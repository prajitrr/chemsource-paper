Most of the L-carnitine is concentrated in the seminal plasma and its level is about 10 times higher than that in blood plasma. About 50% of total L-carnitine in normal human seminal plasma exists in the form of acetylcarnitine. Similar studies were also carried out in oligospermic and azoospermic human seminal plasma. The level of L-O-acetylcarnitine in both types of infertile samples is significantly lower than that in normal samples. On the other hand, the level of free L-carnitine is the same in fertile and infertile seminal plasma. Levels of L-carnitine (C) and L-O-acetylcarnitine (AC) in normal and infertile human semen were determined. Ejaculates and seminal plasma from normal and infertile subjects were evaluated. C was determined by radioactive assay and acylcarnitine levels were determined by hydrolization to C. C concentrated in the seminal plasma at a level 10 times that of blood plasma. AC was found mainly in the sperm. While differences in AC between oligospermic and azoospermic subjects were insignificant, they were both significantly lower than normal samples (p.0005). The level of free C is the same in fertile and infertile patients. These results suggest that the level of AC is related to sperm density. Free-L-carnitine and L-O-acetylcarnitine concentrations have been determined in spermatozoa and seminal plasma of normal, fresh, and frozen human semen. Results show that in fresh semen most of the free L-carnitine (0.213 +/- 0.02 mM) and L-O-acetylcarnitine (0.063 +/- 0.007 mM) is found in the seminal plasma. In contrast to other worker's results, the concentrations of free L-carnitine and L-O-acetylcarnitine in spermatozoa were found to be high and were 0.384 +/- 0.066 mumole/10(9) spermatozoa (22 mM) and 0.376 +/- 0.057 mumole/10(9) spermatozoa (21.6 mM), respectively. It is also demonstrated that the distribution of soluble metabolites such as L-carnitine between spermatozoa and seminal plasma is altered by the freezing of semen. After freezing and storage of semen at -20 degrees C for 7 days, the intracellular concentrations of free L-carnitine and L-O-acetylcarnitine decreased to below the limits of assay.",O-acetylcarnitine,PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.00010437761375214905), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00012403888104017824), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.006846184842288494), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12695282697677612)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10039418190717697)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2974,"('Acetyl-l-carnitine (hydrochloride)', 'O-acetyl-l-carnitine (hydrochloride)', 'Acetyl-l-carnitine', 'Acetylcarnitine', 'O-acetyl-l-carnitine')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Acetyl-L-carnitine, ALCAR or ALC, is an acetylated form of L-carnitine. It is naturally produced by the human body, and it is available as a dietary supplement. Acetylcarnitine is broken down in the blood by plasma esterases to carnitine which is used by the body to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown and energy production. == Biochemical production and action == Carnitine is both a nutrient and made by the body as needed; it serves as a substrate for important reactions in which it accepts and gives up an acyl group. Acetylcarnitine is the most abundant naturally occurring derivative and is formed in the reaction: acetyl-CoA + carnitine ⇌ CoA + acetylcarnitine where the acetyl group displaces the hydrogen atom in the central hydroxyl group of carnitine. Coenzyme A (CoA) plays a key role in the Krebs cycle in mitochondria, which is essential for the production of ATP, which powers many reactions in cells; acetyl-CoA is the primary substrate for the Krebs cycle, once it is de-acetylated, it must be re-charged with an acetyl-group in order for the Krebs cycle to keep working. Most cell types appear to have transporters to import carnitine and export acyl-carnitines, which seems to be a mechanism to dispose of longer-chain moieties; however many cell types can also import ALCAR. Within cells, carnitine plays a key role in importing acyl-CoA into mitochondria; the acyl-group of the acyl-CoA is transferred to carnitine, and the acyl-carnitine is imported through both mitochondrial membranes before being transferred to a CoA molecule, which is then beta oxidized to acetyl-CoA. A separate set of enzymes and transporters also plays a buffering role by eliminating acetyl-CoA from inside mitochondria created by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that is in excess of its utilization by the Krebs cycle; carnitine accepts the acetyl moiety and becomes ALCAR, which is then transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytosol, leaving free CoA inside the mitochondria ready to accept new import of fatty acid chains. ALCAR in the cytosol can also form a pool of acetyl-groups for CoA, should the cell need it. Excess acetyl-CoA causes more carbohydrates to be used for energy at the expense of fatty acids. This occurs by different mechanisms inside and outside the mitochondria. ALCAR transport decreases acetyl-CoA inside the mitochondria, but increases it outside. == Health effects == Carnitine and ALCAR supplements carry warnings of a risk that they promote seizures in people with epilepsy, but a 2016 review found this risk to be based only on animal trials. == Research == === Reviews === Peripheral neuropathy: Meta-analyses from 2015 and 2017 both conclude that the current evidence suggests ALC reduces pain from peripheral neuropathy with few adverse effects. The 2017 review also suggested ALC improved electromyographic parameters. Both called for more randomized controlled trials. An updated Cochrane review in 2019 of four studies with 907 participants was very uncertain as to if ALC caused a pain reduction after 6 to 12 months of treatment. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): A review of two studies concluded that ALC may be a treatment option for paclitaxel- and cisplatin-induced CIPN, while a clinical trial showed it did not prevent CIPN and appeared to worsen the conditions in taxane therapy. Male infertility: Scientific reviews from 2016 and 2014 showed mixed results, with some studies showing a positive relationship between ALC and sperm motility, and others showing no relationship. Dementia: A 2003 Cochrane review sought to determine the safety and efficacy of ALCAR in dementia but the reviewers found only clinical trials studies on Alzheimer's disease; the review found that the pharmacology of ALCAR was poorly understood and that based on the lack of efficacy, ALCAR was unlikely to be an important treatment for AD. Depression: One 2014 review assessed the use of ALCAR in fourteen clinical trials for various conditions with depressive symptoms; the trials were small (ranging from 20 to 193 subjects) and their design was so different that results could not be generalized; most studies showed positive results and a lack of adverse effects. The mechanism of action by which ALCAR could treat depression is not known. A meta-analysis from 2014 concluded that ALCAR could only be recommended for the treatment of persistent depressive disorder if publication bias was deemed improbable. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials found ""supplementation significantly decreases depressive symptoms compared with placebo/no intervention, while offering a comparable effect with that of established antidepressant agents with fewer adverse effects."" The review also indicates that ""the effect of ALC in younger subjects was not more effective than placebo in improving these symptoms."" indicating a need for more research explaining the age/effect relation. Fragile X syndrome: A 2015 Cochrane review of ALCAR in fragile X syndrome found only two placebo-controlled trials, each of low quality, and concluded that ALCAR is unlikely to improve intellectual functioning or hyperactive behavior in children with this condition. Hepatic encephalopathy: ALCAR has been studied in hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis involving neuropsychiatric impairment; ALCAR improves blood ammonia levels and generates a modest improvement in psychometric scores but does not resolve the condition – it may play a minor role in managing the condition. === Studies === In a small clinical study, when ALCAR was administered intravenously and insulin levels were held steady and a meal low in carnitine but high in carbohydrates was taken by healthy young men, ALCAR appeared to decrease glucose consumption in favor of fat oxidation. Mitochondrial decay and oxidative damage to RNA/DNA increases with age in the rat hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with memory. Memory performance declines with age. These increases in decay and damage, and memory loss itself, can be partially reversed in old rats by feeding acetyl-L-carnitine. == References == == Further reading == Jane Higdon, ""L-Carnitine"", Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University Carnitine (L-carnitine), University of Maryland Medical Center",Acetylcarnitine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.00412351917475462), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0002036595979006961), (' FOOD', -0.47424426674842834), (',', -0.10024797916412354), (' MED', -0.0031848405487835407), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.03722985088825226), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -5.006777428206988e-06), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.0002224197960458696), ('ĠFOOD', -0.16041196882724762), (',', -0.16027548909187317), ('ĠMED', -0.0009818024700507522), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011843579122796655)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.4740847051143646), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' END', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcarnitine?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB08842?utm_source=openai), [ods.od.nih.gov](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/carnitine-healthprofessional/?utm_source=openai), [deascal.com](https://www.deascal.com/ingredient-information/acetyl-carnitine/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=403, start_index=42, title='Acetylcarnitine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcarnitine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=403, start_index=42, title='Acetylcarnitine: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB08842?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=403, start_index=42, title='Carnitine - Health Professional Fact Sheet', type='url_citation', url='https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/carnitine-healthprofessional/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=403, start_index=42, title='Acetyl Carnitine: An In-Depth Look at Its Role in Cosmetics – Deascal®', type='url_citation', url='https://www.deascal.com/ingredient-information/acetyl-carnitine/?utm_source=openai')])"

Fenoprofen calcium is used for symptomatic relief for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and mild to moderate pain. It has also been used to treat postoperative pain. It is available as a generic medication. == Pharmacology == Decreases inflammation, pain, and fever, probably through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-2 inhibitor) activity and prostaglandin synthesis. === Chirality and biological activity === Fenoprofen is chiral drug with one stereogenic center and exists as chiral twins. (S)-enantiomer has the desired pharmacological action where as the (R)-isomer is less active. It is observed that there is stereoselective bioconversion of the (R)- to (S)-fenoprofen. This stereoselective conversion is called chiral inversion. == Contraindications == History of significantly impaired renal function; patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the product; patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs; treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Drug interactions == Aminoglycosides (e.g. gentamicin): Plasma aminoglycoside levels may be elevated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: Antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors may be diminished. Anticoagulants: Coadministration may prolong prothrombin time. Aspirin: Fenoprofen Cl may be increased; coadministration is not recommended. Diuretics: Patients treated with fenoprofen may be resistant to the effects of loop diuretics and thiazides. Hydantoins, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas: Fenoprofen may displace these drugs from their binding site. Lithium: Renal Cl of lithium may be reduced and plasma levels may be elevated, which may increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate: May increase methotrexate levels. Phenobarbital: May decrease fenoprofen t1⁄2. Dosage adjustments of fenoprofen may be required if phenobarbital is added or withdrawn.

2978,"('Quercetin', 'Meletin', 'Sophoretin', 'Quercetine', 'Xanthaurine')","Food, Medical","Quercetin is a plant flavonol from the flavonoid group of polyphenols. It is found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains; capers, red onions, and kale are common foods containing appreciable amounts of it. It has a bitter flavor and is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, beverages, and foods. == Occurrence == Quercetin is a flavonoid widely distributed in nature. The name has been used since 1857, and is derived from quercetum (oak forest), after the oak genus Quercus. It is a naturally occurring polar auxin transport inhibitor. Quercetin is one of the most abundant dietary flavonoids, with an average daily consumption of 25–50 mg. In red onions, higher concentrations of quercetin occur in the outermost rings and in the part closest to the root, the latter being the part of the plant with the highest concentration. One study found that organically grown tomatoes had 79% more quercetin than non-organically grown fruit. Quercetin is present in various kinds of honey from different plant sources. == Biosynthesis == In plants, phenylalanine is converted to 4-coumaroyl-CoA in a series of steps known as the general phenylpropanoid pathway using phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumaroyl-CoA-ligase. One molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA is added to three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form tetrahydroxychalcone using 7,2′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyisoflavanol synthase. Tetrahydroxychalcone is then converted into naringenin using chalcone isomerase. Naringenin is converted into eriodictyol using flavanoid 3′-hydroxylase. Eriodictyol is then converted into dihydroquercetin with flavanone 3-hydroxylase, which is then converted into quercetin using flavonol synthase. === Glycosides === Quercetin is the aglycone form of a number of other flavonoid glycosides, such as rutin (also known as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and quercitrin, found in citrus fruit, buckwheat, and onions. Quercetin forms the glycosides quercitrin and rutin together with rhamnose and rutinose, respectively. Likewise guaijaverin is the 3-O-arabinoside, hyperoside is the 3-O-galactoside, isoquercitin is the 3-O-glucoside and spiraeoside is the 4′-O-glucoside. CTN-986 is a quercetin derivative found in cottonseeds and cottonseed oil. Miquelianin is the quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside. Several taxifolin (also known as dihydroquercetin) glycosides also exist. Isoquercetin is the 3-O-glucoside of quercetin. === Rutin degradation pathway === The enzyme quercitrinase can be found in Aspergillus flavus. This enzyme hydrolyzes the glycoside quercitrin to release quercetin and L-rhamnose. It is an enzyme in the rutin catabolic pathway. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of quercetin in humans after oral intake is very low, with one study concluding it must be less than 1%. Intravenous injection of quercetin shows a rapid decay in concentration described by a two-compartment model (initial half-life of 8.8 minutes, terminal half-life of 2.4 hours). Because it undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism, the biological effects presumed from in vitro studies are unlikely to apply in vivo. Quercetin supplements in the aglycone form are less bioavailable than the quercetin glycoside often found in foods, especially red onions. Ingestion with high-fat foods may increase bioavailability compared to ingestion with low-fat foods, and carbohydrate-rich foods may increase absorption of quercetin by stimulating gastrointestinal motility and colonic fermentation. Whereas quercetin has been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory compound in a variety of in vitro and in vivo bioassay models, oral quercetin in human subjects has not exhibited the desired effects. Because of low solubility and poor bioavailability of quercetin, derivatives have been synthesized to overcome these challenges and enhance its biological activity, leading to compounds with improved properties for possible therapeutic applications. === Metabolism === Quercetin is rapidly metabolized (via glucuronidation) after the ingestion of quercetin foods or supplements. Five metabolites (quercetin glucuronides) have been found in human plasma after quercetin ingestion. Taken together, the quercetin glucuronides have a half-life around 11–12 hours. In rats, quercetin did not undergo any significant phase I metabolism. In contrast, quercetin did undergo extensive phase II (conjugation) to produce metabolites that are more polar than the parent substance, hence are more rapidly excreted from the body. In vitro, the meta-hydroxyl group of catechol is methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase. Four of the five hydroxyl groups of quercetin are glucuronidated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The exception is the 5-hydroxyl group of the flavonoid ring, which generally does not undergo glucuronidation. The major metabolites of orally absorbed quercetin are quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide, and quercetin-3'-sulfate. A methyl metabolite of quercetin has been shown in vitro to be more effective than quercetin at inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Compared to other flavonoids, quercetin is one of the most effective inducers of the phase II detoxification enzymes. In vitro studies show that quercetin is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Drugs that are metabolized by these pathways may have increased effect. An in vivo study found that quercetin supplementation slows the metabolism of caffeine to a statistically significant extent in a particular genetic subpopulation, but in absolute terms the effect was almost negligible. == Food safety == In 2010, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledged high-purity quercetin as generally recognized as safe for use as an ingredient in various specified food categories at levels up to 500 mg per serving. == Health claims == Quercetin has been studied in basic research and small clinical trials. While supplements have been promoted for the treatment of cancer and various other diseases, there is no high-quality evidence that quercetin (via supplements or in food) is useful to treat cancer or any other disease. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to several manufacturers advertising on their product labels and websites that quercetin product(s) can be used to treat diseases. The FDA regards such quercetin advertising and products as unapproved – with unauthorized health claims concerning the anti-disease products – as defined by ""sections 201(g)(1)(B) and/or 201 (g)(1)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B) and/or 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease"", conditions not met by the manufacturers. === Safety === Little research has been conducted into the safety of quercetin supplementation in humans, and the results are insufficient to give confidence that the practice is safe. In particular, a lack of safety information exists on the effect of quercetin supplementation for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, children, and adolescents. The hormonal effects of quercetin found in animal studies raise the suspicion of a parallel effect in humans, particularly in respect of estrogen-dependent tumors. Quercetin supplementation can interfere with the effects of medications. The precise nature of this interaction is known for some common medicines, but for many, it is not. == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Quercetin at Wikimedia Commons",Xanthaurine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO, FOOD', [('INFO', -0.0008105786982923746), (',', -0.0001307142956648022), (' FOOD', -0.00029029499273747206)])","('INFO, FOOD', [('INFO', -0.31749579310417175), (',', -0.17917568981647491), ('ĠFOOD', -0.1538812667131424), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.13468952476978302)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('Xanthaurine, also known as quercetin, is a flavonoid found in various plants and foods.

It is a complement factor B inhibitor that was developed by Novartis. It is taken by mouth. Iptacopan was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2023, and in the European Union in May 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Iptacopan is indicated for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; and to reduce proteinuria in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy at risk of rapid disease progression, generally a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥1.5 g/g; for the treatment of adults with complement 3 glomerulopathy, to reduce proteinuria. Complement 3 glomerulopathy is a rare disease that causes inflammation and damage to the kidney glomeruli, which are responsible for filtering blood and producing urine. == Mechanism of action == Iptacopan binds to Factor B of the alternative complement pathway and regulates the cleavage of C3, generation of downstream effectors, and the amplification of the terminal pathway. In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, intravascular hemolysis is mediated by the downstream membrane attack complex, while extravascular hemolysis is facilitated by C3b opsonization. Iptacopan acts proximally in the alternative pathway of the complement cascade to control both C3b-mediated extravascular hemolysis and terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis. == Side effects == The US Food and Drug Administration label for iptacopan contains a boxed warning for the risk of serious and life-threatening infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type B. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Iptacopan was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in December 2023. In March 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Fabhalta, intended for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The applicant for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Limited. Iptacopan was authorized for medical use in the European Union in May 2024. In August 2024, the US FDA granted accelerated approval to iptacopan for reducing proteinuria in adults with primary IgA nephropathy. In March 2025, the US FDA approved iptacopan for the treatment of adults with complement 3 glomerulopathy to reduce proteinuria. == Research == In a clinical study with twelve participants, iptacopan as a single drug led to the normalization of hemolytic markers in most patients, and no serious adverse events occurred during the 12-week study. Iptacopan is also investigated as a drug in other complement-mediated diseases, like age-related macular degeneration and some types of glomerulopathies. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT04558918 for ""Study of Efficacy and Safety of Twice Daily Oral LNP023 in Adult PNH Patients With Residual Anemia Despite Anti-C5 Antibody Treatment (APPLY-PNH)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT04820530 for ""Study of Efficacy and Safety of Twice Daily Oral Iptacopan (LNP023) in Adult PNH Patients Who Are Naive to Complement Inhibitor Therapy (APPOINT-PNH)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Iptacopan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.3165931603871286e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016246906307060272)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptacopan?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Iptacopan', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptacopan?utm_source=openai')])"
2980,"('Procainamide (hydrochloride)', 'Novocainamide', 'Biocoryl', 'Novocamid', 'Procaine amide')",Medical,"Procainamide (PCA) is a medication of the antiarrhythmic class used for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. It is a sodium channel blocker of cardiomyocytes; thus it is classified by the Vaughan Williams classification system as class Ia. In addition to blocking the INa current, it inhibits the IKr rectifier K+ current. Procainamide is also known to induce a voltage-dependent open channel block on the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels in cardiomyocytes. == Uses == === Medical === Procainamide is used for treating ventricular arrhythmias: ventricular ectopy and tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, and re-entrant and automatic supraventricular tachycardia. For example, it can be used to convert new-onset atrial fibrillation, and although was initially thought to be suboptimal for this purpose, a growing body of literature is amounting in support for this exact cause. It is administered by mouth, by intramuscular injection, or intravenously. === Others === It has also been used as a chromatography resin because it somewhat binds protein. == Side effects == There are many side effects following the induction of procainamide. These adverse effects are ventricular dysrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension and shock. The adverse effects occur even more often if the daily doses are increased. Procainamide may also lead to drug fever and other allergic responses. There is also a chance that drug-induced lupus erythematosus occurs, which at the same time leads to arthralgia, myalgia and pleurisy. Most of these side effects may occur due to the acetylation of procainamide. === Toxicity === There is a close line between the plasma concentrations of the therapeutic and toxic effect, therefore a high risk for toxicity. Many symptoms resemble systemic lupus erythematosus because procainamide reactivates hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites, which bind to histone proteins and are toxic to lymphocytes. The hydroxylamine and nitroso metabolites are also toxic to bone marrow cells and can cause agranulocytosis. These metabolites are formed due to the activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These leukocytes release myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide, which oxidize the primary aromatic amine of procainamide to form procainamide hydroxylamine. The release of hydrogen peroxide is also called a respiratory burst, which occurs for procainamide in monocytes but not in lymphocytes. Furthermore, the metabolites can be formed by activated neutrophils. These metabolites could then bind to their cell membranes and cause a release of autoantibodies which would react with the neutrophils. Procainamide hydroxylamine has more cytotoxicity by hindering the response of lymphocytes to T-cell and B-cell mitogens. Hydroxylamine can also generate methemoglobin, a protein that could hinder further oxygen exchange. It was also detected that the antiarrhythmic drug procainamide interferes with pacemakers. A toxic level of procainamide leads to decrease in ventricular conduction velocity and increase of the ventricular refractory period. This results in a disturbance in the artificial membrane potential and leads to a supraventricular tachycardia which induces failure of the pacemaker and death. Thus, it prolongs QT interval of action potential and increases the risk of torsade de pointes. Procainamide could initiate leukopenia and/or agranulocytosis, which are serious hematologic disorders, and is also known for causing gastrointestinal disturbances and aggravating pre-existing abnormalities in impulse initiation and propagation. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Procainamide works as an anti-arrhythmic agent and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmia. It induces rapid block of the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium channels of the heart muscle and acts as antagonist to long-gating closures. The block is voltage-dependent and can occur from both sides; either from the intracellular or the extracellular side. Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. Procainamide is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result from the loss of voltage dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, procainamide has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of procainamide, the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking is determined by the membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels. Procainamide slows the conduction velocity and increases the refractory period, such that the maximal rate of depolarization is reduced. It is also said to be a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor antagonist. === Metabolism === Procainamide is metabolized via different pathways. The most common one is the acetylation of procainamide to the less-toxic N-acetylprocainamide. The rate of acetylation is genetically determined. There are two phenotypes that result from the acetylation process, namely the slow and rapid acetylator. Procainamide can also be oxidized by the cytochrome P-450 to a reactive oxide metabolite. But it seems that acetylation of the nitrogen group of procainamide decrease the amount of the chemical that would be available for the oxidative route. Other metabolites of procainamide include desethyl-N-acetylprocainamide, desethylprocainamide, p-aminobenzoic acid, which are excreted via the urine. N-acetyl-4-aminobenzoic acid as well as N-acetyl-3-hydroxyprocainamide, N-acetylprocainamide-N-oxide and N-acetyl-4-aminohippuric acid are also metabolites of procainamide. == Chemistry == 4-amino-N-2-(diethylamino)ethyl-benzamide (also known as para-amino-N-2-(diethylamino)ethyl-benzamide because the amino substituent is attached to the para-position, Arene substitution patterns of the benzene ring) is a synthetic organic compound with the chemical formula C13-H21-N3-O. Procainamide is structurally similar to procaine, but in place of an ester group, procainamide contains an amide group. This substitution is the reason why procainamide exhibits a longer half-life time than procaine. Procainamide belongs to the aminobenzamides. These are aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives consisting of an amide with a benzamide moiety and a triethylamine attached to the amide nitrogen. In certain lines, the para-amino group might become a target site to attach further paraphernalia, e.g. ref. Ex18 in U.S. patent 7,115,750. == History == Procainamide was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950, under the brand name ""Pronestyl"". It was launched by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1951. Due to the loss of Indonesia in World War II, the source for cinchona alkaloids, a precursor of quinidine, was reduced. This led to research for a new antiarrhythmic drug. As a result, procaine was discovered, which has similar cardiac effects as quinidine. In 1936 it was found by Mautz that by applying it directly on the myocardium, the ventricular threshold for electrical stimulation was elevated. This mechanism is responsible for the antiarrhythmic effect. However, due to the short duration of action, caused by rapid enzymatic hydrolysis, its therapeutic applications were limited. In addition, procaine also caused tremors and respiratory depression. All these adverse features stimulated the search for an alternative to procaine. Studies were done on various congeners and metabolites and this ultimately led to the discovery of procainamide by Mark et al. It was found that procainamide was effective for treating ventricular arrhythmias, but it had the same toxicity profile as quinidine, and it could cause systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. These negative characteristics slowed the search for new antiarrhythmics based on the chemical structure of procainamide. In 1970 only five drugs were reported. These were the cardiac glycosides, quinidine, propranolol, lidocaine and diphenylhydantoin. In January 1996, extended release procainamide hydrochloride (Procanbid extended-release tablets) was approved by the FDA. == References ==",Novocamid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010215714428341016), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019443194614723325)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugcentral.org](https://drugcentral.org/drugcard/2270?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='procainamide', type='url_citation', url='https://drugcentral.org/drugcard/2270?utm_source=openai')])"

2983,"('N-acetyl-l-glutamic acid', 'Acetylglutamic acid', 'N-acetyl-l-glutamate', 'N-acetylglutamate', 'Acetyl-l-glutamic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","N-Acetylglutamic acid (also referred to as N-acetylglutamate, abbreviated NAG, chemical formula C7H11NO5) is biosynthesized from glutamate and acetylornithine by ornithine acetyltransferase, and from glutamic acid and acetyl-CoA by the enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase. The reverse reaction, hydrolysis of the acetyl group, is catalyzed by a specific hydrolase. It is the first intermediate involved in the biosynthesis of arginine in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes and a regulator in the process known as the urea cycle that converts toxic ammonia to urea for excretion from the body in vertebrates. == Discovery == N-Acetylglutamic acid is an extracellular metabolite isolated from the prokaryote Rhizobium trifolii that was characterized using many structure determination techniques such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In Rhizobium, extracellular build-up of N-acetylglutamic acid is due to metabolism involving nod factor genes on a symbiotic plasmid. When the nod factors are mutated, less N-acetylglutamic acid is produced. == Biosynthesis == === Prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes === In prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes, N-acetylglutamic acid can be produced by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) or ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). ==== Ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT) synthesis ==== OAT synthesizes N-acetylglutamic acid from glutamate and acetylornithine and is the method of choice for production in prokaryotes that have the ability to synthesize the compound ornithine. ==== N-Acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) synthesis ==== N-Acetylglutamate synthase is an enzyme that serves as a replenisher of N-acetylglutamic acid to supplement any N-acetylglutamic acid lost by the cell through mitosis or degradation. NAGS synthesizes N-acetylglutamic acid by catalyzing the addition of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A to glutamate. In prokaryotes with non-cyclic ornithine production, NAGS is the sole method of N-acetylglutamic acid synthesis and is inhibited by arginine. Acetylation of glutamate is thought to prevent glutamate from being used by proline biosynthesis. === Vertebrates === In contrast to prokaryotes, NAGS in mammals is enhanced by arginine, along with protamines. It is inhibited by N-acetylglutamic acid and its analogues (other N-acetylated compounds). The brain also contains N-acetylglutamic acid at trace amounts, however no expression of NAGS is found. This suggests that N-acetylglutamic acid is produced by another enzyme in the brain that is yet to be determined. == Biological roles == === Vertebrates and mammals === In vertebrae and mammals, N-acetylglutamic acid is the allosteric activator molecule to mitochondrial carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) which is the first enzyme in the urea cycle. It triggers the production of the first urea cycle intermediate, carbamyl phosphate. CPSI is inactive when N-acetylglutamic acid is not present. In the liver and small intestines, N-acetylglutamic acid-dependent CPSI produces citrulline, the second intermediate in the urea cycle. Liver cell distribution of N-acetylglutamic acid is highest in the mitochondria at 56% of total N-acetylglutamic acid availability, 24% in the nucleus, and the remaining 20% in the cytosol. Aminoacylase I in liver and kidney cells degrades N-acetylglutamic acid to glutamate and acetate. In contrast, N-acetylglutamic acid is not the allosteric cofactor to carbamyl phosphate synthetase found in the cytoplasm, which is involved in pyrimidine synthesis. N-acetylglutamic acid concentrations increase when protein consumption increases due to the accumulation of ammonia that must be secreted through the urea cycle, which supports the role of N-acetylglutamic acid as the cofactor for CPSI. Furthermore, N-acetylglutamic acid can be found in many commonly consumed foods such as soy, corn, and coffee, with cocoa powder containing a notably high concentration. Deficiency in N-acetylglutamic acid in humans is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in blockage of urea production which ultimately increases the concentration of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia). Deficiency can be caused by defects in the NAGS coding gene or by deficiencies in the precursors essential for synthesis. === Bacteria === N-Acetylglutamic acid is the second intermediate in the arginine production pathway in Escherichia coli and is produced via NAGS. In this pathway, N-acetylglutamic acid kinase (NAGK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of the gamma (third) carboxyl group of N-acetylglutamic acid using the phosphate produced by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). === White clover seedling roots === Rhizobium can form a symbiotic relationship with white clover seedling roots and form colonies. The extracellular N-acetylglutamic acid produced by these bacteria have three morphological effects on the white clover seedling roots: branching of root hairs, swelling of root tips, and increase in the number of cell divisions in undifferentiated cells found on the outer-most cell layer of the root. This suggests that N-acetylglutamic acid is involved in the stimulation of mitosis. The same effects were observed on the strawberry clover, but not in legumes. The effects of N-acetylglutamic acid on the clover species were more potent than the effects from glutamine, glutamate, arginine, or ammonia. == Structure == N-Acetylglutamic acid is composed of two carboxylic acid groups and an amide group protruding from the second carbon. The structure of N-acetylglutamic acid at physiological pH (7.4) has all carboxyl groups deprotonated. === Proton NMR spectroscopy === The molecular structure of N-acetylglutamic acid was determined using proton NMR spectroscopy. Proton NMR reveals the presence and functional group location of protons based on chemical shifts recorded on the spectrum. === 13C NMR spectroscopy === Like proton NMR, carbon-13 (13C) NMR spectroscopy is a method used in molecular structure determination. 13C NMR reveals the types of carbons present in a molecule based on chemical shifts that correspond to certain functional groups. N-Acetylglutamic acid exhibits carbonyl carbons most distinctly due to the three carbonyl-containing substituents. == See also == Glutamate Glutamic acid Urea cycle Arginine Ornithine == References == == External links == Diagram at biochemj.org",N-acetylglutamate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0008763278019614518), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.988221684878226e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.00033581978641450405), (' FOOD', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.02566579356789589), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.0371154530730564e-05), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.0019342063460499048), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0007560970261693001), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014213752001523972)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Acetylglutamic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=18, title='N-Acetylglutamic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Acetylglutamic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"

A white solid, it forms the gluconate anion in neutral aqueous solution. The salts of gluconic acid are known as ""gluconates"". Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Some drugs are injected in the form of gluconates. == Chemical structure == The chemical structure of gluconic acid consists of a six-carbon chain, with five hydroxyl groups positioned in the same way as in the open-chained form of glucose, terminating in a carboxylic acid group. It is one of the 16 stereoisomers of 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. == Production == Gluconic acid is typically produced by the aerobic oxidation of glucose in the presence of the enzyme glucose oxidase. The conversion produces gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide. The lactone spontaneously hydrolyzes to gluconic acid in water. C6H12O6 + O2 → C6H10O6 + H2O2 C6H10O6 + H2O → C6H12O7 Variations of glucose (or other carbohydrate-containing substrate) oxidation using fermentation. or noble metal catalysis. Gluconic acid was first prepared by Hlasiwetz and Habermann in 1870 and involved the chemical oxidation of glucose. In 1880, Boutroux prepared and isolated gluconic acid using the glucose fermentation. === Historical role in development of deep-tank fermentation === The production of gluconic acid by deep-tank fermentation (aerated, pH controlled, and stirred >1000 L tanks) of the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger in 1929, for use as a food acidity regulator and cleaning agent, was the first successful use of deep-tank fermentation by Pfizer. This expertise later led to Pfizer's successful use of deep-tank fermentation of Penicillium fungi in February 1944, to rapidly scale up penicillin production, resulting in sufficient penicillin to treat the American and British battle casualties of the June 6th Allied D-Day invasion of World War II. == Occurrence and uses == Gluconic acid occurs naturally in fruit, honey, and wine. As a food additive (E574), it is now known as an acidity regulator. The gluconate anion chelates Ca2+, Fe2+, K+, Al3+, and other metals, including lanthanides and actinides. It is also used in cleaning products, where it dissolves mineral deposits, especially in alkaline solution. Zinc gluconate injections are used to neuter male dogs. Gluconate is also used in building and construction as a concrete admixture (retarder) to slow down the cement hydration reactions, and to delay the cement setting time. It allows for a longer time to lay the concrete, or to spread the cement hydration heat over a longer period of time to avoid too high a temperature and the resulting cracking. Retarders are mixed in to concrete when the weather temperature is high or to cast large and thick concrete slabs in successive and sufficiently well-mixed layers. Gluconic acid aqueous solution finds application as a medium for organic synthesis. === Medicine === In medicine, gluconate is used most commonly as a biologically neutral carrier of Zn2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and K+ to treat electrolyte imbalance. Calcium gluconate, in the form of a gel, is used to treat burns from hydrofluoric acid; calcium gluconate injections may be used for more severe cases to avoid necrosis of deep tissues, as well as to treat hypocalcemia in hospitalized patients. Gluconate is also an electrolyte present in certain solutions, such as ""plasmalyte a"", used for intravenous fluid resuscitation. Quinine gluconate is a salt of gluconic acid and quinine, which is used for intramuscular injection in the treatment of malaria. Ferrous gluconate injections have been proposed in the past to treat anemia. == See also == Uronic acid Glucuronic acid Isosaccharinic acid (ISA) == References == == External links == Gluconic acid on NIST.gov ChemSub Online: D-Gluconic acid.",Dextronic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.39435335993766785), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.5764620304107666), ('OG', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ENO', -0.00012403888104017824), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -2.7729658540920354e-05), (',', -5.676981345459353e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.014167623594403267), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.7568937540054321), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -9.07141511561349e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.25429901480674744), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.003184131346642971), ('ĠMED', -0.0009993088897317648), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038200344890356064)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

He was a member of the Nebraska Legislature from 2009 to 2017. == Nebraska Legislature == Coash was elected in 2008 to represent the 27th Nebraska legislative district by just 79 votes, becoming the first Republican to hold the seat since 1972. He was known to ride a Razor scooter while campaigning door-to-door. While in office, he focused on issues including child welfare, elder care, support for those with developmental disabilities, and corrections reform. He served as chairman of the Developmental Disabilities Special Investigative Committee commissioned by Senator Mike Flood's Legislative Resolution 283 (2008) to further investigate civil rights violations previously identified at the Beatrice State Developmental Center by the federal Department of Justice. === Death penalty === As a state senator, Coash was also a notable proponent of legislation to end the death penalty in Nebraska. He also collaborated with policymakers engaged in similar efforts in other states. His reform efforts led to appearances on The Daily Show and National Public Radio's Here & Now. In an interview published by the Washington Post, Coash described attending a September 3, 1994 rally outside of the Nebraska State Penitentiary in the hours before the execution of Willie Otey. A college freshman at the time, Coash said that ""It was pretty ugly... It kind of changed my heart. I thought, 'I don't want to be a part of state-sponsored killing.'"" Coash argued that his position on abolishing the death penalty was compatible with a conservative political philosophy. ""If any other program was as inefficient and as costly as this has been, we would've gotten rid of it a long time ago."" ""Some people see this as a pro-life issue. Other people see it as a good-government issue. But the support that this bill is getting from conservative members is evidence that you can get justice through eliminating the death penalty, and you can get efficient government through eliminating the death penalty."" In an interview with Playboy magazine, Coash said, ""This is the same government we don't trust to deliver the mail or roll out a health care website."" The magazine editorialized that the 2015 passage of legislation to end the death penalty Nebraska ""would have been impossible without Coash's efforts to rally his conservative peers and convince seven freshmen Republicans of the penalty's inherently anticonservative nature."" == Acting career == Coash is an actor with nearly two dozen acting credits. He participated in theater as a college student, including a controversial production of ""Six Degrees of Separation"" in which he played the role of ""the Hustler"" and was required to appear nude on stage. He is credited as executive producer for I Am a Man, a planned biopic telling the story of Chief Standing Bear, a Native American civil rights icon from Nebraska. == Memoir == In April 2024, Cahoy & Crook published Coash 's memoir, Running Naked: Surviving the Legacy of Family in Rural Nebraska. In the book, Coash describes a sense of inevitable destiny that many rural young people face and the tension they experience, feeling needed at home on the farm but also feeling called to careers and opportunities that takes them away to urban areas instead. ""Children carry on by following in the footsteps of the generations before them. A small community’s balance always depends on the next generation’s embrace of such a duty and responsibility.""

2991,"('Diethylstilbestrol', 'Stilbestrol', 'Stilboestrol', 'Distilbene', 'Agostilben')",Medical,"Diethylstilbestrol (DES), also known as stilbestrol or stilboestrol, is a nonsteroidal estrogen medication, which is presently rarely used. In the past, it was widely used for a variety of indications, including pregnancy support for those with a history of recurrent miscarriage, hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency, treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer, and other uses. By 2007, it was only used in the treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer. In 2011, Hoover and colleagues reported adverse reproductive health outcomes linked to DES including infertility, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, infant death, menopause prior to age 45, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and vaginal cancer. While most commonly taken by mouth, DES was available for use by other routes as well, for instance, vaginal, topical, and by injection. DES is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a synthetic and nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group, and differs from the natural estrogen estradiol. Compared to estradiol, DES has greatly improved bioavailability when taken by mouth, is more resistant to metabolism, and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the liver and uterus. These differences result in DES having an increased risk of blood clots, cardiovascular issues, and certain other adverse effects. DES was discovered in 1938 and introduced for medical use in 1939. From about 1940 to 1971, the medication was given to pregnant women in the incorrect belief that it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In 1971, DES was shown to cause clear-cell carcinoma, a rare vaginal tumor, in those who had been exposed to this medication in utero. The United States Food and Drug Administration subsequently withdrew approval of DES as a treatment for pregnant women. Follow-up studies have indicated that DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed including infertility. The United States National Cancer Institute recommends children born to mothers who took DES to undergo special medical exams on a regular basis to screen for complications as a result of the medication. Individuals who were exposed to DES during their mothers' pregnancies are commonly referred to as ""DES daughters"" and ""DES sons"". Since the discovery of the toxic effects of DES, it has largely been discontinued and is now mostly no longer marketed for human treatment. == Medical uses == DES has been used in the past for the following indications: Recurrent miscarriage in pregnancy Menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy Hormone therapy for hypoestrogenism (e.g., gonadal dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after oophorectomy) Postpartum lactation suppression to prevent or reverse breast engorgement Gonorrheal vaginitis (discontinued following the introduction of the antibiotic penicillin) Prostate cancer and breast cancer Prevention of tall stature in tall adolescent girls Treatment of acne in girls and women As an emergency postcoital contraceptive As a means of chemical castration for treating hypersexuality and paraphilias and sex offenders Prevention of the testosterone flare at the start of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist) therapy Feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women DES was used at a dosage of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/day in menopausal hormone therapy. Interest in the use of DES to treat prostate cancer continues today. However, use of bioidentical parenteral estrogens like polyestradiol phosphate has been advocated in favor of oral synthetic estrogens like DES due to their much lower risk of cardiovascular toxicity. In addition to prostate cancer, some interest in the use of DES to treat breast cancer continues today as well. However, similarly to the case of prostate cancer, arguments have been made for the use of bioidentical estrogens like estradiol instead of DES for breast cancer. Oral DES at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/day is effective in the treatment of hot flashes in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Although DES was used to support pregnancy, it was later found not to be effective for this use and to actually be harmful. == Side effects == At more than 1 mg/day, DES is associated with high rates of side effects including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache, and bloating (incidence of 15–50%). === Breast changes and feminization === The pigmentation of the breast areolae are often very dark and almost black with DES therapy. The pigmentation that occurs with synthetic estrogens such as DES is much greater than with natural estrogens such as estradiol. The mechanism of the difference is unknown. Progestogens like hydroxyprogesterone caproate have been reported to reduce the nipple hyperpigmentation induced by high-dose estrogen therapy. In men treated with it for prostate cancer, DES has been found to produce high rates of gynecomastia (breast development) of 41 to 77%. === Blood clots and cardiovascular issues === In studies of DES as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy for those with prostate cancer, it has been associated with considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The risk is dose-dependent. A dosage of 5 mg/day DES has been associated with a 36% increase in non-cancer-related (mostly cardiovascular) deaths. In addition, there is an up to 15% incidence of venous thromboembolism. A 3 mg/day dosage of DES has been associated with an incidence of thromboembolism of 9.6 to 17%, with an incidence of cardiovascular complications of 33.3%. A lower dosage of 1 mg/day DES has been associated with a rate of death due to cardiovascular events of 14.8% (relative to 8.3% for orchiectomy alone). === Other long-term effects === DES has been linked to a variety of long-term adverse effects in women who were treated with it during pregnancy, and/or in their offspring, including increased risk of the following: vaginal clear-cell adenocarcinoma vaginal adenosis T-shaped uterus uterine fibroids cervical weakness breast cancer infertility hypogonadism intersexual gestational defects depression A comprehensive animal study in 1993 found a plethora of adverse effects from DES such as (but not limited to) genotoxicity (due to quinone metabolite) teratogenicity penile and testicular hypoplasia cryptorchidism (in rats and rhesus monkeys), liver and renal cancer (in hamsters), ovarian papillary carcinoma (in canines), and malignant uterine mesothelioma (in squirrel monkeys). Evidence was also found linking ADHD to F2 generations, demonstrating that there is at least some neurological and transgenerational effects in addition to the carcinogenic. Rodent studies reveal female reproductive tract cancers and abnormalities reaching to the F2 generation, and there is evidence of adverse effects such as irregular menstrual cycles intersexual in grandchildren of DES mothers. Additionally, evidence also points to transgenerational effects in F2 sons, such as hypospadias. At this time however, the extent of DES transgenerational effects in humans is not fully understood. == Overdose == DES has been assessed in the past in clinical studies at extremely high doses of as much as 1,500 to 5,000 mg/day. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Estrogenic activity ==== DES is an estrogen; specifically, it is a highly potent full agonist of both of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has approximately 468% and 295% of the affinity of estradiol at the ERα and ERβ, respectively. However, EC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, have been reported, suggesting, in spite of its binding affinity for the two receptors, several-fold preference for activation of the ERβ over the ERα. In addition to the nuclear ERs, DES is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), albeit with relatively low affinity (~1,000 nM). DES produces all of the same biological effects attributed to natural estrogens like estradiol. This includes effects in the uterus, vagina, mammary glands, pituitary gland, and other tissues. A dosage of 1 mg/day DES is approximately equivalent to a dosage of 50 μg/day ethinylestradiol in terms of systemic estrogenic potency. Similarly to ethinylestradiol, DES shows a marked and disproportionately strong effect on liver protein synthesis. Whereas its systemic estrogenic potency was about 3.8-fold of that of estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), which has similar potency to micronized estradiol, the hepatic estrogenic potency of DES was 28-fold that of estropipate (or about 7.5-fold stronger potency for a dosage with equivalent systemic estrogenic effect). DES has at least three mechanisms of action in the treatment of prostate cancer. It suppresses gonadal androgen production and hence circulating androgen levels due to its antigonadotropic effects; it stimulates hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production, thereby increasing circulating levels of SHBG and decreasing the free fraction of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the circulation; and it may have direct cytotoxic effects in the testes and prostate gland. DES has also been found to decrease DNA synthesis at high doses. DES is a long-acting estrogen, with a nuclear retention of around 24 hours. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Due to its estrogenic activity, DES has antigonadotropic effects. That is, it exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis), suppresses the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and suppresses sex hormone production as well as gamete production or maturation in the gonads. A study of ovulation inhibition found that 5 mg/day oral DES was 92% effective, with ovulation occurring in only a single cycle. DES consistently suppresses testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (<50 ng/dL) within 1 to 2 weeks at doses of 3 mg/day and above. Conversely, a dosage of 1 mg/day DES is unable to fully suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men, which instead often stabilize at just above castrate levels (>50 ng/dL). However, it has also been reported that 1 mg/day DES results in approximately 50% suppression of testosterone levels, albeit with wide interindividual variability. It has been said that doses of DES of less than 1 mg/day have no effect on testosterone levels. However, the addition of an ""extremely low"" dosage of 0.1 mg/day DES to cyproterone acetate has been found to result in a synergistic antigonadotropic effect and to suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men. DES at 3 mg/day has similar testosterone suppression to a dose of 300 mg/day, suggesting that suppression of testosterone levels is maximal by 3 mg/day. ==== Other activities ==== In addition to the ERs, an in vitro study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, at a variety of other steroid hormone receptors. Whereas the study found EC50 values of 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the medication showed significant glucocorticoid activity at a concentration of 1 μM that surpassed that of 0.1 nM dexamethasone, as well as significant antagonism of the androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, all at a concentration of 1 μM). It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of PPARγ and LXRα at a concentration of 10 μM. The researchers stated that, to the best of their knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed). However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in animal models at pharmacologically relevant doses. DES has been identified as an antagonist of all three isotypes of the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), the ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at a concentration of about 1 μM. === Pharmacokinetics === DES is well-absorbed with oral administration. With an oral dosage of 1 mg/day DES, plasma levels of DES at 20 hours following the last dose ranged between 0.9 and 1.9 ng/mL (3.4 to 7.1 nmol/L). Sublingual administration of DES appears to have about the same estrogenic potency of oral DES in women. Intrauterine DES has been studied for the treatment of uterine hypoplasia. Oral DES is thought to have about 17 to 50% of the clinical estrogenic potency of DES by injection. The distribution half-life of DES is 80 minutes. It has no affinity for SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin, and hence is not bound to these proteins in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of DES is greater than 95%. Hydroxylation of the aromatic rings of DES and subsequent conjugation of the ethyl side chains accounts for 80 to 90% of DES metabolism, while oxidation accounts for the remaining 10 to 20% and is dominated by conjugation reactions. Conjugation of DES consists of glucuronidation, while oxidation includes dehydrogenation into (Z,Z)-dienestrol. The medication is also known to produce paroxypropione as a metabolite. DES produces transient quinone-like reactive intermediates that cause cellular and genetic damage, which may help to explain the known carcinogenic effects of DES in humans. However, other research indicates that the toxic effects of DES may simply be due to overactivation of the ERs. In contrast to estradiol, the hydroxyl groups of DES do not undergo oxidation into an estrone-like equivalent. The elimination half-life of DES is 24 hours. The metabolites of DES are excreted in urine and feces. == Chemistry == DES belongs to the stilbestrol (4,4'-dihydroxystilbene) group of compounds. It is a nonsteroidal open-ring analogue of the steroidal estrogen estradiol. DES can be prepared from anethole, which also happens to be weakly estrogenic. Anethole was demethylated to form anol and anol then spontaneously dimerized into dianol and hexestrol, with DES subsequently being synthesized via structural modification of hexestrol. As shown by X-ray crystallography, the molecular dimensions of DES are almost identical to those of estradiol, particularly in regards to the distance between the terminal hydroxyl groups. == History == === Synthesis === DES was first synthesized in early 1938 by Leon Golberg, then a graduate student of Sir Robert Robinson at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory at the University of Oxford. Golberg's research was based on work by Wilfrid Lawson at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, (led by Sir Edward Charles Dodds at Middlesex Hospital Medical School now part of University College London). A report of its synthesis was published in Nature on 5 February 1938. DES research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds. Because it was not patented, DES was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide. === Clinical use === DES was first marketed for medical use in 1939. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 19, 1941, in tablets up to 5 mg for four indications: gonorrheal vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, menopausal symptoms, and postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement. The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the antibiotic penicillin became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial. In 1941, Charles Huggins and Clarence Hodges at the University of Chicago found estradiol benzoate and DES to be the first effective drugs for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. DES was the first cancer drug. Orchiectomy or DES or both were the standard initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the GnRH agonist leuprorelin was found to have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985. From the 1940s until the late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as estrogen replacement therapy for estrogen deficiency states such as ovarian dysgenesis, premature ovarian failure, and after oophorectomy. In the 1940s, DES was used off-label to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage. On July 1, 1947, the FDA approved the use of DES for this indication. The first such approval was granted to Bristol-Myers Squibb, allowing use of 25 mg (and later 100 mg) tablets of DES during pregnancy. Approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year. The recommended regimen started at 5 mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy (from first day of last menstrual period), increased every other week by 5 mg per day through the 14th week, and then increased every week by 5 mg per day from 25 mg per day in the 15th week to 125 mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy. DES was originally considered effective and safe for both the pregnant woman and the developing baby. It was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed. Sales peaked in 1953. In the early 1950s, a double-blind clinical trial at the University of Chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive DES. The study showed no benefit of taking DES during pregnancy; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reduced in the women who were given DES. By the late 1960s, six of seven leading textbooks of obstetrics said DES was ineffective at preventing miscarriage. Despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of DES to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, DES continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s. In 1971, a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed a probable link between DES and vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug in utero. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use. On February 5, 1975, the FDA ordered 25 mg and 100 mg tablets of DES withdrawn, effective February 18, 1975. The number of persons exposed to DES during pregnancy or in utero during the period of 1940 to 1971 is unknown, but may be as high as 2 million in the United States. DES was also used in other countries, most notably France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. From the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s, DES was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones. Despite its clear link to cancer, doctors continued to recommend the hormone for ""excess height"". In 1960, DES was found to be more effective than androgens in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. DES was the hormonal treatment of choice for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women until 1977, when the FDA approved tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator with efficacy similar to DES but fewer side effects. Several sources from medical literature in the 1970s and 1980s indicate that DES was used as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women. In 1973, in an attempt to restrict off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in JAMA) to emergency situations such as rape, an FDA Drug Bulletin was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES. In 1975, the FDA said it had not actually given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in 1975. To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25 mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5 mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: ""This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive"" in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label. In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive. In 1978, the FDA removed postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens. In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, Eli Lilly, stopped making and marketing it in 1997. === Trials === Diethylstilbestrol has been used countless times in studies on rats. Once it was discovered that DES was causing vaginal cancer, experiments began on both male and female rats. Many of these male rats were injected with DES while other male rats were injected with olive oil, and they were considered the control group. Each group received the same dosage on the same days, and the researchers performed light microscopy, electron microscopy, and confocal laser microscopy. With both the electron and confocal laser microscopy, it was prevalent that the Sertoli cells, which are somatic cells where spermatids develop in the testes, were formed 35 days later in the rats who were injected with Diethylstilbestrol compared to the rats in the control group. Proceeding the completion of the trial, it was understood that rats of older age who were injected with DES experienced delay in sertoli cell maturation, underdeveloped epididymides, and drastic decrease in weight compared to its counterparts. The female rats used were inbred and most of them were given DES combined in their food. These rats were divided into three groups, one group who received no diethylstilbestrol, one group who had DES mixed into their diet, and the third group who had DES administered into their diet after day 13 of being pregnant. Some rats who were given DES unfortunately died before delivering their pup. The group that received DES in their food for 13 days while being pregnant resulted in early abortion and delivery failure. These outcomes showed that DES had a detrimental effect on pregnancy when administered as often as it was. Providing the dosing of diethylstilbestrol later in the pregnancy term also made visible the occurrence of abortions among the rats. Overall, any interaction with DES in female rats concluded in the rats' experiencing abortions, improper fetal growth, and the increase in sterility. A review of people who had been treated or exposed to DES was done to find out what long-term effects would show. People for a long time had been treated during their pregnancy with DES, and there have been known to be toxic and adverse effects to the hormone therapy. ""Exposure to DES has been associated with an increased risk for breast cancer in DES mothers (relative risk, <2.0) and with a lifetime risk of clear-cell cervicovaginal cancer in DES daughters of 1/1000 to 1/10 000."" Side effects of DES are proving to be long-term as it can cause increased risks of cancer after use. There will be continued work to see how far the adverse effects of DES go after previous therapy and how it will affect offspring and the mothers longer-term. === Regulations === In 1938, the ability to test the safety of DES on animals was first obtained by the FDA. The results from the preliminary tests showed that DES harmed the reproductive systems of animals. The application of these results to humans could not be determined, so the FDA could not act in a regulatory manner. New Drug Applications for DES approval were withdrawn in 1940 in a decision made by the FDA based on scientific uncertainty. However, this decision resulted in significant political pressure, so the FDA came to a compromise. The compromise meant that DES would be available only by prescription and would have to have warnings about its effects on the bottle, but the warning was dropped in 1945. In 1947, DES finally gained FDA approval for prescription to pregnant women who had diabetes as a method of preventing miscarriages. This led to the widespread prescription of DES to all pregnant women. In 1971, the FDA recommended against the prescription of DES to pregnant women. As a result, DES then began to see a withdraw from the US market starting in 1972 and in the European market starting in 1978, but the FDA still did not withdraw its approval for the use of DES in humans. DES was classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. After classification as a carcinogen, DES had its FDA approval withdrawn in 2000. DES is currently only in use for veterinary practices and in research trials as allowed by the FDA. === Medical ethics === Medical Ethics in regard to the approval and use of Diethylstilbestrol have been dismissed because of the actions of the FDA and pharmaceutical companies that were making DES at the time of its use. The Vice President of the American Drug Manufacturers Association, Carson Frailey, was employed by drug companies creating DES in order to help get it approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nancy Langston, the author of The Retreat from Precaution: Regulating Diethylstilbestrol (DES), Endocrine Disruptors, and Environmental Health, states that ""Frailey persuaded fifty-four doctors from around the country to write to the FDA, describing their clinical experiences with a total of more than five thousand patients. Only four of these fifty-four doctors felt that DES should not be approved, and the result was that, against the concerns of many of the FDA medical staff, the FDA's drug chief Theodore Klumpp recommended that the FDA approve DES."" This excerpt describes how DES was unethically approved and shows that the motivation behind its approval was for the benefit of drug companies rather than the people who were going to use the drug. This approval of DES violates the values of medical ethics, autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice as there was little thought put into how DES would affect its users. The decisions made by the FDA leaders to approve DES without further study and convince doctors to dissimulate their opinions on the use of DES is unethical. Once DES was approved for public consumption the ""warnings [for DES were] made available only on a separate circular that patients would not see. Doctors could get this warning circular only by writing to the drug companies and requesting it. Letters between companies and FDA regulators reveal that both groups feared that if a woman ever saw how many potential risks DES might present, she might refuse to take the drug—or else she might sue the company and the prescribing doctors if she did get cancer or liver damage after taking the drug."" Women were not informed about the possible effects of DES because doctors and FDA regulators were afraid DES would fail and never be approved costing the drug companies millions of dollars. The act of distributing potentially dangerous medicine to patients regardless of the effect and harm it may do solely for monetary gain is unethical. === Lawsuits === In the 1970s, the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of DES's long-term effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the United States against its manufacturers. These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the Supreme Court of California, Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, in which the court imposed a rebuttable presumption of market share liability upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff. Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company manufacturing DES, and the University of Chicago, had an action filed against them in regard to clinical trials from the 1950s. Three women filed the claim that their daughters had developments of abnormal cervical cellular formations as well as reproductive abnormalities in themselves and their sons. The plaintiffs had asked the courts to certify their case as a class action but were declined by the courts. However, the courts issued an opinion that their case had merit. The court held that Eli Lilly had a duty to notify about the risks of DES once they became aware of them or should have become aware of them. Under Illinois tort law, for the plaintiffs to recover under theories of breach of duty to warn and strict liability, the plaintiffs must have alleged injury to themselves. Ultimately, under their claims of breach of duty to warn and strict liability due to the plaintiffs citing risk of physical injury to others, not physical injury to themselves, the case was dismissed by the courts. Although the case was not certified as class action and their claims of breach of duty to warn and strict liability was dismissed, the courts did not dismiss the battery allegations. The issue was then to determine whether the University of Chicago had committed battery against these women but the case was settled before trial. Part of the settlement agreement for this case, Mink v. University of Chicago, attorneys for the plaintiffs negotiated for the university to provide free medical exams for all offspring exposed to DES in utero during the 1950 experiments as well as treat the daughters of any women involved who develop DES-associated vaginal or cervical cancer. As of February 1991, there were over a thousand pending legal actions against DES manufacturers. There are over 300 companies that manufactured DES according to the same formula and the largest barrier to recovery is determining which manufacturer supplied the drug in each particular case. Many of the successful cases have relied on joint or several parties holding liability. A lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them. Their cases survived a Daubert hearing. In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial. The remaining litigants have received various settlements. The advocacy group DES Action USA helped provide information and support for DES-exposed persons engaged in lawsuits. == Society and culture == Alan Turing, the ground-breaking cryptographer, founder of computing science and programmable computers, who also proposed the actual theoretical model of biological morphogenesis, was forcefully given this drug to induce chemical castration as a punitive and discredited ""treatment"" for homosexual behaviour, shortly before he died in ambiguous circumstances. At least on one occasion in New Zealand in the early 1960s, diethylstilbestrol was prescribed for the ""treatment"" of homosexuality. James Herriot describes a case regarding treating a small dog's testicular Sertoli cell tumor in his 1974 book All Things Bright and Beautiful. Herriot decided to prescribe a high dose of stilboestrol for the recurring tumor, with the amusing side effect that the male dog became ""attractive to other male dogs"", who followed the terrier around the village for a few weeks. Herriot comments in the story that he knew ""The new drug was said to have a feminising effect, but surely not to that extent."" == Veterinary use == === Canine incontinence === DES has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control. It is still available from compounding pharmacies, and at the low (1 mg) dose, does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans. It is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed. === Livestock growth promotion === The greatest usage of DES was in the livestock industry, used to improve feed conversion in beef and poultry. During the 1960s, DES was used as a growth hormone in the beef and poultry industries. It was later found to cause cancer by 1971, but was not phased out until 1979. Although DES was discovered to be harmful to humans, its veterinary use was not immediately halted. As of 2011, DES was still being used as a growth promoter in terrestrial livestock or fish in some parts of the world including China. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Diethylstilbestrol (DES) and Cancer National Cancer Institute DES Update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DES Action USA national consumer organization providing comprehensive information for DES-exposed individuals DES Booklets from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (c. 1980) DES Follow-up Study Archived 2011-09-29 at the Wayback Machine National Cancer Institute's longterm study of DES-exposed persons (including the DES-AD Project) University of Chicago DES Registry of patients with CCA (clear cell adenocarcinoma) of the vagina and/or cervix DES Diethylstilbestrol Provides resources and social media links for general DES awareness",Agostilben,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.000157293034135364), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07896248996257782), (' INDUSTR', -0.009171206504106522), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.031694043427705765), ('ICAL', -1.1086402082582936e-05), (',', -0.576316773891449), ('ĠINDU', -0.014136063866317272), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12756623327732086)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol_dipropionate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=110, start_index=9, title='Diethylstilbestrol dipropionate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol_dipropionate?utm_source=openai')])"

It is an amide of pelargonic acid (n-nonanoic acid) and vanillyl amine. It is present in chili peppers, but is commonly manufactured synthetically. It is more heat-stable than capsaicin. Nonivamide is used as a food additive to add pungency to seasonings, flavorings, and spice blends. It is also used in the confectionery industry to create a hot sensation, and in the pharmaceutical industry in some formulations as a cheaper alternative to capsaicin. Like capsaicin, it can deter mammals (but not birds or insects) from consuming plants or seeds (e.g. squirrels and bird feeder seeds). This is consistent with nonivamide's role as a TRPV1 ion channel agonist. Mammalian TRPV1 is activated by heat and capsaicin, but the avian form is insensitive to capsaicin. Nonivamide is used (under the name PAVA) as the payload in ""less-lethal munitions"" such as the FN Herstal's FN 303 projectiles or as the active ingredient in most pepper sprays, which may be used as a chemical weapon. As a chemical irritant, pepper sprays have been used both as a riot control munition and also a weapon to disperse peaceful demonstrators; they have also been used in other contexts, such as military or police training exercises. While irritants commonly cause only ""transient lacrimation, blepharospasm, superficial pain, and disorientation,"" their use and misuse also presents serious risks of more severe injury and disability. == Treatment == Nonivamide is not soluble in water, however water will dilute it and wash it away.

2993,"('Nefopam (hydrochloride)', 'Fenazoxine hydrochloride', 'Nefopam', 'Fenazoxine', 'Nefopamum')",Medical,"Nefopam, sold under the brand name Acupan among others, is a centrally acting, non-opioid painkilling medication, with central stimulant and sympathomimetic properties that is primarily used to treat moderate to severe pain. Nefopam acts in the brain and spinal cord to relieve pain via novel mechanisms: antinociceptive effects from triple monoamine reuptake inhibition, and antihyperalgesic activity through modulation of glutamatergic transmission. == Medical uses == === Analgesic === Nefopam was significantly more effective than aspirin as an analgesic in one clinical trial, although with a greater incidence of side effects such as sweating, dizziness and nausea, especially at higher doses. The estimated relative potency of nefopam to morphine indicates that 20 mg of nefopam HCl is the approximate analgesic equal of 12 mg of morphine with comparable analgesic efficacy to morphine, or oxycodone, while nefopam tends to produce fewer side effects, does not produce respiratory depression, and has much less abuse potential, and so is useful either as an alternative to opioid analgesics, or as an adjunctive treatment for use alongside opioids or other types of analgesics. === Other Medical Uses === Nefopam is also used to treat severe hiccups. Nefopam is also used for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an affective disorder and attention-deficit disorder. Nefopam can also be used as a contradiction for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Nefopam is effective for prevention of shivering during surgery or recovery from surgery. == Contraindications == Nefopam is contraindicated in people with convulsive disorders, those that have received treatment with irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine or isocarboxazid within the past 30 days and those with myocardial infarction pain, mostly due to a lack of safety data in these conditions. == Side effects == Common side effects include nausea, nervousness, dry mouth, light-headedness and urinary retention. Less common side effects include vomiting, blurred vision, drowsiness, sweating, insomnia, headache, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, aggravation of angina and rarely a temporary and benign pink discolouration of the skin or erythema multiforme. === Overdose === Overdose and death have been reported with nefopam. Overdose usually manifests with convulsions, hallucinations, tachycardia, and hyperdynamic circulation. Treatment is usually supportive, managing cardiovascular complications with beta blockers and limiting absorption with activated charcoal. == Interactions == It has additive anticholinergic and sympathomimetic effects with other agents with these properties. Its use should be avoided in people receiving some types of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) as there is the potential for serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crises to result. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of nefopam and its analgesic effects are not well understood, although inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (that is, acting as an SNDRITooltip serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor) is thought to be involved. It also reduces glutamate signaling via modulating sodium and calcium channels. === Pharmacokinetics === The absolute bioavailability of nefopam is low. It is reported to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations between 49 and 183 nM. The drug is approximately 73% protein-bound across a plasma range of 7 to 226 ng/mL (28–892 nM). The metabolism of nefopam is hepatic, by N-demethylation and via other routes. Its terminal half-life is 3 to 8 hours, while that of its active metabolite, desmethylnefopam, is 10 to 15 hours. It is eliminated mostly in urine, and to a lesser extent in feces. == Chemistry == Nefopam is a cyclized analogue of orphenadrine, diphenhydramine, and tofenacin, with each of these compounds different from one another only by the presence of one or two carbons. The ring system of nefopam is a benzoxazocine system. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Recreational use of nefopam has rarely been reported, and is far less common than with opioid analgesics. === Names === In the 1960s, when it was first developed, it had the generic name fenazoxine. == See also == Troparil == References ==",Fenazoxine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.505351095460355e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.38985195755958557), (',', -0.09007657319307327), ('ĠMED', -0.005003668367862701), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003577738767489791)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01814994215965271)])","('INFO; ', [])"

A method free of empirical models was used for the treatment of kinetic data, and compared to several known solid state kinetic data processing methods. Phase transitions were monitored by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermal analysis. Full PXRD profiles were used for determining the phase content instead of single reflex intensity measurements, in order to minimize the influence of particle texture. We compared the applicability of isothermal and nonisothermal methods to our investigation of detomidine hydrochlorine monohydrate dehydration. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of MK-467 and hyoscine butylbromide on detomidine hydrochloride-induced cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal changes in horses. ANIMALS 6 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES Horses received detomidine hydrochloride (20 μg/kg, IV), followed 10 minutes later by MK-467 hydrochloride (150 μg/kg; DET-MK), hyoscine butylbromide (0.2 mg/kg; DET-HYO), or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (DET-S), IV, in a Latin square design. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, arterial and venous blood pressures, and cardiac output were measured; blood gases and arterial plasma drug concentrations were analyzed; selected cardiopulmonary variables were calculated; and sedation and gastrointestinal borborygmi were scored at predetermined time points. Differences among treatments or within treatments over time were analyzed statistically. RESULTS With DET-MK, detomidine-induced hypertension and bradycardia were reversed shortly after MK-467 injection. Marked tachycardia and hypertension were observed with DET-HYO. Mean heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure differed significantly among all treatments from 15 to 35 and 15 to 40 minutes after detomidine injection, respectively. Cardiac output was greater with DET-MK and DET-HYO than with DET-S 15 minutes after detomidine injection, but left ventricular workload was significantly higher with DET-HYO. Borborygmus score, reduced with all treatments, was most rapidly restored with DET-MK. Sedation scores and pharmacokinetic parameters of detomidine did not differ between DET-S and DET-MK. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE MK-467 reversed or attenuated cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects of detomidine without notable adverse effects or alterations in detomidine-induced sedation in horses. Further research is needed to determine whether these advantages are found in clinical patients and to assess whether the drug influences analgesic effects of detomidine. A standardized protocol for electroencephalography (EEG) under standing sedation for the investigation of epilepsy in foals is needed. To evaluate a modified standardized EEG protocol under standing sedation using sublingual detomidine hydrochloride in Egyptian Arabian foals. Nineteen foals (controls, 9; juvenile idiopathic epilepsy [JIE], 10). Descriptive clinical study. Foals were classified as controls or epileptic based on history or witnessed seizures and neurological examination. Foals were sedated using sublingual detomidine hydrochloride at a dosage of 0.08 mg/kg to avoid stress associated with injectable sedation. Once foals appeared sedated with their heads low to the ground and with wide base stance (30 minutes), topical lidocaine hydrochloride was applied at the determined locations of EEG electrodes. Fifteen minutes were allowed for absorption and electrodes were placed, protected, and EEG recording performed. Level of sedation was considered excellent with no need of redosing. The EEG recording lasted from 27 to 51 minutes and provided interpretable data. Epileptic discharges (ED) were noted predominantly in the central-parietal region in 9 of 10 epileptic foals. Photic stimulation triggered ED in 7 of 10 epileptic foals and in none of the controls. Foals were not oversedated and recovered uneventfully. Sublingual detomidine hydrochloride is a safe, painless, simple, and effective method of sedation for EEG recording in foals. Sublingual sedation allowed the investigation of cerebral electrical activity during states of sleep and arousal, and during photic stimulation for the investigation of epilepsy in foals.",Detomidine (hydrochloride),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004078758880496025), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0017322786152362823), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04859709367156029)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.575981616973877)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detomidine,https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-approves-first-generic-detomidine-hydrochloride-injectable-solution-horses,https://equimed.com/drugs-and-medications/reference/detomidine-hydrochloride ', [])"
2996,"('Citrulline', 'H-cit-oh', 'Delta-ureidonorvaline', 'Sitrulline', '(s)-2-amino-5-ureidopentanoic acid')","Food, Medical","The organic compound citrulline is an α-amino acid. Its name is derived from citrullus, the Latin word for watermelon. Although named and described by gastroenterologists since the late 19th century, it was first isolated from watermelon in 1914 by Japanese researchers Yatarō Koga (古賀彌太郎) and Ryō Ōtake (大嶽了) and further codified by Mitsunori Wada of Tokyo Imperial University in 1930. It has the formula H2NC(O)NH(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. It is a key intermediate in the urea cycle, the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. == Biosynthesis == Citrulline can be derived from: from arginine via nitric oxide synthase, as a byproduct of the production of nitric oxide for signaling purposes from ornithine through the breakdown of proline or glutamine/glutamate from asymmetric dimethylarginine via DDAH Citrulline is made from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate in one of the central reactions in the urea cycle. It is also produced from arginine as a byproduct of the reaction catalyzed by NOS family (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39). It is also prevalent in trichohyalin at the inner root sheath and medulla of hair follicles, where it is synthesized from arginine. Arginine is first oxidized into N-hydroxyl-arginine, which is then further oxidized to citrulline concomitant with release of nitric oxide. Citrulline is also made by enterocytes of the small intestine. == Function == Citrulline is a metabolic intermediate within the urea cycle, which is the pathway by which mammals excrete ammonia by converting it into urea. Citrulline is also produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic production of nitric oxide from the amino acid arginine, catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase. In the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, citrulline is a metabolic intermediate in the latter, cytosolic half of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. Several proteins contain citrulline as a result of a post-translational modification. These citrulline residues are generated by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), which convert arginine into citrulline in a process called citrullination or deimination with the help of calcium ions. Proteins that normally contain citrulline residues include myelin basic protein (MBP), filaggrin, and several histone proteins, whereas other proteins, such as fibrin and vimentin are susceptible to citrullination during cell death and tissue inflammation. Circulating citrulline concentration is a biomarker of intestinal functionality. == Commercial use == L-citrulline is sold as a dietary supplement, usually in powder form. Advocates suggest that since L-citrulline boosts nitric oxide production, helping arterial function and thus blood flow throughout the body, this might be helpful in treating or preventing various ailments. Lowering blood pressure in people with elevated blood pressure. Easing symptoms of mild-to-moderate erectile dysfunction, with fewer risks than Viagra. Ameliorating circulatory problems such as slow wound healing due to diabetes. Raising muscle protein levels, preventing malnourishment in the elderly and possibly improving athletic performance. Treating intestinal problems, including short bowel syndrome, celiac disease and radiation-caused small bowel damage Various genetic disorders and health conditions such as liver disease, Parkinson's disease and certain dementias. These assertions are based on animal studies, and like most dietary supplement claims have not be endorsed by the Food and Drugs Administration. L-citrulline is added to certain energy drinks such as Reign and touted for its thermogenic effects. == See also == Citrullinemia == References ==",Citrulline,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.00012833021173719317), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00015872348740231246), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0002613358374219388), (' FOOD', -0.03393762558698654), (',', -0.0790046826004982), (' PERSONAL', -9.519893501419574e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.28969040513038635), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -2.682172998902388e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.005290080793201923), (',', -0.38691797852516174), ('ĠMED', -0.18194909393787384), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07892411947250366)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.306760805164231e-05), (' FOOD', -3.774276774493046e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrulline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=113, start_index=33, title='Citrulline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrulline?utm_source=openai')])"

2998,"('Ribociclib', 'Ribociclib (lee011)', 'Kisqali', 'Ribociclib(lee011)', 'Ribociclib, lee011')",Medical,"Ribociclib, sold under the brand name Kisqali, is a medication used for the treatment of certain kinds of breast cancer. Ribociclib is a kinase inhibitor. It was developed by Novartis and Astex Pharmaceuticals. The most common side effects include infections, low levels of white blood cells, headache, cough, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, tiredness, hair loss and rash. Ribociclib was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2017, in the European Union in August 2017, and in the United Kingdom in February 2021. == Medical uses == In the United States, it is indicated for the treatment of adults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy; or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women or in men. In the European Union, it is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR)‑positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. In pre‑ or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinising hormone‑releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. In September 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indication for ribociclib, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, for the adjuvant treatment of adults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage II and III early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. Additionally, the FDA approved the ribociclib and letrozole co-pack for the same indication. In November 2024, the European Commission expanded the indication of ribociclib, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, for the adjuvant treatment of adults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. == Side effects == The most common side effects in studies were decreased blood cell counts, mainly neutropenia (in 75% of patients, as compared to 5% under placebo), but also anemia (18% vs. 5%). Gastrointestinal disorders were also common, for example nausea (52% vs. 29%) and diarrhea (35% vs. 22%), as was alopecia (33% vs. 16%). The drug also increases the QT interval and liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase). The most common side effects include infections, low levels of white blood cells, headache, cough, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, tiredness, hair loss and rash. The most common severe side effects include infections, low levels of red and white blood cells, vomiting, abnormal blood tests for liver function and low levels of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphataemia). == Interactions == As ribociclib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, inhibitors of this enzyme increase its concentrations in the body and could potentiate side effects and toxicity. Examples of such inhibitors include ketoconazole and similar antifungal drugs, ritonavir, clarithromycin, as well as grapefruit. Conversely, drugs that induce CYP3A4, such as rifampicin and St John's Wort, can decrease ribociclib concentrations. Ribociclib itself is a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and can increase concentrations of other drugs that share this metabolism, as has been shown with midazolam. It also inhibits a number of transporter proteins and could thus theoretically interfere with the transport of other drugs in the body. It could also amplify QT prolongation of other drugs such as antiarrhythmics, clarithromycin, and haloperidol. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 are enzymes that have been shown to promote cell division and multiplication in both normal and cancer cells. Many cancer cells have shown abnormalities that increase the activity of CDK, leading to the inactivation of certain tumor suppressor genes. When used in combination with other drugs such as an ALK inhibitor or an MEK inhibitor, ribociclib has been shown to have a synergistic effect, resulting in improved responses. Again, this is likely a result of ""crosstalk"" between signaling pathways. Simply blocking one pathway in cancer tumorigenesis can sometimes result in ""tumor compensation"", where the tumor compensates for the blocked signaling pathway by utilizing other pathways to survive. By blocking several pathways at once, it is thought that the tumor is less able to compensate, and a greater anti-tumor response is often observed. Utilizing ribociclib in combination with other agents has been shown to reduce the development of resistance to these agents. === Pharmacokinetics === The percentage of ribociclib absorbed in the gut has not been determined. Highest blood plasma levels are reached after one to four hours; and after repeated dosage, steady state concentrations are reached after about eight days. Food intake has no effect on absorption rates. When in the bloodstream, about 70% of ribociclib is bound to plasma proteins. The substance is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and subsequently by various phase II enzymes, resulting in a large number of metabolites. Those with highest blood plasma concentrations in humans are called CCI284 (an unspecified N-hydroxylation product), LEQ803 (the N-demethylation product) and M1 (a glucuronide). All metabolites have negligible clinical activity. Ribociclib has a slight tendency to accumulate in the body. It is eliminated with an average biological half-life of 32 hours, mostly (69%) via the feces, but also (23%) via the urine. The unchanged drug accounts for 17% of the substance in the feces and 12% of the substance in the urine, the rest being metabolites. == Chemistry == Ribociclib is used in form of its succinate salt. It is a slightly hygroscopic yellow to brown crystalline powder that is soluble in aqueous acids. == History == Ribociclib demonstrated a clinical benefit on overall survival across all three phase III trials of the MONALEESA clinical program with different endocrine therapy partners, regardless of menopausal status or line of therapy. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) assigned the highest score on the 'Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale' for ribociclib. In the clinical trial relevant for the drug's approval, ribociclib significantly improved progression-free survival, that is, the time span the cancer did not get worse. For participants receiving placebo plus letrozole, progression-free survival was 16 months on average, while under ribociclib plus letrozole, progression-free survival was 25 months as of the January 2017 analysis. In October 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency recommended a change to the terms of the marketing authorization for ribociclib to add the adjuvant treatment of people with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative early breast cancer, at high risk of disease recurrence. The marketing authorization holder is Novartis Europharm Limited. In November 2024, the European Commission expanded the marketing authorization to include the use of ribociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the adjuvant treatment of patients with hormone receptor -positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. == References ==",Kisqali,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.9141146923357155e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.034383063204587e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/ribociclib-kisqali,https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/fda-approves-novartis-kisqali-reduce-risk-recurrence-people-hrher2-early-breast-cancer ', [])"

Narlaprevir is the first Russian tableted medication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. == Mechanism of action == Narlaprevir is an oral NS3 serine protease inhibitor of hepatitis C virus. It inhibits viral replication in infected host cells. The mechanism of inhibition involves reversible covalent binding of narlaprevir with NS3 protease active site via the ketoamide functional group. Narlaprevir does not bind to human proteases, with the exception of cathepsin B (69% inhibition). Overexpression of cathepsin B is associated with the development of malignancies. == Usage == Indications Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection genotype 1 in combination with ritonavir, pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin, in patients older than 18 years with compensated liver disease who are treatment-naïve or have failed dual combination of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin. Narlaprevir cannot be used as a single agent. Contraindications Narlaprevir has some contraindications. In particular: pregnancy or lactation children up to 18 years of age severe neutropenia liver failure prior treatment with HCV protease inhibitors lactase deficiency, lactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption. == Efficacy studies == H. Reesink et al. (2009) demonstrated narlaprevir safety and antiviral activity both as a single agent and in dual combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b. X. Tong et al. (2010) demonstrated narlaprevir activity against HCV mutations causing resistance to boceprevir and telaprevir. In the year 2016 a large-scale phase III multicenter PIONEER study was completed. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was 89% in treatment-naïve and 70% in treatment-experienced patients 24 weeks after the end of treatment in the narlaprevir group, whereas in the control group SVR was only 59.6% in treatment-naïve and 24.5% in treatment-experienced patients on dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin. Adding narlaprevir to dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin did not affect narlaprevir safety profile. A phase I study of narlaprevir pharmacokinetics in combination with ritonavir in patients with compensated cirrhosis was also completed (Liver Meeting AASLD, 13–17 February 2015, San Francisco, California, USA). According to professor I.G. Bakulin, the head of the Department of Hepatology of the Moscow clinical research center and chief gastroenterologist of Moscow government healthcare department, the regulatory approval of narlaprevir has become a major milestone accomplished in the fight against hepatitis C in Russia. == History == In 2012, the pharmaceutical group R-Pharm acquired a license to manufacture narlaprevir from the Merck & Co. (MSD). Further development of the drug was conducted by R-Pharm in cooperation with Texas Liver Institute (USA), with the support of the Federal Target Program ""Development of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Industry of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2020 and beyond"". About 700 million rubles were invested in clinical trials and the development of the drug, of which 120 million rubles came from the Russian Government. Preclinical and clinical studies of the drug were conducted in Schering-Plough Research Institute (USA), as well as in a number of clinical centers in Europe, USA and Russia.The drug is manufactured at a pharmaceutical factory in the Russian city of Yaroslavl. == References == == Further reading ==",Narlaprevir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005566716426983476)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narlaprevir?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Narlaprevir', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narlaprevir?utm_source=openai')])"

It was developed by the Belgian-Dutch biotech company Galapagos NV. The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), upper respiratory tract infection (nose and throat infection), urinary tract infection and dizziness. Filgotinib was approved for medical use in both the European Union and Japan in September 2020. == Medical uses == Filgotinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease‑modifying anti‑rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Filgotinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). == Mechanism of action == Filgotinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor with selectivity for subtype JAK1 of this enzyme. It is considered a promising agent as it inhibits JAK1 selectively, similar to already marketed upadacitinib. Less selective JAK inhibitors (e.g. tofacitinib and baricitinib) are already being marketed. They show long-term efficacy in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. However, their lack of selectivity leads to dose-limiting side effects. It is thought that inhibition of all JAK isoenzymes is beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. However, pan-JAK inhibition might also lead to unwanted side effects that might not outweigh its benefits. This is the rationale for the development of newer and more selective inhibitors like filgotinib. The signal transmission of large numbers of proinflammatory cytokines is dependent on JAK1. Inhibition of JAK2 may also contribute to the efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis. Nonetheless it is thought that JAK2 inhibition might lead to anemia and thrombopenia by interference with erythropoietin and thrombopoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Therefore, one might prefer to choose a more selective JAK1 inhibitor as a primary therapeutic option. Filgotinib exerts a 30-fold selectivity for JAK1 compared to JAK2. It is however still to be seen to what extent JAK2 inhibition should be avoided. == History == June 2011: results of first Phase II trial November 2014: initiation of DARWIN 1 and 2 trials July 2015: DARWIN 1 results released August 2015: DARWIN 2 trial results released September 2015: AbbVie opted out of collaboration with Galapagos December 2015: Galapagos signed partnership with Gilead to co-develop & co-commercialize Filgotinib for various diseases December 2019: Gilead submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with a priority review voucher to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for filgotinib. On 23 July 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Jyseleca, intended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences Ireland UC. 19 August 2020: FDA rejects Gilead’s filing for approval of filgotinib over toxicity concerns September 2020: Filgotinib was approved for medical use in both the European Union and Japan. == Research == === Clinical trials === The efficacy of filgotinib is being studied in a Phase IIb program (DARWIN trial 1, 2) with involvement of 886 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 180 Crohn's disease patients. ==== Phase I study ==== It was shown in Phase I studies that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib metabolism is independent of hepatic CYP450 enzymatic degradation. The drug metabolism is however mediated by carboxylesterases. There is no interference reported with the metabolism of methotrexate nor with any of the investigated transport proteins. ==== Phase II study: Proof of concept (2011) ==== In November 2011 Galapagos released the results of their Phase II study (identification: NCT01384422, Eudract: 2010-022953-40) in which 36 rheumatoid arthritis patients were treated who showed a suboptimal clinical response to methotrexate treatment. Three groups of twelve patients were treated either with 200 mg filgotinib in a single dose, 200 mg divided in two doses or placebo. The primary end-point was the ACR20 score, which monitors improvements in the symptomatology of the patient. After the scheduled 4 weeks of treatment, 83% of the respondents showed an improved ACR20-score. Half of the treated patients showed a complete (or near complete) remission of the disease. There were no reports of anemia nor changes in lipidemia. The company stated in their press release that filgotinib is the first selective JAK1 inhibitor that shows clinical efficacy. As a result of this study, the company stated that ""GLPG0634 shows one of the highest initial response rates ever reported for rheumatoid arthritis treatments"". ==== DARWIN 1 trial ==== The DARWIN 1 trial was a 24-week double blind placebo-controlled trial with 599 rheumatoid arthritis patients enrolled. All participants had moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and showed an insufficient response to standard methotrexate treatment. The trial compared three dosages of filgotinib as a once or twice per day regimen. During the trial all participants remained on their methotrexate treatment. The trial completed in Feb 2015 and the results were released in July 2015. Galapagos announced that the drug met key efficacy endpoints, showed ACR70 responses up to 39%, and maintained its safety profile. ==== DARWIN 2 trial ==== The DARWIN 2 trial was a double blind placebo-controlled trial with 280 rheumatoid arthritis patients enrolled who show an insufficient response to standard methotrexate treatment. In contrast to the previous DARWIN 1 trial, methotrexate was discontinued. Therefore, this trial investigates filgotinib as a second-line monotherapy. The recruitment of DARWIN trial 2b ended in November 2014. In August 2015, Galapagos announced that the study confirmed previous results. ==== DARWIN 3 trial ==== Patients who completed DARWIN 1 and 2 were eligible for DARWIN 3. In November 2017, the company announced consistent safety findings and durable activity at week 84 in the trial. The estimated study completion timeframe is May 2019. ==== FINCH Phase III trials ==== FINCH 1 looks at patients where first-line treatment with methotrexate (MTX) is not working.

3001,"('Fomepizole', 'Antizol', 'Fomepizol', 'Fomepizolum', 'Fomepizol [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Fomepizole, also known as 4-methylpyrazole, is a medication used to treat methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. It may be used alone or together with hemodialysis. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, nausea, sleepiness, and unsteadiness. It is unclear if use during pregnancy causes risk to a fetus. Fomepizole works by blocking the enzyme that converts methanol and ethylene glycol to their toxic breakdown products. Fomepizole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical use == Fomepizole is used to treat ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning. It acts to inhibit the breakdown of these toxins into their active toxic metabolites. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, found in the liver. This enzyme plays a key role in the metabolism of ethylene glycol, and of methanol. Ethylene glycol is first metabolized to glycolaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycolaldehyde then undergoes further oxidation to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are the primary toxins responsible for the metabolic acidosis, and for the renal damage, seen in ethylene glycol poisoning. Methanol is first metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde then undergoes further oxidation, via formaldehyde dehydrogenase, to become formic acid. Formic acid is the primary toxin responsible for the metabolic acidosis, and for the visual disturbances, associated with methanol poisoning. By competitively inhibiting the first enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol, fomepizole slows the production of the toxic metabolites. The slower rate of metabolite production allows the liver to process and excrete the metabolites as they are produced, limiting the accumulation in tissues such as the kidney and eye. As a result, much of the organ damage is avoided. Fomepizole is most effective when given soon after ingestion of ethylene glycol or methanol. Delaying its administration allows for the generation of harmful metabolites. === Interaction with alcohol === Concurrent use with ethanol is contraindicated because fomepizole is known to prolong the half-life of ethanol via inhibiting its metabolism. Extending the half-life of ethanol may increase and extend the intoxicating effects of ethanol, allowing for greater (potentially dangerous) levels of intoxication at lower doses. Fomepizole slows the production of acetaldehyde by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, which in turn allows more time to further convert acetaldehyde into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The result is a patient with a prolonged and deeper level of intoxication for any given dose of ethanol, and reduced ""hangover"" symptoms (since these adverse symptoms are largely mediated by acetaldehyde build up) . In a chronic alcoholic who has built up a tolerance to ethanol, this removes some of the disincentives to ethanol consumption (""negative reinforcement"") while allowing them to become intoxicated with a lower dose of ethanol. The danger is that the alcoholic will then overdose on ethanol (possibly fatally). If alcoholics instead very carefully reduce their doses to reflect the now slower metabolism, they may get the ""rewarding"" stimulus of intoxication at lower doses with less adverse ""hangover"" effects - leading potentially to increased psychological dependency. However, these lower doses may therefore produce less chronic toxicity and provide a harm minimization approach to chronic alcoholism . It is, in essence, the antithesis of a disulfiram approach which tries to increase the buildup of acetaldehyde resulting in positive punishment for the patient. Compliance, and adherence, is a substantial problem in disulfiram-based approaches. Disulfiram also has a considerably longer half-life than that of fomepizole, requiring the person to not drink ethanol in order to avoid severe effects. If the person is not adequately managed on a benzodiazepine, barbiturate, acamprosate, or another GABAA receptor agonist, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and its attendant, life-threatening risk of delirium tremens ""DT"", may occur. Disulfiram treatment should never be initiated until the risk of DT has been evaluated, and mitigated appropriately. Fomepizole treatment may be initiated while the DT de-titration sequence is still being calibrated based upon the person's withdrawal symptoms and psychological health. == Adverse effects == Common side effects associated with fomepizole use include headache and nausea. == Kinetics == === Absorption and distribution === Fomepizole distributes rapidly into total body water. The volume of distribution is between 0.6 and 1.02 L/kg. The therapeutic concentration is from 8.2 to 24.6 mg (100 to 300 micromoles) per liter. Peak concentration following single oral doses of 7 to 50 mg/kg of body weight occurred in 1 to 2 hours. The half-life varies with dose, so has not been calculated. === Metabolism and elimination === Hepatic – the primary metabolite is 4-carboxypyrazole (about 80 to 85% of an administered dose). Other metabolites include the pyrazoles 4-hydroxymethylpyrazole and the N -glucuronide conjugates of 4-carboxypyrazole and 4-hydroxymethylpyrazole. Following multiple doses, fomepizole rapidly induces its own metabolism via the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system. In healthy volunteers, 1.0 to 3.5% of an administered dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolites also are excreted unchanged in the urine. Fomepizole is dialyzable. == Other uses == Apart from medical uses, the role of 4-methylpyrazole in coordination chemistry has been studied. == References ==",Antizol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.40932747349143e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004093007650226355)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomepizole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Fomepizole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomepizole?utm_source=openai')])"

It has been shown to significantly inhibit growth of breast cancer in animal (xenograft) models and has shown partial responses in clinical trials with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and several other tumour types. It was approved to treat renal cell carcinoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after showing a modest increase in progression-free survival, though there have been reports of fatal adverse effects. == Medical uses == === Renal cell carcinoma === It has received approval for use as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (January 2012), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (September 2012), the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (September 2012) and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) (July 2012). == Clinical trials == A Phase II clinical trial showed good response in combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer. However, Pfizer reported on 30 January 2009, that Phase III clinical trials of the drug when used in combination with gemcitabine showed no evidence of improved survival rates over treatments using gemcitabine alone for advanced pancreatic cancer and halted the trial. In 2010, a Phase III trial for previously treated metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) showed significantly extended progression-free survival when compared to sorafenib. In December 2011, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted unanimously to recommend that US FDA approve axitinib for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), based on the results of the Phase III trial comparing axitinib and sorafenib. It has also been studied in combination with the ALK1 inhibitor dalantercept. A study published in 2015 showed that axitinib effectively inhibits a mutated gene (BCR-ABL1[T315I]) that is common in chronic myeloid leukemias and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemias which have become resistant to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib. This is one of the first examples of a new indication for an existing drug being discovered by screening known drugs using a patient's own cells. == Adverse effects == Diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, hand-foot syndrome, weight decreased, vomiting, asthenia, and constipation are the most common side effects occurring in more than 20% of patients. == Interactions == Coadministration with strong CYP3A4/CYP3A5 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided where possible as they may increase or reduce plasma exposure of axitinib, respectively. == Mechanism of action == Its primary mechanism of action is thought to be vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1–3, c-KIT and PDGFR inhibition, this, in turn, enables it to inhibit angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels by tumours). It was also proposed that it might act by inducing autophagy, as some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, like sorafenib. It has also been shown to bind (in a different conformation from the VEGF binding) to the BCR-ABL fusion protein, specifically inhibiting the drug-resistant T315I mutant isoform. == Pharmacokinetics == == Society and culture == === Legal status === In July 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Axitinib Accord, intended for the treatment of adults with renal cell carcinoma.

UA was discovered 40 years ago, but only recently has its impact on aging and disease been explored. UA enhances cellular health by increasing mitophagy and mitochondrial function and reducing detrimental inflammation. Several preclinical studies show how UA protects against aging and age-related conditions affecting muscle, brain, joints, and other organs. In humans, benefits of UA supplementation in the muscle are supported by recent clinical trials in elderly people. Here, we review the state of the art of UA's biology and its translational potential as a nutritional intervention in humans. Targeting mitophagy to activate the recycling of faulty mitochondria during aging is a strategy to mitigate muscle decline. We present results from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in middle-aged adults where we administer a postbiotic compound Urolithin A (Mitopure), a known mitophagy activator, at two doses for 4 months (NCT03464500). The data show significant improvements in muscle strength (∼12%) with intake of Urolithin A. We observe clinically meaningful improvements with Urolithin A on aerobic endurance (peak oxygen oxygen consumption [VO Compromised autophagy, including impaired mitophagy and lysosomal function, plays pivotal roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Urolithin A (UA) is a gut microbial metabolite of ellagic acid that stimulates mitophagy. The effects of UA's long-term treatment of AD and mechanisms of action are unknown. We addressed these questions in three mouse models of AD with behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches. Long-term UA treatment significantly improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in different AD transgenic mice. UA also reduced amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies and enhanced long-term potentiation. UA induced mitophagy via increasing lysosomal functions. UA improved cellular lysosomal function and normalized lysosomal cathepsins, primarily cathepsin Z, to restore lysosomal function in AD, indicating the critical role of cathepsins in UA-induced therapeutic effects on AD. Our study highlights the importance of lysosomal dysfunction in AD etiology and points to the high translational potential of UA. Long-term urolithin A (UA) treatment improved learning, memory, and olfactory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice.

The L-selenomethionine enantiomer is the main form of selenium found in Brazil nuts, cereal grains, soybeans, and grassland legumes, while Se-methylselenocysteine, or its γ-glutamyl derivative, is the major form of selenium found in Astragalus, Allium, and Brassica species. In vivo, selenomethionine is randomly incorporated instead of methionine. Selenomethionine is readily oxidized. Selenomethionine's antioxidant activity arises from its ability to deplete reactive oxygen species. Selenium and methionine also play separate roles in the formation and recycling of glutathione, a key endogenous antioxidant in many organisms, including humans. == Substitution chemistry issues == Selenium and sulfur are chalcogens that share many chemical properties so the substitution of methionine with selenomethionine may have only a limited effect on protein structure and function. However, the incorporation of selenomethionine into tissue proteins and keratin in cattle, birds, and fish causes alkali disease. Alkali disease is characterized by emaciation, loss of hair, deformation and shedding of hooves, loss of vitality, and erosion of the joints of long bones. Incorporation of selenomethionine into proteins in place of methionine aids the structure elucidation of proteins by X-ray crystallography using single- or multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD or MAD). The incorporation of heavy atoms such as selenium helps solve the phase problem in X-ray crystallography. == Dietary intake == Selenomethionine is readily available as a dietary supplement. It has been suggested by nutritionists that selenomethionine, as an organic form of selenium, is easier for the human body to absorb than selenite, which is an inorganic form. It was determined in a clinical trial that selenomethionine is absorbed 19% better than selenite. == See also == Selenocysteine, another selenium-containing amino acid, but one that is incorporated into specific locations of specific proteins as directed by the genetic code.

3005,"('Nitroxoline', 'Nitroxolin', 'Noxibiol', 'Nibiol', 'Noxin')",Medical,"Nitroxoline is an antibiotic that has been in use in Europe for about fifty years, and has proven to be very effective at combating biofilm infections. Nitroxoline was shown to cause a decrease in the biofilm density of P. aeruginosa infections, which would allow access to the infection by the immune system in vivo. It was shown that nitroxoline functions by chelating Fe2+ and Zn2+ ions from the biofilm matrix; when Fe2+ and Zn2+ were reintroduced into the system, biofilm formation activity was restored. The biofilm degradation ability is comparable to EDTA derivatives, but this drug has a history of human use in clinical settings and therefore has a precedent with which to allow its use against “slimy” biofilm infections. == Anticancer activity == The chelating activities of nitroxoline have also been used in an anticancer setting. Nitroxoline has been shown to be more cytotoxic to HL60, DHL-4, PANC-1, and A2780 cells lines than clioquinol and other 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives. It also demonstrated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu2+ was added. The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl2. The cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl2, indicating, based on this model, that nitroxoline is not a zinc chelator. Because the zinc chelating action of clioquinol has been associated with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy, the use of nitroxoline as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and in vivo trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects. Nitroxoline has been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of cathepsin B. Cathepsin B degrades extra-cellular membrane proteins in tumor cells, allowing them to proliferate more freely, and metastasize throughout the body. Nitroxoline was shown to be a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of these actions in MCF-10A neoT cells. The Ki (dissociation constant) values it demonstrates are comparable to other reversible inhibitors of cathepsin B. This indicates that it may be a candidate for further trials as an anticancer drug, especially given its history as an antimicrobial agent and its well-known pharmacokinetic profile. The mechanism of action by which nitroxoline inhibits cathepsin B may also suggest that further research of noncovalent, noncompetitive inhibitors of cathepsin B could be warranted. In fact, it was recently shown that a balance exists between the potency and the kinetics of a molecule, reflected in the molecular weight, which must be optimized in order to create the best drug for inhibition of a target enzyme. For example, a certain inhibitor may have a high affinity for an enzyme, but it may prove impractical to use in a clinical setting for treatment because of its size. Nitroxoline and its analogues have also been shown to have antiangiogenic properties. For example, nitroxoline inhibits MetAP2 activity, an enzyme associated with angiogenesis, and HUVEC proliferation. This is further evidence that nitroxoline would make an effective anticancer drug. With different derivatives of nitroxoline demonstrating various levels of inhibition, nitroxoline may also prove to be a novel starting point for future research into cancer treatment. == Balamuthia infection == In 2018, nitroxoline was identified via a clinical metagenomic next-generation sequencing analysis as a compound that could be repurposed as an amoebicidal agent against Balamuthia mandrillaris which causes the fatal disease granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). In 2021, a patient survived an infection of Balamuthia mandrillaris after treatment with nitroxoline. The man had been given the recommended drug therapy of pentamidine, sulfadiazine, azithromycin, fluconazole, flucytosine, and miltefosine but progressed negatively. Therefore the regime was complemented with nitroxoline which required the permission of the FDA as the drug isn't approved in the United States. The cerebral lesion shrank only one week later after the new drug was added and the man later recovered. == References ==",Noxin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0016925308154895902), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011137931607663631)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3006,"('Progesterone', 'Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione', 'Agolutin', 'Luteohormone', 'Crinone')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Progesterone (P4), sold under the brand name Prometrium among others, is a medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is a progestogen and is used in combination with estrogens mainly in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low sex hormone levels in women. It is also used in women to support pregnancy and fertility and to treat gynecological disorders. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, vaginally, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes. A progesterone vaginal ring and progesterone intrauterine device used for birth control also exist in some areas of the world. Progesterone is well tolerated and often produces few or no side effects. However, a number of side effects are possible, for instance mood changes. If progesterone is taken by mouth or at high doses, certain central side effects including sedation, sleepiness, and cognitive impairment can also occur. The medication is a naturally occurring progestogen and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), the biological target of progestogens like endogenous progesterone. It opposes the effects of estrogens in various parts of the body like the uterus and also blocks the effects of the hormone aldosterone. In addition, progesterone has neurosteroid effects in the brain. Progesterone was first isolated in pure form in 1934. It first became available as a medication later that year. Oral micronized progesterone (OMP), which allowed progesterone to be taken by mouth, was introduced in 1980. A large number of synthetic progestogens, or progestins, have been derived from progesterone and are used as medications as well. Examples include medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone. In 2022, it was the 125th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Menopause === Progesterone is used in combination with an estrogen as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women. It is used specifically to provide endometrial protection against unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with intact uteruses. A 2016 systematic review of endometrial protection with progesterone recommended 100 mg/day continuous oral progesterone, 200 mg/day cyclic oral progesterone, 45 to 100 mg/day cyclic vaginal progesterone, and 100 mg alternate-day vaginal progesterone. Twice-weekly 100 mg vaginal progesterone was also recommended, but more research is needed on this dose and endometrial monitoring may be advised. Transdermal progesterone was not recommended for endometrial protection. The REPLENISH trial was the first adequately powered study to show that continuous 100 mg/day oral progesterone with food provides adequate endometrial protection. Cyclic 200 mg/day oral progesterone has also been found to be effective in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia, for instance in the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial. However, the PEPI trial was not adequately powered to fully quantify endometrial hyperplasia or cancer risk. No adequately powered studies have assessed endometrial protection with vaginal progesterone. In any case, the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) found that cyclic 45 mg/day vaginal progesterone gel showed no significant difference from placebo in endometrial cancer rates. Due to the vaginal first-pass effect, low doses of vaginal progesterone may allow for adequate endometrial protection. Although not sufficiently powered, various other smaller studies have also found endometrial protection with oral or vaginal progesterone. There is inadequate evidence for endometrial protection with transdermal progesterone cream. Oral progesterone has been found to significantly reduce hot flashes relative to placebo. The combination of an estrogen and oral progesterone likewise reduces hot flashes. Estrogen plus oral progesterone has been found to significantly improve quality of life. The combination of an estrogen and 100 to 300 mg/day oral progesterone has been found to improve sleep outcomes. Moreover, sleep was improved to a significantly better extent than estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate. This may be attributable to the sedative neurosteroid effects of progesterone. Reduction of hot flashes may also help to improve sleep outcomes. Based on animal research, progesterone may be involved in sexual function in women. However, very limited clinical research suggests that progesterone does not improve sexual desire or function in women. The combination of an estrogen and oral progesterone has been found to improve bone mineral density (BMD) to a similar extent as an estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate. Progestogens, including progesterone, may have beneficial effects on bone independent of those of estrogens, although more research is required to confirm this notion. The combination of an estrogen and oral or vaginal progesterone has been found to improve cardiovascular health in women in early menopause but not in women in late menopause. Estrogen therapy has a favorable influence on the blood lipid profile, which may translate to improved cardiovascular health. The addition of oral or vaginal progesterone has neutral or beneficial effects on these changes. This is in contrast to various progestins, which are known to antagonize the beneficial effects of estrogens on blood lipids. Progesterone, both alone and in combination with an estrogen, has been found to have beneficial effects on skin and to slow the rate of skin aging in postmenopausal women. In the French E3N-EPIC observational study, the risk of diabetes was significantly lower in women on menopausal hormone therapy, including with the combination of an oral or transdermal estrogen and oral progesterone or a progestin. === Transgender women === Progesterone is used as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women in combination with estrogens and antiandrogens. However, the addition of progestogens to HRT for transgender women is controversial and their role is unclear. Some patients and clinicians believe anecdotally that progesterone may enhance breast development, improve mood, regulate sleep, and increase sex drive. However, there is a lack of evidence from well-designed studies to support these notions at present. In addition, progestogens can produce undesirable side effects, although bioidentical progesterone may be safer and better tolerated than synthetic progestogens like medroxyprogesterone acetate. Because some believe that progestogens are necessary for full breast development, progesterone is sometimes used in transgender women with the intention of enhancing breast development. However, a 2014 review concluded the following on the topic of progesterone for enhancing breast development in transgender women: Our knowledge concerning the natural history and effects of different cross-sex hormone therapies on breast development in [transgender] women is extremely sparse and based on low quality of evidence. Current evidence does not provide evidence that progestogens enhance breast development in [transgender] women. Neither do they prove the absence of such an effect. This prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion at this moment and demonstrates the need for further research to clarify these important clinical questions. Data on menstruating women shows there is no correlation between water retention, and levels of progesterone or estrogen. Despite this, some theorise progesterone might cause temporary breast enlargement due to local fluid retention, and may thus give a misleading appearance of breast growth. Aside from a hypothetical involvement in breast development, progestogens are not otherwise known to be involved in physical feminization. === Pregnancy support === Vaginally dosed progesterone is being investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women with a history of preterm birth. According to a recent study, women with a short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day during the second half of a pregnancy. A subsequent and larger study showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data in this trial showed that women with a short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care. In another trial, vaginal progesterone was shown to be better than placebo in reducing preterm birth prior to 34 weeks in women with an extremely short cervix at baseline. An editorial by Roberto Romero discusses the role of sonographic cervical length in identifying patients who may benefit from progesterone treatment. A meta-analysis published in 2011 found that vaginal progesterone cut the risk of premature births by 42 percent in women with short cervixes. The meta-analysis, which pooled published results of five large clinical trials, also found that the treatment cut the rate of breathing problems and reduced the need for placing a baby on a ventilator. === Fertility support === Progesterone is used for luteal support in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). It is also used to correct luteal phase deficiency to prepare the endometrium for implantation in infertility therapy and is used to support early pregnancy. === Birth control === A progesterone vaginal ring is available for birth control when breastfeeding in a number of areas of the world. An intrauterine device containing progesterone has also been marketed under the brand name Progestasert for birth control, including previously in the United States. === Gynecological disorders === Progesterone is used to control persistent anovulatory bleeding. === Other uses === Progesterone is of unclear benefit for the reversal of mifepristone-induced abortion. Evidence is insufficient to support use in traumatic brain injury. Progesterone has been used as a topical medication applied to the scalp to treat female and male pattern hair loss. Variable effectiveness has been reported, but overall its effectiveness for this indication in both sexes has been poor. ==== Breast pain ==== Progesterone is approved under the brand name Progestogel as a 1% topical gel for local application to the breasts to treat breast pain in certain countries. It is not approved for systemic therapy. It has been found in clinical studies to inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast epithelial cells and to abolish breast pain and tenderness in women with the condition. However, in one small study in women with cyclic breast pain it was ineffective. Vaginal progesterone has also been found to be effective in the treatment of breast pain and tenderness. ==== Premenstrual syndrome ==== Historically, progesterone has been widely used in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome. A 2012 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of progesterone for this indication. Another review of 10 studies found that progesterone was not effective for this condition, although it stated that insufficient evidence is available currently to make a definitive statement on progesterone in premenstrual syndrome. ==== Catamenial epilepsy ==== Progesterone can be used to treat catamenial epilepsy by supplementation during certain periods of the menstrual cycle. === Available forms === Progesterone is available in a variety of different forms, including oral capsules; sublingual tablets; vaginal capsules, tablets, gels, suppositories, and rings; rectal suppositories; oil solutions for intramuscular injection; and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection. A 1% topical progesterone gel is approved for local application to the breasts to treat breast pain, but is not indicated for systemic therapy. Progesterone was previously available as an intrauterine device for use in hormonal contraception, but this formulation was discontinued. Progesterone is also limitedly available in combination with estrogens such as estradiol and estradiol benzoate for use by intramuscular injection. In addition to approved pharmaceutical products, progesterone is available in unregulated custom compounded and over-the-counter formulations like systemic transdermal creams and other preparations. The systemic efficacy of transdermal progesterone is controversial and has not been demonstrated. == Contraindications == Contraindications of progesterone include hypersensitivity to progesterone or progestogens, prevention of cardiovascular disease (a Black Box warning), thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorder, cerebral hemorrhage, impaired liver function or disease, breast cancer, reproductive organ cancers, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, missed menstruations, miscarriage, or a history of these conditions. Progesterone should be used with caution in people with conditions that may be adversely affected by fluid retention such as epilepsy, migraine headaches, asthma, cardiac dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. It should also be used with caution in patients with anemia, diabetes mellitus, a history of depression, previous ectopic pregnancy, and unresolved abnormal Pap smear. Use of progesterone is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, the medication has been deemed usually safe in breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but should not be used during the first four months of pregnancy. Some progesterone formulations contain benzyl alcohol, and this may cause a potentially fatal ""gasping syndrome"" if given to premature infants. == Side effects == Progesterone is well tolerated, and many clinical studies have reported no side effects. Side effects of progesterone may include abdominal cramps, back pain, breast tenderness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, edema, vaginal bleeding, hypotension, fatigue, dysphoria, depression, and irritability, among others. Central nervous system depression, such as sedation and cognitive/memory impairment, can also occur. Vaginal progesterone may be associated with vaginal irritation, itchiness, and discharge, decreased libido, painful sexual intercourse, vaginal bleeding or spotting in association with cramps, and local warmth or a ""feeling of coolness"" without discharge. Intramuscular injection may cause mild-to-moderate pain at the site of injection. High intramuscular doses of progesterone have been associated with increased body temperature, which may be alleviated with paracetamol treatment. Progesterone lacks undesirable off-target hormonal activity, in contrast to various progestins. As a result, it is not associated with androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or glucocorticoid effects. Conversely, progesterone can still produce side effects related to its antimineralocorticoid and neurosteroid activity. Compared to the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate, there are fewer reports of breast tenderness with progesterone. In addition, the magnitude and duration of vaginal bleeding with progesterone are reported to be lower than with medroxyprogesterone acetate. === Central depression === Progesterone can produce central nervous system depression as an adverse effect, particularly with oral administration or with high doses of progesterone. These side effects may include drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, fatigue, sluggishness, reduced vigor, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, and cognitive, memory, and/or motor impairment. Limited available evidence has shown minimal or no adverse influence on cognition with oral progesterone (100–600 mg), vaginal progesterone (45 mg gel), or progesterone by intramuscular injection (25–200 mg). However, high doses of oral progesterone (300–1200 mg), vaginal progesterone (100–200 mg), and intramuscular progesterone (100–200 mg) have been found to result in dose-dependent fatigue, drowsiness, and decreased vigor. Moreover, high single doses of oral progesterone (1200 mg) produced significant cognitive and memory impairment. Intravenous infusion of high doses of progesterone (e.g., 500 mg) has been found to induce deep sleep in humans. Some individuals are more sensitive and can experience considerable sedative and hypnotic effects at lower doses of oral progesterone (e.g., 400 mg). Sedation and cognitive and memory impairment with progesterone are attributable to its inhibitory neurosteroid metabolites. These metabolites occur to a greater extent with oral progesterone, and may be minimized by switching to a parenteral route. Progesterone can also be taken before bed to avoid these side effects and to help with sleep. The neurosteroid effects of progesterone are unique to progesterone and are not shared with progestins. === Breast cancer === Breast cell proliferation has been found to be significantly increased by the combination of an oral estrogen plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate in postmenopausal women but not by the combination of transdermal estradiol plus oral progesterone. Studies of topical estradiol and progesterone applied to the breasts for 2 weeks have been found to result in highly pharmacological local levels of estradiol and progesterone. These studies have assessed breast proliferation markers and have found increased proliferation with estradiol alone, decreased proliferation with progesterone, and no change in proliferation with estradiol and progesterone combined. In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial, the combination of estrogen and cyclic oral progesterone resulted in a higher mammographic breast density than estrogen alone (3.1% vs. 0.9%) but a non-significantly lower breast density than the combination of estrogen and cyclic or continuous medroxyprogesterone acetate (3.1% vs. 4.4–4.6%). Higher breast density is a strong known risk factor for breast cancer. Other studies have had mixed findings however. A 2018 systematic review reported that breast density with an estrogen plus oral progesterone was significantly increased in three studies and unchanged in two studies. Changes in breast density with progesterone appear to be less than with the compared progestins. In large short-term observational studies, estrogen alone and the combination of estrogen and oral progesterone have generally not been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, the combination of estrogen and almost any progestin, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone acetate, has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The only exception among progestins is dydrogesterone, which has shown similar risk to that of oral progesterone. Breast cancer risk with estrogen and progestin therapy is duration-dependent, with the risk being significantly greater with more than 5 years of exposure relative to less than 5 years. In contrast to shorter-term studies, the longer-term observations (>5 years) of the French E3N study showed significant associations of both estrogen plus oral progesterone and estrogen plus dydrogesterone with higher breast cancer risk, similarly to estrogen plus other progestogens. Oral progesterone has very low bioavailability and has relatively weak progestogenic effects. The delayed onset of breast cancer risk with estrogen plus oral progesterone is potentially consistent with a weak proliferative effect of oral progesterone on the breasts. As such, a longer duration of exposure may be necessary for a detectable increase in breast cancer risk to occur. In any case, the risk remains lower than that with most progestins. A 2018 systematic review of progesterone and breast cancer concluded that short-term use (<5 years) of an estrogen plus progesterone is not associated with a significant increase in risk of breast cancer but that long-term use (>5 years) is associated with greater risk. The conclusions for progesterone were the same in a 2019 meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence by the Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer (CGHFBC). Most data on breast density changes and breast cancer risk are with oral progesterone. Data on breast safety with vaginal progesterone are scarce. The Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) was a randomized controlled trial of about 650 postmenopausal women who used estradiol and 45 mg/day cyclic vaginal progesterone. Incidence of breast cancer was reported as an adverse effect. The absolute incidences were 10 cases in the estradiol plus vaginal progesterone group and 8 cases in the control group. However, the study was not adequately powered for quantifying breast cancer risk. === Blood clots === Whereas the combination of estrogen and a progestin is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) relative to estrogen alone, there is no difference in risk of VTE with the combination of estrogen and oral progesterone relative to estrogen alone. Hence, in contrast to progestins, oral progesterone added to estrogen does not appear to increase coagulation or VTE risk. The reason for the differences between progesterone and progestins in terms of VTE risk are unclear. However, they may be due to very low progesterone levels and relatively weak progestogenic effects produced by oral progesterone. In contrast to oral progesterone, non-oral progesterone—which can achieve much higher progesterone levels—has not been assessed in terms of VTE risk. == Overdose == Progesterone is likely to be relatively safe in overdose. Levels of progesterone during pregnancy are up to 100-fold higher than during normal menstrual cycling, although levels increase gradually over the course of pregnancy. Oral dosages of progesterone of as high as 3,600 mg/day have been assessed in clinical trials, with the main side effect being sedation. There is a case report of progesterone misuse with an oral dosage of 6,400 mg per day. Administration of as much as 500 mg progesterone by intravenous infusion in humans was uneventful in terms of toxicity, but did induce deep sleep, though the individuals were still able to be awakened with sufficient stimulation. == Interactions == There are several notable drug interactions with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline may increase the GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3α-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride inhibit the conversion of progesterone into the inhibitory neurosteroid allopregnanolone, and for this reason, may have the potential to reduce the sedative and related effects of progesterone. Progesterone is a weak but significant agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), and has been found to induce several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, especially when concentrations are high, such as with pregnancy range levels. As such, progesterone may have the potential to accelerate the metabolism of various medications. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Progesterone is a progestogen, or an agonist of the nuclear progesterone receptors (PRs), the PR-A, PR-B, and PR-C. In addition, progesterone is an agonist of the membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs), including the mPRα, mPRβ, mPRγ, mPRδ, and mPRϵ. Aside from the PRs and mPRs, progesterone is a potent antimineralocorticoid, or antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, the biological target of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. In addition to its activity as a steroid hormone, progesterone is a neurosteroid. Among other neurosteroid activities, and via its active metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, progesterone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, the major signaling receptor of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The PRs are expressed widely throughout the body, including in the uterus, cervix, vagina, fallopian tubes, breasts, fat, skin, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and in other areas of the brain. In accordance, progesterone has numerous effects throughout the body. Among other effects, progesterone produces changes in the female reproductive system, the breasts, and the brain. Progesterone has functional antiestrogenic effects due to its progestogenic activity, including in the uterus, cervix, and vagina. The effects of progesterone may influence health in both positive and negative ways. In addition to the aforementioned effects, progesterone has antigonadotropic effects due to its progestogenic activity, and can inhibit ovulation and suppress gonadal sex hormone production. The activities of progesterone besides those mediated by the PRs and mPRs are also of significance. Progesterone lowers blood pressure and reduces water and salt retention among other effects via its antimineralocorticoid activity. In addition, progesterone can produce sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, euphoric, amnestic, cognitive-impairing, motor-impairing, anticonvulsant, and even anesthetic effects via formation of sufficiently high concentrations of its neurosteroid metabolites and consequent GABAA receptor potentiation in the brain. There are differences between progesterones and progestins, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone, with implications for pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, as well as for efficacy, tolerability, and safety. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of progesterone are dependent on its route of administration. The medications is approved in the form of oil-filled capsules containing micronized progesterone for oral administration, termed oral micronized progesterone or OMP. It is also available in the form of vaginal or rectal suppositories or pessaries, topical creams and gels, oil solutions for intramuscular injection, and aqueous solutions for subcutaneous injection. Routes of administration that progesterone has been used by include oral, intranasal, transdermal/topical, vaginal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenous injection. Vaginal progesterone is available in the form of progesterone capsules, tablets or inserts, gels, suppositories or pessaries, and rings. The bioavailability of progesterone was commonly overestimated due to the immunoassay method of analysis failing to distinguish between progesterone itself and its metabolites. Newer methods have adjusted the oral bioavailbility estimate from 6.2 to 8.6% down to less than 2.4%. == Chemistry == Progesterone is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid and is also known as pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. It has a double bond (4-ene) between the C4 and C5 positions and two ketone groups (3,20-dione), one at the C3 position and the other at the C20 position. Due to its pregnane core and C4(5) double bond, progesterone is often abbreviated as P4. It is contrasted with pregnenolone, which has a C5(6) double bond and is often abbreviated as P5. === Derivatives === A large number of progestins, or synthetic progestogens, have been derived from progesterone. They can be categorized into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. The progesterone ethers quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) and progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether are among the only examples that do not belong to any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone. A variety of synthetic inhibitory neurosteroids have been derived from progesterone and its neurosteroid metabolites, allopregnanolone and pregnanolone. Examples include alfadolone, alfaxolone, ganaxolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, and renanolone. In addition, C3 and C20 conjugates of progesterone, such as progesterone carboxymethyloxime (progesterone 3-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime; P4-3-CMO), P1-185 (progesterone 3-O-(L-valine)-E-oxime), EIDD-1723 (progesterone 20E-[O-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]oxime] sodium salt), EIDD-036 (progesterone 20-oxime; P4-20-O), and VOLT-02 (chemical structure unreleased), have been developed as water-soluble prodrugs of progesterone and its neurosteroid metabolites. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of progesterone have been published. == History == === Discovery and synthesis === The hormonal action of progesterone was discovered in 1929. Pure crystalline progesterone was isolated in 1934 and its chemical structure was determined. Later that year, chemical synthesis of progesterone was accomplished. Shortly following its chemical synthesis, progesterone began being tested clinically in women. === Injections and implants === In 1933 or 1934, Schering introduced progesterone in oil solution as a medication by intramuscular injection under the brand name Proluton. This was the first pharmaceutical formulation of progesterone to be marketed for medical use. It was initially a corpus luteum extract, becoming pure synthesized progesterone only subsequently. A clinical study of the formulation was published in 1933. Multiple formulations of progesterone in oil solution for intramuscular injection, under the brand names Proluton, Progestin, and Gestone, were available by 1936. A parenteral route was used because oral progesterone had very low activity and was thought to be inactive. Progesterone was initially very expensive due to the large doses required. However, with the start of steroid manufacturing from diosgenin in the 1940s, costs greatly decreased. Subcutaneous pellet implants of progesterone were first studied in women in the late 1930s. They were the first long-acting progestogen formulation. Pellets were reported to be extruded out of the skin within a few weeks at high rates, even when implanted beneath the deep fascia, and also produced frequent inflammatory reactions at the site of implantation. In addition, they were absorbed too slowly and achieved unsatisfactorily low progesterone levels. Consequently, they were soon abandoned, in favor of other preparations such as aqueous suspensions. However, subcutaneous pellet implants of progesterone were later studied as a form of birth control in women in the 1980s and early 1990s, though no preparations were ultimately marketed. Aqueous suspensions of progesterone crystals for intramuscular injection were first described in 1944. These preparations were on the market in the 1950s under a variety of brand names including Flavolutan, Luteosan, Lutocyclin M, and Lutren, among others. Aqueous suspensions of steroids were developed because they showed much longer durations than intramuscular injection of steroids in oil solution. However, local injection site reactions, which do not occur with oil solutions, have limited the clinical use of aqueous suspensions of progesterone and other steroids. Today, a preparation with the brand name Agolutin Depot remains on the market in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. A combined preparation of progesterone, estradiol benzoate, and lidocaine remains available with the brand name Clinomin Forte in Paraguay as well. In addition to aqueous suspensions, water-in-oil emulsions of steroids were studied by 1949, and long-acting emulsions of progesterone were introduced for use by intramuscular injection under the brand names Progestin and Di-Pro-Emulsion (with estradiol benzoate) by the 1950s. Due to lack of standardization of crystal sizes, crystalline suspensions of steroids had marked variations in effect. Emulsions were said to be even more unreliable. Macrocrystalline aqueous suspensions of progesterone as well as microspheres of progesterone were investigated as potential progestogen-only injectable contraceptives and combined injectable contraceptives (with estradiol) by the late 1980s and early 1990s but were never marketed. Aqueous solutions of water-insoluble steroids were first developed via association with colloid solubility enhancers in the 1940s. An aqueous solution of progesterone for use by intravenous injection was marketed by Schering AG under the brand name Primolut Intravenous by 1962. One of its intended uses was the treatment of threatened abortion, in which rapid-acting effect was desirable. An aqueous solution of progesterone complexed with cyclodextrin to increase its water solubility was introduced for use by once-daily subcutaneous injection in Europe under the brand name Prolutex in the mid-2010s. In the 1950s, long-acting parenteral progestins such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and norethisterone enanthate were developed and introduced for use by intramuscular injection. They lacked the need for frequent injections and the injection site reactions associated with progesterone by intramuscular injection and soon supplanted progesterone for parenteral therapy in most cases. === Oral and sublingual === The first study of oral progesterone in humans was published in 1949. It found that oral progesterone produced significant progestational effects in the endometrium in women. Prior to this study, animal research had suggested that oral progesterone was inactive, and for this reason, oral progesterone had never been evaluated in humans. A variety of other early studies of oral progesterone in humans were also published in the 1950s and 1960s. These studies generally reported oral progesterone to be only very weakly active. Oral non-micronized progesterone was introduced as a pharmaceutical medication around 1953, for instance as Cyclogesterin (1 mg estrogenic substances and 30 mg progesterone tablets) for menstrual disturbances by Upjohn, though it saw limited use. Another preparation, which contained progesterone alone, was Synderone (trademark registered by Chemical Specialties in 1952). Sublingual progesterone in women was first studied in 1944 by Robert Greenblatt. Buccal progesterone tablets were marketed by Schering under the brand name Proluton Buccal Tablets by 1949. Sublingual progesterone tablets were marketed under the brand names Progesterone Lingusorbs and Progesterone Membrettes by 1951. A sublingual tablet formulation of progesterone has been approved under the brand name Luteina in Poland and Ukraine and remains marketed today. Progesterone was the first progestogen that was found to inhibit ovulation, both in animals and in women. Injections of progesterone were first shown to inhibit ovulation in animals between 1937 and 1939. Inhibition of fertilization by administration of progesterone during the luteal phase was also demonstrated in animals between 1947 and 1949. Ovulation inhibition by progesterone in animals was subsequently re-confirmed and expanded on by Gregory Pincus and colleagues in 1953 and 1954. Findings on inhibition of ovulation by progesterone in women were first presented at the Fifth International Conference on Planned Parenthood in Tokyo, Japan in October 1955. Three different research groups presented their findings on this topic at the conference. They included Pincus (in conjunction with John Rock, who did not attend the conference); a nine-member Japanese group led by Masaomi Ishikawa; and the two-member team of Abraham Stone and Herbert Kupperman. The conference marked the beginning of a new era in the history of birth control. The results were subsequently published in scientific journals in 1956 in the case of Pincus and in 1957 in the case of Ishikawa and colleagues. Rock and Pincus also subsequently described findings from 1952 that ""pseudopregnancy"" therapy with a combination of high doses of diethylstilbestrol and oral progesterone prevented ovulation and pregnancy in women. Unfortunately, the use of oral progesterone as a hormonal contraceptive was plagued by problems. These included the large and by extension expensive doses required, incomplete inhibition of ovulation even at high doses, and a frequent incidence of breakthrough bleeding. At the 1955 Tokyo conference, Pincus had also presented the first findings of ovulation inhibition by oral progestins in animals, specifically 19-nortestosterone derivatives like noretynodrel and norethisterone. These progestins were far more potent than progesterone, requiring much smaller doses orally. By December 1955, inhibition of ovulation by oral noretynodrel and norethisterone had been demonstrated in women. These findings as well as results in animals were published in 1956. Noretynodrel and norethisterone did not show the problems associated with oral progesterone—in the studies, they fully inhibited ovulation and did not produce menstruation-related side effects. Consequently, oral progesterone was abandoned as a hormonal contraceptive in women. The first birth control pills to be introduced were a noretynodrel-containing product in 1957 and a norethisterone-containing product in 1963, followed by numerous others containing a diversity of progestins. Progesterone itself has never been introduced for use in birth control pills. More modern clinical studies of oral progesterone demonstrating elevated levels of progesterone and end-organ responses in women, specifically progestational endometrial changes, were published between 1980 and 1983. Up to this point, many clinicians and researchers apparently still thought that oral progesterone was inactive. It was not until almost half a century after the introduction of progesterone in medicine that a reasonably effective oral formulation of progesterone was marketed. Micronization of progesterone and suspension in oil-filled capsules, which allowed progesterone to be absorbed several-fold more efficiently by the oral route, was first studied in the late 1970s and described in the literature in 1982. This formulation, known as oral micronized progesterone (OMP), was then introduced for medical use under the brand name Utrogestan in France in 1982. Subsequently, oral micronized progesterone was introduced under the brand name Prometrium in the United States in 1998. By 1999, oral micronized progesterone had been marketed in more than 35 countries. In 2019, the first combination of oral estradiol and progesterone was introduced under the brand name Bijuva in the United States. A sustained-release (SR) formulation of oral micronized progesterone, also known as ""oral natural micronized progesterone sustained release"" or ""oral NMP SR"", was marketed in India in 2012 under the brand name Gestofit SR. Many additional brand names followed. The preparation was originally developed in 1986 by a compounding pharmacy called Madison Pharmacy Associates in Madison, Wisconsin in the United States. === Vaginal, rectal, and uterine === Vaginal progesterone suppositories were first studied in women by Robert Greenblatt in 1954. Shortly thereafter, vaginal progesterone suppositories were introduced for medical use under the brand name Colprosterone in 1955. Rectal progesterone suppositories were first studied in men and women by Christian Hamburger in 1965. Vaginal and rectal progesterone suppositories were introduced for use under the brand name Cyclogest by 1976. Vaginal micronized progesterone gels and capsules were introduced for medical use under brand names such as Utrogestan and Crinone in the early 1990s. Progesterone was approved in the United States as a vaginal gel in 1997 and as a vaginal insert in 2007. A progesterone contraceptive vaginal ring known as Progering was first studied in women in 1985 and continued to be researched through the 1990s. It was approved for use as a contraceptive in lactating mothers in Latin America by 2004. A second progesterone vaginal ring known as Fertiring was developed as a progesterone supplement for use during assisted reproduction and was approved in Latin America by 2007. Development of a progesterone-containing intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception began in the 1960s. Incorporation of progesterone into IUDs was initially studied to help reduce the risk of IUD expulsion. However, while addition of progesterone to IUDs showed no benefit on expulsion rates, it was unexpectedly found to induce endometrial atrophy. This led in 1976 to the development and introduction of Progestasert, a progesterone-containing product and the first progestogen-containing IUD. Unfortunately, the product had various problems that limited its use. These included a short duration of efficacy of only one year, a high cost, a relatively high 2.9% failure rate, a lack of protection against ectopic pregnancy, and difficult and sometimes painful insertions that could necessitate use of a local anesthetic or analgesic. As a result of these issues, Progestasert never became widely used, and was discontinued in 2001. It was used mostly in the United States and France while it was marketed. === Transdermal and topical === A topical gel formulation of progesterone, for direct application to the breasts as a local therapy for breast disorders such as breast pain, was introduced under the brand name Progestogel in Europe by 1972. No transdermal formulations of progesterone for systemic use have been successfully marketed, in spite of efforts of pharmaceutical companies towards this goal. The low potency of transdermal progesterone has thus far precluded it as a possibility. Although no formulations of transdermal progesterone are approved for systemic use, transdermal progesterone is available in the form of creams and gels from custom compounding pharmacies in some countries, and is also available over-the-counter without a prescription in the United States. However, these preparations are unregulated and have not been adequately characterized, with low and unsubstantiated effectiveness. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Progesterone is the generic name of the drug in English and its INNTooltip INN, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while progestérone is its name in French and its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also referred to as progesteronum in Latin, progesterona in Spanish and Portuguese, and progesteron in German. === Brand names === Progesterone is marketed under a large number of brand names throughout the world. Examples of major brand names under which progesterone has been marketed include Crinone, Crinone 8%, Cyclogest, Endogest, Endometrin, Estima, Geslutin, Gesterol, Gestone, Luteina, Luteinol, Lutigest, Lutinus, Microgest, Progeffik, Progelan, Progendo, Progering, Progest, Progestaject, Progestan, Progesterone, Progestin, Progestogel, Prolutex, Proluton, Prometrium, Prontogest, Strone, Susten, Utrogest, and Utrogestan. === Availability === Progesterone is widely available in countries throughout the world in a variety of formulations. Progesterone in the form of oral capsules; vaginal capsules, tablets/inserts, and gels; and intramuscular oil have widespread availability. The following formulations/routes of progesterone have selective or more limited availability: A tablet of micronized progesterone which is marketed under the brand name Luteina is indicated for sublingual administration in addition to vaginal administration and is available in Poland and Ukraine. A progesterone suppository which is marketed under the brand name Cyclogest is indicated for rectal administration in addition to vaginal administration and is available in Cyprus, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Malta, Oman, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. An aqueous solution of progesterone complexed with β-cyclodextrin for subcutaneous injection is marketed under the brand name Prolutex in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, and Switzerland. A non-systemic topical gel formulation of progesterone for local application to the breasts to treat breast pain is marketed under the brand name Progestogel and is available in Belgium, Bulgaria, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Georgia, Germany, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Peru, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Switzerland, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Vietnam. It was also formerly available in Italy, Portugal, and Spain, but was discontinued in these countries. A progesterone intrauterine device was previously marketed under the brand name Progestasert and was available in Canada, France, the United States, and possibly other countries, but was discontinued.

An oral combination formulation of micronized progesterone and estradiol in oil-filled capsules (brand name Bijuva) is marketed in the United States for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and endometrial hyperplasia. Progesterone is also available in unregulated custom preparations from compounding pharmacies in the United States. In addition, transdermal progesterone is available over-the-counter in the United States, although the clinical efficacy of transdermal progesterone is controversial. == Research == Progesterone was studied as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive, but was never marketed. Combinations of estradiol and progesterone as a macrocrystalline aqueous suspension and as an aqueous suspension of microspheres have been studied as once-a-month combined injectable contraceptives, but were likewise never marketed. Progesterone has been assessed for the suppression of sex drive and spermatogenesis in men. In one study, 100 mg rectal suppositories of progesterone given five times per day for 9 days resulted in progesterone levels of 5.5 to 29 ng/mL and suppressed circulating testosterone and growth hormone levels by about 50% in men, but did not affect libido or erectile potency in this short treatment period. In other studies, 50 mg/day progesterone by intramuscular injection for 10 weeks in men produced azoospermia, decreased testicular size, markedly suppressed libido and erectile potency, and resulted in minimal semen volume upon ejaculation. An oil and water nanoemulsion of progesterone (particles of <1 mm in diameter) using micellar nanoparticle technology for transdermal administration known as Progestsorb NE was under development by Novavax for use in menopausal hormone therapy in the 2000s. However, development was discontinued in 2007 and the formulation was never marketed. == References == == Further reading ==",Crinone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007454255828633904), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.005787994246929884), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.06199584901332855), ('ĠEND', -0.0022845377679914236), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03843381628394127)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.25193509459495544), (' PERSONAL', -0.004078401252627373), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/crinone.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Crinone: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/crinone.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3008,"('Methicillin (sodium salt)', 'Meticillin (sodium)', 'Methicillin', 'Meticillin', 'Methycillin')",Medical,"Methicillin (USAN), also known as meticillin (INN), is a narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. Methicillin was discovered in 1960. == Medical uses == Compared to other penicillins that face antimicrobial resistance due to β-lactamase, it is less active, can be administered only parenterally, and has a higher frequency of interstitial nephritis, an otherwise-rare adverse effect of penicillins. However, selection of methicillin depended on the outcome of susceptibility testing of the sampled infection, and since it is no longer produced, it is also not routinely tested for any more. It also served a purpose in the laboratory to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus to other penicillins facing β-lactam resistance; this role has now been passed on to other penicillins, namely cloxacillin, as well as genetic testing for the presence of mecA gene by PCR. === Spectrum of activity === At one time, methicillin was used to treat infections caused by certain gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin is only effective against Staphylococcus aureus 50% of the time. Resistance to methicillin is conferred by activation of a new bacterial penicillin binding protein (PBP) mecA gene. This encodes protein PBP2a. PBP2a works in a similar manner to other PBPs, but it binds β-lactams with very low affinity, meaning they do not compete efficiently with the natural substrate of the enzyme and will not inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. Expression of PBPA2 confers resistance to all β-lactams. These susceptibility data are given on a few medically significant bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus: 0.125 – >100 μg/ml Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): 15.6 – >1000 μg/ml Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.39 μg/ml == Mechanism of action == Like other beta-lactam antibiotics, methicillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. It does this by binding to and competitively inhibiting the transpeptidase enzyme (also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)). These PBPs crosslink glycopeptides (D-alanyl-alanine), forming the peptidoglycan cell wall. Methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics are structural analogs of D-alanyl-alanine, and the transpeptidase enzymes that bind to them are sometimes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Methicillin is actually a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic. Penicillinase is a bacterial enzyme produced by bacteria resistant to other β-lactam antibiotics which hydrolyses the antibiotic, rendering it non-functional. Methicillin is not bound and hydrolysed by penicillinase, meaning it can kill the bacteria, even if this enzyme is present. == Medicinal chemistry == Methicillin is resistant to beta-lactamases, which are enzymes secreted by many beta-lactam antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The presence of the ortho-dimethoxyphenyl group directly attached to the side-chain carbonyl group of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase resistance, since those enzymes are relatively intolerant of side-chain steric hindrance. Thus, it is able to bind to PBPs and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but it is not bound by nor inactivated by β-lactamases. == History == Methicillin was developed by Beecham in 1959. It was previously used to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, in particular, penicillinase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus that would otherwise be resistant to most penicillins. Its role in therapy has been largely replaced by oxacillin (used for clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing), flucloxacillin and dicloxacillin, but the term methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues to be used to describe S. aureus strains resistant to all penicillins. == References ==",Methycillin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.500529267825186e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001520311925560236)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/methycillin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=6, title='Methycillin: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/methycillin?utm_source=openai')])"

It has undergone Phase III clinical trials to determine its place in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease. This paper reviews the available history, pharmacology and preclinical and clinical trial data of succinobucol. Data were compiled following review of publications indexed in Medline and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, industry media releases and relevant bibliographies. In preclinical studies, succinobucol exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic and antiplatelet properties; however, these effects have not resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular clinical end points in clinical trials. Although proposed antihyperglycemic effects are being investigated, safety concerns and lack of clear cardiovascular benefit may limit its clinical use as an antihyperglycemic agent. Succinobucol is a phenolic antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. Given the importance of oxidant stress in modulating platelet-platelet and platelet-vessel wall interactions, the aim of this study was to establish if antioxidant activity was responsible for the antiplatelet activity of succinobucol. Platelet aggregation in response to collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was studied in rabbit whole blood and platelet-rich plasma using impedance aggregometry. The effect of oxidant stress on aggregation, platelet lipid peroxides, and vascular tone was studied by incubating platelets, washed platelets or preconstricted rabbit iliac artery rings respectively with a combination of xanthine and xanthine oxidase (X/XO). To study the effect of succinobucol in vivo, anaesthetized rats were injected with up to 150 mg/kg succinobucol and aggregation measured in blood removed 15 mins later. Succinobucol (10 Probucol inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo, and the drug reduces intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis in animals via induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Because the succinyl ester of probucol, succinobucol, recently failed as an antiatherogenic drug in humans, we investigated its effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation. Succinobucol and probucol induced HO-1 and decreased cell proliferation in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. However, whereas inhibition of HO-1 reversed the antiproliferative effects of probucol, this was not observed with succinobucol. Instead, succinobucol but not probucol induced caspase activity and apoptosis, and it increased mitochondrial oxidation of hydroethidine to ethidium, suggestive of the participation of H(2)O(2) and cytochrome c. Also, succinobucol but not probucol converted cytochrome c into a peroxidase in the presence of H(2)O(2), and succinobucol-induced apoptosis was decreased in cells that lacked cytochrome c or a functional mitochondrial complex II. In addition, succinobucol increased apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo after balloon angioplasty-mediated vascular injury. Our results suggest that succinobucol induces apoptosis via a pathway involving mitochondrial complex II, H(2)O(2), and cytochrome c.

3011,"('Atropine', 'Tropine tropate', 'Hyoscyamine', 'Atropin', 'Atropen')",Medical,"Atropine is a tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic medication used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate, and to decrease saliva production during surgery. It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Eye drops are also available which are used to treat uveitis and early amblyopia. The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour. Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings. Common side effects include dry mouth, abnormally large pupils, urinary retention, constipation, and a fast heart rate. It should generally not be used in people with closed-angle glaucoma. While there is no evidence that its use during pregnancy causes birth defects, this has not been well studied so sound clinical judgment should be used. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. It is an antimuscarinic (a type of anticholinergic) that works by inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system. Atropine occurs naturally in a number of plants of the nightshade family, including deadly nightshade (belladonna), datura, and mandrake. It was first isolated in 1833, It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Eyes === Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination. In refractive and accommodative amblyopia, when occlusion is not appropriate sometimes atropine is given to induce blur in the good eye. Evidence suggests that atropine penalization is just as effective as occlusion in improving visual acuity. Antimuscarinic topical medication is effective in slowing myopia progression in children; accommodation difficulties and papillae and follicles are possible side effects. All doses of atropine appear similarly effective, while higher doses have greater side effects. The lower dose of 0.01% is thus generally recommended due to fewer side effects and potential less rebound worsening when the atropine is stopped. === Heart === Injections of atropine are used in the treatment of symptomatic or unstable bradycardia. Atropine was previously included in international resuscitation guidelines for use in cardiac arrest associated with asystole and PEA but was removed from these guidelines in 2010 due to a lack of evidence for its effectiveness. For symptomatic bradycardia, the usual dosage is 0.5 to 1 mg IV push; this may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes, up to a total dose of 3 mg (maximum 0.04 mg/kg). Atropine is also useful in treating second-degree heart block Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach block), and also third-degree heart block with a high Purkinje or AV-nodal escape rhythm. It is usually not effective in second-degree heart block Mobitz type 2, and in third-degree heart block with a low Purkinje or ventricular escape rhythm. Atropine has also been used to prevent a low heart rate during intubation of children; however, the evidence does not support this use. === Secretions === Atropine's actions on the parasympathetic nervous system inhibit salivary and mucous glands. The drug may also inhibit sweating via the sympathetic nervous system. This can be useful in treating hyperhidrosis, and can prevent the death rattle of dying patients. Even though atropine has not been officially indicated for either of these purposes by the FDA, it has been used by physicians for these purposes. === Poisonings === Atropine acts as an antagonist for organophosphate poisoning by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors caused by organophosphate insecticides and nerve agents, such as tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), and VX. Troops who are likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry autoinjectors with atropine and oxime, for rapid injection into the muscles of the thigh. In a developed case of nerve gas poisoning, maximum atropinization is desirable. Atropine is often used in conjunction with the oxime pralidoxime chloride. Some of the nerve agents attack and destroy acetylcholinesterase by phosphorylation, so the action of acetylcholine becomes excessive and prolonged. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) can be effective against organophosphate poisoning because it can re-cleave this phosphorylation. Atropine can be used to reduce the effect of the poisoning by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which would otherwise be overstimulated, by excessive acetylcholine accumulation. Atropine or diphenhydramine can be used to treat muscarine intoxication. Atropine was added to cafeteria salt shakers in an attempt to poison the staff of Radio Free Europe during the Cold War. === Irinotecan-induced diarrhea === Atropine has been observed to prevent or treat irinotecan induced acute diarrhea. == Side effects == Adverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, deliriant hallucinations, and excitation especially among the elderly. These latter effects are because atropine can cross the blood–brain barrier. Because of the hallucinogenic properties, some have used the drug recreationally, though this is potentially dangerous and often unpleasant. In overdoses, atropine is poisonous. Atropine is sometimes added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly antidiarrhea opioid drugs such as diphenoxylate or difenoxin, wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the antidiarrhea effects. Although atropine treats bradycardia (slow heart rate) in emergency settings, it can cause paradoxical heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5 mg), presumably as a result of central action in the CNS. One proposed mechanism for atropine's paradoxical bradycardia effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response. Atropine is incapacitating at doses of 10 to 20 mg per person. Its LD50 is estimated to be 453 mg per person (by mouth) with a probit slope of 1.8. The antidote to atropine is physostigmine or pilocarpine. A common mnemonic used to describe the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: ""hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter"". These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine), diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine. == Contraindications == It is generally contraindicated in people with glaucoma, pyloric stenosis, or prostatic hypertrophy, except in doses ordinarily used for preanesthesia. == Chemistry == Atropine, a tropane alkaloid, is an enantiomeric mixture of d-hyoscyamine and l-hyoscyamine, with most of its physiological effects due to l-hyoscyamine, the 3(S)-endo isomer of atropine. Its pharmacological effects are due to binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is an antimuscarinic agent. Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour and disappear rapidly from the blood with a half-life of 2 hours. About 60% is excreted unchanged in the urine, and most of the rest appears in the urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. Noratropine (24%), atropine-N-oxide (15%), tropine (2%), and tropic acid (3%) appear to be the major metabolites, while 50% of the administered dose is excreted as apparently unchanged atropine. No conjugates were detectable. Evidence that atropine is present as (+)-hyoscyamine was found, suggesting that stereoselective metabolism of atropine probably occurs. Effects on the iris and ciliary muscle may persist for longer than 72 hours. The most common atropine compound used in medicine is atropine sulfate (monohydrate) (C17H23NO3)2·H2SO4·H2O, the full chemical name is 1α H, 5α H-Tropan-3-α ol (±)-tropate(ester), sulfate monohydrate. == Pharmacology == In general, atropine counters the ""rest and digest"" activity of glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system, producing clinical effects such as increased heart rate and delayed gastric emptying. This occurs because atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine being the main neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Atropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor types M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. It is classified as an anticholinergic drug (parasympatholytic). In cardiac uses, it works as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, increasing firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) of the heart, opposes the actions of the vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases bronchial secretions. In the eye, atropine induces mydriasis by blocking the contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial iris dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. The vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that innervate the heart release acetylcholine (ACh) as their primary neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi subunit; therefore, vagal activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells. Increases in vagal activities to the SA node decrease the firing rate of the pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of the pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone in the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates. There is also some vagal innervation of the atrial muscle, and to a much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular contractility. Muscarinic receptor antagonists bind to muscarinic receptors thereby preventing ACh from binding to and activating the receptor. By blocking the actions of ACh, muscarinic receptor antagonists very effectively block the effects of vagal nerve activity on the heart. By doing so, they increase heart rate and conduction velocity. == History == The name atropine was coined in the 19th century, when pure extracts from the belladonna plant Atropa belladonna were first made. The medicinal use of preparations from plants in the nightshade family is much older however. Mandragora (mandrake) was described by Theophrastus in the fourth century B.C. for the treatment of wounds, gout, and sleeplessness, and as a love potion. By the first century A.D. Dioscorides recognized wine of mandrake as an anaesthetic for treatment of pain or sleeplessness, to be given before surgery or cautery. The use of nightshade preparations for anesthesia, often in combination with opium, persisted throughout the Roman and Islamic Empires and continued in Europe until superseded in the 19th century by modern anesthetics. Atropine-rich extracts from the Egyptian henbane plant (another nightshade) were used by Cleopatra in the last century B.C. to dilate the pupils of her eyes, in the hope that she would appear more alluring. Likewise in the Renaissance, women used the juice of the berries of the nightshade Atropa belladonna to enlarge their pupils for cosmetic reasons. This practice resumed briefly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in Paris. The pharmacological study of belladonna extracts was begun by the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge (1795–1867). In 1831, the German pharmacist Heinrich F. G. Mein (1799-1864) succeeded in preparing a pure crystalline form of the active substance, which was named atropine. The substance was first synthesized by German chemist Richard Willstätter in 1901. == Natural sources == Atropine is found in many members of the family Solanaceae. The most commonly found sources are Atropa belladonna (the deadly nightshade), Datura innoxia, D. wrightii, D. metel, and D. stramonium. Other sources include members of the genera Brugmansia (angel's trumpets) and Hyoscyamus. == Synthesis == Atropine can be synthesized by the reaction of tropine with tropic acid in the presence of hydrochloric acid. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of atropine starting from l-phenylalanine first undergoes a transamination forming phenylpyruvic acid which is then reduced to phenyl-lactic acid. Coenzyme A then couples phenyl-lactic acid with tropine forming littorine, which then undergoes a radical rearrangement initiated with a P450 enzyme forming hyoscyamine aldehyde. A dehydrogenase then reduces the aldehyde to a primary alcohol making (−)-hyoscyamine, which upon racemization forms atropine. == Society and culture == The species name ""belladonna"" ('beautiful woman' in Italian) comes from the original use of deadly nightshade to dilate the pupils of the eyes for cosmetic effect. Both atropine and the genus name for deadly nightshade derive from Atropos, one of the three Fates who, according to Greek mythology, chose how a person was to die. === Legal status === In March 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Ryjunea, intended for slowing the progression of myopia in children aged 3 to 14 years.

3012,"('Hyoscyamine', 'Daturine', 'Duboisine', 'Atropine', 'Tropine tropate')",Medical,"Atropine is a tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic medication used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate, and to decrease saliva production during surgery. It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Eye drops are also available which are used to treat uveitis and early amblyopia. The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour. Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings. Common side effects include dry mouth, abnormally large pupils, urinary retention, constipation, and a fast heart rate. It should generally not be used in people with closed-angle glaucoma. While there is no evidence that its use during pregnancy causes birth defects, this has not been well studied so sound clinical judgment should be used. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. It is an antimuscarinic (a type of anticholinergic) that works by inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system. Atropine occurs naturally in a number of plants of the nightshade family, including deadly nightshade (belladonna), datura, and mandrake. It was first isolated in 1833, It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Eyes === Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination. In refractive and accommodative amblyopia, when occlusion is not appropriate sometimes atropine is given to induce blur in the good eye. Evidence suggests that atropine penalization is just as effective as occlusion in improving visual acuity. Antimuscarinic topical medication is effective in slowing myopia progression in children; accommodation difficulties and papillae and follicles are possible side effects. All doses of atropine appear similarly effective, while higher doses have greater side effects. The lower dose of 0.01% is thus generally recommended due to fewer side effects and potential less rebound worsening when the atropine is stopped. === Heart === Injections of atropine are used in the treatment of symptomatic or unstable bradycardia. Atropine was previously included in international resuscitation guidelines for use in cardiac arrest associated with asystole and PEA but was removed from these guidelines in 2010 due to a lack of evidence for its effectiveness. For symptomatic bradycardia, the usual dosage is 0.5 to 1 mg IV push; this may be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes, up to a total dose of 3 mg (maximum 0.04 mg/kg). Atropine is also useful in treating second-degree heart block Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach block), and also third-degree heart block with a high Purkinje or AV-nodal escape rhythm. It is usually not effective in second-degree heart block Mobitz type 2, and in third-degree heart block with a low Purkinje or ventricular escape rhythm. Atropine has also been used to prevent a low heart rate during intubation of children; however, the evidence does not support this use. === Secretions === Atropine's actions on the parasympathetic nervous system inhibit salivary and mucous glands. The drug may also inhibit sweating via the sympathetic nervous system. This can be useful in treating hyperhidrosis, and can prevent the death rattle of dying patients. Even though atropine has not been officially indicated for either of these purposes by the FDA, it has been used by physicians for these purposes. === Poisonings === Atropine acts as an antagonist for organophosphate poisoning by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors caused by organophosphate insecticides and nerve agents, such as tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), and VX. Troops who are likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry autoinjectors with atropine and oxime, for rapid injection into the muscles of the thigh. In a developed case of nerve gas poisoning, maximum atropinization is desirable. Atropine is often used in conjunction with the oxime pralidoxime chloride. Some of the nerve agents attack and destroy acetylcholinesterase by phosphorylation, so the action of acetylcholine becomes excessive and prolonged. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) can be effective against organophosphate poisoning because it can re-cleave this phosphorylation. Atropine can be used to reduce the effect of the poisoning by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which would otherwise be overstimulated, by excessive acetylcholine accumulation. Atropine or diphenhydramine can be used to treat muscarine intoxication. Atropine was added to cafeteria salt shakers in an attempt to poison the staff of Radio Free Europe during the Cold War. === Irinotecan-induced diarrhea === Atropine has been observed to prevent or treat irinotecan induced acute diarrhea. == Side effects == Adverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, deliriant hallucinations, and excitation especially among the elderly. These latter effects are because atropine can cross the blood–brain barrier. Because of the hallucinogenic properties, some have used the drug recreationally, though this is potentially dangerous and often unpleasant. In overdoses, atropine is poisonous. Atropine is sometimes added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly antidiarrhea opioid drugs such as diphenoxylate or difenoxin, wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the antidiarrhea effects. Although atropine treats bradycardia (slow heart rate) in emergency settings, it can cause paradoxical heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5 mg), presumably as a result of central action in the CNS. One proposed mechanism for atropine's paradoxical bradycardia effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response. Atropine is incapacitating at doses of 10 to 20 mg per person. Its LD50 is estimated to be 453 mg per person (by mouth) with a probit slope of 1.8. The antidote to atropine is physostigmine or pilocarpine. A common mnemonic used to describe the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: ""hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter"". These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine), diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine. == Contraindications == It is generally contraindicated in people with glaucoma, pyloric stenosis, or prostatic hypertrophy, except in doses ordinarily used for preanesthesia. == Chemistry == Atropine, a tropane alkaloid, is an enantiomeric mixture of d-hyoscyamine and l-hyoscyamine, with most of its physiological effects due to l-hyoscyamine, the 3(S)-endo isomer of atropine. Its pharmacological effects are due to binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is an antimuscarinic agent. Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour and disappear rapidly from the blood with a half-life of 2 hours. About 60% is excreted unchanged in the urine, and most of the rest appears in the urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. Noratropine (24%), atropine-N-oxide (15%), tropine (2%), and tropic acid (3%) appear to be the major metabolites, while 50% of the administered dose is excreted as apparently unchanged atropine. No conjugates were detectable. Evidence that atropine is present as (+)-hyoscyamine was found, suggesting that stereoselective metabolism of atropine probably occurs. Effects on the iris and ciliary muscle may persist for longer than 72 hours. The most common atropine compound used in medicine is atropine sulfate (monohydrate) (C17H23NO3)2·H2SO4·H2O, the full chemical name is 1α H, 5α H-Tropan-3-α ol (±)-tropate(ester), sulfate monohydrate. == Pharmacology == In general, atropine counters the ""rest and digest"" activity of glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system, producing clinical effects such as increased heart rate and delayed gastric emptying. This occurs because atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine being the main neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Atropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor types M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. It is classified as an anticholinergic drug (parasympatholytic). In cardiac uses, it works as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, increasing firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) of the heart, opposes the actions of the vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases bronchial secretions. In the eye, atropine induces mydriasis by blocking the contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial iris dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. The vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that innervate the heart release acetylcholine (ACh) as their primary neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi subunit; therefore, vagal activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells. Increases in vagal activities to the SA node decrease the firing rate of the pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of the pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone in the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates. There is also some vagal innervation of the atrial muscle, and to a much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular contractility. Muscarinic receptor antagonists bind to muscarinic receptors thereby preventing ACh from binding to and activating the receptor. By blocking the actions of ACh, muscarinic receptor antagonists very effectively block the effects of vagal nerve activity on the heart. By doing so, they increase heart rate and conduction velocity. == History == The name atropine was coined in the 19th century, when pure extracts from the belladonna plant Atropa belladonna were first made. The medicinal use of preparations from plants in the nightshade family is much older however. Mandragora (mandrake) was described by Theophrastus in the fourth century B.C. for the treatment of wounds, gout, and sleeplessness, and as a love potion. By the first century A.D. Dioscorides recognized wine of mandrake as an anaesthetic for treatment of pain or sleeplessness, to be given before surgery or cautery. The use of nightshade preparations for anesthesia, often in combination with opium, persisted throughout the Roman and Islamic Empires and continued in Europe until superseded in the 19th century by modern anesthetics. Atropine-rich extracts from the Egyptian henbane plant (another nightshade) were used by Cleopatra in the last century B.C. to dilate the pupils of her eyes, in the hope that she would appear more alluring. Likewise in the Renaissance, women used the juice of the berries of the nightshade Atropa belladonna to enlarge their pupils for cosmetic reasons. This practice resumed briefly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in Paris. The pharmacological study of belladonna extracts was begun by the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge (1795–1867). In 1831, the German pharmacist Heinrich F. G. Mein (1799-1864) succeeded in preparing a pure crystalline form of the active substance, which was named atropine. The substance was first synthesized by German chemist Richard Willstätter in 1901. == Natural sources == Atropine is found in many members of the family Solanaceae. The most commonly found sources are Atropa belladonna (the deadly nightshade), Datura innoxia, D. wrightii, D. metel, and D. stramonium. Other sources include members of the genera Brugmansia (angel's trumpets) and Hyoscyamus. == Synthesis == Atropine can be synthesized by the reaction of tropine with tropic acid in the presence of hydrochloric acid. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of atropine starting from l-phenylalanine first undergoes a transamination forming phenylpyruvic acid which is then reduced to phenyl-lactic acid. Coenzyme A then couples phenyl-lactic acid with tropine forming littorine, which then undergoes a radical rearrangement initiated with a P450 enzyme forming hyoscyamine aldehyde.

3014,"('Lisinopril (dihydrate)', 'Lisinopril', 'Prinivil', 'Zestril', 'Linopril')",Medical,"Lisinopril is a medication belonging to the drug class of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, and heart attacks. For high blood pressure it is usually a first-line treatment. It is also used to prevent kidney problems in people with diabetes mellitus. Lisinopril is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Full effect may take up to four weeks to occur. Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, hyperkalemia (high blood potassium), and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby. Lisinopril works by inhibiting the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Lisinopril was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the third most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 82 million prescriptions. It is available in combination with amlodipine (as lisinopril/amlodipine) and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (as lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide). == Medical uses == Lisinopril is typically used for the treatment of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy and after acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). Lisinopril is part of the ACE inhibitors drug class. Lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, adjunctive therapy for heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. == Contraindications == Lisinopril is contraindicated in people who have a history of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic) or who have diabetes and are taking aliskiren. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, cough, nausea, and rash. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, hyperkalemia, and angioedema. Use is not recommended during the entire duration of pregnancy as it may harm the baby. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Animal and human data have revealed evidence of harm to the embryo and teratogenicity associated with ACE inhibitors. == Interactions == === Dental care === ACE-inhibitors like lisinopril are considered to be generally safe for people undergoing routine dental care, though the use of lisinopril prior to dental surgery is more controversial, with some dentists recommending discontinuation the morning of the procedure. People may present to dental care suspicious of an infected tooth, but the swelling around the mouth may be due to lisinopril-induced angioedema, prompting emergency and medical referral. == Pharmacology == Lisinopril is the lysine-analog of enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, it is not a prodrug, is not metabolized by the liver, and is excreted unchanged in the urine. === Mechanism of action === Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, meaning it blocks the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), preventing angiotensin I from being converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent direct vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of aldosterone release. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II results in relaxation of the arterioles. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II also reduces the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which allows the kidney to excrete sodium along with water into the urine and increases the retention of potassium ions. Specifically, this process occurs in the peritubular capillaries of the kidneys in response to a change in Starling forces. The inhibition of the RAAS system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations of lisinopril occur within about seven hours, although there was a trend to a small delay in time taken to reach peak serum concentrations in acute myocardial infarction patients. The peak effect of lisinopril is about 6 hours after administration for most people. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and the absorbed drug is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25% (reduced to 16% in people with New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) Class II–IV heart failure), with large interpatient variability (6 to 60%) at all doses tested (5 to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not affected by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats result in little or no accumulation in brain tissue. ==== Distribution ==== Lisinopril does not bind to proteins in the blood. It does not distribute as well in people with NYHA Class II–IV heart failure. ==== Elimination ==== Lisinopril leaves the body completely unchanged in the urine. The half-life of lisinopril is 12 hours, and is increased in people with kidney problems. While the plasma half-life of lisinopril has been estimated between 12 and 13 hours, the elimination half-life is much longer, at around 30 hours. The full duration of action is between 24 and 30 hours. Lisinopril is the only water-soluble member of the ACE inhibitor class and thus has no metabolism by the liver. === Chemistry === Pure lisinopril powder is white to off-white in color. Lisinopril is soluble in water (approximately 13 mg/L at room temperature), less soluble in methanol, and virtually insoluble in ethanol. == History == Captopril, the first ACE inhibitor, is a functional and structural analog of a peptide derived from the venom of the jararaca, a Brazilian pit viper (Bothrops jararaca). Enalapril is a derivative, designed by scientists at Merck to overcome the rash and bad taste caused by captopril.: 12–13 Enalapril is actually a prodrug; the active metabolite is enalaprilat. The di-acid metabolite of enalapril, enalaprilat, and its lysine analogue lisinopril are potent inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); they do not contain sulphydryl groups. Both drugs can be assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and by radioimmunoassay and plasma ACE inhibition remains stable under normal storage conditions. It is therefore possible to study their pharmacokinetics as well as their pharmacodynamic effects in humans. Enalaprilat and lisinopril as well as ACE activity have been measured in blood taken during the course of two studies of the effects of these drugs on blood pressure and autonomic responsiveness. Lisinopril is a synthetic peptide derivative of captopril. Scientists at Merck created lisinopril by systematically altering each structural unit of enalaprilat, substituting various amino acids. Adding lysine at one end of the drug turned out to have strong activity and adequate bioavailability when given orally; analogs of that compound resulted in lisinopril, which takes its name from the discovery of lysine. Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993. The discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company did not want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with Zeneca under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage aldose reductase inhibitor drug candidate, a potential diabetes treatment. Zeneca's marketing and brand name, ""Zestril"", turned out to be stronger than Merck's effort. The drug became a blockbuster for AstraZeneca (formed in 1998), with annual sales in 1999 of $1.2B. The US patents expired in 2002. Since then, lisinopril has been available under many brand names worldwide; it is also available in combination drugs with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (as lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide), and with calcium channel blocker amlodipine (as lisinopril/amlodipine). == Society and culture == === Legal status === In July 2016, an oral solution formulation of lisinopril was approved for use in the United States. == References == == Further reading ==",Linopril,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.1470757676288486e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00018094333063345402)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20141372084617615)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Natural agents derived from herbs or plants have become unparalleled resources for the discovery of novel drug candidates. Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, a well-known herbal medicine in China, occupies a very important position in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) with a long history of clinical application. Ginsenoside Rd is the active compound in P. ginseng known to have broad-spectrum pharmacological effects to reduce neurological damage that can lead to neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, cognitive impairment, and cerebral ischemia. To review and discuss the effects and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rd in the treatment of neurological diseases. The related information was compiled by the major scientific databases, such as Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Elsevier, ScienceDirect, PubMed, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and GeenMedical. Using 'Ginsenoside Rd', 'Ginsenosides', 'Anti-inflammation', 'Antioxidant', 'Apoptosis' and 'Neuroprotection' as keywords, the correlated literature was extracted and conducted from the databases mentioned above. Through summarizing the existing research progress, we found that the general effects of ginsenoside Rd are anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, inhibition of Ca Ginsenoside Rd is a promising natural neuroprotective agent. This review would contribute to the future development of ginsenoside Rd as a novel clinical candidate drug for treating neurological diseases. Ginsenoside Rd is an active ingredient in Panax ginseng CA Mey and can be absorbed into the adipose tissue. Adipokines play an important role in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the potential benefit of Rd on heart failure (HF) and the underlying mechanism associated with the crosstalk between adipocytes and cardiomyocytes remains to be illustrated. Here, the results identified that Rd improved cardiac function and inhibited cardiac pathological changes in transverse aortic constriction (TAC), coronary ligation (CAL) and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF mice. And Rd promoted the release of omentin from the adipose tissue and up-regulated omentin expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Further, Rd could increase TBK1 and AMPK phosphorylation in adipocytes. And also, the TBK1-AMPK signaling pathway regulated the expression of omentin in LPS-induced adipocytes. Moreover, the omentin mRNA expression was significantly decreased by TBK1 knockdown in LPS-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, molecular docking and SPR analysis confirmed that Rd had a certain binding ability with TBK1, and co-treatment with TBK1 inhibitors or TBK1 knockdown partially abolished the effect of Rd on increasing the omentin expression and the ratio of p-AMPK to AMPK in adipocytes. Moreover, we found that circulating omentin level diminished in the HF patients compared with healthy subjects. Meanwhile, the adipose tissue-specific overexpression of omentin improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial infarct size and ameliorated cardiac pathological features in CAL-induced HF mice. Consistently, exogenous omentin reduced mtROS levels and restored ΔψM to improve oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cardiomyocytes injury.

3019,"('Telmisartan', 'Micardis', 'Pritor', 'Kinzalmono', 'Semintra')",Medical,"Telmisartan, sold under the brand name Micardis among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and back pain. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor blocker and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Telmisartan was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 228th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is available in combination with hydrochlorothiazide as telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide; with cilnidipine as telmisartan/cilnidipine; and with amlodipine as telmisartan/amlodipine. == Medical uses == Telmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure.: 146 == Contraindications == Telmisartan is contraindicated during pregnancy. Telmisartan affects the renin–angiotensin system and can cause birth defects, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. It is not known whether the medication passes into breast milk. == Side effects == Side effects include tachycardia and bradycardia (fast or slow heartbeat), hypotension (low blood pressure) and edema (swelling of arms, legs, lips, tongue, or throat, the latter leading to breathing problems). Allergic reactions may also occur. == Interactions == Due to its mechanism of action, telmisartan increases blood potassium levels. Combination with potassium preparations or potassium-sparing diuretics could cause hyperkalaemia (excessive potassium levels). Combination with NSAIDs, especially in patients with impaired kidney function, has a risk of causing (usually reversible) kidney failure. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that shows high affinity for the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), with a binding affinity 3000 times greater for AT1 than AT2. In addition to blocking the renin–angiotensin system, telmisartan acts as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a central regulator of insulin and glucose metabolism. It is believed that telmisartan's dual mode of action may provide protective benefits against the vascular and renal damage caused by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).: 171 As a partial agonist, it activates the receptor by 25–30%. Clinical trials have shown that telmisartan increases insulin sensitivity, reduces cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and improves endothilial function; all these effects can be attributed to its activity on PPAR-γ. The kidney-protecting activity of telmisartan is attributed to both angiotensin II antagonism and improved endothelial function from PPAR-γ. Telmisartan's activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) receptor has prompted speculation around its potential as a sport doping agent as an alternative to GW 501516. Telmisartan activates PPAR-δ receptors in several tissues. In mice, this results in effects such as enhanced endurance. However, telmisartan does not improve the walking performance (6-minute walk distance) in people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease. Telmisartan activates PPAR-α in vitro. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly but to varying degrees absorbed from the gut. The average bioavailability is about 50% (42–100%). Food intake has no clinically relevant influence on the kinetics of telmisartan. Plasma protein binding is over 99.5%, mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. It has the longest half-life of any angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (24 hours) and the largest volume of distribution among ARBs (500 liters). Less than 3% of telmisartan is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver, and over 97% is eliminated in unchanged form via bile and faeces. == History == == Society and culture == Telmisartan is available as a generic medication. == Research == Telmisartan does not appear effective for slowing the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Telmisartan does not cause rapid cancer growth like the PPAR-δ agonist GW 501516, but whether it causes a change in cancer rates is disputed. Short-term use is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer over other ARB drugs, according to a large 2016 analysis of UK patients. A 2022 meta-analysis finds that a longer duration of taking ARBs (including telmisartan) is associated with an increase in cancer rates. Patients who have taken an ARB for more than 3 years appears 11% more likely to develop cancer. A 2023 large-scale study on Lebanese patients finds that taking ARBs reduces the incidence of cancer, with greater effects on those who have taken the drug for a long time. A 2021 Korean study and a 2012 Japanese study finds similar results. == References == == Further reading ==",Semintra,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004311460361350328), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.032142505049705505), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.010923351161181927)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.drugs.com/vet/semintra-telmisartan-oral-solution.html,https://www.basg.gv.at/marktbeobachtung/amtliche-nachrichten/detail/semintra-4-mg-ml-loesung-zum-eingeben-fuer-katzen,https://www.companimo.com/actualites/semintra-nouvelle-formulation-hypertension-feline.html ', [])"

3021,"('Amrinone', 'Inamrinone', 'Inocor', 'Wincoram', 'Cordemcura')",Medical,"Amrinone, also known as inamrinone, and sold as Inocor, is a pyridine phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor. It is a drug that may improve the prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure. Amrinone has been shown to increase the contractions initiated in the heart by high-gain calcium induced calcium release (CICR). The positive inotropic effect of amrinone is mediated by the selective enhancement of high-gain CICR, which contributes to the contraction of myocytes by phosphorylation through cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+ calmodulin kinase pathways. == Actions == Increases cardiac contractility, vasodilator. Acts by inhibiting the breakdown of both cAMP and cGMP by the phosphodiesterase (PDE3) enzyme. There is a long-standing controversy regarding whether the drug actually increases cardiac contractility in diseased myocardium (and therefore whether it is of any clinical use). The issue has been reviewed extensively by Dr Peter Wilmshurst, one of the first cardiologists and researchers to question the drug's efficacy. == PDE-III inhibition and cardiac function == PDE III is present in cardiac muscle, vascular smooth muscle and platelets. PDE III degrades the phosphodiester bond in cAMP to break it down. When PDE III is inhibited, cAMP cannot be inactivated. An increase in cAMP with the administration of amrinone in vascular smooth muscle produces vasodilation by facilitating calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a special type of smooth ER) and decreasing the calcium available for contraction. In myocytes, the increase of cAMP concentration increases in turn the activity of PKA; this kinase improves the Ca2+ inward current through the L-type Ca2+ channels, which leads to calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, giving rise to a calcium spark that triggers the contraction; this results in an inotropic effect. Furthermore, PKA phosphorylates and deactivates the phospholambans that inhibit SERCA, which is an enzymatic pump that, to terminate the contraction, removes the Ca2+ from the cytoplasm, stores it back in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and promotes the subsequent arterial relaxation as well, producing a lusitropic effect. Both inotropic and lusitropic effects justify the use of amrinone to treat heart failure. Amrinone decreases the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure while increasing cardiac output, as it functions as an arterial vasodilator and increases venous capacitance while decreasing venous return. There is a net decrease in myocardial wall tension, and O2 consumption when using amrinone. Amrinone also has beneficial effects during diastole in the left ventricle, including relaxation, compliance and filling in patients with congestive heart failure. == Indications == Short-term management of severe CHF (not used long term because of increased mortality, probably due to heart failure). == Effects in congestive heart failure == Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by a reduction in ventricular performance and abnormalities in peripheral circulation and organs. A reduced release of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF) causes a decrease in the stimulation of guanylate cyclase, and cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels fall in vascular smooth muscle. This impairs relaxation in the vasculature and is a part of the vicious cycle of CHF. Patients with CHF have a down-regulation of their β-1 adrenergic receptors which alters their ability to activate intracellular adenylate cyclase, which catalyzes cAMP formation. cAMP is the second messenger that controls the level of calcium available to allow the heart to contract. An IV administration of amrinone has been shown to increase cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV), while concurrently reducing the filling pressure of the left ventricle and decreasing the resistance in the peripheral vasculature. This does not lead to an increase in heart rate or blood pressure. The improvement in performance of the ventricles is likely to result from a direct stimulation of the depressed myocardium as well as a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. == Contraindications == Patients with aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or history of hypersensitivity to the drug. == Precautions == May increase myocardial ischemia. Blood pressure, pulse, and ECG should be constantly monitored. Amrinone should only be diluted with normal saline or 1/2 normal saline; no dextrose solutions should be used. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, should not be administered into an IV line delivering amrinone. == Side effects == Thrombocytopenia is the most prominent and dose-related side effect, but it is transient and asymptomatic. Nausea, diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, arrhythmias and fever are other adverse effects. == Amrinone discovery and progression == Early studies in patients with heart failure showed that amrinone produced short-term hemodynamic improvement, but had limited long-term clinical benefit. Some serious side effects of long term administration included sustained ventricular tachycardia resulting in circulatory collapse, worsening myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, and worsening congestive heart failure. Amrinone has good absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and has led to gastrointestinal upset when taken orally. The oral form of the drug is no longer in use. Currently, only acute intravenous administration takes place. The effects of amrinone vary widely with species and experimental condition; therefore, its inotropic effects are variable. A loss in sensitivity to phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors, including amrinone, has been observed in end stage heart failure in humans; other treatment options may be more useful for improvement in these stages. == Naming == Amrinone is the INN, while inamrinone is the United States Adopted Name, which was adopted in 2000 in an attempt to avoid confusion with amiodarone. == Synthesis == See also: Milrinone and Pelrinone. == References ==",Cordemcura,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.40457335114479065), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06669029593467712)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In prespecified interim analyses, zanubrutinib was superior to ibrutinib with respect to overall response (the primary end point). Data from the final analysis of progression-free survival are now available. We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL who had received at least one previous course of therapy to receive zanubrutinib or ibrutinib until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. In this final analysis, progression-free survival (a key secondary end point) was assessed with the use of a hierarchical testing strategy to determine whether zanubrutinib was noninferior to ibrutinib. If noninferiority was established, the superiority of zanubrutinib was assessed and claimed if the two-sided P value was less than 0.05.

The phase 3 ASPEN study compared the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib, a first-generation BTK inhibitor, with zanubrutinib, a novel highly selective BTK inhibitor, in patients with WM. Patients with MYD88L265P disease were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with ibrutinib or zanubrutinib. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or a very good partial response (VGPR) by independent review. Key secondary end points included major response rate (MRR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), disease burden, and safety. A total of 201 patients were randomized, and 199 received ≥1 dose of study treatment. No patient achieved a CR. Twenty-nine (28%) zanubrutinib patients and 19 (19%) ibrutinib patients achieved a VGPR, a nonstatistically significant difference (P = .09). MRRs were 77% and 78%, respectively. Median DOR and PFS were not reached; 84% and 85% of ibrutinib and zanubrutinib patients were progression free at 18 months. Atrial fibrillation, contusion, diarrhea, peripheral edema, hemorrhage, muscle spasms, and pneumonia, as well as adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, were less common among zanubrutinib recipients. Incidence of neutropenia was higher with zanubrutinib, although grade ≥3 infection rates were similar in both arms (1.2 and 1.1 events per 100 person-months). These results demonstrate that zanubrutinib and ibrutinib are highly effective in the treatment of WM, but zanubrutinib treatment was associated with a trend toward better response quality and less toxicity, particularly cardiovascular toxicity.",(¬±)-zanubrutinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.541770613286644e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000436091679148376)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-zanubrutinib-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-or-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma?utm_source=openai), [fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-zanubrutinib-waldenstroms-macroglobulinemia?utm_source=openai), [fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-zanubrutinib-marginal-zone-lymphoma?utm_source=openai), [fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-zanubrutinib-mantle-cell-lymphoma?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=657, start_index=9, title='FDA approves zanubrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-zanubrutinib-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-or-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=657, start_index=9, title='FDA approves zanubrutinib for Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-zanubrutinib-waldenstroms-macroglobulinemia?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=657, start_index=9, title='FDA grants accelerated approval to zanubrutinib for marginal zone lymphoma | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-zanubrutinib-marginal-zone-lymphoma?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=657, start_index=9, title='FDA grants accelerated approval to zanubrutinib for mantle cell lymphoma | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-zanubrutinib-mantle-cell-lymphoma?utm_source=openai')])"

Zanubrutinib is classified as a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. It is given by mouth. It was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2019. == Medical uses == Zanubrutinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, and for the treatment of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. It is also indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen. In January 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved zanubrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. In March 2024, FDA granted accelerated approval to zanubrutinib, in combination with obinutuzumab, for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. == Adverse Effects == The most common adverse effects (≥30%) are: decreased neutrophil count, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased platelet count, hemorrhage and musculoskeletal pain. == History == Efficacy was evaluated in BGB-3111-206 (NCT03206970), a phase II open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial of 86 participants with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who received at least one prior therapy. Zanubrutinib was given orally at 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was also assessed in BGB-3111-AU-003 (NCT02343120), a phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation, global, multicenter, single-arm trial of B‑cell malignancies, including 32 previously treated MCL participants treated with zanubrutinib administered orally at 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily. The primary efficacy outcome measure in both trials was overall response rate (ORR), as assessed by an independent review committee. In trial BGB-3111-206, FDG-PET scans were required and the ORR was 84% (95% CI: 74, 91), with a complete response rate of 59% (95% CI 48, 70) and a median response duration of 19.5 months (95% CI: 16.6, not estimable). In trial BGB-3111-AU-003, FDG-PET scans were not required and the ORR was 84% (95% CI: 67, 95), with a complete response rate of 22% (95% CI: 9, 40) and a median response duration of 18.5 months (95% CI: 12.6, not estimable). Trial 1 was conducted at 13 sites in China, and Trial 2 was conducted at 25 sites in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and South Korea. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted zanubrutinib priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designations. The FDA approved zanubrutinib in November 2019, and granted the application for Brukinsa to BeiGene USA Inc. In August 2021, the FDA approved zanubrutinib for the treatment of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in September 2021, for marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Zanubrutinib was investigated for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia in ASPEN (NCT03053440), a randomized, active control, open-label trial, comparing zanubrutinib and Ibrutinib in participants with MYD88 L265P mutation (MYD88MUT) WM. Participants in Cohort 1 (n=201) were randomized 1:1 to receive zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohort 2 enrolled participants with MYD88 wildtype (MYD88WT) or MYD88 mutation unknown WM (n=26 and 2, respectively) and received zanubrutinib 160 mg twice daily. Approval of zanubrutinib for marginal zone lymphoma is based on two open-label, multicenter, single-arm trials: BGB-3111-214 (NCT03846427), which evaluated 66 participants with MZL who received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy, and BGB-3111-AU-003 (NCT02343120), which included 20 participants with previously treated MZL. In March 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to zanubrutinib with obinutuzumab for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The regimen was evaluated in Study BGB-3111-212 (ROSEWOOD; NCT03332017), an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial that enrolled 217 adult participants with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic treatments. Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive either zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity plus obinutuzumab (ZO), or obinutuzumab alone. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 3 (range 2-11). The application was granted fast track and orphan drug designations. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In September 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Brukinsa, intended for the treatment of Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia.

We compared the obtained data with the effect of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) (a nonselective NOS inhibitor) and L-N(G)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL) (a relatively selective inhibitor of iNOS activity) on cells in this model. To investigate the involvement of an exogenous NO on IL-12 and TNF-α production we used NO donor-S-nitrosocaptopril (S-NO-Cap). The most potent inhibitor of NO generation was 1400 W. This compound also markedly increased IL-12 p40 secretion and decreased TNF-α release. L-NIL suppressed both NO and TNF-α production, but it did not change IL-12 p40 synthesis. The effect of L-NMMA on NO generation was weaker than other inhibitors. Moreover, it decreased TNF-α secretion slightly but not significantly. IL-12 p40 production by stimulated cells was inhibited by S-NO-Cap in a dose dependent manner, but no effect on TNF-α release was observed. The potency and selectivity of 1400 W as an inhibitor of iNOS and cytokine release modifier are encouraging for therapeutic use. Gastrointestinal inflammation has been associated with an increased generation of nitric oxide (NO) and the expression of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Using an experimental model of colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS), we sought to determine whether the administration of N-(3-(Aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W), a specific inhibitor of iNOS, has a beneficial action on the colonic injury. 1400W (0.4 and 2 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally from day 5 to 10 after intrarectal instillation of TNBS. TNBS led to colonic ulceration and inflammation, an increase of colonic myeloperoxidase activity and the expression of the calcium-independent NOS from days 1 to 15. 1400W reduced the macroscopic damage and the histological changes induced by TNBS as well as the calcium-independent NOS activity and myeloperoxidase activity determined over 30 min after sacrifice. These findings indicate that the expression of iNOS accounts for most of the damage caused by TNBS and that the administration of 1400W after the onset of colitis has a beneficial action on the colonic injury. It has been suggested that large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible NO synthase are involved in the mechanisms of neurotoxicity after cerebral ischaemia. We have recently demonstrated that inducible NO synthase was expressed within hours after rat forebrain slices were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether NO produced by inducible NO synthase contributes to tissue damage in this model, by using a new, highly selective, inhibitor of inducible NO synthase, N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine (1400W). We found that incubation with 1400W from the start of the oxygen-glucose deprivation period until the end of the experiment decreases tissue damage determined as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux 4 h after the oxygen-glucose deprivation period, the time at which inducible NO synthase expression is maximal in this model. This effect may be a result of direct inhibition of inducible NO synthase activity, raising the possibility of a clinical use of selective inhibitors of this NO synthase isoform in the management of cerebral ischaemia.",N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003648174926638603), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029762335121631622)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.probes-drugs.org/compound/PD008195/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24995119/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4068048/,https://www.chemnet.com/cas/en/180001-34-7/N-%5B3-%28Aminomethyl%29benzyl%5Dacetamidine.html,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=90721,https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/article/S0022-3565%2824%2929482-9/fulltext ', [])"

Here, we show that systemic administration of the selective FAAH inhibitor URB597 (cyclohexyl carbamic acid 3'-carbamoyl-biphenyl-3-yl ester; 0.3 mg/kg i.p.) increases anandamide levels in the brain of rats and wild-type mice but has no such effect in FAAH-null mutants. Moreover, URB597 enhances the hypothermic actions of anandamide (5 mg/kg i.p.) in wild-type mice but not in FAAH-null mice. In contrast, the FAAH inhibitor does not affect anandamide or OEA levels in the rat duodenum at doses that completely inhibit FAAH activity. In addition, URB597 does not alter the hypophagic response elicited by OEA (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.), which is mediated by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type-alpha. Finally, exogenously administered OEA (5 mg/kg i.p.) was eliminated at comparable rates in wild-type and FAAH-/- mice.

3026,"('Leucine', '(r)-leucine', 'H-d-leu-oh', '(2r)-2-amino-4-methylpentanoic acid', 'Leucine, d-')","Food, Medical","Leucine (symbol Leu or L) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Leucine is an α-amino acid, meaning it contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isobutyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, and beans and other legumes. It is encoded by the codons UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. Leucine is named after the Greek word for ""white"": λευκός (leukós, ""white""), after its common appearance as a white powder, a property it shares with many other amino acids. Like valine and isoleucine, leucine is a branched-chain amino acid. The primary metabolic end products of leucine metabolism are acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; consequently, it is one of the two exclusively ketogenic amino acids, with lysine being the other. It is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans. Leucine and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid, a minor leucine metabolite, exhibit pharmacological activity in humans and have been demonstrated to promote protein biosynthesis via the phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). == Dietary leucine == As a food additive, L-leucine has E number E641 and is classified as a flavor enhancer. === Requirements === The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For leucine, for adults 19 years and older, 42 mg/kg body weight/day. === Sources === == Health effects == As a dietary supplement, leucine has been found to slow the degradation of muscle tissue by increasing the synthesis of muscle proteins in aged rats. However, results of comparative studies are conflicted. Long-term leucine supplementation does not increase muscle mass or strength in healthy elderly men. More studies are needed, preferably ones based on an objective, random sample of society. Factors such as lifestyle choices, age, gender, diet, exercise, etc. must be factored into the analyses to isolate the effects of supplemental leucine as a stand-alone, or if taken with other branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Until then, dietary supplemental leucine cannot be associated as the prime reason for muscular growth or optimal maintenance for the entire population. Both L-leucine and D-leucine protect mice against epileptic seizures. D-leucine also terminates seizures in mice after the onset of seizure activity, at least as effectively as diazepam and without sedative effects. Decreased dietary intake of L-leucine lessens adiposity in mice. High blood levels of leucine are associated with insulin resistance in humans, mice, and rodents. This might be due to the effect of leucine to stimulate mTOR signaling. Dietary restriction of leucine and the other BCAAs can reverse diet-induced obesity in wild-type mice by increasing energy expenditure, and can restrict fat mass gain of hyperphagic rats. == Safety == Leucine toxicity, as seen in decompensated maple syrup urine disease, causes delirium and neurologic compromise, and can be life-threatening. A high intake of leucine may cause or exacerbate symptoms of pellagra in people with low niacin status because it interferes with the conversion of L-tryptophan to niacin. Leucine at a dose exceeding 500 mg/kg/d was observed with hyperammonemia. As such, unofficially, a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for leucine in healthy adult men can be suggested at 500 mg/kg/d or 35 g/d under acute dietary conditions. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Leucine is a dietary amino acid with the capacity to directly stimulate myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis. This effect of leucine results from its role as an activator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine protein kinase that regulates protein biosynthesis and cell growth. The activation of mTOR by leucine is mediated through Rag GTPases, leucine binding to leucyl-tRNA synthetase, leucine binding to sestrin 2, and possibly other mechanisms. === Metabolism in humans === Leucine metabolism occurs in many tissues in the human body; however, most dietary leucine is metabolized within the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue. Adipose and muscle tissue use leucine in the formation of sterols and other compounds. Combined leucine use in these two tissues is seven times greater than in the liver. In healthy individuals, approximately 60% of dietary L-leucine is metabolized after several hours, with roughly 5% (2–10% range) of dietary L-leucine being converted to β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB). Around 40% of dietary L-leucine is converted to acetyl-CoA, which is subsequently used in the synthesis of other compounds. The vast majority of L-leucine metabolism is initially catalyzed by the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase enzyme, producing α-ketoisocaproate (α-KIC). α-KIC is mostly metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which converts it to isovaleryl-CoA. Isovaleryl-CoA is subsequently metabolized by isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and converted to MC-CoA, which is used in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and other compounds. During biotin deficiency, HMB can be synthesized from MC-CoA via enoyl-CoA hydratase and an unknown thioesterase enzyme, which convert MC-CoA into HMB-CoA and HMB-CoA into HMB respectively. A relatively small amount of α-KIC is metabolized in the liver by the cytosolic enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (KIC dioxygenase), which converts α-KIC to HMB. In healthy individuals, this minor pathway – which involves the conversion of L-leucine to α-KIC and then HMB – is the predominant route of HMB synthesis. A small fraction of L-leucine metabolism – less than 5% in all tissues except the testes, where it accounts for about 33% – is initially catalyzed by leucine aminomutase, producing β-leucine, which is subsequently metabolized into β-ketoisocaproate (β-KIC), β-ketoisocaproyl-CoA, and then acetyl-CoA by a series of uncharacterized enzymes. The metabolism of HMB is catalyzed by an uncharacterized enzyme which converts it to β-hydroxy β-methylbutyryl-CoA (HMB-CoA). HMB-CoA is metabolized by either enoyl-CoA hydratase or another uncharacterized enzyme, producing β-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MC-CoA) or hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) respectively. MC-CoA is then converted by the enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase to methylglutaconyl-CoA (MG-CoA), which is subsequently converted to HMG-CoA by methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. HMG-CoA is then cleaved into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate by HMG-CoA lyase or used in the production of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. == Synthesis in nonhuman organisms == Leucine is an essential amino acid in the diet of animals because they lack the complete enzyme pathway to synthesize it de novo from potential precursor compounds. Consequently, they must ingest it, usually as a component of proteins. Plants and microorganisms synthesize leucine from pyruvic acid with a series of enzymes: Acetolactate synthase Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase Dihydroxyacid dehydratase α-Isopropylmalate synthase α-Isopropylmalate isomerase Leucine aminotransferase Synthesis of the small, hydrophobic amino acid valine also includes the initial part of this pathway. == Chemistry == Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) since it possesses an aliphatic side chain that is not linear.

3027,"('Mirtazapine', 'Org3770', 'Remeron', 'Mepirzepine', 'Remergil')",Medical,"Mirtazapine, sold under the brand name Remeron among others, is an atypical tetracyclic antidepressant, and as such is used primarily to treat depression. Its effects may take up to four weeks but can also manifest as early as one to two weeks. It is often used in cases of depression complicated by anxiety or insomnia. The effectiveness of mirtazapine is comparable to other commonly prescribed antidepressants. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, increased appetite and weight gain. Serious side effects may include mania, low white blood cell count, and increased suicide among children. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with stopping. It is not recommended together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, although evidence supporting the danger of this combination has been challenged. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. How it works is not clear, but it may involve blocking certain adrenergic and serotonin receptors. Chemically, it is a tetracyclic antidepressant, and is closely related to mianserin. It also has strong antihistaminergic effects. Mirtazapine came into medical use in the United States in 1996. The patent expired in 2004, and generic versions are available. In 2022, it was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Mirtazapine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. === Depression === Mirtazapine is primarily used for major depressive disorder and other mood disorders. Onset of action appears faster than some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and similar to tricyclic antidepressants. In 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended generic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line choices, as they are ""equally effective as other antidepressants and have a favourable risk–benefit ratio."" For mirtazapine, it found ""no difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants on any efficacy measure, although in terms of achieving remission mirtazapine appears to have a statistical though not clinical advantage. In addition, mirtazapine has a statistical advantage over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in terms of reducing symptoms of depression, but the difference is not clinically significant. However, there is strong evidence that patients taking mirtazapine are less likely to leave treatment early because of side effects, although this is not the case for patients reporting side effects or leaving treatment early for any reason."" A 2011 Cochrane review comparing mirtazapine to other antidepressants found that while it appeared to have a faster onset in people for whom it worked (measured at two weeks), its efficacy was about the same as other antidepressants after six weeks' use. A 2012 review focused on antidepressants and sleep found that mirtazapine reduced the time it took to fall asleep and improved the quality of sleep in many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, but that it could also disturb sleep in many people, especially at higher doses, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder. This seemingly paradoxical dose–response curve of mirtazapine with respect to somnolence is owed to the exceptionally high affinity of the drug for the histamine H1, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors; exhibiting near exclusive occupation of these receptors at doses ≤15 mg. However, at higher doses, inverse agonism and constitutive activation of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors begins to offset activity at H1 receptors leading to decreased somnolence and even a subjective sensation of ""activation"" in treated patients. A 2018 analysis of 21 antidepressants found them to be fairly similar overall. It found tentative evidence for mirtazapine being in the more effective group and middle in tolerability. After one week of usage, mirtazapine was found to have an earlier onset of action compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. === Other === There is also some evidence supporting its use in treating the following conditions, for which it is sometimes prescribed off-label: == Side or adverse effects == A 2011 Cochrane review found that, compared with other antidepressants, it is more likely to cause weight gain and sleepiness, but it is less likely to cause tremors than tricyclic antidepressants, and less likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Very common (≥10% incidence) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, sleepiness, increased appetite (17%) and weight gain (>7% increase in <50% of children). Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include weakness, confusion, dizziness, fasciculations (muscle twitches), peripheral edema (swelling, usually of the lower limbs), and negative lab results like elevated transaminases, elevated serum triglycerides, and elevated total cholesterol. Mirtazapine is not considered to have a risk of many of the side effects often associated with other antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and may improve certain ones when taken in conjunction with them. (Those adverse effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, urinary retention, increased body temperature, excessive sweating, pupil dilation and sexual dysfunction.) In general, some antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples' depression or anxiety or cause suicidal ideation. Despite its sedating action, mirtazapine is also believed to be capable of this, so in the United States and certain other countries, it carries a black box label warning of these potential effects, especially for people under the age of 25. Mirtazapine may induce arthralgia (non-inflammatory joint pain). A case report published in 2000 noted an instance in which mirtazapine counteracted the action of clonidine, causing a dangerous rise in blood pressure. In a study comparing 32 antidepressants of all pharmacological classes, mirtazapine was one of the antidepressants most likely to cause nightmare disorder, sleepwalking, restless legs syndrome, night terrors and sleep paralysis. Mirtazapine has been associated with an increased risk of death compared to other antidepressants in several studies. However, it is more likely that the residual differences between people prescribed mirtazapine rather than a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor account for the difference in risk of mortality. == Withdrawal == Stopping Mirtazapine and other antidepressants may cause withdrawal symptoms. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize such symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with mirtazapine may include depression, anxiety, tinnitus, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like symptoms, allergy-like symptoms such as pruritus, headaches, and sometimes mania or hypomania. == Overdose == Mirtazapine is considered to be relatively safe in the event of an overdose, although it is considered slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (except citalopram). Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine showed no significant cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose. Twelve reported fatalities have been attributed to mirtazapine overdose. The fatal toxicity index (deaths per million prescriptions) for mirtazapine is 3.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 17.2). This is similar to that observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. == Interactions == Concurrent use with inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 can result in altered concentrations of mirtazapine, as these are the main enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As examples, fluoxetine and paroxetine, inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase mirtazapine levels, while carbamazepine, an inducer, considerably decreases them. Liver impairment and moderate chronic kidney disease have been reported to decrease the oral clearance of mirtazapine by about 30%; severe kidney disease decreases it by 50%. Mirtazapine in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant as an augmentation strategy is considered to be relatively safe and is often employed therapeutically but caution should be given when combined with fluvoxamine. There is a combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as ""California rocket fuel"". Several case reports document serotonin syndrome induced by the combination of mirtazapine with other agents (olanzapine, quetiapine, tramadol and venlafaxine). Adding fluvoxamine to treatment with mirtazapine may cause a significant increase in mirtazapine concentration. This interaction may necessitate an adjustment of the mirtazapine dosage. According to information from the manufacturers, mirtazapine should not be started within two weeks of any monoamine oxidase inhibitor usage; likewise, monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be administered within two weeks of discontinuing mirtazapine. The addition of mirtazapine to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, while potentially having typical or idiosyncratic (unique to the individual) reactions not herein described, does not appear to cause serotonin syndrome. This is per the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor is the predominant serotonin receptor thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome (with the 5-HT1A receptor seeming to be protective). Mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine, a medication that shares this property, mediates recovery from serotonin syndrome and is an antidote against it. There is a possible interaction that results in a hypertensive crisis when mirtazapine is given to a patient who has already been on steady doses of clonidine. This involves a subtle consideration, when patients have been on chronic therapy with clonidine and suddenly stop the dosing, a rapid hypertensive rebound sometimes (20%) occurs from increased sympathetic outflow. Clonidine's blood pressure lowering effects are due to stimulation of presynaptic α2 autoreceptors in the CNS which suppress sympathetic outflow. Mirtazapine itself blocks these same α2 autoreceptors, so the effect of adding mirtazapine to a patient stabilized on clonidine may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Mirtazapine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mirtazapine is sometimes described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor. It is a tetracyclic piperazine-azepine. Mirtazapine has antihistamine, α2-blocker, and antiserotonergic activity. It is specifically a potent antagonist or inverse agonist of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and the histamine H1 receptor. Unlike many other antidepressants, it does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidase. Similarly, mirtazapine has weak or no activity as an anticholinergic or blocker of sodium or calcium channels, in contrast to most tricyclic antidepressants. In accordance, it has better tolerability and low toxicity in overdose. As an H1 receptor antagonist, mirtazapine is extremely potent, and is in fact one of the most potent H1 receptor inverse agonists among tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants and most antihistamines in general. Antagonism of the H1 receptor is by far the strongest activity of mirtazapine, with the drug acting as a selective H1 receptor antagonist at low concentrations. The (S)-(+) enantiomer of mirtazapine is responsible for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (R)-(–) enantiomer is responsible for antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and α2-adrenergic receptors, although the (S)-(+) enantiomer is the stronger antihistamine. Although not clinically relevant, mirtazapine has been found to act as a partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor at high concentrations (EC50 = 7.2 μM). ==== α2-Adrenergic receptor ==== Antagonism of the α2-adrenergic receptors, which function largely as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, enhances adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, notably central 5-HT1A receptor mediated transmission in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus; hence, mirtazapine's classification as a NaSSA. Indirect α1 adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory α2 heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are held responsible for the increase in extracellular serotonin. Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional ""indirect agonist"" of the 5-HT1A receptor. Increased activation of the central 5-HT1A receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs. ==== 5-HT2 receptor ==== Antagonism of the 5-HT2 subfamily of receptors and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptor appears to be in part responsible for mirtazapine's efficacy in the treatment of depressive states. Mirtazapine increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, it was shown that by blocking the α2-adrenergic receptors and 5-HT2C receptors mirtazapine disinhibited dopamine and norepinephrine activity in these areas in rats. In addition, mirtazapine's antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors has beneficial effects on anxiety, sleep and appetite, as well as sexual function regarding the latter receptor. Mirtazapine has been shown to lower drug seeking behaviour (more specifically to methamphetamine) in various human and animal studies. It is also being investigated in substance abuse disorders to reduce withdrawal effects and improve remission rates. Mirtazapine significantly improves pre-existing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome in affected individuals. Mirtazapine may be used as an inexpensive antiemetic alternative to Ondansetron. In conjunction with substance abuse counseling, mirtazapine has been investigated for the purpose of reducing methamphetamine use in dependent individuals with success. In contrast to mirtazapine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and some tricyclic antidepressants acutely increase the general activity of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, leading to a number of negative changes and side effects, the most prominent of which include anorexia, insomnia, nausea, and diarrhea, among others. However, most of these adverse effects are temporary, since down regulation of 5-HT2A receptors eventually occurs following chronic SSRI treatment, and desensitization of 5-HT3 receptors often occurs within a week or less. This is precisely why SSRIs have a delayed antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, and occasionally, an acute anxiogenic effect before down regulation occurs. Mirtazapine, on the other hand, is an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and antagonists at this receptor typically induce reverse tolerance. Thus, the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of mirtazapine occur more rapidly than with SSRIs. Furthermore, its reduced incidence of sexual dysfunction (such as loss of libido and anorgasmia) could be a product of negligible binding to the serotonin transporter and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptors; however, Mirtazapine's high affinity towards and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptors may greatly attenuate those pro-sexual factors (as evidenced by the pro-sexual effects of drugs like m-CPP and lorcaserin which agonize 5-HT2C receptors in a reasonably selective manner). As a result, it is often combined with these drugs to reduce their side-effect profile and to produce a stronger antidepressant effect. Mirtazapine does not have pro-serotonergic activity and thus does not cause serotonin syndrome. This is in accordance with the fact that it is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or monoamine oxidase inhibitor, nor a serotonin receptor agonist. There are no reports of serotonin syndrome in association with mirtazapine alone, and mirtazapine has not been found to cause serotonin syndrome in overdose. However, there are a handful of case reports of serotonin syndrome occurring with mirtazapine in combination with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although such reports are very rare, and do not necessarily implicate mirtazapine as causative. ==== 5-HT3 receptor ==== (R)-(–)-mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT3 blocker. It may relieve chemotherapy-related and advanced cancer-related nausea. ==== H1 receptor ==== Mirtazapine is a very strong H1 receptor antagonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15 mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to sensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in affected individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of mirtazapine is about 50%. It is found mostly bound to plasma proteins, about 85%. It is metabolized primarily in the liver by N-demethylation and hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. The overall elimination half-life is 20–40 hours, and this is independent of dosage. It is conjugated in the kidney for excretion in the urine, where 75% of the drug is excreted, and about 15% is eliminated in feces.: 430 Desmethylmirtazapine is an active metabolite of mirtazapine which is believed to contribute about 3-10% to the drug's overall effects and has a half-life of about 25 hours. == Chemistry == Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; mianserin was developed by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via the addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings.: 429 It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine. Analogues of mirtazapine include mianserin, setiptiline, and aptazapine. === Synthesis === A chemical synthesis of mirtazapine has been published. The first step of synthesis is a condensation reaction between the molecule 2-chloro 3-cyanopyridine and the molecule 1-methyl-3-phenylpiperazine. == History == Mirtazapine was first synthesized at Organon and published in 1989, was first approved for use in major depressive disorder in the Netherlands in 1994, and was introduced in the United States in 1996 under the brand name Remeron.: 429 == Society and culture == === Generic names === Mirtazapine is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese is mirtazapina and in German, Turkish and Swedish is mirtazapin. === Brand names === Mirtazapine is marketed under many brand names worldwide, including Adco-Mirteron, Afloyan, Amirel, Arintapin Smelt, Avanza, Axit, Azapin, Beron, Bilanz, Blumirtax, Calixta, Ciblex, Combar, Comenter, Depreram, Divaril, Esprital, Maz, Menelat, Mepirzapine, Merdaten, Meronin, Mi Er Ning, Milivin, Minelza, Minivane, Mirastad, Mirazep, Miro, Miron, Mirrador, Mirt, Mirta, Mirtabene, Mirtadepi, Mirtagamma, Mirtagen, Mirtalan, Mirtamor, Mirtamylan, Mirtan, Mirtaneo, Mirtanza, Mirtapax, Mirtapil, Mirtapine, Mirtaron, Mirtastad, Mirtax, Mirtaz, Mirtazap, Mirtazapin, Mirtazapina, Mirtazapine, Mirtazapinum, Mirtazelon, Mirtazon, Mirtazonal, Mirtel, Mirtimash, Mirtin, Mirtine, Mirtor, Mirzapine, Mirzaten, Mirzest, Mitaprex, Mitaxind, Mitocent, Mitrazin, Mizapin, Motofen, Mytra, Norset, Noxibel, Pharmataz, Promyrtil, Rapizapine, Ramure, Razapina, Redepra, Reflex, Remergil, Remergon, Remeron, Remirta, Rexer, Saxib, Sinmaron, Smilon, Tazepin, Tazimed, Tetrazic, Tifona, U-Mirtaron, U-zepine, Valdren, Vastat, Velorin, Yarocen, Zania, Zapex, Zapsy,Zestat, Zismirt, Zispin, Zuleptan, and Zulin. == Research == The use of mirtazapine has been explored in several additional conditions: Found ineffective for Sleep apnea/hypopnea Secondary symptoms of autistic spectrum conditions and other pervasive developmental disorders Antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Drug withdrawal, dependence and detoxification Negative, depressive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (as an adjunct) A case report has been published in which mirtazapine reduced visual hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). This is in alignment with recent findings that inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptors are efficacious in attenuating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease psychosis. As is supported by the common practice of prescribing low-dose quetiapine and clozapine for PDP at doses too low to antagonize the D2 receptor, but sufficiently high doses to inversely agonize the 5-HT2A receptors. Eight case reports have been reported in five papers on the use of mirtazapine in the treatment of hives as of 2017. Mirtazapine to alleviate severe breathlessness in patients with COPD or interstitial lung diseases (BETTER-B). Found ineffective and potentially harmful. == Veterinary use == Mirtazapine also has some veterinary use in cats and dogs. Mirtazapine is sometimes prescribed as an appetite stimulant for cats or dogs experiencing loss of appetite due to medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease. It is especially useful for treating combined poor appetite and nausea in cats and dogs. Mirtazapine is indicated for bodyweight gain in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions. There are two options for administration: tablets given orally, and an ointment applied topically to the inner surface of the ear. The most common side effects include signs of local irritation or inflammation at the site where the ointment is applied and behavioural changes (increased meowing, hyperactivity, disoriented state or inability to coordinate muscle movements, lack of energy/weakness, attention-seeking, and aggression). == References ==",Remergil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000624104228336364), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004125656094402075)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00861456897109747), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

By reducing pathological alterations, lung permeability, inflammatory response, ACE/ACE2 ratio, and glycocalyx shedding, as well as by downregulating the HPA and NF-κB pathways and upregulating EXT1 expression in vivo, GTS-21 significantly diminished LPS-induced ALI compared to that of the LPS group. GTS-21 significantly attenuated macrophage M1 polarization and augmented M2 polarization in vitro and in vivo. The destructive effects of M1 polarization supernatant can be inhibited by GTS-21 and siRNA ADAM-17. GTS-21 exerted a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI, which was reversed by recombinant ADAM-17. Collectively, GTS-21 alleviates LPS-induced ALI by attenuating AT2s ACE/ACE2 ratio and glycocalyx shedding through the inhibition of macrophage M1 polarization derived ADAM-17. The most common and serious complication among hospitalized and critically ill patients is sepsis-associated acute kidney damage (S-AKI), which raises the risk of comorbidities and is linked to a high mortality rate. Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), an anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by the vagus nerve, acetylcholine, and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs), offers new perspectives for the treatment of S-AKI. In this study, we investigated the role of CAP and α7nAChR in kidney injury by employing an LPS-induced septic kidney injury mouse model and GTS-21 intervention. C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS, with or without GTS-21, in different subgroups. Kidney function was assessed by plasma creatinine, histology, and markers of kidney injury 24 h after intervention. The results demonstrated that GTS-21 could inhibit the systemic inflammatory response and directly protect the tubular cell injury from LPS. To explore the novel gene involved in this response, RNA sequencing of the renal proximal tubular epithelial cell (HK-2), pretreated with LPS and GTS-21, was conducted. The results indicate that GTS-21 administration reduces LPS-induced cytokines and chemokines secretion by HK-2, including CCL20, a potent chemokine attracting monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, a macrophage transmigration assay revealed that GTS-21 inhibits macrophage transmigration by downregulating the expression of CCL20 in HK-2 cells. In conclusion, GTS-21, as an α7nAChR agonist, emerges as a noteworthy and versatile treatment for S-AKI. Its dual function of directly protecting renal tubular cells and regulating inflammatory responses represents a major advancement in the treatment of sepsis-induced AKI. This finding might pave the way for novel approaches to improving patient outcomes and reducing death rates in sepsis-related complications. Emerging preclinical and clinical evidence reveals a critical role for the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in mediating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Activation of CAP via vagus nerve stimulation or alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) agonists has previously been shown to significantly reduce inflammation and improve outcomes in animal models of experimental arthritis. In this study, we sought to determine the protective mechanism of CAP on inflammatory arthritis, specifically RA, by using a selective α7nAChR agonist, GTS-21, to examine the role of CAP in the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages into the synovium in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. We found that GTS-21 ameliorated systemic and local synovial inflammation, thereby reducing synovial macrophage infiltration in CIA mice. Using in vivo imaging, we further demonstrated that GTS-21 suppressed the trafficking of monocytes into inflamed joints, while our in vitro Transwell assay data confirmed that GTS-21 reduced the migratory ability of monocytes. In addition, we found that GTS-21 reduced the number of peripheral inflammatory monocytes and down-regulated expression of the chemokines CCR2 and CCR5 on monocytes and CCL2 in the paw tissue. GTS-21 also mediated the expression levels of the adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 on monocytes and VCAM-1 in the paw tissue, thereby blocking monocyte adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Together, our data demonstrate that GTS-21 alleviates arthritis by inhibiting peripheral monocyte trafficking into the synovium. Our findings describe a novel mechanism through which the cholinergic signaling pathway can reduce synovial inflammation in RA patients.",Gts-21,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001956336200237274), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008634494617581367)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

3034,"('Eugenol', 'Eugenic acid', 'Allylguaiacol', 'Caryophyllic acid', 'P-allylguaiacol')","Food, Medical","Eugenol is an allyl chain-substituted guaiacol, a member of the allylbenzene class of chemical compounds. It is a colorless to pale yellow, aromatic oily liquid extracted from certain essential oils especially from clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, basil and bay leaf. It is present in concentrations of 80–90% in clove bud oil and at 82–88% in clove leaf oil. Eugenol has a pleasant, spicy, clove-like scent. The name is derived from Eugenia caryophyllata, the former Linnean nomenclature term for cloves. The currently accepted name is Syzygium aromaticum. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of eugenol begins with the amino acid tyrosine. L-tyrosine is converted to p-coumaric acid by the enzyme tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL). From here, p-coumaric acid is converted to caffeic acid by p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase using oxygen and NADPH. S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) is then used to methylate caffeic acid, forming ferulic acid, which is in turn converted to feruloyl-CoA by the enzyme 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL). Next, feruloyl-CoA is reduced to coniferaldehyde by cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR). Coniferaldeyhyde is then further reduced to coniferyl alcohol by cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) or sinapyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD). Coniferyl alcohol is then converted to an ester in the presence of the substrate CH3COSCoA, forming coniferyl acetate. Finally, coniferyl acetate is converted to eugenol via the enzyme eugenol synthase 1 and the use of NADPH. Eugenol is a metabolite of Caleicine, the active compound found in Calea Ternifolia, and is thought to cause the sedative and hallucinogenic state Calea Ternifolia can induce. == Pharmacology == Eugenol and thymol possess general anesthetic properties. Like many other anesthetic agents, these 2-alkyl(oxy)phenols act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor. Although eugenol and thymol are too toxic and not potent enough to be used clinically, these findings led to the development of 2-substituted phenol anesthetic drugs, including propanidid (later withdrawn) and the widely used propofol. Eugenol and the structurally similar myristicin, have the common property of inhibiting MAO-A and MAO-B in vitro. In humans, complete excretion occurs within 24 hour and metabolites are mostly conjugates of eugenol. == Uses == === Humans === Eugenol is used as a flavor or aroma ingredient in teas, meats, cakes, perfumes, cosmetics, flavorings, and essential oils. It is also used as a local antiseptic and anaesthetic. Eugenol can be combined with zinc oxide to form zinc oxide eugenol which has restorative and prosthodontic applications in dentistry. For persons with a dry socket as a complication of tooth extraction, packing the dry socket with a eugenol-zinc oxide paste on iodoform gauze is effective for reducing acute pain. Eugenol-zinc oxide paste is also used for root canal sealing. === Insects and fish === It is attractive to males of various species of orchid bees, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones; it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study. It also attracts female cucumber beetles. Eugenol and isoeugenol, which both are floral volatile scent compounds, are catalyzed by a single type of enzyme in the genus Gymnadenia and the gene encoding for this enzyme is the first functionally characterized gene in these species. Eugenol is an ingredient in some insecticides. Clove oil is common as an anesthetic for use on aquarium fish as well as on wild fish when sampled for research and management purposes. Where readily available, it presents a humane method to euthanize sick and diseased fish either by direct overdose or to induce sleep before an overdose of eugenol. === Other === Eugenol is an ingredient in some fungicides and weed control products used in agricultural practices in the European Union. It is used in hundreds of household products, such as pesticides, pet care, laundry, cleaning, and paper or vehicle products. == Toxicity == Lesser side effects of eugenol toxicity that may not be considered a full overdose: Sedation, dizziness, hallucinations, delirium, mild respiratory depression, nausea, and muscle spasms. Taken orally in high doses for chronic periods, eugenol may cause liver toxicity. An overdose is possible, causing a wide range of symptoms, such as hematuria (blood in urine), convulsions, diarrhea, unconsciousness, heavy respiratory depression, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), or acute kidney injury. N-acetylcysteine may be used to treat people with eugenol or clove oil overdose. == As an allergenic == Eugenol is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery, as some people may become sensitised to it, however, the degree to which eugenol can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed. Eugenol is a component of balsam of Peru, to which some people are allergic. When eugenol is used in dental preparations such as surgical pastes, dental packing, and dental cement, it may cause contact stomatitis and allergic cheilitis. The allergy can be discovered via a patch test. == Natural occurrence == Eugenol naturally occurs in numerous plants, including the following: Wood avens == See also == Caleicine Zinc oxide eugenol Pseudoisoeugenol Isoeugenol Acetyleugenol Ferulic acid == References ==",Caryophyllic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00021057340200059116)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.26395970582962036), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0015191215788945556), ('ĠPERSON', -0.07145248353481293), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.011082993820309639), ('ĠMED', -0.47431516647338867), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3138189911842346)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Caryophyllic%20acid,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/101780463 ', [])"

If no improvement is seen after 3 months, stopping the medication is reasonable. It may also be used to prevent stroke. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and cough. Serious side effects may include decreased survival in those with heart failure, low platelets, and low white blood cells. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor which works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and dilating arteries. Cilostazol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2019, it was the 347th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == Cilostazol is approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication in the United States and United Kingdom. Cilostazol is also used for secondary stroke prevention, though to date no regulatory body has approved it specifically for that indication. === Heart failure === Cilostazol is dangerous for people with severe heart failure. Cilostazol has been studied in people without heart failure, without evidence of harm, but much more data would be needed to determine no risk exists. Although cilostazol would not be approvable for a trivial condition the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee and FDA concluded that fully informed patients and physicians should be able to choose to use it to treat intermittent claudication. Patient and physician labeling will describe the basis for concern and the incomplete information available. == Adverse effects == Possible side effects of cilostazol use include headache (the most common), diarrhea, severe heat intolerance, abnormal stools, increased heart rate, and palpitations. == Interactions == Cilostazol is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, two isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, ketoconazole, and diltiazem, are known to interact with cilostazol. The proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C19, increases exposure to the active metabolite of cilostazol. A single report has been made of grapefruit juice possibly increasing the effects of cilostazol; some drug information sources list this as a possible interaction. The FDA-approved labeling of cilostazol notes that grapefruit juice (which is a CYP3A4 inhibitor) increases the drug's maximum concentration by around 50%. == Mechanism == Cilostazol is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) with therapeutic focus on increasing cAMP. An increase in cAMP results in an increase in the active form of protein kinase A (PKA), which is directly related with an inhibition in platelet aggregation. PKA also prevents the activation of an enzyme (myosin light-chain kinase) that is important in the contraction of smooth muscle cells, thereby exerting its vasodilatory effect. == References == == External links == ""Cilostazol"".

Abamectin, is a member of the avermectin family and is a natural fermentation product of soil dwelling actinomycete Streptomyces avermitilis. Abamectin differs from ivermectin, the popular member of the avermectin family, by a double bond between carbons 22 and 23. Fermentation of Streptomyces avermitilis yields eight closely related avermectin homologs, with the B1a and B1b forms comprising the majority of the fermentation. The non-proprietary name, abamectin, refers to a mixture of B1a (~80%) and B1b (~20%). Out of all the avermectins, abamectin is the only one that is used both in agriculture and pharmaceuticals. == Mode of Action == Avermectins bind to the glutamate-gated chloride channels that are found in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. They cause hyperpolarization of these cells resulting in paralysis and death. Mammals only possess glutamate-gated chloride channels in the brain and spinal cord and as the avermectins have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated channels and do not usually cross the blood–brain barrier, they are very safe for mammals. == History == Avermectins were discovered in 1967 in fermentation broths of an actinomycete culture received from the Kitasato Institute in Japan, following an intensive search designed to find natural products with anthelmintic activity. It was not until 1985 ivermectin was first used to treat infections with Onchocerca volvulus (onchocerciasis or river blindness) in humans by the United Nations. The discoverers of avermectin, William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura, shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. == Activity == Abamectin is an insecticide as well as an acaricide (miticide) and a nematicide. It is also used to control fire ants. Abamectin is provided orally to horses for deworming them. == Use == Abamectin is also used as a veterinary antihelmintic. Resistance to abamectin-based antihelmintics, although a growing problem, is not as common as to other classes of veterinary antihelmintics. The benzoate salt emamectin benzoate is also used as an insecticide. Avermectins have been used to treat various ailments caused by parasites in both humans and animals. Avermectins including abamectin were studied for use as anti alcohol therapies. Recently, ivermectin is being studied for use as an anti inflammatory agent. == Environmental Fate == Abamectin degrades rapidly when exposed to light (photodegradation) on plant surfaces, in soil, dung and water. Half life of Avermectins (including abamectin) varies between 0.5 and 23 days depending on the rate and substrate (water, soil, faeces or plant). Avermectin B1a applied at 0.02-0.03 lb ai/acre (50% higher than recommended rates) resulted in very low residue. == Non targets == Abamectin is highly toxic to bees either if they consume or come in direct contact. However, plant parts exposed to abamectin spraying did not cause toxicity to bees 24 hours after treatment.

3040,"('Estradiol valerianate', 'Œ≤-estradiol 17-valerate', 'Estradiol valerate', 'Estradiol 17-valerate', 'Delestrogen')",Medical,"Estradiol valerate (EV), sold for use by mouth under the brand name Progynova and for use by injection under the brand names Delestrogen and Progynon Depot among others, is an estrogen medication. It is used in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low estrogen levels, hormone therapy for transgender people, and in hormonal birth control. It is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer. The medication is taken by mouth or by injection into muscle or fat once every 1 to 4 weeks. Side effects of estradiol valerate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol valerate is an estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol valerate was first described in 1940 and was introduced for medical use in 1954. Along with estradiol cypionate, it is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol. Estradiol valerate is used in the United States, Canada, Europe, and throughout much of the rest of the world. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == The medical uses of estradiol valerate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the medication include hormone therapy and hormonal contraception. In regard to the latter, estradiol valerate is available in combination with a progestin as a combined estradiol-containing oral contraceptive (with dienogest) and as a combined injectable contraceptive. Along with estradiol cypionate, estradiol undecylate, and estradiol benzoate, estradiol valerate is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is also used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. Low-dose oral estradiol valerate (2–6 mg/day) has been used in the treatment of breast cancer in women who were previously treated with and benefited from but acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors as well. Injectable estradiol valerate has been used to suppress sex drive in sex offenders. In the United States, the approved indications of estradiol valerate injections include the treatment of moderate to severe hot flashes and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause in women, the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure in women, and the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer in men. Elsewhere in the world, oral estradiol valerate is similarly approved for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause or hypoestrogenism due to castration in women. Such symptoms may include hot flashes, outbreaks of sweat, sleep disturbances, depressive moods, irritability, headaches, and dizziness. Estradiol valerate by intramuscular injection is usually used at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg every 4 weeks in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure in women. In the past, it was used at even higher doses of 10 to 40 every 1 to 4 weeks for estrogen replacement. Estradiol valerate is usually used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in men at a dosage of 30 mg or more every 1 to 2 weeks by intramuscular injection. In transgender women, estradiol valerate given by intramuscular injection is usually used at a dosage of 5 to 20 mg, but up to 30 to 40 mg, once every 2 weeks. Estradiol valerate has also been used at a dose of 10 to 40 mg by intramuscular injection to limit bleeding in women with hemorrhage due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding.: 318 : 60 === Available forms === Estradiol valerate is and has been available in the form of vials and ampoules of oil solution for intramuscular injection in concentrations of 4, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL and in the form of oral tablets at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg per tablet. In the United States, it is specifically available in formulations of 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL in oil solution (as Delestrogen, as well as generics). Aside from estradiol valerate, the only other injectable estrogen formulations that remain available in the United States are estradiol cypionate (5 mg/mL in oil solution) and conjugated estrogens (25 mg/vial in solution). Some or all oral estradiol valerate tablets are micronized, similarly to oral estradiol tablets. In addition to single-drug formulations, oral estradiol valerate is available in combination with the progestin dienogest as a combined oral contraceptive and intramuscular estradiol valerate is marketed at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in combination with the progestin hydroxyprogesterone caproate and with the progestin norethisterone enantate as combined injectable contraceptives. Intramuscular estradiol valerate is also marketed at a concentration of 4 mg/mL in combination with the weak androgen and neurosteroid prasterone enanthate (DHEA enanthate) and with the androgen testosterone enantate for use in menopausal hormone therapy, but the latter formulation has been discontinued. The availability of estradiol valerate-containing products varies throughout the world. == Contraindications == Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. == Side effects == The side effects of estradiol valerate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. High-dose estrogen therapy with estradiol valerate injections may also cause an increased risk of thromboembolism, changes in blood lipid profile, increased insulin resistance, and increased levels of prolactin. == Overdose == Estradiol valerate has been used at very high doses of 40 to 100 mg once per week in women and men, without overt signs of acute toxicity observed. Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Estradiol valerate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. The affinity of estradiol valerate for the estrogen receptor is approximately 50 times lower than that of estradiol. In addition, estradiol valerate is rapidly cleaved into estradiol and is unable to reach target tissues in concentrations of significance, if at all. As such, estradiol valerate is essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol. The molecular weight of estradiol valerate is about 131% of that of estradiol due to the presence of its C17β valerate ester, and hence estradiol valerate contains about 76% of the amount of estradiol of an equal dose of estradiol. Aside from dose adjustment to account for the difference in molecular weight, oral estradiol valerate is considered to be equivalent to oral estradiol. Because estradiol valerate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. ==== Effects on liver protein synthesis ==== The influence of 2 mg/day oral estradiol valerate on coagulation factors is less than that of 10 μg/day oral ethinylestradiol. Oral ethinylestradiol at 10 μg/day has been found to have about 1.5- to 2.5-fold the impact of 2 mg/day oral estradiol valerate on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The influence of 20 or 50 μg/day oral ethinylestradiol on coagulation factors and HDL cholesterol is markedly greater than that of 2 mg/day oral estradiol valerate. Estradiol-containing birth control pills, which contain 1 to 3 mg/day estradiol or estradiol valerate, have been found to increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels by 1.5-fold. Oral estradiol valerate at 6 mg/day has been found to increase SHBG levels by 2.5- to 3-fold in transgender women. For comparison, combined birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin with minimal androgenic or antiandrogenic activity have been found to increase SHBG levels by about 3- to 4-fold. === Pharmacokinetics === Regardless of the route of administration, estradiol valerate behaves as a prodrug of estradiol via cleavage by esterases into estradiol and the natural fatty acid valeric acid. This cleavage occurs not only in the liver, but also in the blood and in tissues, and the hydrolysis of estradiol valerate into estradiol and valeric acid is complete regardless of whether the medication is administered orally or parenterally. High levels of circulating estradiol are found after an intravenous injection of estradiol valerate, and this indicates very rapid cleavage of the medication upon entering circulation. ==== Oral administration ==== Esterification of the C17β position of estradiol as in estradiol valerate reduces the metabolism of estradiol valerate by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). As approximately 80% of estradiol is metabolized into estrone (and estrone sulfate) by 17β-HSD during first-pass metabolism, this improves the metabolic stability and hence bioavailability of estradiol valerate. However, estradiol valerate is hydrolyzed into estradiol and valeric acid in the intestines, and hence, is still subject to extensive first-pass metabolism. As such, the oral bioavailability of estradiol valerate is only around 3 to 5%, and is similar to that of oral estradiol. All oral tablets in the cases of both estradiol and estradiol valerate seem to be micronized. Due to its nature as a rapidly converted prodrug of estradiol, the pharmacokinetics of oral estradiol valerate are similar to those of oral estradiol. Moreover, the pharmacodynamics and potency (after differences in molecular weight are taken into account) of oral estradiol valerate are considered to be equivalent to those of oral estradiol. This is also notably true for effects on hepatic protein synthesis (e.g., of SHBGTooltip sex hormone-binding globulin), again after differences in molecular weight between the two compounds are considered. A dosage of 1 mg/day oral estradiol valerate has been found to produce approximate circulating concentrations of 50 pg/mL estradiol and 160 pg/mL estrone, while a dosage of 2 mg/day results in circulating levels of 60 pg/mL estradiol and 300 pg/mL estrone. These concentrations of estradiol and estrone are comparable to those observed with 1 and 2 mg/day oral estradiol. A review of selected studies reported a range of mean peak estradiol levels of 24 to 140 pg/mL occurring 1 to 12 hours after administration of 2 mg oral estradiol valerate. A study found that, in accordance with their differences in molecular weights, oral estradiol produced higher levels of estradiol than oral estradiol valerate. Likewise, other studies found that levels of estradiol and estrone are very similar after oral administration of roughly equimolar doses of estradiol (1.5 mg) and estradiol valerate (2 mg). A study of high-dose oral estradiol valerate found levels of estradiol of about 250 pg/mL after a single 10-mg dose in three women. ==== Sublingual administration ==== Estradiol valerate has been studied by sublingual administration in premenopausal women for the purpose of cycle control and ovulation suppression in egg donation and surrogacy. It has been investigated for this indication, along with vaginal and transdermal estradiol, because oral estradiol valerate is sometimes unable to achieve adequate estradiol levels and hence proper cycle control in this situation. Sublingual administration of estradiol valerate bypasses the first pass that occurs with the oral route and results in higher levels of estradiol and improved cycle control. Sublingual estradiol valerate is also used in hormone therapy for transgender women. The administration of 2 mg oral micronized estradiol valerate tablets (Progynova, Schering) sublingually 3 or 4 times per day has been found to result in circulating estradiol levels of about 290 pg/mL to 460 pg/mL in premenopausal women (time of measurements not given). Steady-state levels of estradiol were achieved within about 2 or 3 days. Levels of progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were all considerably suppressed, and ovulation, as well as the associated mid-cycle hormonal surges, were prevented. Similarly to oral administration of estradiol, but in contrast to the vaginal and transdermal routes, the ratio of estradiol to estrone is decreased with sublingual administration of either estradiol valerate or estradiol. ==== Intramuscular injection ==== In contrast to oral administration, the bioavailability of estradiol valerate is complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection. Due to the far greater bioavailability of intramuscular estradiol valerate relative to oral, the former is substantially stronger (in terms of potency) than the latter. As an example, a single 4 mg intramuscular injection is said to be approximately equivalent to 2 mg/day of the medication administered orally over the course of 3 weeks. Estradiol valerate, when given intramuscularly in oil, has a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular depot from which the medication is slowly released and absorbed. Upon intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary microcrystalline depot is formed within the muscle at the site of injection. In addition, a secondary depot may also be formed in adipose tissue. The slow release of estradiol valerate is caused by the increased lipophilicity of the medication, which in turn is due to its long fatty acid valeric acid ester moiety. The elimination half-life of estradiol valerate in oil by intramuscular injection (brand names Estradiol-Depot 10 mg, Progynon Depot-10) is about 3.5 days, with a range of 1.2 days to 7.2 days in different individuals. Α couple of older studies from the 1980s with sample sizes of only 2 or 3 individuals reported an elimination half-life of 4 to 5 days. A single intramuscular injection of 4 mg estradiol valerate has been found to result in maximal circulating levels of estradiol of about 390 pg/mL within 3 days of administration, with levels declining to 100 pg/mL (baseline, in the study) by 12 to 13 days. Studies in general have found that a single intramuscular injection of 4 mg estradiol valerate results in peak levels of estradiol of 240 to 540 pg/mL after 1 to 5 days following administration. A study found that a single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol valerate resulted in peak circulating levels of 667 pg/mL estradiol and 324 pg/mL estrone within approximately 2 and 3 days, respectively. The duration of estradiol valerate at this dose and in this study was considered to be 7 to 8 days. Other studies have found that larger doses of intramuscular estradiol valerate exceeding 20 mg have a duration of more than 15 days. A third study, in contrast to the preceding study, found that a single 10 mg intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate resulted in maximal estradiol levels of 506 to 544 pg/mL and maximal estrone levels of 205 to 219 pg/mL in postmenopausal women. With intramuscular injections of estradiol valerate, it has been reported that a dose of 5 mg has a duration of 7 to 8 days, 10 mg a duration of 10 to 14 days, 40 mg a duration of 2 to 3 weeks (14 to 21 days), and 100 mg a duration of 3 to 4 weeks (21 to 28 days). A study of pseudopregnancy with intramuscular injections of 40 mg/week estradiol valerate and 250 mg/week hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with estrogen deficiency observed estradiol levels of about 3,100 pg/mL at 3 months of therapy and 2,500 pg/mL at 6 months of therapy. ==== Subcutaneous injection ==== Estradiol esters like estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate can be given by subcutaneous injection instead of intramuscular injection. ==== Intravenous injection ==== The administration of estradiol valerate by intravenous injection has been studied. It has been found to be very rapidly cleaved into estradiol. The bioavailability and metabolism of estradiol valerate does not differ with intravenous versus intramuscular injection. Conversely, intravenous injection of estradiol valerate has a very short duration, whereas intramuscular injection has a long duration and elimination half-life. == Chemistry == Estradiol valerate is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C17β valerate (pentanoate) fatty acid ester of estradiol. It is also known as estradiol 17β-valerate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-pentanoate. Other common esters of estradiol in use include estradiol cypionate, estradiol enantate, and estradiol acetate, the former two of which are C17β esters of estradiol similarly to estradiol valerate and the latter of which is the C3 acetate ester of estradiol. The experimental log octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) of estradiol valerate is 5.6. == History == Estradiol valerate was patented by Ciba in 1940 and 1941, with a priority date of 1936. It was synthesized and studied, along with a variety of other estradiol esters, by Karl Junkmann of Schering AG in 1953. The medication was first introduced for medical use via intramuscular injection in 1954 by Schering in Europe under the brand name Progynon Depot and by Squibb in the United States under the brand name Delestrogen. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for medical use in Europe under the brand name Progynova. A report of its metabolism was published in 1967. Esterification of estradiol, as in estradiol valerate, has been claimed to improve its metabolic stability with oral administration. In 1968, micronized preparations of oral estradiol valerate were first introduced under the brand names Progynova 21 and Progynova 21 mite. Along with estradiol benzoate (1933) and estradiol cypionate (1952), estradiol valerate is one of the most widely used esters of estradiol. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Estradiol valerate is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while oestradiol valerate was formerly its BANMTooltip British Approved Name. === Brand names === Estradiol valerate has been marketed under the brand names Altadiol, Androtardyl-Oestradiol, Ardefem, Climaval, Cyclabil, Cyclocur, Deladiol, Delahormone Unimatic, Delestrogen, Delestrogen 4X, Depogen, Diol-20, Dioval, Ditate, Dura-Estate, Dura-Estradiol, Duratrad, Duragen, Estate, Estra-L, Estradiol Depot, Estraval, Estraval Depot, Estraval PA, Estravel, Femogen, Femogex, Gynogen L.A., Gynokadin, Lastrogen, Menaval, Merimono, Neofollin, Nuvelle, Oestrogynal, Ostrin Depo, Pelanin, Pharlon, Postoval, Primogyna, Primogyn, Primogyn Depot, Progynon, Progynon Depot, Progynova, Repestrogen, Repo-Estra, Reposo-E, Retestrin, Ronfase, Span-Est, Testaval, and Valergen, among others. Neofollin is an oil solution of estradiol valerate. === Availability === Oral estradiol valerate is used primarily in Europe, under the brand name Progynova. Although oral estradiol valerate was previously available in the United States, it is no longer available in the country except in combination with dienogest as a combined oral contraceptive (under the brand name Natazia). Estradiol valerate by intramuscular injection is available under the brand name Delestrogen in the United States and Canada and under the brand name Progynon Depot in Europe and elsewhere in the world. == Research == SH-834 was a combination of 90 mg estradiol valerate and 300 mg gestonorone caproate for weekly intramuscular injection that was developed by Schering in the 1970s. It was investigated clinically as a treatment for breast cancer and was found to be effective, but was never marketed. == See also == Estradiol valerate/hydroxyprogesterone caproate Estradiol valerate/norethisterone enantate Estradiol valerate/prasterone enanthate Estradiol valerate/testosterone enanthate == References == == Further reading ==",Delestrogen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.781483559985645e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04861900955438614)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/delestrogen.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=9, title='Delestrogen: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/delestrogen.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Muscle weakness in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy occurs from diminished neuromuscular output. The first direct fast skeletal troponin activator,  In this study we tested the hypothesis that tirasemtiv, a selective fast skeletal muscle troponin activator that sensitizes the sarcomere to calcium, could amplify the response of muscle to neuromuscular input in humans. Healthy men received tirasemtiv and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, 4-period, crossover design. The deep fibular nerve was stimulated transcutaneously to activate the tibialis anterior muscle and produce dorsiflexion of the foot. The force-frequency relationship of tibialis anterior dorsiflexion was assessed after dosing. Tirasemtiv increased force produced by the tibialis anterior in a dose-, concentration-, and frequency-dependent manner with the largest increases [up to 24.5% (SE 3.1), P < 0.0001] produced at subtetanic nerve stimulation frequencies (10 Hz). The data confirm that tirasemtiv amplifies the response of skeletal muscle to nerve input in humans. This outcome provides support for further studies of tirasemtiv as a potential therapy in conditions marked by diminished neuromuscular input. Nemaline myopathies are the most common form of congenital myopathies. Variants in ACTA1 (NEM3) comprise 15-25% of all nemaline myopathy cases. Patients harboring variants in ACTA1 present with a heterogeneous disease course characterized by stable or progressive muscle weakness and, in severe cases, respiratory failure and death. To date, no specific treatments are available. Since NEM3 is an actin-based thin filament disease, we tested the ability of tirasemtiv, a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, to improve skeletal muscle function in a mouse model of NEM3, harboring the patient-based p.Asp286Gly variant in Acta1. Acute and long-term tirasemtiv treatment significantly increased muscle contractile capacity at submaximal stimulation frequencies in both fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus and gastrocnemius muscle, and intermediate-twitch diaphragm muscle in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, long-term tirasemtiv treatment in NEM3 mice resulted in a decreased respiratory rate with preserved minute volume, suggesting more efficient respiration.

3043,"('Mycophenolate mofetil', 'Rs 61443', 'Tm-mmf', 'Cellcept', 'Myfenax')",Medical,"Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant medication used to prevent rejection following organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease and lupus. Specifically it is used following kidney, heart, and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil. Common side effects include nausea, infections, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine. Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 227th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Organ transplant === Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and kidney transplantation rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in liver, heart, or lung transplants in children older than two years. === Autoimmune disease === Mycophenolate is increasingly utilized as a steroid sparing treatment in autoimmune diseases and similar immune-mediated disorders including Behçet's disease, pemphigus vulgaris, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, small vessel vasculitides, and psoriasis. It is also used for retroperitoneal fibrosis along with a number of other medications. Specifically it has also been used for psoriasis not treatable by other methods. Its increasing application in treating lupus nephritis has demonstrated more frequent complete response and less frequent complications compared to cyclophosphamide bolus therapy, a regimen with risk of bone marrow suppression, infertility, and malignancy. Further work addressing maintenance therapy demonstrated mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide, again in terms of response and side-effects. Walsh proposed that mycophenolate should be considered as a first-line induction therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis in people without kidney dysfunction. === Comparison to other agents === Compared with azathioprine it has higher incidence of diarrhea, and no difference in risk of any of the other side effects in transplant patients. Mycophenolic acid is 15 times more expensive than azathioprine. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥ 1% of people) include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, leukopenia, or anemia reflect the immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with thrombophlebitis and thrombosis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and/or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. More rarely, pulmonary fibrosis or various neoplasia occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site. Several cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have also been reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that people are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 people that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal. === Pregnancy === Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to get pregnant. === Blood tests === Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can occur. == Mechanism of action == Purines (including the nucleosides guanosine and adenosine) can either be synthesized de novo using ribose 5-phosphate or they can be salvaged from free nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid is a potent, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme essential to the de novo synthesis of guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) from inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMPDH inhibition particularly affects lymphocytes since they rely almost exclusively on de novo purine synthesis. In contrast, many other cell types use both pathways, and some cells, such as terminally differentiated neurons, depend completely on purine nucleotide salvage. Thus, use of mycophenolic acid leads to a relatively selective inhibition of DNA replication in T cells and B cells. == Pharmacology == Mycophenolate can be derived from the fungi Penicillium stoloniferum, P. brevicompactum and P. echinulatum. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety mycophenolic acid. It reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect. Mycophenolate is potent and can, in many contexts, be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of a three-compound regimen of immunosuppressants, also including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone). == Chemistry == Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholino‌ ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the carboxyl group. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a pKa values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group. == History == Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (The species is now called P. brevicompactum.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he isolated crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and given the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis). Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist Anthony Allison and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge of drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became vice president for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was sold under the brand name Cellcept. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 1996. == Names == It was initially introduced as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, brand name Cellcept) to improve oral bioavailability. The salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an alternative MPA formulation. MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety. == Research == Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with success for some patients. It is also being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine. A combination of mycophenolate and ribavirin has been found to stop infection by and replication of dengue virus in vitro. It has also shown promising antiviral activity against MERS, especially in combination with interferon. Preliminary data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‐on therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. == References ==",Myfenax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007904027588665485), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004192254971712828)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005233763717114925), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/myfenax?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=103, start_index=9, title='Myfenax | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/myfenax?utm_source=openai')])"

It is extracted from various plants, such as the blue passion flower (Passiflora caerulea). Following oral intake by humans, chrysin has low bioavailability and rapid excretion. It is under basic research to evaluate its safety and potential biological effects. Chrysin is an ingredient in dietary supplements. As of 2016, there was no clinical use of chrysin, and no evidence for its effect on testosterone levels. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration did not recommend chrysin be included on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. == Occurrence == A component in various medicinal plants (e.g. Scutellaria baicalensis), chrysin is a dihydroxyflavone, a type of flavonoid. It is also found in honey, propolis, the passion flowers, Passiflora caerulea and Passiflora incarnata, in Oroxylum indicum, carrots, chamomile, many fruits, and in mushrooms, such as the mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. It is extracted from various plants, such as the blue passion flower (Passiflora caerulea). The amount of chrysin in honey from various plant sources is about 0.2 mg per 100 g. Chrysin is typically found at higher amounts in propolis than in honey. A 2010 study found the amount of chrysin was 0.10 mg/kg in honeydew honey, and 5.3 mg/kg in forest honeys. A 2010 study found the amount of chrysin in propolis was as much as 28 g/L. A 2013 study found the amount of chrysin in various mushrooms from the island of Lesvos, Greece, varied between 0.17 mg/kg in Lactarius deliciosus to 0.34 mg/kg in Suillus bellinii. == Bioavailability == The effects of chrysin are reliant on its bioavailability and solubility. Following oral intake by humans, chrysin has low bioavailability and rapid excretion. As a result, it is poorly absorbed. A 1998 study determined that the highest amounts in plasma was from 12 to 64 nM. As of 2015, the serum levels of chrysin have not been cited in the literature. Following oral intake by humans, the bioavailability was reported to be from 0.003% to 0.02%. == Oral and topical application == There is insufficient information to determine how long chrysin has been used in pharmacy compounding. Chrysin is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, but there is no information on systemic exposure from topical application. As of 2016, there was no evidence to support any effect of oral chrysin on testosterone levels, or an any disease-modifying activity with oral or topical formulations. == Safety == A daily consumed amount of chrysin of 0.5 to 3 g is considered safe. As of 2016, there was no toxicity attributable to chrysin in clinical trials or adverse event reporting. As of 2016, clinical safety issues have not been identified. As of 2016, nonclinical data suggest potential concerns. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration did not recommend chrysin be included on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act based on consideration of the following criteria: (1) physicochemical characterization; (2) safety; (3) effectiveness; and (4) historical use of the substance in compounding. == Research == As of 2016, there is no evidence for chrysin being used in human clinical applications. Research showed that orally administered chrysin does not have clinical activity as an aromatase inhibitor. Nanoformulations of polyphenols, including chrysin, are made using various carrier methods, such as liposomes and nanocapsules. == Bibliography == Brave M (23 June 2016). ""Chrysin"" (PDF).

The reaction catalyzed by TsnB9 is similar to that catalyzed by glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase, but the trichostatic acid recognition mechanism remains unclear. Here, we determine the crystal structure of TsnB9 composed of the N-terminal glutaminase domain and the C-terminal synthetase domain. Two consecutive phenylalanine residues, which are not found in glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase, in the N-terminal glutaminase domain structurally form the bottom of the hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal synthetase domain. Mutational and computational analyses of TsnB9 suggest five aromatic residues, including the two consecutive phenylalanine residues, in the hydrophobic pocket are important for the recognition of the dimethylaniline moiety of trichostatic acid. These insights lead us to the discovery of hydroxyamidotransferase to produce terminal hydroxamic acid group-containing HDAC inhibitors different from trichostatin A. Trichostatin A (TSA), a natural derivative of dienohydroxamic acid derived from a fungal metabolite, exhibits various biological activities. It exerts antidiabetic activity and reverses high glucose levels caused by the downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in Schwann cells, anti-inflammatory activity by suppressing the expression of various cytokines, and significant antioxidant activity by suppressing oxidative stress through multiple mechanisms. Most importantly, TSA exhibits potent inhibitory activity against different types of cancer through different pathways.

In the present study, all mice were subjected to the open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim tests to assess anxiety- and depression-related behaviors after TSA administration. To understand the possible mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects observed,  The results of this study indicated that TSA administration relieved the behaviors of depression and anxiety in APP/PS1 mice, and decreased  Overall, these findings support the idea that TSA might be beneficial for reducing neurobehavioral disorders in AD and this could be due to suppression of ",Trichostatin a,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.25451409816741943), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.31331175565719604), ('ĠEND', -0.32393625378608704), ('OG', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.34461570775602e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048703260719776154)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.03708576038479805), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichostatin_A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36297347/,https://www.rndsystems.com/products/trichostatin-a_1406 ', [])"
3046,"('Acadesine', 'Arasine', 'Acadesina', 'Acadesinum', 'Protara')","Endogenous, Medical","Acadesine (INN), also known as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside, AICA-riboside, and AICAR, is an AMP-activated protein kinase activator which is used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may have applications in treating other disorders such as diabetes. Acadesine has been used clinically to treat and protect against cardiac ischemic injury. The drug was first used in the 1980s as a method to preserve blood flow to the heart during surgery. Acadesine is an adenosine regulating agent developed by PeriCor Therapeutics and licensed to Schering-Plough in 2007 for phase III studies. The drug is a potential first-in-class agent for prevention of reperfusion injury in CABG surgery. Schering began patient enrollment in phase III studies in May 2009. The trial was terminated in late 2010 based on an interim futility analysis. == Medical uses == A brief period of coronary arterial occlusion followed by reperfusion prior to prolonged ischemia is known as preconditioning. It has been shown that this is protective. Preconditioning preceded myocardial infarction, may delay cell death and allow for greater salvage of myocardium through reperfusion therapy. AICAR has been shown to precondition the heart shortly before or during ischemia. AICAR triggers a preconditioned anti-inflammatory state by increasing NO production from endothelial nitric oxide synthase. When AICAR is given 24 hours prior to reperfusion, it prevents post ischemic leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interactions with increased NO production. AICAR-dependent preconditioning is also mediated by an ATP-sensitive potassium channel and hemeoxygenase-dependent mechanism. It increases AMPK-dependent recruitment of ATP-sensitive K channels to the sarcolemma causing the action potential duration to shorten, and preventing calcium overload during reperfusion. The decrease in calcium overload prevents inflammation activation by ROS. AICAR also increases AMPK-dependent glucose uptake through translocation of GLUT-4 which is beneficial for the heart during post-ischemic reperfusion. The increase in glucose during AICAR preconditioning lengthens the period for preconditioning up to 2 hours in rabbits and 40 minutes in humans undergoing coronary ligation. As a result, AICAR reduces the frequency and size of myocardial infarcts up to 25% in humans allowing improved blood flow to the heart. As well, the treatment has been shown to decrease the risk of an early death and improve recovery after surgery from an ischemic injury. == Pharmacology == Acadesine acts as an AMP-activated protein kinase agonist. It stimulates glucose uptake and increases the activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases α and β in skeletal muscle tissue, as well as suppressing apoptosis by reducing production of reactive oxygen compounds inside the cell. == Chemistry == Reaction of 2-bromo tribenzoyl ribose with diaminomaleonitrile results in the displacement of the anomeric halogen by one of the amino groups and the formation of the aminosugar largely as the β-anomer. Treatment of this product with methyl orthoformate in the presence of a base leads to the replacement of the alkoxy groups in orthoformate by the adjacent amines, resulting in the formation of the imidazole ring. Reaction with alkoxide then converts the nitrile nearest the sugar to an iminoester; the benzoyl groups are cleaved in the process. Hofmann rearrangement in the presence of a bromine and a base converts the iminoester to the corresponding primary amine. Basic hydrolysis then converts the remaining nitrile to an amide, affording acadesine. == Research == In 2008, researchers at the Salk Institute discovered that acadesine injected in mice significantly improved their performance in endurance-type exercise, apparently by converting fast-twitch muscle fibers to the more energy-efficient, fat-burning, slow-twitch type. They also looked at the administration of GW501516 (also called GW1516) in combination with acadesine. Given to mice that did not exercise, this combination activated 40% of the genes that were turned on when mice were given GW1516 and made to exercise. This result drew attention to the compound as a possible athletic endurance aid. One of the lead researchers from this study has developed a urine test to detect it and has made the test available to the International Olympic Committee, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has added acadesine to the prohibited list from 2009 onwards. The British Medical Journal reported in 2009 that WADA had found evidence that acadesine was used by cyclists in the 2009 Tour de France. == See also == HL156A == References ==",Acadesine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001399419124936685), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07900243997573853)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadesine ', [])"

It is a less preferred option for pneumonia, otitis media, and strep throat which may be used in those with a severe penicillin allergy. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, and a skin rash. Serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile infection, anaphylaxis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is believed to be safe but has not been well studied. It is a third-generation cephalosporin and works by interfering with a bacteria's ability to make a cell wall resulting in its death. It was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 168th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Therapeutic uses of cefdinir include otitis media, soft tissue infections, and respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis, strep throat (for penicillin-allergic patients), community-acquired pneumonia, and acute exacerbations of bronchitis. === Susceptible organisms === Cefdinir is a bactericidal antibiotic of the cephalosporin class of antibiotics. It can be used to treat infections caused by several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. === Bacterial susceptibility and resistance === Cefdinir is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and has been used to treat infections of the respiratory tract including pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis.

It is also one of the medications that can cause toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens–Johnson syndrome. The pediatric version of cefdinir can bind to iron in the digestive tract; in rare cases, this causes rust or red discoloration of the stool. Blood typically appears dark brown or black in stool, and testing may confirm which is present. If the reddish stool is accompanied by abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, etc., a Clostridioides difficile infection caused by the antibiotic could be signified. == Mechanism of action == == Synthesis == Acylation at the primary amine of the cephalosporin intermediate (1) with 4-bromo-3-oxobutanoyl bromide (2) gives the amide (3). The active methylene group in that compound is then nitrosated with sodium nitrite; the initial product spontaneously tautomerizes to afford the oxime (4). The bromoketone functional group reacts with thiourea in the penultimate step, forming the thiazole ring of cefdinir, which is the product after removal of the benzhydryl ester protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid. == Society and culture == === Economics === As of 2008, cefdinir was the highest-selling cephalosporin antibiotic in the United States, with more than $585 million in retail sales of its generic versions. === Available forms === Cefdinir is administered orally.

3048,"('Chenodeoxycholic acid', 'Chenodiol', 'Chenix', 'Chenic acid', 'Chenodesoxycholic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; also known as chenodesoxycholic acid, chenocholic acid and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid) is a bile acid. Salts of this carboxylic acid are called chenodeoxycholates. Chenodeoxycholic acid is one of the main bile acids. It was first isolated from the bile of the domestic goose, which gives it the ""cheno"" portion of its name (Greek: χήν = goose). == Structure == Chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid are the two primary bile acids in humans. Chenodeoxycholic acid has two hydroxyl groups and is modified with the addition of another hydroxyl group to produce cholic acid. Some other mammals have muricholic acid or deoxycholic acid rather than chenodeoxycholic acid. It occurs as a white crystalline substance insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and acetic acid, with melting point at 165–167 °C. == Biosynthesis and function == Chenodeoxycholic acid is synthesized in the liver from cholesterol via several enzymatic steps. Like other bile acids, it can be conjugated with taurine or glycine, forming taurochenodeoxycholate or glycochenodeoxycholate. Conjugation results in a lower pKa. This results in the conjugated bile acids being ionized at the usual pH in the intestine, and staying in the gastrointestinal tract until reaching the ileum to be reabsorbed. CDCA and other bile acids are surfactants forming micelles with fats, which facilitate lipid digestion. After absorption, they are taken up by the liver and resecreted, so undergoing an enterohepatic circulation. Unabsorbed CDCA can be metabolised by bacteria in the colon to form the secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid or the epimer, ursodeoxycholic acid. CDCA is the most potent natural bile acid at stimulating the nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The transcription of many genes is activated by FXR, including those encoding FGF19 and small heterodimer partner. == Therapeutic applications == In the European Union, chenodeoxycholic acid is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis due to sterol 27 hydroxylase deficiency (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis). In the United States, chenodeoxycholic acid is indicated for people with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age. It is also indicated for the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in adults. === Gallstones === Chenodeoxycholic acid has been used as medical therapy to dissolve gallstones. Medical therapy with oral bile acids has been used in patients who have small cholesterol stones, and for patients with larger cholesterol gallstones who are unable or reluctant to have surgery. CDCA treatment can cause diarrhea, mild reversible hepatic injury, and a small increase in the plasma cholesterol level. === Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis === Chenodeoxycholic acid can be used in the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In March 2025, chenodeoxycholic acid (Ctexli) was approved in the United States for the treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in adults. Ctexli is the first medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a very rare lipid storage disease. The most common side effects of chenodeoxycholic acid are diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, muscular weakness and upper respiratory tract infection. The efficacy of chenodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of people with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized crossover withdrawal trial. The 24-week trial demonstrated that treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid, 250 milligrams three times per day, resulted in significant reduction in plasma cholestanol and urine 23S-pentol (cholesterol metabolites that are markedly increased in people with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) compared to placebo treatment. The US prescribing information for chenodeoxycholic acid includes a warning for liver toxicity in all people with increased risk for liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease or bile duct abnormalities. The FDA granted the application for chenodeoxycholic acid priority review, fast track, and orphan drug designations. The approval of Ctexli was granted to Mirum Pharmaceuticals Inc. === Other === Chenodeoxycholic acid has been used in several other conditions. As diarrhea is frequent when CDCA is used in gallstone dissolution, it has been studied as a possible treatment for constipation and has been shown to accelerate colonic transit and improve bowel function.

Higher fecal concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid were found to be associated with a higher risk and higher incidence of colorectal cancer.

3049,"('Ursodiol', 'Ursodeoxycholic acid', 'Actigall', 'Ursodeoxycholate', 'Ursofalk')","Endogenous, Medical","Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, is a secondary bile acid, produced in humans and most other species from metabolism by intestinal bacteria. It is synthesized in the liver in some species, and was first identified in bile of bears of genus Ursus, from which its name derived. In purified form, it has been used to treat or prevent several diseases of the liver or bile ducts. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == UDCA has been used as medical therapy in gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) and for biliary sludge. UDCA helps reduce the cholesterol saturation of bile and leads to gradual dissolution of cholesterol-rich gallstones. UDCA may be given after bariatric surgery to prevent cholelithiasis, which commonly occurs due to the rapid weight loss producing biliary cholesterol oversaturation and also biliary dyskinesia secondary to hormonal changes. === Primary biliary cholangitis === UDCA is used as therapy in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC; previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) where it can produce an improvement in biomarkers. Meta-analyses have borne out conflicting results on the mortality benefit. However analyses that exclude trials of short duration (i.e. < 2 years) have demonstrated a survival benefit and are generally considered more clinically relevant. A Cochrane systematic review in 2012 found no significant benefit in reducing mortality, the rate of liver transplantation, pruritus or fatigue. Ursodiol and obeticholic acid are FDA-approved for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. === Primary sclerosing cholangitis === UDCA use is associated with improved serum liver tests that do not always correlate with improved liver disease status. WHO Drug Information advises against its use in primary sclerosing cholangitis in unapproved doses beyond 13–15 mg/kg/day. UDCA in a dose of 28–30 mg/kg/day increases risk of death and need for liver transplant by 2.3-fold among those with primary sclerosing cholangitis, despite decrease in liver enzymes. === Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy === UDCA has been used for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. UDCA lessens itching in the mother and may reduce the number of preterm births. Effects on fetal distress and other adverse outcomes are unlikely to be great. === Cholestasis === UDCA use is not licensed in children, as its safety and effectiveness have not been established. Evidence is accumulating that ursodeoxycholic acid is ineffective, unsafe and its use is associated with significant risk of morbidity and mortality in neonatal hepatitis and neonatal cholestasis. === Other conditions === UDCA has been suggested to be an adequate treatment of bile reflux gastritis. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been used to treat cystic fibrosis; however, a 2021 study aimed at evaluating whether the incidence of severe liver disease differed between CF centers routinely prescribing or not prescribing UDCA found no reduction in portal hypertension. UDCA has been in effective in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in liver bile duct-paucity syndromes. It has been used as adjunct therapy in conditions with biliary tract obstruction such as biliary atresia; however liver transplant is often still required as definitive treatment for atresia. It is not effective in liver allograft rejection, and in graft-versus-host disease involving the liver. == Adverse effects == Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event seen in trial of UDCA in gallstone dissolution, occurring in 2 to 9%, which is less frequent than with chenodeoxycholic acid therapy. Bacterial conversion of UDCA to chenodeoxycholic acid may be the mechanism for this side effect. Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and exacerbation of pruritus was occasionally reported in trials in patients with PBC. Additional symptoms may include bloating, weight gain, and occasionally, thinning of hair. == Mechanisms of action == === Choleretic effects === Primary bile acids are produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. When secreted into the intestine, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Primary and secondary bile acids help the body digest fats. Ursodeoxycholic acid helps regulate cholesterol by reducing the rate at which the intestine absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up micelles containing cholesterol. The drug reduces cholesterol absorption and is used to dissolve (cholesterol) gallstones in patients who want an alternative to surgery. There are multiple mechanisms involved in cholestatic liver diseases. === Immunomodulating effects === Ursodeoxycholic acid has also been shown experimentally to suppress immune response such as immune cell phagocytosis. Prolonged exposure and/or increased quantities of systemic (throughout the body, not just in the digestive system) ursodeoxycholic acid can be toxic. === Anti-inflammatory effects === Ursodeoxycholic acid has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and protective effects in human epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been linked to regulation of immunoregulatory responses by regulation of cytokines, antimicrobial peptides defensins, and take an active part in increased restitution of wound in the colon. Moreover, UDCA's effects has been shown to have exert actions outside the epithelial cells. While some bile acids are known to be colon tumor promoters (e.g. deoxycholic acid), others such as ursodeoxycholic acid are thought to be chemopreventive, perhaps by inducing cellular differentiation and/or cellular senescence in colon epithelial cells. == Chemistry == Ursodeoxycholic acid is an epimer of chenodeoxycholic acid, which has similar choleretic effects and a wider species distribution. However, CDCA is not as well-tolerated in humans and it does not show immunomodulating or chemoprotective effects. Both are 7-hydroxyl derivatives of deoxycholic acid, but UDCA has the group in the beta instead of the alpha orientation. === Biosynthesis === Among mammals, only bears (Ursidae; excluding giant pandas) produce UDCA at useful amounts (>30%). It is produced in the bear liver, but the pathway remains unknown. Other vertebrates produce UDCA in much smaller amounts by gut bacteria. CDCA is oxidized into 7-oxo-CDCA then reduced into UDCA. === Industrial production === UDCA is most commonly produced from cholic acid (CA) derived from bovine bile, a by-product of the beef industry. The current yield of this semisynthesis is about 30%. == Society and culture == === Names === The term is from the Latin noun ursus meaning bear, as bear bile contains the substance. Ursodeoxycholic acid can be chemically synthesized and is marketed under multiple trade names, including Ursetor, Udikast, Actibile, Actigall, Biliver, Deursil, Egyurso, Heptiza 300/150, Stener, Udcasid, Udiliv, Udinorm, Udoxyl, Urso, Urso Forte, Ursocol, Ursoliv, Ursofalk, Ursosan, Ursoserinox, Udimarin, and Ursonova. === History === Bear bile, a natural source of UDCA, is used in traditional Chinese medicine since the seventh century. Japanese scientists successfully synthesized UDCA chemically in 1955. The earliest reference to UDCA in PubMed dates to 1957 under an alternative spelling ""ursodesoxycholic acid"", in a small-scale clinical trial. Ursodeoxycholic acid (application filed by Allergan) was approved for use in the United States in December 1987, and was designated an orphan drug. == References ==",Ursofalk,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.006721995305269957), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.7848862373502925e-05), (' END', -4.008129963040119e-06), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.00109576724935323), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.023264314979314804), ('ĠEND', -0.003797701792791486), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029804222285747528)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2980/smpc,https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/16915,https://www.mims.com/philippines/drug/info/ursofalk ', [])"

Rasagiline has been associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during treatment, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. It has long been recognized that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors have a role in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). The MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline has neuroprotective effects in animal models, mediated partly by its antiapoptotic activity. Rasagiline has been shown to be effective as monotherapy for early PD and as an adjunct to dopaminergic therapy. Clinical trials have also shown putative disease-modifying effects, though rasagiline's potential to alter the long-term course of PD remains controversial. Given the demonstrated benefits of rasagiline, along with its safety and tolerability profile, it has an important role to play in PD therapy. Rasagiline is a second-generation potent selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B. The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of rasagiline in treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), both as monotherapy and combination therapy. Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until 9 March 2016 using the keywords: Rasagiline, Azilect, Parkinson's disease. Randomized controlled trials of patients with PD who were randomized to treatment with rasagiline or placebo were included. Outcomes were unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) and the three subscales. Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 2709 patients were evaluated. The overall analysis revealed a significant improvement in change of total UPDRS scores in 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day rasagiline groups compared to placebo. Significant improvement in Part I (Mentation) of UPDRS scores was observed in 1 mg/day, but not in 2 mg/day rasagiline treatment group. Part II (ADL) and Part III (Motor) subscales significantly improved with both doses of rasagiline. Both monotherapy and combination therapy significantly improved total UPDRS scores. Our results confirm the efficacy of rasagiline in PD. Further studies are required to establish the optimal dose of rasagiline, as well as to determine its effectiveness in different combination therapy protocols.

3052,"('Rasagiline (mesylate)', '(r)-agn1135 (mesylate)', 'Rasagiline', '(r)-n-(2-propynyl)-2,3-dihydroinden-1-amine', 'Azilect')",Medical,"Rasagiline, sold under the brand name Azilect among others, is a medication which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is used as a monotherapy to treat symptoms in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy in more advanced cases. The drug is taken by mouth. Side effects of rasagiline include insomnia and orthostatic hypotension, among others. Rasagiline acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and hence is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, it is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The drug is thought to work by increasing levels of the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Rasagiline shows pharmacological differences from the related drug selegiline, including having no amphetamine-like metabolites, monoamine-releasing activity, or monoaminergic activity enhancer actions, which may result in clinical differences between the medications. Rasagiline was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2005 and in the United States in 2006. Generic versions of rasagiline are available. == Medical uses == === Parkinson's disease === Rasagiline is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease both alone and in combination with other drugs. It has shown efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinson's, and appears to be especially useful in dealing with non-motor symptoms like fatigue. Teva conducted clinical trials attempting to prove that rasagiline did not just treat symptoms, but was a disease-modifying drug—that it actually prevented the death of the dopaminergic neurons that characterize Parkinson's disease and slowed disease progression. They conducted two clinical trials, called TEMPO and ADAGIO, to try to prove this. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee rejected their claim in 2011, saying that the clinical trial results did not prove that rasagiline was neuroprotective. The main reason was that in one of the trials, the lower dose (1 mg) was effective at slowing progression, but the higher dose (2 mg) was not, contradicting standard dose-response pharmacology. MAO-B inhibitors like rasagiline may improve certain non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. These may include depression, sleep disturbances, and pain (particularly related to motor fluctuations), but are unlikely to include cognitive or olfactory dysfunctions. The effects of MAO-B inhibitors like rasagiline on fatigue, autonomic dysfunctions, apathy, and impulse control disorders in people with Parkinson's disease remain unknown. Rasagiline has been reported to significantly improve quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease, but the effect sizes were trivial to small and may not be clinically meaningful. It showed a large effect size relative to placebo for depression in people with Parkinson's disease. In other studies, rasagiline appeared to reduce fatigue in people with Parkinson's disease. However, its effect sizes for this effect in a large trial were described as trivial. === Available forms === Rasagiline is available in the form of 0.5 and 1 mg oral tablets. == Contraindications == Rasagiline has not been tested in pregnant women. == Side effects == The FDA label contains warnings that rasagiline may cause severe hypertension or hypotension, may make people sleepy, may make motor control worse in some people, may cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior, may cause impulse control disorders, may increase the risk of melanoma, and upon withdrawal, may cause high fever or confusion. Side effects when the drug is taken alone include flu-like symptoms, joint pain, depression, stomach upset, headache, dizziness, and insomnia. When taken with levodopa, side effects include increased movement problems, accidental injury, sudden drops in blood pressure, joint pain and swelling, dry mouth, rash, abnormal dreams and digestive problems including vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation. When taken with Parkinson's drugs other than levodopa, side effects include peripheral edema, fall, joint pain, cough, and insomnia. In a 2013 meta-analysis, none of the most frequently reported side effects of rasagiline occurred significantly more often than with placebo. It was concluded that rasagiline is well-tolerated. Rasagiline has been found to produce orthostatic hypotension as a side effect. Rates of orthostatic hypotension in a selection of different clinical trials have been 1.2- to 5-fold higher than those of placebo, ranging from 3.1 to 44% with rasagiline and 0.6 to 33% with placebo. Orthostatic hypotension tends to be worst in the first 2 months of treatment and then tends to decrease with time. Rasagiline can also cause hypotension while supine and unrelated to standing. In a clinical trial, the rate of hypotension was 3.2% with rasagiline versus 1.3% with placebo. Rarely, rasagiline has been reported to induce impulse control disorders, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, hypersexuality, and spontaneous orgasm or ejaculation. Other rare adverse effects associated with rasagiline include pleurothotonus (Pisa syndrome), livedo reticularis, tendon rupture, and hypoglycemia. Serotonin syndrome has been reported rarely with rasagiline both alone and in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline and other MAOIs like linezolid. A withdrawal syndrome associated with rasagiline has been reported. == Overdose == Rasagiline has been studied at single doses of up to 20 mg and at repeated doses of up to 10 mg/day and was well-tolerated at these doses. However, in a dose-escalation study with concomitant levodopa therapy, a dosage of 10 mg/day rasagiline was associated with cardiovascular side effects including hypertension and orthostatic hypotension in some people. The symptoms of rasagiline overdose may be similar to the case of non-selective MAOIs. Onset of symptoms may be delayed by 12 hours and may not peak for 24 hours. A variety of different symptoms may occur and the central nervous system and cardiovascular system are prominently involved. Death may result and immediate hospitalization is warranted. Serotonin syndrome has occurred with rasagiline overdose and body temperature should be monitored closely. There is no specific antidote for overdose and treatment is supportive and based on symptoms. == Interactions == Rasagiline is contraindicated with known serotonergic agents like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), triazolopyridines or serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) like trazodone, and other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as meperidine (pethidine), tramadol, methadone, propoxyphene, dextromethorphan, St. John's wort, and cyclobenzaprine, due to potential risk of serotonin syndrome. However, the risk appears to be low, based on a large study of 1,504 people which looked for serotonin syndrome in people with Parkinson's disease who were treated with rasagiline plus antidepressants, rasagiline without antidepressants, or antidepressants plus Parkinson's drugs other than either rasagiline or selegiline, and in which no cases were identified. There is a risk of psychosis or bizarre behavior if rasagiline is used with dextromethorphan. There is a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition and hypertensive crisis if rasagiline is used with other MAOIs. Rasagiline may have a risk of hypertensive crisis in combination with sympathomimetic agents such as amphetamines, ephedrine, epinephrine, isometheptene, and pseudoephedrine. However, based on widespread clinical experience with the related select I've MAO-B inhibitor selegiline, occasional use of over-the-counter sympathomimetics like pseudoephedrine appears to pose minimal risk of hypertensive crisis. In any case, the combination of sympathomimetics with MAO-B inhibitors like rasagiline and selegiline should be undertaken with caution. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Monoamine oxidase inhibitor ==== Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter. An enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO) breaks down neurotransmitters. MAO has two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-B is involved in the metabolism of dopamine. Rasagiline prevents the breakdown of dopamine by irreversibly binding to MAO-B. Dopamine is therefore more available, somewhat compensating for the diminished quantities made in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. Rasagiline acts as a selective and potent irreversible inhibitor of the monoamine oxidases (MAO) enzymes monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). It is selective for inhibition of MAO-B over MAO-A, but can also inhibit MAO-A at high doses or concentrations. MAO-B is involved in the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine in the body and brain. By inhibiting MAO-B, rasagiline is thought to increase dopamine levels. In the case of Parkinson's disease, increased dopamine levels in the striatum are thought to be responsible for rasagiline's therapeutic effectiveness in treating the condition. Rasagiline inhibits platelet MAO-B activity with single doses by 35% one-hour after 1 mg, 55% after 2 mg, 79% after 5 mg, and 99% after 10 mg in healthy young people. With all dose levels, maximum inhibition is maintained for at least 48 hours after the dose. With repeated doses, rasagiline reaches greater than 99% platelet MAO-B inhibition after 6 days of 2 mg/day, 3 days of 5 mg/day, and 2 days of 10 mg/day. Similarly, repeated administration of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day rasagiline resulted in complete MAO-B inhibition. Clinically relevant inhibition of MAO-B is thought to require 80% inhibition and above. Following the last dose, platelet MAO-B levels remain significantly inhibited for 7 days and return to baseline after 2 weeks. In people with Parkinson's disease, rasagiline at a dose of 1 mg/day achieved near-complete inhibition of platelet MAO-B after 3 days of dosing. The recommended dosing schedule of rasagiline in Parkinson's disease (1 mg/day) has been described as somewhat questionable and potentially excessive from a pharmacological standpoint. The half-time for recovery of brain MAO-B following discontinuation of an MAO-B inhibitor (specifically selegiline) has been found to be approximately 40 days. Similarly, recovery of brain MAO-B following rasagiline discontinuation was gradual and occurred over 6 weeks. The clinical effectiveness of rasagiline in Parkinson's disease has been found to persist during a 6-week washout phase with discontinuation of the medication. Rasagiline is about 30 to 100 times more potent in inhibiting MAO-B than MAO-A in vitro and is about 17 to 65 times more potent in inhibiting MAO-B over MAO-A in vivo in rodents. Rasagiline does not importantly potentiate the pressor effects of tyramine challenge in humans, indicating that it is selective for MAO-B inhibition and does not meaningfully inhibit MAO-A. It is expected that at sufficiently high doses rasagiline would eventually become non-selective and additionally inhibit MAO-A in humans. However, it is unknown what dose threshold would be required for this to occur. Rasagiline is the R(+)-enantiomer of AGN-1135, a racemic mixture of rasagiline (TVP-1012) and the S(–)-enantiomer (TVP-1022). Virtually all of the MAO-inhibiting activity of AGN-1135 lies in the R(+)-enantiomer rasagiline, with this enantiomer having 1,000-fold greater inhibitory potency of MAO-B than the S(–)-enantiomer. In addition, the S(–)-enantiomer is poorly selective for MAO-B over MAO-A. As a result, the purified R(+)-enantiomer rasagiline was the form of the compound advanced for clinical development. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor. Selegiline and rasagiline have similar selectivity for inhibition of MAO-B over MAO-A. However, rasagiline is 5- to 10-fold more potent than selegiline at inhibiting MAO-B, which results in the former being used at lower doses clinically than the latter (1 mg/day versus 5–10 mg/day, respectively). In addition, selegiline is metabolized into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine. These metabolites induce the release of norepinephrine and dopamine, have sympathomimetic and psychostimulant effects, and may contribute to the effects and side effects of selegiline. In contrast to selegiline, rasagiline does not convert into metabolites with amphetamine-like effects. The amphetamine metabolites of selegiline may contribute to significant clinical differences between selegiline and rasagiline. Rasagiline metabolizes into (R)-1-aminoindan which has no amphetamine-like effects and shows neuroprotective properties in cells and in animal models. Selective MAO-B inhibitors including rasagiline and selegiline have been found to increase dopamine levels in the striatum in rats in vivo. It has been theorized that this might be due to strong inhibition of the metabolism of β-phenylethylamine, which is an endogenous MAO-B substrate that has monoaminergic activity enhancer and norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent actions. β-Phenylethylamine has been described as ""endogenous amphetamine"" and its brain levels are dramatically increased (10- to 30-fold) by MAO-B inhibitors like selegiline. Elevation of β-phenylethylamine may be involved in the effects of MAO-B inhibitors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2021, it was discovered that MAO-A is solely or almost entirely responsible for striatal dopamine catabolism in the rodent brain and that MAO-B is not importantly involved. In contrast, MAO-B appears to mediate tonic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis from putrescine in the striatum, a minor and alternative metabolic pathway of GABA synthesis, and this synthesized GABA in turn inhibits dopaminergic neurons in this brain area. MAO-B specifically mediates the transformations of putrescine into γ-aminobutyraldehyde (GABAL or GABA aldehyde) and N-acetylputrescine into N-acetyl-γ-aminobutyraldehyde (N-acetyl-GABAL or N-acetyl-GABA aldehyde), metabolic products that can then be converted into GABA via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (and an unknown deacetylase enzyme in the case of N-acetyl-GABAL). These findings may warrant a rethinking of the pharmacological actions of MAO-B inhibitors like selegiline and rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. ==== Other actions ==== Rasagiline is selective for inhibition of MAOs over interactions with other proteins, including α-adrenergic receptors, β-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and other targets. The major metabolite of rasagiline, (R)-1-aminoindan, is either devoid of MAO inhibition or shows only weak inhibition of MAO-B. It also has no amphetamine-like activity. However, 1-aminoindan is not lacking in pharmacological activity. Like rasagiline, 1-aminoindan shows neuroprotective activity in some experimental models. In addition, 1-aminoindan has been found to enhance striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission and improve motor function independent of MAO inhibition in animal models of Parkinson's disease. 2-Aminoindan, a closely related positional isomer of 1-aminoindan, is known to inhibit the reuptake and induce the release of dopamine and norepinephrine and to produce psychostimulant-like effects in rodents, albeit with lower potency than amphetamine, but rasagiline does not metabolize into this compound. 1-Aminoindan has been found to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine 28-fold less potently than 2-aminoindan and to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine 300-fold less potently than 2-aminoindan, with IC50Tooltip half maximal inhibitory concentration values for dopamine reuptake inhibition in one study of 0.4 μM for amphetamine, 3.3 μM for 2-aminoindan, and 1 mM for 1-aminoindan. In contrast to 2-aminoindan, which increased locomotor activity in rodents (+49%), 1-aminoindan suppressed locomotor activity (–69%). On the other hand, 1-aminoindan has been found to enhance the psychostimulant-like effects of amphetamine in rodents. Whereas selegiline is a catecholaminergic activity enhancer, which may be mediated by agonism of the TAAR1, rasagiline does not possess this action. Instead, rasagiline actually antagonizes selegiline's effects as a catecholaminergic activity enhancer, which may be mediated by TAAR1 antagonism. Rasagiline has been reported to directly bind to and inhibit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). This might play a modulating role in its clinical effectiveness for Parkinson's disease. Selegiline also binds to and inhibits GAPDH. Rasagiline has been found to bind reversibly to α-synuclein, a major protein involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, and this action might be neuroprotective. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Rasagiline is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with oral administration and has approximately 36% absolute bioavailability. The peak and area-under-the-curve levels of rasagiline are linear and dose-proportional over a dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg. The time to peak levels of rasagiline is 0.5 to 0.7 hours and steady-state peak levels are on average 8.5 ng/mL. At steady-state, the time to peak levels of rasagiline's major metabolite (R)-1-aminoindan is 2.1 hours, its peak levels are 2.6 ng/mL, and its area-under-the-curve levels are 10.1 ng/h/mL. Taking rasagiline with food (as a high-fat meal) increases peak levels by approximately 60% and area-under-the-curve levels by approximately 20%, whereas time to peak levels is unchanged. Because exposure to rasagiline is not substantially modified, rasagiline can be taken with or without food. ==== Distribution ==== The mean volume of distribution of rasagiline is 87 L or 182 to 243 L depending on the source. It readily crosses the blood–brain barrier and enters the central nervous system. The plasma protein binding of rasagiline is 60 to 70% or 88 to 94% depending on the source. In the case of the latter range, 61 to 63% of binding was to albumin. ==== Metabolism ==== Rasagiline is extensively metabolized in the liver. It is metabolized primarily by hepatic N-dealkylation via the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2 which forms the major metabolite (R)-1-aminoindan. It is also metabolized by hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 enzymes to form 3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan (3-OH-PAI) and 3-hydroxy-1-aminoindan (3-OH-AI). Rasagiline and its metabolites also undergo conjugation via glucuronidation. Use of rasagiline should be monitored carefully in people taking other drugs that inhibit or induce CYP1A2. Variants in CYP1A2 have been found to modify exposure to rasagiline in some studies but not others. Tobacco smoking, a known inhibitor of CYP1A2, did not modify rasagiline exposure. Drug transporters may be more important in influencing the pharmacokinetics of rasagiline than metabolizing enzymes. Exposure to rasagiline is increased in people with hepatic impairment. In those with mild hepatic impairment, peak levels of rasagiline are increased by 38% and area-under-the-curve levels by 80%, whereas in people with moderate hepatic impairment, peak levels are increased by 83% and area-under-the-curve levels by 568%. As a result, the dosage of rasagiline should be halved to 0.5 mg/day in people with mild hepatic impairment and rasagiline is considered to be contraindicated in people with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. ==== Elimination ==== Rasagiline is eliminated primarily in urine (62%) and to a much lesser extent in feces (7%). Rasagiline is excreted unchanged in urine at an amount of less than 1%. Hence, it is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion. The elimination half-life of rasagiline is 1.34 hours. At steady-state, its half-life is 3 hours. As rasagiline acts as an irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, its actions and duration of effect are not dependent on its half-life or sustained concentrations in the body. The oral clearance of rasagiline is 94.3 L/h and is similar to normal liver blood flow (90 L/h). This indicates that non-hepatic mechanisms are not significantly involved in the elimination of rasagiline. Moderate renal impairment did not modify exposure to rasagiline, whereas that of (R)-1-aminoindan was increased by 1.5-fold. Since (R)-1-aminoindan is not an MAO inhibitor, mild to moderate renal impairment does not require dosage adjustment of rasagiline. No data are available in the case of severe or end-stage renal impairment. == Chemistry == Rasagiline, also known as (R)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan and by its former developmental code name TVP-1012, is a secondary cyclic benzylamine propargylamine. It is the R(+)-enantiomer of the chiral racemic compound AGN-1135 (N-propargyl-1-aminoindan), whereas the S(–)-enantiomer is TVP-1022 ((S)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan). Rasagiline is a potent and selective MAO-B inhibitor, whereas TVP-1022 is a very weak and poorly selective MAO inhibitor. Both the hydrochloride and mesylate salts of rasagiline were studied and were found to have similar pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profiles. However, the mesylate salt of rasagiline was ultimately selected for its use as a pharmaceutical drug due to favorable chemical stability. The propargyl moiety is essential in the pharmacodynamics of rasagiline. It binds covalently and irreversibly with the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) moiety of the MAO enzyme. The selectivity of rasagiline for MAO-B over MAO-A depends on the maintenance of a distance of no more than two carbon atoms between the aromatic ring and the N-propargyl group. The propargyl group of rasagiline is also essential for its neuroprotective and antiapoptopic actions, which are independent of its MAO inhibition. Rasagiline is closely structurally related to selegiline (R(–)-N-propargylmethamphetamine). However, in contrast to selegiline, rasagiline is not a substituted amphetamine and is instead an 1-aminoindan derivative. The chemical structures of the amphetamines and aminoindans are very similar. However, whereas selegiline metabolizes into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine and can produce amphetamine-like effects, rasagiline does not do so. Instead, it metabolizes into (R)-1-aminoindan (TVP-136) and has no such actions. SU-11739 (AGN-1133; N-methyl-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan), the N-methylated analogue of rasagiline, is also an MAO-B-preferring MAOI. However, it is less selective for inhibition of MAO-B over MAO-A than rasagiline. Another structurally related selective MAO-B inhibitor, ladostigil (N-propargyl-(3R)-aminoindan-5-yl-N-propylcarbamate; TV-3326), was developed from structural modification of rasagiline and additionally acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor due to its carbamate moiety. Rasagiline and its metabolite (R)-1-aminoindan are structurally related to 2-aminoindan and derivatives like 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane (MDAI), 5,6-methylenedioxy-N-methyl-2-aminoindane (MDMAI), and 5-iodo-2-aminoindane (5-IAI). == History == AGN-1135, the racemic form of the drug, was invented by Aspro Nicholas in the early 1970s. Moussa B. H. Youdim identified it as a potential drug for Parkinson's disease, and working with collaborators at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in Israel and the drug company, Teva Pharmaceuticals, identified the R-isomer as the active form of the drug. Teva brought it to market in partnership with Lundbeck in the European Union and Eisai in the United States and elsewhere. Prior to the discovery of rasagiline, a closely related analogue called SU-11739 (AGN-1133; J-508; N-methyl-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan) was patented in 1965. At first, the N-methyl was necessary for the agent to be considered a ring cyclized analogue of pargyline with about 20 times the potency. However, the N-methyl compound was a non-selective MAOI. In addition, SU-11739 has been reported to have strong catecholamine-releasing actions. Racemic rasagiline was discovered and patented by Aspro Nicholas in the 1970s as a drug candidate for treatment of hypertension. Moussa B. H. Youdim was involved in developing selegiline as a drug for Parkinson's, in collaboration with Peter Reiderer. He called the compound AGN 1135. In 1996 Youdim, in collaboration with scientists from Technion and the US National Institutes of Health, and using compounds developed with Teva Pharmaceuticals, published a paper in which the authors wrote that they were inspired by the racemic nature of deprenyl and the greater activity of one of its stereoisomers, L-deprenyl, which became selegiline, to explore the qualities of the isomers of the Aspro compound, and they found that the R-isomer had almost all the activity; this is the compound that became rasagiline. They called the mesylate salt of the R-isomer TVP-1012 and the hydrochloride salt, TVP-101. Teva and Technion filed patent applications for this racemically pure compound, methods to make it, and methods to use it to treat Parkinson's disease and other disorders, and Technion eventually assigned its rights to Teva. Teva began development of rasagiline, and by 1999 was in Phase III trials, and entered into a partnership with Lundbeck in which Lundbeck agreed to share the costs and obtained the joint right to market the drug in the European Union. In 2003, Teva partnered with Eisai, giving Eisai the right to jointly market the drug for Parkinson's in the US, and to co-develop and co-market the drug for Alzheimers and other neurological diseases. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency for Parkinson's in 2005 and in the United States in 2006. Following its approval, rasagiline was described by some authors as a ""me-too drug"" that offered nothing new in terms of effectiveness and tolerability compared to selegiline. However, others have contended that rasagiline shows significant differences from and improvements over selegiline, like its lack of amphetamine metabolites and associated monoamine releasing agent effects, which may improve tolerability and safety. Conversely, others have maintained that rasagiline may be less efficacious than selegiline due to its lack of catecholaminergic activity enhancer actions. == Society and culture == === Names === Rasagiline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. It is also known by its former developmental code name TVP-1012. Rasagiline is marketed under the brand name Azilect, among others. === Generic forms === Lower-cost generic versions of rasagiline are available. == Research == === Neurodegenerative diseases === Rasagiline was under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, development was discontinued. Rasagiline was tested for efficacy in people with multiple system atrophy in a large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind disease-modification trial; the drug failed. Rasagiline has been reported to improve symptoms in people with freezing gait. Rasagiline has been studied in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease). === Psychiatric disorders === Rasagiline has been described as an emerging potential antidepressant. MAO-B inhibitors have been found to reduce depressive symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease with a small effect size. However, rasagiline does not appear to have been studied in the treatment of depression in people without Parkinson's disease and it has not been developed nor approved for the treatment depression. In an animal study, selegiline was effective in models of antidepressant-like activity, whereas rasagiline was ineffective. The antidepressant effects of selegiline in animals appear to be independent of monoamine oxidase inhibition and may be related to its catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) activity, which rasagiline lacks. Rasagiline has not been studied in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction as of 2015. === Other conditions === Rasagiline has been reported to improve restless legs syndrome (RLS). == Notes == == References ==",Azilect,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4305012882687151e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016604475968051702)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/azilect.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Azilect: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/azilect.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3053,"('Anethole', 'Anise camphor', 'P-propenylanisole', 'Isoestragole', 'Trans-anethole')","Food, Medical","Anethole (also known as anise camphor) is an organic compound that is widely used as a flavoring substance. It is a derivative of the aromatic compound allylbenzene and occurs widely in the essential oils of plants. It is in the class of phenylpropanoid organic compounds. It contributes a large component of the odor and flavor of anise and fennel (both in the botanical family Apiaceae), anise myrtle (Myrtaceae), liquorice (Fabaceae), magnolia blossoms, and star anise (Schisandraceae). Closely related to anethole is its isomer estragole, which is abundant in tarragon (Asteraceae) and basil (Lamiaceae), and has a flavor reminiscent of anise. It is a colorless, fragrant, mildly volatile liquid. Anethole is only slightly soluble in water but exhibits high solubility in ethanol. This trait causes certain anise-flavored liqueurs to become opaque when diluted with water; this is called the ouzo effect. == Structure and production == Anethole is an aromatic, unsaturated ether related to lignols. It exists as both cis–trans isomers (see also E–Z notation), involving the double bond outside the ring. The more abundant isomer, and the one preferred for use, is the trans or E isomer. Like related compounds, anethole is poorly soluble in water. Historically, this property was used to detect adulteration in samples. Most anethole is obtained from turpentine-like extracts from trees. Of only minor commercial significance, anethole can also be isolated from essential oils. Currently Banwari Chemicals Pvt Ltd situated in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, India is the leading manufacturer of anethole. It is prepared commercially from 4-methoxypropiophenone, which is prepared from anisole. == Uses == === Flavoring === Anethole is distinctly sweet, measuring 13 times sweeter than sugar. It is perceived as being pleasant to the taste by many even at higher concentrations. It is used in alcoholic drinks ouzo, rakı, anisette and absinthe, among others. It is also used in seasoning and confectionery applications, such as German Lebkuchen, oral hygiene products, and in small quantities in natural berry flavors. === Precursor to other compounds === Because they metabolize anethole into several aromatic chemical compounds, some bacteria are candidates for use in commercial bioconversion of anethole to more valuable materials. Bacterial strains capable of using trans-anethole as the sole carbon source include JYR-1 (Pseudomonas putida) and TA13 (Arthrobacter aurescens). == Research == === Antimicrobial and antifungal activity === Anethole has potent antimicrobial properties, against bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. Reported antibacterial properties include both bacteriostatic and bactericidal action against Salmonella enterica but not when used against Salmonella via a fumigation method. Antifungal activity includes increasing the effectiveness of some other phytochemicals (such as polygodial) against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans; In vitro, anethole has antihelmintic action on eggs and larvae of the sheep gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus. Anethole also has nematicidal activity against the plant nematode Meloidogyne javanica in vitro and in pots of cucumber seedlings. === Insecticidal activity === Anethole also is a promising insecticide. Several essential oils consisting mostly of anethole have insecticidal action against larvae of the mosquito Ochlerotatus caspius and Aedes aegypti. In a similar manner, anethole itself is effective against the fungus gnat Lycoriella ingenua (Sciaridae) and the mold mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae. Against the mite, anethole is a slightly more effective pesticide than DEET, but anisaldehyde, a related natural compound that occurs with anethole in many essential oils, is 14 times more effective. The insecticidal action of anethole is greater as a fumigant than as a contact agent. trans-Anethole is highly effective as a fumigant against the cockroach Blattella germanica and against adults of the weevils Sitophilus oryzae, Callosobruchus chinensis and beetle Lasioderma serricorne. As well as an insect pesticide, anethole is an effective insect repellent against mosquitos. === Ouzo effect === Anethole is responsible for the ""ouzo effect"" (also ""louche effect""), the spontaneous formation of a microemulsion that gives many alcoholic beverages containing anethole and water their cloudy appearance. Such a spontaneous microemulsion has many potential commercial applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. === Precursor to illicit drugs === Anethole is an inexpensive chemical precursor for paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), and is used in its clandestine manufacture. Anethole is present in the essential oil from guarana, which has psychoactive effects typically attributed to its caffeine content. The absence of PMA or any other known psychoactive derivative of anethole in human urine after ingestion of guarana leads to the conclusion that any psychoactive effect of guarana is not due to aminated anethole metabolites. Anethole is also present in absinthe, a liquor with a reputation for psychoactive effects; these effects, however, are attributed to ethanol. (See also thujone, anethole dithione (ADT), and anethole trithione (ATT).) === Estrogen and prolactin === Anethole has estrogenic activity. It has been found to significantly increase uterine weight in immature female rats. Fennel, which contains anethole, has been found to have a galactagogue effect in animals. Anethole bears a structural resemblance to catecholamines like dopamine and may displace dopamine from its receptors and thereby disinhibit prolactin secretion, which in turn may be responsible for the galactagogue effects. == Safety == In the USA, anethole is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). After a hiatus due to safety concerns, anethole was reaffirmed by Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) as GRAS. The concerns related to liver toxicity and possible carcinogenic activity reported in rats. Anethole is associated with a slight increase in liver cancer in rats, although the evidence is scant and generally regarded as evidence that anethole is not a carcinogen. An evaluation of anethole by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) found its notable pharmacologic properties to be reduction in motor activity, lowering of body temperature, and hypnotic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant effects. A subsequent evaluation by JECFA found some reason for concern regarding carcinogenicity, but there is currently insufficient data to support this. At this time, the JECFA summary of these evaluations is that anethole has ""no safety concern at current levels of intake when used as a flavoring agent"". In large quantities, anethole is slightly toxic and may act as an irritant. == History == That an oil could be extracted from anise and fennel had been known since the Renaissance by the German alchemist Hieronymus Brunschwig (c. 1450 – c. 1512), the German botanist Adam Lonicer (1528–1586), and the German physician Valerius Cordus (1515–1544), among others. Anethole was first investigated chemically by the Swiss chemist Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure in 1820. In 1832, the French chemist Jean Baptiste Dumas determined that the crystallizable components of anise oil and fennel oil were identical, and he determined anethole's empirical formula. In 1845, the French chemist Charles Gerhardt coined the term anethol – from the Latin anethum (anise) + oleum (oil) – for the fundamental compound from which a family of related compounds was derived. Although the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer proposed the correct molecular structure for anethole in 1866, it was not until 1872, that the structure was accepted as correct. == See also == Category:Anise liqueurs and spirits List of liqueurs § Anise-flavored liqueurs Anol Chavicol Dianethole Fenchone Pseudoisoeugenol Safrole == References == == External links == Media related to Anethole at Wikimedia Commons",Trans-anethole,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -2.975612187583465e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.20147249102592468), (' PERSONAL', -0.5760446190834045), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.06211669743061066), (' INDUSTR', -5.0259150157216936e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0006467396160587668), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.1269981861114502), ('ĠINDU', -0.11096619814634323), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1002366691827774)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.20141352713108063), (' INDUSTR', -0.006716555915772915), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8839413/,https://dormer.com/product/trans-anethole/,https://www.ewg.org/cleaners/substances/17176-transANETHOLE/ ', [])"
3054,"('Doxazosin (mesylate)', 'Uk 33274 mesylate', 'Doxazosin', 'Doxazosine', 'Doxazosina')",Medical,"Doxazosin, sold under the brand name Cardura among others, is a medication used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), hypertension (high blood pressure), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For high blood pressure, it is a less preferred option. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, swelling, nausea, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Severe side effects may include low blood pressure with standing, an irregular heart beat, and priapism. It is a selective α1-adrenergic blocker in the quinazoline class of compounds. Doxazosin was patented in 1977 and came into medical use in 1988. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 180th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === High blood pressure === Doxazosin is usually added to other antihypertensive therapy such as calcium channel antagonists, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers. Doxazosin is generally considered to be safe, well tolerated and effective as an add-on (adjunctive) antihypertensive drug. Like other alpha-1 receptor antagonists, it has a role in the peri-operative management of pheochromocytoma. === Benign prostatic hyperplasia === Doxazosin is considered to be effective in reducing urinary symptom scores and improving peak urinary flow in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The bladder neck is densely packed with alpha-1 receptors. === PTSD nightmares and flashbacks === Sympatholytic drugs, including prazosin and doxazosin, are used for nightmares and flashbacks in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Doxazosin is very well tolerated for this constellation of symptoms. Given its long half-life, doxazosin lasts much longer than prazosin. While prazosin is dosed up to 4 times daily, doxazosin is generally dosed only once daily (at night). Both are alpha-1 antagonists. Other sympatholytic drugs include clonidine and guanfacine, which are alpha-2 agonists; they are not in the same exact class as doxazosin and prazosin. == History == The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study stopped its arm of the trial looking at alpha blockers, because doxazosin was less effective than a simple diuretic, and because patients on doxazosin had a 25% higher rate of cardiovascular disease and twice the rate of congestive heart failure as patients on diuretics. Pfizer, aware of the results before publication, launched a marketing campaign in early 2000, and sales were largely unaffected, despite the dangers highlighted by the study. The decision to stop the trial was controversial because the higher rate of heart failure (HF) in the doxazosin group could have been caused by misdiagnosis due to fluid retention from the medication, or because patients with existing HF stopped their diuretic treatment to switch to doxazosin. However, in the later ASCOT trial, where doxazosin was used as a third-line treatment, there was no increase in HF risk. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In the US, Cardura is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Research == A 2021 study associated doxazosin with decelerated biological aging in humans and confirmed its causal role in longevity in C. elegans. == References ==",Doxazosin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.07287787614041e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021753329201601446)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a693045.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Doxazosin: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a693045.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Ganetespib is a potent non-geldanamycin analogue, and avoids the toxicities associated with older analogues due to its small molecular weight, lipophilicity and the absence of the benzoquinone moiety; strong pre-clinical data support its evaluation in lung cancer, especially small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Areas covered: The chemical structure of ganetespib, the biology of Hsp90 in cancer and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data related to ganetespib are summarized; data from preclinical studies and multiple Phase I-III clinical trials, with a focus on its evaluation in SCLC are reviewed. Expert opinion: Recent progress made in the treatment of refractory SCLC with immune checkpoint inhibitors and DLL3-directed antibody-drug conjugate have made the development of ganetespib particularly challenging in SCLC. Hsp90 remains a critical therapeutic target. Hsp90 inhibitors with a wider therapeutic index and combinations with drugs targeting iHsp90 co-chaperones such as Cdc37 or Protein Kinase 2 may need to be explored in the future. Under stressful conditions, the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) molecular chaperone protects cellular proteins (client proteins) from degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HSP90 expression is upregulated in cancers, and this contributes to the malignant phenotype of increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis and maintenance of metastatic potential via conservation of its client proteins, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, Akt, Raf-1, cell cycle proteins, and B-cell lymphoma 2 among others. Hence, inhibition of HSP90 leads to the simultaneous degradation of its many clients, thereby disrupting multiple oncogenic signaling cascades. This has sparked tremendous interest in the development of HSP90 inhibitors as an innovative anticancer strategy. Based on the wealth of compelling data from preclinical studies, a number of HSP90 inhibitors have entered into clinical testing. However, despite enormous promise and anticancer activity reported to date, none of the HSP90 inhibitors in development has been approved for cancer therapy, and the full potential of this class of agents is yet to be realized. This article provides a review on ganetespib, a small molecule HSP90 inhibitor that is currently under evaluation in a broad range of cancer types in combination with other therapeutic agents with the hope of further enhancing its efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. Based on our current understanding of the complex HSP90 machinery combined with the emerging data from these key clinical trials, ganetespib has the potential to be the first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor to be approved as a new anticancer therapy. As with many physiologic processes that become subverted during tumorigenesis, the chaperoning activity of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is often exploited by cancer cells to confer aberrant proliferative, survival, and/or metastatic potential. Functional inhibition of HSP90 results in the degradation of its client proteins, in turn providing a means to concomitantly disrupt multiple oncogenic signaling cascades through one molecular target. Pharmacologic blockade of HSP90 has, therefore, emerged as an innovative and multifaceted approach for the development of new antineoplastic agents. However, no HSP90 inhibitors are currently approved for cancer therapy and the full promise of this class of agents is yet to be realized. This review focuses on the preclinical activity profile of ganetespib, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of HSP90, the characterization of which has provided important frameworks for the optimal design and application of HSP90 inhibitor-based strategies in a variety of cancer types. Beyond client protein-driven tumors, ganetespib can also potentiate the effects of other molecularly targeted and standard-of-care therapeutics while simultaneously overcoming drug resistance in multiple tumor types, thereby positioning this compound as the leading HSP90 inhibitor currently under clinical development.",Ganetespib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004078758880496025), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006923494394868612), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029766617342829704)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://seekingalpha.com/news/3392717-aldeyras-ganetespib-shows-positive-effect-in-mesothelioma-study-shares-ahead-5-percent,https://www.jcancer.org/v08p1733.htm ', [])"

Debio-0932 is a second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor that exhibited promising anticancer activity against a wide variety of cancer types with a strong binding affinity for Hsp90 and high oral bioavailability. Anticancer activities of the Debio-0932 were tested in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Molecular docking results indicated that Debio-0932 was selectively bound to the ATP binding pocket of the Hsp90 with an estimated free energy of binding - 7.24 kcal/mol. Antiproliferative activity of Debio-0932 was determined by XTT assay and Debio-0932 exhibited a cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a time and dose-depended manner. Apoptosis inducer role of Debio-0932 was evaluated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with fluorometric apoptosis/necrosis detection kit. Treatment with Debio-0932 stimulated apoptosis in both breast cancer cell lines. mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and Casp-9 were determined in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. Debio-0932 stimulated the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the up-regulation of apoptotic protein Bax and cleavage of Casp-9 in cancer cells. Moreover, the anti-invasive potential of Debio-0932 was evaluated in endothelial cells (HUVEC) by wound-healing assay. Debio-0932 decreased the migration of HUVEC cells as compared to the control group. These results indicate that Debio-0932 is a promising compound to treat triple-negative breast cancer and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and their metastases. Debio 0932 is a novel oral heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor developed for anti-cancer therapy. Surprising-ly, during the first clinical trial, one psoriasis patient experienced complete remission of his skin manifestation. However, a possible therapeutic utility of Hsp90 in psoriasis has not previously been reported. The objective of the present study was to explore the ability of Debio 0932 to alleviate psoriasis in a preclinical model. A psoriasis xenograft transplantation model was employed where skin from 5 psoriasis patients was transplanted onto immunodeficient mice (8 xenografts per donor). Debio 0932 was administered perorally daily for 3 weeks and resulted in significant clinical alleviation of psoriasis by day 11 and reduced epidermal thickness evaluated post-treatment. Alleviation of psoriasis in the psoriasis xenograft transplantation model, which may be due to Hsp90's involvement in signalling pathways that are up-regulated in psoriasis, substantiates a potential role of Debio 0932 in psoriasis treatment. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Given the diverse nature of prostate cancer and its tendency to respond differently to various treatments, combination therapies are often employed to enhance outcomes. In this study, the synergetic efficiency of chemotherapeutic drug Navitoclax and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor Debio-0932 was evaluated in human prostate cancer cell line (PC3).

3057,"('Chromocarb', 'Chromone-2-carboxylic acid', 'Atremon', 'Chromocarbe', 'Chromonecarboxylic acid')",Medical," This study was undertaken to determine the concentration of malondialdehyde, an end product of lipoperoxidation, in lens and retinal tissue postvitrectomy associated with oral administration of antioxidant flavonoids cyaninosides chloride and chromocarb diethylamine salt or N -acetylcysteine. Fifty adult pigmented rabbits were divided into five groups: (1) controls (normal eyes, malondialdehyde concentration in lens and retina); (2) vitrectomy with BSS Plus (malondialdehyde level measured 2hr after vitrectomy); (3) vitrectomy with BSS Plus and pretreatment with oral cyaninosides chloride 100mg kg day(-1)for 3 weeks (malondialdehyde level measured 2hr after surgery); (4) vitrectomy with BSS Plus and pretreatment with oral chromocarb diethylamine salt 100 mg kg day(-1)for 3 weeks (malondialdehyde level measured 2hr after surgery); and (5) vitrectomy with BSS Plus and pretreatment with oral N -acetylcysteine 200 mg kg day(-1)for 3 weeks (malondialdehyde level measured 2hr after surgery). Lens and retina samples were used to determine malondialdehyde levels using ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis was done using analysis of variance (P<0.05). The content of malondialdehyde in the normal lens was 0.036 +/- 0.017 microg g(-1); in the vitrectomized groups the malondialdehyde concentrations were as follows: (2) 0.027 +/- 0.013 microg g(-1); (3) under detection limit (detection limit=1.75x e-3 microg g(-1)); (4) under detection limit; and (5) 0.020 +/- 0.006 microg g(-1). The results showed that the malondialdehyde concentration in the normal retina was 1.160 +/- 0.361 microg g(-1), while in the vitrectomized groups with or without pretreatment (cyaninosides chloride, chromocarb diethylamine salt, and N -acetylcysteine) the malondialdehyde levels were 2.091 +/- 0.982 microg g(-1), 0.069 +/- 0.024 microg g(-1), 0.082 +/- 0.027 microg g(-1), and 0.215 +/- 0.134 microg/g(-1), respectively, all significantly different from the normal eyes (P<0.05). Vitrectomy induced increased malondialdehyde levels in the retina. Oral flavonoids are an effective protective therapy for surgically induced lipoperoxidation, especially in the retina. Intravenously injected collagenase, detectable in brain microvessels by immunological methods, partially degrades the constituents of the vascular wall and so increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Intravenous administration of collagenase is a model for diseases in which the concentration of endogenous proteases is increased. Peroral treatment of rats with chromocarb diethylamine (CD) significantly reduced the degradation of the vascular wall by intravenous collagenase, as demonstrated by a lesser permeability increase of the BBB, a shorter recovery time, lower hydroxyproline levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and a lesser decrease of the collagen content of the brain capillary basal lamina. Clove oil injection in the anterior chamber of the rabbit eye produces an uveitis and a disruption of the blood-ocular barrier which can be evaluated by the leakage of 125I-radiolabelled rabbit serum albumin (RSA) administered intravenously. In the normal rabbit eye the amount of RSA in the aqueous humor is quite small. The disruption of the blood-ocular barrier by clove oil injection increases the RSA level in the anterior chamber of the eye. Topically applied chromocarb diethylamine reduces significantly the disruption of the blood-ocular barrier in the inflamed eye.

3058,"('Cambinol',)",Medical," The accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which is synthesized by UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), is associated with several diseases, including Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. Since the inhibition of UGCG can be used to treat diseases caused by GlcCer accumulation, several UGCG inhibitors have been developed. In this study, we report on the inhibition of UGCG activity by cambinol, a sirtuin inhibitor. Unlike conventional UGCG inhibitors, cambinol has no structural similarity to GlcCer. LC-ESI MS/MS analysis revealed that the cellular GlcCer levels were reduced by cambinol with an increase in ceramide, the GlcCer precursor. Histidine 193 plays an important role in the inhibition of UGCG via a known UGCG inhibitor, D-PDMP. However, cambinol was found to inhibit UGCG activity in a histidine 193-independent manner. This study provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition of UGCG activity by cambinol, and provides a basis for the development of a cambinol-based novel UGCG inhibitor. Methyltrioxorhenium mediated oxidative addition/elimination nucleophilic substitution yielded alkylamino and arylamino cambinol derivatives characterized by anti-proliferative activity against wild-type and p53 mutated MGH-U1 and RT112 bladder cancer cell lines. Some of the novel compounds showed an activity higher than that of the lead compound. The reaction was highly regioselective, affording for the first time a panel of C-2 cambinol substitution products. Aliphatic primary and secondary amines, and primary aromatic amines, were used as nitrogen centered nucleophiles. Surprisingly, the antiproliferative activity of C-2 substituted cambinol derivatives was not correlated to the induction of p53 protein, as evaluated by the analysis of the cell viability on wild-type and p53 mutated cancer cell lines, and further confirmed by western blot analyses. These data suggest that they exert their antiproliferative activity by a mechanism completely different from cambinol. Ceramide is a bioactive lipid that plays an important role in stress responses leading to apoptosis, cell growth arrest and differentiation. Ceramide production is due in part to sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinases. In brain, neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is expressed in neurons and increases in its activity and expression have been associated with pro-inflammatory conditions observed in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) patients. Increased nSMase2 activity translates into higher ceramide levels and neuronal cell death, which can be prevented by chemical or genetic inhibition of nSMase2 activity or expression. However, to date, there are no soluble, specific and potent small molecule inhibitor tool compounds for in vivo studies or as a starting point for medicinal chemistry optimization. Moreover, the majority of the known inhibitors were identified using bacterial, bovine or rat nSMase2. In an attempt to identify new inhibitor scaffolds, two activity assays were optimized as screening platform using the recombinant human enzyme. First, active hits were identified using a fluorescence-based high throughput compatible assay. Then, hits were confirmed using a 14C sphingomyelin-based direct activity assay. Pharmacologically active compounds and approved drugs were screened using this strategy which led to the identification of cambinol as a novel uncompetitive nSMase2 inhibitor (Ki = 7 μM). The inhibitory activity of cambinol for nSMase2 was approximately 10-fold more potent than for its previously known target, silence information regulator 1 and 2 (SIRT1/2). Cambinol decreased tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1 β-induced increases of ceramide and cell death in primary neurons. A preliminary study of cambinol structure and activity allowed the identification of the main structural features required for nSMase2 inhibition. Cambinol and its analogs may be useful as nSMase2 inhibitor tool compounds to prevent ceramide-dependent neurodegeneration.",Cambinol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.6939193606376648), ('ICAL', -2.169585604860913e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47410672903060913)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.4140441635390744e-05)])","('INFO; https://www.scbt.com/p/sirt1-2-inhibitor-iv-cambinol-14513-15-6,https://www.rndsystems.com/products/cambinol_7137,https://www.abcam.com/en-us/products/biochemicals/cambinol-sirt1-2-inhibitor-ab141181 ', [])"
3059,"('Pyridostigmine (bromide)', 'Pyridostigmine', 'Pyridostigminum', 'Mestinon', 'Regonol')",Medical,"Pyridostigmine is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis and underactive bladder. It is also used together with atropine to end the effects of neuromuscular blocking medication of the non-depolarizing type. It is also used off-label to treat some forms of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. It is typically given by mouth but can also be used by injection. The effects generally begin within 45 minutes and last up to 4 hours. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, frequent urination, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects include low blood pressure, weakness, and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the fetus. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in the cholinergic family of medications. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase and therefore increases the levels of acetylcholine. Pyridostigmine was patented in 1945 and came into medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Pyridostigmine is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Pyridostigmine is used to treat muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis or forms of congenital myasthenic syndrome and to combat the effects of curariform drug toxicity. Pyridostigmine bromide has been FDA approved for military use during combat situations as an agent to be given prior to exposure to the nerve agent Soman in order to increase survival. Used in particular during the first Gulf War, pyridostigmine bromide has been implicated as a causal factor in Gulf War syndrome. With pyridostigmine classified as a type of parasympathomimetic, it can be used to treat underactive bladder. Pyridostigmine sometimes is used to treat orthostatic hypotension. It may also be of benefit in chronic axonal polyneuropathy. It is also being prescribed off-label for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) as well as complications resulting from Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. == Contraindications == Pyridostigmine bromide is contraindicated in cases of mechanical intestinal or urinary obstruction and should be used with caution in patients with bronchial asthma. == Side effects == Common side effects include: Sweating Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Abdominal cramps Increased salivation Tearing Increased bronchial secretions Constricted pupils Facial flushing due to vasodilation Erectile dysfunction Additional side effects include: Muscle twitching Muscle cramps and weakness == Mechanism of action == Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It inhibits acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft, thus slowing down the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Like its predecessor neostigmine, it is a quaternary carbamate inhibitor of cholinesterase that does not cross the blood–brain barrier. It carbamylates about 30% of peripheral cholinesterase enzyme, and the carbamylated enzyme eventually regenerates by natural hydrolysis and excess acetylcholine (ACh) levels revert to normal. The ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the post synaptic membrane, causing an influx of sodium (Na+,) resulting in depolarization. If large enough, this depolarization results in an action potential. To prevent constant stimulation once the ACh is released, an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase is present in the endplate membrane close to the receptors on the post synaptic membrane, and quickly hydrolyses ACh. == Names == Pyridostigmine bromide is available under the trade name Mestinon (Valeant Pharmaceuticals), Regonol and Gravitor (SUN Pharma). == References == == External links == ""Pyridostigmine"".

3061,"('Benzophenone', 'Diphenylmethanone', 'Diphenyl ketone', 'Methanone, diphenyl-', 'Benzoylbenzene')","Medical, Personal Care","Benzophenone is a naturally occurring organic compound with the formula (C6H5)2CO, generally abbreviated Ph2CO. Benzophenone has been found in some fungi, fruits and plants, including grapes. It is a white solid with a low melting point and rose-like odor that is soluble in organic solvents. Benzophenone is the simplest diaromatic ketone. It is a widely used building block in organic chemistry, being the parent diarylketone. == History == Carl Graebe of the University of Königsberg, in an early literature report from 1874, described working with benzophenone. == Uses == Benzophenone can be used as a photo initiator in ultraviolet (UV)-curing applications such as inks, imaging, and clear coatings in the printing industry. Benzophenone prevents UV light from damaging scents and colors in products such as perfumes and soaps. Benzophenone can also be added to plastic packaging as a UV blocker to prevent photo-degradation of the packaging polymers or its contents. Its use allows manufacturers to package the product in clear glass or plastic (such as a PETE water bottle). Without it, opaque or dark packaging would be required. In biological applications, benzophenones have been used extensively as photophysical probes to identify and map peptide–protein interactions. Benzophenone is used as an additive in flavorings or perfumes for ""sweet-woody-geranium-like notes"". == Synthesis == Benzophenone is produced by the copper-catalyzed oxidation of diphenylmethane with air. A laboratory route involves the reaction of benzene with carbon tetrachloride followed by hydrolysis of the resulting diphenyldichloromethane. It can also be prepared by Friedel–Crafts acylation of benzene with benzoyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium chloride) catalyst: since benzoyl chloride can itself be produced by the reaction of benzene with phosgene the first synthesis proceeded directly from those materials. Another route of synthesis is through a palladium(II)/oxometalate catalyst. This converts an alcohol to a ketone with two groups on each side. Another, less well-known reaction to produce benzophenone is the pyrolysis of anhydrous calcium benzoate. == Organic chemistry == Benzophenone is a common photosensitizer in photochemistry. It crosses from the S1 state into the triplet state with nearly 100% yield. The resulting diradical will abstract a hydrogen atom from a suitable hydrogen donor to form a ketyl radical. === Radical anion === Alkali metals reduce benzophenone to the deeply blue colored radical anion, diphenylketyl: M + Ph2CO → M+Ph2CO•− Generally sodium is used as the alkali metal. Sodium-benzophenone ketyl is used in the purification of organic solvents, particularly ethers, because it reacts with water and oxygen to give non-volatile products. Adsorbents such as alumina, silica gel, and especially molecular sieves are superior and far safer. The sodium-benzophenone method is common since it gives a visual indication that water, oxygen, and peroxides are absent from the solvent. Large scale purification may be more economical using devices which utilize adsorbents such as the aforementioned alumina or molecular sieves. The ketyl is soluble in the organic solvent being dried, which leads to faster purification. In comparison, sodium is insoluble, and its heterogeneous reaction is much slower. When excess alkali metal is present a second reduction may occur, resulting in a color transformation from deep blue to purple: M + M+Ph2CO•− → (M+)2(Ph2CO)2− == Commercially significant derivatives and analogues == There are over 300 natural benzophenones, with great structural diversity and biological activities. They are being investigated as potential sources of new drugs. Substituted benzophenones such as oxybenzone and dioxybenzone are used in many sunscreens. The use of benzophenone-derivatives which structurally resemble a strong photosensitizer has been criticized (see sunscreen controversy). Michler's ketone has dimethylamino substituents at each para position. The high-strength polymer PEEK is prepared from derivatives of benzophenone. 2-Amino-5-chlorobenzophenone is used in the synthesis of benzodiazepines. == Safety == It is considered ""essentially nontoxic"". Benzophenone is however banned as a food additive by the US Food and Drug Administration, despite the FDA's continuing stance that this chemical does not pose a risk to public health under the conditions of its intended use. The European Union permits it as a flavouring substance, having established a Total Dietary Intake of 0.3mg/kg of body weight per day. Benzophenone derivatives are known to be pharmacologically active. From a molecular chemistry point of view interaction of benzophenone with B-DNA has been demonstrated experimentally. The interaction with DNA and the successive photo-induced energy transfer is at the base of the benzophenone activity as a DNA photosensitizer and may explain part of its therapeutic potentialities. In 2014, benzophenones were named Contact Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. Benzophenone is an endocrine disruptor capable of binding to the pregnane X receptor. == References ==",Benzoylbenzene,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.3209392726421356), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.2519626319408417), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -2.7968066206085496e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.001708732801489532), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('IN', -0.4793655276298523), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.000753357307985425), ('ĠFOOD', -0.39261308312416077), (',', -0.10048380494117737), ('ĠPERSON', -0.008958621881902218), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5765012502670288)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10020667314529419)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/application-and-preparation-of-benzophenone.htm,https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Benzoylbenzene ', [])"
3062,"('Thymine', 'Thymin', 'Thymine anhydrate', 'Thymin (purine base)', 'Thy')","Endogenous, Medical","Thymine () (symbol T or Thy) is one of the four nucleotide bases in the nucleic acid of DNA that are represented by the letters G–C–A–T. The others are adenine, guanine, and cytosine. Thymine is also known as 5-methyluracil, a pyrimidine nucleobase. In RNA, thymine is replaced by the nucleobase uracil. Thymine was first isolated in 1893 by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann from calf thymus glands, hence its name. == Derivation == As its alternate name (5-methyluracil) suggests, thymine may be derived by methylation of uracil at the 5th carbon. In RNA, thymine is replaced with uracil in most cases. In DNA, thymine (T) binds to adenine (A) via two hydrogen bonds, thereby stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. Thymine combined with deoxyribose creates the nucleoside deoxythymidine, which is synonymous with the term thymidine. Thymidine can be phosphorylated with up to three phosphoric acid groups, producing dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). One of the common mutations of DNA involves two adjacent thymines or cytosine, which, in presence of ultraviolet light, may form thymine dimers, causing ""kinks"" in the DNA molecule that inhibit normal function. Thymine could also be a target for actions of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in cancer treatment. 5-FU can be a metabolic analog of thymine (in DNA synthesis) or uracil (in RNA synthesis). Substitution of this analog inhibits DNA synthesis in actively dividing cells. Thymine bases are frequently oxidized to hydantoins over time after the death of an organism. == Thymine imbalance causes mutation == During growth of bacteriophage T4, an imbalance of thymine availability, either a deficiency or an excess of thymine, causes increased mutation. The mutations caused by thymine deficiency appear to occur only at AT base pair sites in DNA and are often AT to GC transition mutations. In the bacterium Escherichia coli, thymine deficiency was also found to cause the same mutation. == Theoretical aspects == In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), another carbon-rich compound, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists. Thymine has not been found in meteorites, which suggests the first strands of DNA had to look elsewhere to obtain this building block. Thymine likely formed within some meteorite parent bodies, but may not have persisted within these bodies due to an oxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide. == Synthesis == === Laboratory synthesis === Thymine was first prepared by hydrolysis of the corresponding nucleoside obtained from natural sources. Interest in its direct chemical synthesis began in the early 1900s: Emil Fischer published a method starting from urea but a more practical synthesis used methylisothiourea in a condensation reaction with ethyl formyl propionate, followed by hydrolysis of the pyrimidine intermediate: Many other preparative methods have been developed, including optimised conditions so that urea can be used directly in the reaction shown above, preferably with methyl formyl propionate. == See also == == References == == External links == Thymine MS Spectrum Infoplease Encyclopedia Science Aid: DNA Structure and Replication",Thymin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0008975276723504066), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017982252757064998), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.008791903965175152), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.318072337307967e-06), ('OUS', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6934017539024353)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/thymine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=12, title='Thymine | DNA, Nucleotide, Base Pairing | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/thymine?utm_source=openai')])"
3063,"('Fexofenadine (hydrochloride)', 'Terfenadine carboxylate (hydrochloride)', 'Fexofenadine', 'Carboxyterfenadine', 'Terfenadine carboxylate')",Medical,"Fexofenadine, sold under the brand name Allegra among others, is an antihistamine pharmaceutical drug used in the treatment of allergy symptoms, such as hay fever and urticaria. Therapeutically, fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 blocker. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine because it is less able to pass the blood–brain barrier and cause sedation, compared to first-generation antihistamines. It was patented in 1979 and came into medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Fexofenadine has been manufactured in generic form since 2011. In 2022, it was the 257th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fexofenadine is used for relief from physical symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and for treatment of hives, including chronic urticaria. It does not cure, but rather prevents the aggravation of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, and reduces the severity of the symptoms associated with those conditions, providing relief from repeated sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes or skin, and general body fatigue. In a 2018 review, fexofenadine, along with levocetirizine, desloratadine, and cetirizine, was cited to be a safe drug to use for individuals with inherited long QT syndrome. === Efficacy === For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, fexofenadine is similarly effective to cetirizine, but is associated with less drowsiness than cetirizine. Fexofenadine was also shown to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare to a significantly greater degree than loratadine or desloratadine, but was slightly less effective than levocetirizine. Fexofenadine at doses above 120 mg a day does not appear to provide additional efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. == Side effects == The most common side effects include headache, back and muscle pain, miosis or pinpoint pupils, nausea, drowsiness, and menstrual cramps. Anxiety and insomnia have also been rarely reported. The most common side effects demonstrated during clinical trials were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, and otitis media for children ages 6 to 11 and fatigue for children ages 6 months to 5 years. == Overdose == The safety profile of fexofenadine is quite favorable, as no cardiovascular or sedative effects have been shown to occur even when taking 10 times the recommended dose. Research on humans ranges from a single 800-mg dose, to a twice-daily, 690-mg dose for a month, with no clinically significant adverse effects, when compared to a placebo. No deaths occurred in testing on mice, at 5000 mg/kg body weight, which is 110 times the maximum recommended dose for an adult human. If an overdose were to occur, supportive measures are recommended. Theoretically, an overdose could present as dizziness, dry mouth, and/or drowsiness, consistent with an exaggeration of the usual side effects. Hemodialysis does not appear to be an effective means of removing fexofenadine from the blood. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist. Blockage prevents the activation of the H1 receptors by histamine, preventing the symptoms associated with allergies from occurring. Fexofenadine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so is less likely to cause drowsiness in comparison to other antihistamines that readily cross that barrier (i.e., first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine). In general, fexofenadine takes about an hour to take effect, though this may be affected by the choice of dosage form and the presence of certain foods. Fexofenadine also exhibits no anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking effects. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption: After oral application, maximum plasma concentrations are reached after 2–3 hours. Fexofenadine should not be taken with a high-fat meal, as mean concentrations of fexofenadine in the bloodstream are seen to be reduced by 20–60% depending on the form of medication (tablet, ODT, or suspension). Distribution: Fexofenadine is 60–70% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Metabolism: Fexofenadine is a substrate of CYP3A4, but only about 5% is metabolized by the liver, indicating that hepatic metabolism is relatively minor in clearance from the body. Elimination: Most of the substance is eliminated unchanged via the feces (80%) and urine (11–12%). == Interactions == Taking erythromycin or ketoconazole while taking fexofenadine does increase the plasma levels of fexofenadine, but this increase does not influence the QT interval. The reason for this effect is likely due to transport-related effects, specifically involving p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Both erythromycin and ketoconazole are inhibitors of p-gp, a transporter protein involved in preventing the intestinal absorption of fexofenadine. When p-gp is inhibited, fexofenadine may be better absorbed by the body, increasing its plasma concentration by more than intended. Fexofenadine is not to be taken with apple, orange, or grapefruit juice because they could decrease absorption of the drug. Therefore, it should be taken with water. Grapefruit juice can significantly reduce the plasma concentration of fexofenadine. Antacids containing aluminum or magnesium should not be taken within 15 minutes of fexofenadine, as they reduce its absorption by almost 50%. This is not thought to be due to a change in pH (in fact, absorption can actually increase under increasingly alkaline pH), but rather due to the formation of metal complexes with charged/polar moieties on fexofenadine. As suggested by Shehnaza et al (2014), various sites of the molecule are thought to be responsible for this interaction, including the piperidine nitrogen, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, and both hydroxyl (-OH) groups. == History == The older antihistaminic agent terfenadine was found to metabolize into the related carboxylic acid, fexofenadine. Fexofenadine was found to retain all of the biological activity of its parent while giving fewer adverse reactions in patients, so terfenadine was replaced in the market by its metabolite. Fexofenadine was originally synthesized in 1993 by Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Sepracor, which then sold the development rights to Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Sanofi-Aventis), and was later approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) holds the patents to the intermediates and production of fexofenadine HCl, along with Roussel. Since that time, it has achieved blockbuster drug status with global sales of US$1.87B in 2004 (with $1.49B coming from the United States). AMRI received royalty payments from Aventis which enabled the growth of AMRI. In January 2011, the FDA approved over-the-counter sales of fexofenadine in the United States, and Sanofi Aventis' version became available in March 2011. In December 2020, the MHRA reclassified fexofenadine from prescription only to allow general sales in the United Kingdom. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Fexofenadine is marketed under many brand names worldwide. As of January 2017, it is marketed as a combination drug with pseudoephedrine under brand names including Alerfedine D, Allegra-D, Allergyna-D, Allevia, Altiva-D, Dellegra, Fexo Plus, Fexofed, Fixal Plus, Ridrinal D, Rinolast D, Telfast D, and Treathay. As of January 2017, it is marketed as a combination drug with montelukast under brand names including Fexokast, Histakind-M, Monten-FX, Montolife-FX, Montair-FX and Novamont-FX. == References ==",Fexofenadine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.156323378381785e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013040646445006132)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexofenadine,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00950,https://www.drugs.com/pro/fexofenadine.html ', [])"

3068,"('Puromycin (dihydrochloride)', 'Puromycin', 'Puromycine', 'Stylomycin', 'Puromicina')",Medical,"Puromycin is an antibiotic protein synthesis inhibitor which causes premature chain termination during translation. == Inhibition of translation == Puromycin is an aminonucleoside antibiotic, derived from the Streptomyces alboniger bacterium, that causes premature chain termination during translation taking place in the ribosome. Part of the molecule resembles the 3' end of the aminoacylated tRNA. It enters the A site and transfers to the growing chain, causing the formation of a puromycylated nascent chain and premature chain release. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time but the 3' position contains an amide linkage instead of the normal ester linkage of tRNA. That makes the molecule much more resistant to hydrolysis and stops the ribosome. Puromycin is selective for either prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Also of note, puromycin is critical in mRNA display. In this reaction, a puromycin molecule is chemically attached to the end of an mRNA template, which is then translated into protein. The puromycin can then form a covalent link to the growing peptide chain allowing the mRNA to be physically linked to its translational product. Antibodies that recognize puromycylated nascent chains can also be used to purify newly synthesized polypeptides and to visualize the distribution of actively translating ribosomes by immunofluorescence. == Peptidase Inhibitor == Puromycin is a reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl-peptidase II (serine peptidase) and cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase (metallopeptidase). The mechanism of inhibition is not well understood, however puromycin can be used to distinguish between aminopeptidase M (active) and cytosol alanyl aminopeptidase (inhibited by puromycin). == Cell culture == Puromycin is used in cell biology as a selective agent in cell culture systems. It is toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Resistance to puromycin is conferred by the pac gene encoding a puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC) that was found in a Streptomyces producer strain. Puromycin is soluble in water (50 mg/mL) as colorless solution at 10 mg/mL. Puromycin is stable for one year as solution when stored at -20 °C. The recommended dose as a selection agent in cell cultures is within a range of 1-10 μg/mL, although it can be toxic to eukaryotic cells at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL. Puromycin acts quickly and can kill more than 99% of nonresistant cells within one day. == Selection of Escherichia coli == Puromycin is poorly active on E. coli. Puromycin-resistant transformants are selected in LB agar medium supplemented with 125 μg/mL of puromycin. But use of puromycin for E. coli selection requires precise pH adjustment and also depends on which strain is selected. For hassle–free selection and optimum results the use of specially modified puromycin is possible. Plates containing puromycin are stable for 1 month when stored at 4 °C. == Selection of yeast == Puromycin resistance in yeast can also be conferred through expression of the puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (pac) gene. Lethal concentrations of puromycin are much higher for strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae than mammalian cell lines. Deletion of the gene encoding the multidrug efflux pump Pdr5 sensitizes cells to puromycin. == Memory loss in mice == Long-term synaptic plasticity, such as is required for memory processes, requires morphological changes at protein level. As puromycin inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, researchers were able to show that injections of this drug will result in both short-term as well as long-term memory loss in mice. == References ==",Puromycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.1006021499633789), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.06198785454034805), (' INDUSTR', -1.6286106983898208e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01381596177816391), ('ICAL', -3.933898824470816e-06), (',', -0.10022599250078201), ('ĠINDU', -0.0020705468486994505), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001527215470559895)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00317783304490149), (' INDUSTR', -0.0001584850688232109), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32435426/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='The science of puromycin: From studies of ribosome function to applications in biotechnology - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32435426/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. Roxithromycin is derived from erythromycin, containing the same 14-membered lactone ring. but with an N-oxime side chain attached to the ring. Roxithromycin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is available under several brand names. Roxithromycin is available in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, South Korea and New Zealand, but not in the United States. It has also been shown to possess antimalarial activity. == Side effects == The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Less common side effects include central or peripheral nervous system events such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo.Rarely seen side effects are rashes, abnormal liver function values and alteration in the senses of smell and taste. == Drug interactions == Roxithromycin has fewer interactions than erythromycin as it has a lower affinity for cytochrome P450. Roxithromycin is not known to interact with hormonal contraceptives, prednisolone, carbamazepine, ranitidine or antacids. When roxithromycin is administered with theophylline, some studies have shown an increase in the plasma concentration of theophylline. A change in dosage is usually not required but patients with high levels of theophylline at the start of the treatment should have their plasma levels monitored. Roxithromycin appears to interact with warfarin. This is shown by an increase in prothrombin time and/or international normalised ratio (INR) in patients taking roxithromycin and warfarin concurrently. As a consequence, severe bleeding episodes have occurred. == Available forms == Roxithromycin is commonly available as tablets or oral suspension. == Mechanism of action == Roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the synthesis of peptides. Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly Legionella pneumophila. == Pharmacokinetics == When taken before a meal, roxithromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, roxithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of roxithromycin are released. == Metabolism == Only a small portion of roxithromycin is metabolised.
