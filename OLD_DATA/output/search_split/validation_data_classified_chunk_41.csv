Cilastatin can therefore be combined intravenously with imipenem in order to protect it from degradation, prolonging its antibacterial effect. Imipenem alone is an effective antibiotic and can be given without cilastatin. Cilastatin itself does not have antibiotic activity, although it has been proved to be active against a zinc-dependent beta-lactamase that usually confers antibiotic resistance to certain bacteria, more precisely, the carbapenem family of antibiotics. This property is due to the physicochemical similarities between membrane dipeptidase (MDP), the compound it is usually set to target, and the bacterial metallo-beta-lactamase carried by the CphA gene. The combination allows the antibiotic to be more effective by changing the pharmacokinetics involved. Thus imipenem/cilastatin, like amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, is a commonly used combination product. == References ==",Cilastatin sodium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000760385300964117), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006758686620742083)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a686013.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Imipenem and Cilastatin Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a686013.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4063,"('Lorazepam', 'Ativan', 'O-chloroxazepam', 'O-chlorooxazepam', 'Temesta')",Medical,"Lorazepam, sold under the brand name Ativan among others, is a benzodiazepine medication. It is used to treat anxiety (including anxiety disorders), insomnia, severe agitation, active seizures including status epilepticus, alcohol withdrawal, and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is also used during surgery to interfere with memory formation, to sedate those who are being mechanically ventilated, and, along with other treatments, for acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use. It can be given orally (by mouth), transdermally (on the skin via a topical gel or patch), intravenously (injection into a vein), or intramuscularly (injection into a muscle). When given by injection, onset of effects is between one and thirty minutes and effects last for up to a day. Common side effects include weakness, sleepiness, ataxia, decreased alertness, decreased memory formation, low blood pressure, and a decreased effort to breathe. When given intravenously, the person should be closely monitored. Among those who are depressed, there may be an increased risk of suicide. With long-term use, larger doses may be required for the same effect. Physical dependence and psychological dependence may also occur. If stopped suddenly after long-term use, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur. Older people more often develop adverse effects. In this age group, lorazepam is associated with falls and hip fractures. Due to these concerns, lorazepam use is generally recommended only for up to four weeks. Lorazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 80th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Anxiety === Lorazepam is used in the short-term management of severe anxiety. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises against use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for longer than four weeks. It is fast-acting, and useful in treating fast-onset anxiety and panic attacks. Lorazepam can effectively reduce agitation and induce sleep, and the duration of effects from a single dose makes it an appropriate choice for the short-term treatment of insomnia, especially in the presence of severe anxiety or night terrors. It has a fairly short duration of action. Withdrawal symptoms, including rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety, may occur after seven days of use of lorazepam. === Seizures === Intravenous diazepam or lorazepam are first-line treatments for convulsive status epilepticus. Lorazepam is more effective than diazepam and intravenous phenytoin in the treatment of status epilepticus and has a lower risk of continuing seizures that might require additional medication. However, phenobarbital has a superior success rate compared to lorazepam and other drugs, at least in the elderly. Lorazepam's anticonvulsant properties and pharmacokinetic profile make intravenous use reliable for terminating acute seizures, but induce prolonged sedation. Orally administered benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, are occasionally used as long-term prophylactic treatment of resistant absence seizures; because of gradual tolerance to their anti-seizure effects, benzodiazepines are not considered first-line therapies. Additionally, common seizure characteristics (e.g., hypersalivation, jaw-clenching, involuntary swallowing) pose some difficulties with regard to oral administration. Lorazepam's anticonvulsant and central nervous system (CNS) depressant properties are useful for the treatment and prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In this setting, impaired liver function is not a hazard with lorazepam, since lorazepam does not require oxidation, in the liver or otherwise, for its metabolism. Lorazepam is noted as being the most tolerable benzodiazepine in those with advanced-stage liver disease. === Sedation === Lorazepam is sometimes used for individuals receiving mechanical ventilation. However, in critically ill people, propofol has been found to be superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost; as a result, the use of propofol for this indication is now encouraged, whereas the use of lorazepam is discouraged. Its relative effectiveness in preventing new memory formation, along with its ability to reduce agitation and anxiety, makes lorazepam useful as premedication. It is given before a general anesthetic to reduce the amount of anesthetic required or before unpleasant awake procedures, such as in dentistry or endoscopies, to reduce anxiety, increase compliance, and induce amnesia for the procedure. Lorazepam by mouth is given 90 to 120 minutes before procedures, and intravenous lorazepam is given as late as 10 minutes before procedures. Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to midazolam in palliative sedation. In intensive care units, lorazepam is sometimes used to produce anxiolysis, hypnosis, and amnesia. === Agitation === Lorazepam is sometimes used as an alternative to haloperidol when there is the need for rapid sedation of violent or agitated individuals, but haloperidol plus promethazine is preferred due to better effectiveness and due to lorazepam's adverse effects on respiratory function. However, adverse effects such as behavioral disinhibition may make benzodiazepines inappropriate for some people who are acutely psychotic. Acute delirium is sometimes treated with lorazepam, but as it can cause paradoxical effects, it is preferably given together with haloperidol. Lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly if given intramuscularly, a common route in restraint situations. === Other === Catatonia with inability to speak is responsive to lorazepam. Symptoms may recur and treatment for some days may be necessary. Catatonia due to abrupt or overly rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines, as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, should also respond to lorazepam treatment. As lorazepam can have paradoxical effects, haloperidol is sometimes given at the same time. It is sometimes used in chemotherapy in addition to medications used to treat nausea and vomiting (i.e., nausea and vomiting caused or worsened by psychological sensitization to the thought of being sick). == Adverse effects == Many beneficial effects of lorazepam (e.g., sedative, muscle relaxant, anti-anxiety, and amnesic effects) may become adverse effects when unwanted. Adverse effects can include sedation and low blood pressure; the effects of lorazepam are increased in combination with other CNS depressants. Other adverse effects include confusion, ataxia, inhibiting the formation of new memories, pupil constriction, and hangover effects. With long-term benzodiazepine use, it is unclear whether cognitive impairments fully return to normal after stopping lorazepam use; cognitive deficits persist for at least six months after withdrawal, but longer than six months may be required for recovery of cognitive function. Lorazepam appears to have more profound adverse effects on memory than other benzodiazepines; it impairs both explicit and implicit memory. In the elderly, falls may occur as a result of benzodiazepines. Adverse effects are more common in the elderly, and they appear at lower doses than in younger people. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical effects can also occur, such as worsening of seizures, or paradoxical excitement; paradoxical excitement is more likely to occur in the elderly, children, those with a history of alcohol abuse, and in people with a history of aggression or anger problems. Lorazepam's effects are dose-dependent, meaning the higher the dose, the stronger the effects (and side effects) will be. Using the smallest dose needed to achieve desired effects lessens the risk of adverse effects. Sedative drugs and sleeping pills, including lorazepam, have been associated with an increased risk of death. Sedation is the side effect people taking lorazepam most frequently report. In a group of around 3,500 people treated for anxiety, the most common side effects complained of from lorazepam were sedation (15.9%), dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%). Side effects such as sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Cognitive impairment, behavioral disinhibition and respiratory depression as well as hypotension may also occur. Paradoxical effects: In some cases, paradoxical effects can occur with benzodiazepines, such as increased hostility, aggression, angry outbursts, and psychomotor agitation. These effects are seen more commonly with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects are more likely to occur with higher doses, in people with pre-existing personality disorders and those with a psychiatric illness. Frustrating stimuli may trigger such reactions, though the drug may have been prescribed to help the person cope with such stress and frustration in the first place. As paradoxical effects appear to be dose-related, they usually subside on dose reduction or on complete withdrawal of lorazepam. Suicidality: Benzodiazepines are associated with an increased risk of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition. Higher dosages appear to confer greater risk. Amnesic effects: Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has relatively strong amnesic effects, but people soon develop tolerance to this with regular use. To avoid amnesia (or excess sedation) being a problem, the initial total daily lorazepam dose should not exceed 2 mg. This also applies to use for night sedation. Five participants in a sleep study were prescribed lorazepam 4 mg at night, and the next evening, three subjects unexpectedly volunteered memory gaps for parts of that day, an effect that subsided completely after two to three days' use. Amnesic effects cannot be estimated from the degree of sedation present, since the two effects are unrelated. High-dose or prolonged parenterally-administered lorazepam with its associated solvent can cause propylene glycol intoxication and poisoning. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Contraindications === Lorazepam should be avoided in people with: Allergy or hypersensitivity – Past hypersensitivity or allergy to lorazepam, to any benzodiazepine, or to any of the ingredients in lorazepam tablets or injections Respiratory failure – Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may depress central nervous system respiratory drive and are contraindicated in severe respiratory failure. An example would be the inappropriate use to relieve anxiety associated with acute severe asthma. The anxiolytic effects may also be detrimental to a person's willingness and ability to fight for breath. However, if mechanical ventilation becomes necessary, lorazepam may be used to facilitate deep sedation. Acute intoxication – Lorazepam may interact synergistically with the effects of alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances. It should, therefore, not be administered to a drunk or intoxicated person. Ataxia – This is a neurological clinical sign, consisting of unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs and torso, due to the failure of gross muscle movement coordination, most evident on standing and walking. It is the classic way in which acute alcohol intoxication may affect a person. Benzodiazepines should not be administered to people who are already ataxic. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma – Lorazepam has pupil-dilating effects, which may further interfere with the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye, thus worsening narrow-angle glaucoma. Sleep apnea – Sleep apnea may be worsened by lorazepam's central nervous system depressant effects. It may further reduce the person's ability to protect his or her airway during sleep. Myasthenia gravis – This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, so a muscle relaxant such as lorazepam may exacerbate symptoms. Pregnancy and breastfeeding – Lorazepam belongs to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy category D, which means it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether lorazepam if taken early in pregnancy results in reduced intelligence, neurodevelopmental problems, physical malformations in cardiac or facial structure, or other malformations in some newborns. Lorazepam given to pregnant women antenatally may cause floppy infant syndrome in the neonate, or respiratory depression necessitating ventilation. Regular lorazepam use during late pregnancy (the third trimester), carries a definite risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal may include hypotonia, reluctance to suck, apneic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Lorazepam may also inhibit fetal liver bilirubin glucuronidation, leading to neonatal jaundice. Lorazepam is present in breast milk, so caution must be exercised about breastfeeding. === Specific groups === Children and the elderly – The safety and effectiveness of lorazepam are not well determined in children under 18 years of age, but it is used to treat acute seizures. Dose requirements have to be individualized, especially in people who are elderly and debilitated in whom the risk of oversedation is greater. Long-term therapy may lead to cognitive deficits, especially in the elderly, which may only be partially reversible. The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even at similar plasma levels. Additionally, the elderly tend to take more drugs which may interact with or enhance the effects of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, have been found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. As a result, dosage recommendations for the elderly are about half of those used in younger individuals and used for no longer than two weeks. Lorazepam may also be slower to clear in the elderly, leading potentially to accumulation and enhanced effects. Lorazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete, tolerance develops to these impairments. Liver or kidney failure – Lorazepam may be safer than most benzodiazepines in people with impaired liver function. Like oxazepam, it does not require liver oxidation, but only liver glucuronidation into lorazepam-glucuronide. Therefore, impaired liver function is unlikely to result in lorazepam accumulation to an extent causing adverse reactions. Similarly kidney disease has minimal effects on lorazepam levels. Drug and alcohol dependence – The risk of abuse of lorazepam is increased in dependent people. Comorbid psychiatric disorders also increase the risk of dependence and paradoxical adverse effects. === Tolerance and dependence === Dependence typified by a withdrawal syndrome occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated for longer than four weeks with a benzodiazepine. Higher doses and longer periods of use increase the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. Potent benzodiazepines with a relatively short half-life, such as lorazepam, alprazolam, and triazolam, have the highest risk of causing dependence. If regular treatment is continued for longer than four to six months, dose increases may be necessary to maintain effects, but treatment-resistant symptoms may in fact be benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects, benzodiazepines are generally not recommended for long-term use for the management of epilepsy. Increasing the dose may overcome tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may persist and worsen. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines is complex and involves GABAA receptor downregulation, alterations to subunit configuration of GABAA receptors, uncoupling, and internalization of the benzodiazepine binding site from the GABAA receptor complex as well as changes in gene expression. The likelihood of dependence is relatively high with lorazepam compared to other benzodiazepines. Lorazepam's relatively short serum half-life, its confinement mainly to blood, and its inactive metabolite can result in interdose withdrawal phenomena and next-dose cravings, that may reinforce psychological dependence. Because of its high potency, the smallest lorazepam tablet strength of 0.5 mg is also a significant dose. To minimise the risk of physical/psychological dependence, lorazepam is best used only short-term, at the smallest effective dose. If any benzodiazepine has been used long-term, the recommendation is a gradual dose taper over weeks, months, or longer, according to dose and duration of use, the degree of dependence and the individual. Coming off long-term lorazepam use may be more realistically achieved by a gradual switch to an equivalent dose of diazepam and a period of stabilization on this, and only then initiating dose reductions. The advantage of switching to diazepam is that dose reductions are felt less acutely, because of the longer half-lives (20–200 hours) of diazepam and its active metabolites. === Withdrawal === On abrupt or overly rapid discontinuation of lorazepam, anxiety, and signs of physical withdrawal have been observed, similar to those seen on withdrawal from alcohol and barbiturates. Lorazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Rebound effects often resemble the condition being treated, but typically at a more intense level and may be difficult to diagnose. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild anxiety and insomnia to more severe symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. The risk and severity of withdrawal are increased with long-term use, use of high doses, abrupt or over-rapid reduction, among other factors. Short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are more likely to cause a more severe withdrawal syndrome compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms can occur after taking therapeutic doses of lorazepam for as little as one week. Withdrawal symptoms include headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. It takes about 18–36 hours for the benzodiazepine to be removed from the body. The ease of physical dependence to lorazepam, (Ativan brand was particularly cited), and its withdrawal were brought to the attention of the British public during the early 1980s in Esther Rantzen's BBC TV series That's Life!, in a feature on the drug over a number of episodes. === Interactions === Lorazepam is not usually fatal in overdose but may cause respiratory depression if taken in overdose with alcohol. The combination also causes greater enhancement of the disinhibitory and amnesic effects of both drugs, with potentially embarrassing or criminal consequences. Some experts advise that people should be warned against drinking alcohol while on lorazepam treatment, but such clear warnings are not universal. Greater adverse effects may also occur when lorazepam is used with other drugs, such as opioids or other hypnotics. Lorazepam may also interact with rifabutin. Valproate inhibits the metabolism of lorazepam, whereas carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin increase its rate of metabolism. Some antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics, and alcohol, when taken with lorazepam may result in enhanced sedative effects. === Overdose === In cases of a suspected lorazepam overdose, it is important to establish whether the person is a regular user of lorazepam or other benzodiazepines since regular use causes tolerance to develop. Also, one must ascertain whether other substances were also ingested. Signs of overdose range through mental confusion, dysarthria, paradoxical reactions, drowsiness, hypotonia, ataxia, hypotension, hypnotic state, coma, cardiovascular depression, respiratory depression, and death. However, fatal overdoses on benzodiazepines alone are rare and less common than with barbiturates. Such a difference is largely due to benzodiazepine activity as a neuroreceptor modulator, and not as an activator per se. Lorazepam and similar medications do however act in synergy with alcohol, which increases the risk of overdose. Early management of people under alert includes emetics, gastric lavage, and activated charcoal. Otherwise, management is by observation, including vital signs, support and, only if necessary, considering the hazards of doing so, giving intravenous flumazenil. People are ideally nursed in a kind, frustration-free environment, since, when given or taken in high doses, benzodiazepines are more likely to cause paradoxical reactions. If shown sympathy, even quite crudely feigned, people may respond solicitously, but they may respond with disproportionate aggression to frustrating cues. Opportunistic counseling has limited value here, as the person is unlikely to recall this later, owing to drug-induced anterograde amnesia. === Detection in body fluids === Lorazepam may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm poisoning in hospitalized people, provide evidence of an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma concentrations are usually in a range of 10–300 μg/L in persons either receiving the drug therapeutically or in those arrested for impaired driving. Approximately 300–1000 μg/L is found in people after acute overdosage. Lorazepam may not be detected by commonly used urine drug screenings for benzodiazepines. This is due to the fact that the majority of these screening tests are only able to detect benzodiazepines that undergo oxazepam glucuronide metabolism. == Pharmacology == Lorazepam has anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, amnesic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. It is a high-potency and an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine, and its uniqueness, advantages, and disadvantages are largely explained by its pharmacokinetic properties (poor water and lipid solubility, high protein binding and anoxidative metabolism to a pharmacologically inactive glucuronide form) and by its high relative potency (lorazepam 1 mg is equal in effect to diazepam 10 mg). The biological half-life of lorazepam is 10–20 hours. === Pharmacokinetics === Lorazepam is highly protein-bound and is extensively metabolized into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Due to its poor lipid solubility, lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly by mouth and is unsuitable for rectal administration. However, its poor lipid solubility and a high degree of protein binding (85–90%) mean that its volume of distribution is mainly the vascular compartment, causing relatively prolonged peak effects. This contrasts with the highly lipid-soluble diazepam, which, although rapidly absorbed orally or rectally, soon redistributes from the serum to other parts of the body, in particular, body fat. This explains why one lorazepam dose, despite its shorter serum half-life, has more prolonged peak effects than an equivalent diazepam dose. Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals. The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months. On regular administration, diazepam will accumulate, since it has a longer half-life and active metabolites, these metabolites also have long half-lives. Clinical example: Diazepam has long been a drug of choice for status epilepticus; its high lipid solubility means it gets absorbed with equal speed whether given orally, or rectally (nonintravenous routes are convenient outside of hospital settings), but diazepam's high lipid solubility also means it does not remain in the vascular space, but soon redistributes into other body tissues. So, it may be necessary to repeat diazepam doses to maintain peak anticonvulsant effects, resulting in excess body accumulation. Lorazepam is a different case; its low lipid solubility makes it relatively slowly absorbed by any route other than intravenously, but once injected, it will not get significantly redistributed beyond the vascular space. Therefore, lorazepam's anticonvulsant effects are more durable, thus reducing the need for repeated doses. If a person is known to usually stop convulsing after only one or two diazepam doses, it may be preferable because sedative after effects will be less than if a single dose of lorazepam is given (diazepam anticonvulsant/sedative effects wear off after 15–30 minutes, but lorazepam effects last 12–24 hours). The prolonged sedation from lorazepam may, however, be an acceptable trade-off for its reliable duration of effects, particularly if the person needs to be transferred to another facility. Although lorazepam is not necessarily better than diazepam at initially terminating seizures, lorazepam is, nevertheless, replacing diazepam as the intravenous agent of choice in status epilepticus. Lorazepam serum levels are proportional to the dose administered. Giving 2 mg oral lorazepam will result in a peak total serum level of around 20 ng/mL around two hours later, half of which is lorazepam, half its inactive metabolite, lorazepam-glucuronide. A similar lorazepam dose given intravenously will result in an earlier and higher peak serum level, with a higher relative proportion of unmetabolised (active) lorazepam. On regular administration, maximum serum levels are attained after three days. Longer-term use, up to six months, does not result in further accumulation. On discontinuation, lorazepam serum levels become negligible after three days and undetectable after about a week. Lorazepam is metabolized in the liver by conjugation into inactive lorazepam-glucuronide. This metabolism does not involve liver oxidation, so is relatively unaffected by reduced liver function. Lorazepam-glucuronide is more water-soluble than its precursor, so gets more widely distributed in the body, leading to a longer half-life than lorazepam. Lorazepam-glucuronide is eventually excreted by the kidneys, and, because of its tissue accumulation, it remains detectable, particularly in the urine, for substantially longer than lorazepam. === Pharmacodynamics === Relative to other benzodiazepines, lorazepam is thought to have a high affinity for GABA receptors, which may also explain its marked amnesic effects. Its main pharmacological effects are the enhancement of the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA at the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, enhance the effects of GABA at the GABAA receptor via increasing the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel on the GABAA receptors; which results in the therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines. They, however, do not on their own activate the GABAA receptors but require the neurotransmitter GABA to be present. Thus, the effect of benzodiazepines is to enhance the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. The magnitude and duration of lorazepam effects are dose-related, meaning larger doses have stronger and longer-lasting effects, because the brain has spare benzodiazepine drug receptor capacity, with single, clinical doses leading only to an occupancy of some 3% of the available receptors. The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by the benzodiazepine effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation to deactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures, hence prolonging the refractory period. == Physical properties and formulations == Pure lorazepam is an almost white powder that is nearly insoluble in water and oil. In medicinal form, it is mainly available as tablets and a solution for injection, but, in some locations, it is also available as a skin patch, an oral solution, and a sublingual tablet. Lorazepam tablets and syrups are administered orally. Lorazepam tablets of the Ativan brand also contain lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilin, magnesium stearate, and coloring agents (indigo carmine in blue tablets and tartrazine in yellow tablets). Lorazepam for injection formulated with polyethylene glycol 400 in propylene glycol with 2.0% benzyl alcohol as preservative. Lorazepam injectable solution is administered either by deep intramuscular injection or by intravenous injection. The injectable solution comes in 1 mL ampoules containing 2 or 4 mg of lorazepam. The solvents used are polyethylene glycol 400 and propylene glycol. As a preservative, the injectable solution contains benzyl alcohol. Toxicity from propylene glycol has been reported in the case of a person receiving a continuous lorazepam infusion. Intravenous injections should be given slowly and they should be closely monitored for side effects, such as respiratory depression, hypotension, or loss of airway control. Peak effects roughly coincide with peak serum levels, which occur 10 minutes after intravenous injection, up to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection, and 90 to 120 minutes after oral administration, but initial effects will be noted before this. A clinically relevant lorazepam dose will normally be effective for six to 12 hours, making it unsuitable for regular once-daily administration, so it is usually prescribed as two to four daily doses when taken regularly, but this may be extended to five or six, especially in the case of elderly people who could not handle large doses at once. Topical formulations of lorazepam, while sometimes used as a treatment for nausea, especially in people in hospice, has been advised against by the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine for this purpose as it has not been proven effective. == History == Historically, lorazepam is one of the ""classical"" benzodiazepines. Others include diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Lorazepam was first introduced by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 1977 under the brand names Ativan and Temesta. The drug was developed by D.J. Richards, president of research. Wyeth's original patent on lorazepam is expired in the United States. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Lorazepam is also used for other purposes, such as recreational drug use, wherein it is taken to achieve a high, or when the medication is continued long-term against medical advice. A 2006 large-scale, nationwide, US government study of pharmaceutical-related emergency department visits by SAMHSA found sedative-hypnotics are the pharmaceuticals most frequently used outside of their prescribed medical purpose in the United States, with 35% of drug-related emergency department visits involving sedative-hypnotics. In this category, benzodiazepines are most commonly used. Males and females use benzodiazepines for nonmedical purposes equally. Of drugs used in attempted suicide, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used pharmaceutical drugs, with 25% of attempted suicides involving them and lorazepam specifically being used in 3.6% of attempts. Lorazepam was the third-most-common benzodiazepine used outside of prescription in these ER visit statistics. === Legal status === Lorazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the US and internationally under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

It reduces triglyceride levels and increases HDL cholesterol. It may have less marked adverse effects than niacin, although it is unclear whether the recommended dose is as effective as standard doses of niacin. == Contraindications == Contraindications are peptic ulcers, acute bleeding, recent heart attack, acute decompensated heart failure, and severe chronic kidney disease. == Adverse effects == As with niacin and related drugs, the most common adverse effects are flushing (associated with prostaglandin D2) and gastrointestinal disturbances such as indigestion, which occur in at least 10% of patients. Flushing can be reduced by taking aspirin 20 to 30 minutes before taking acipimox. Palpitations have also been described. High doses can cause headache, and precipitate gout. In contrast to niacin, no impairment of glucose tolerance and no disorders of liver function have been found in studies, even under high doses of acipimox. == Interactions == No interactions with other drugs are known. Theoretically, combination with statins and fibrates could increase the incidence of myalgia. Alcohol can increase the risk of flushing. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like niacin, acipimox acts on the niacin receptor 1, inhibiting the enzyme triglyceride lipase. This reduces the concentration of fatty acids in the blood plasma and their inflow into the liver. Consequently, VLDL cholesterol production in the liver is reduced, which leads indirectly to a reduction in LDL and increase in HDL cholesterol. === Pharmacokinetics === Acipimox is completely absorbed from the gut. It is not bound to blood plasma proteins and not metabolized. Elimination occurs in two phases, the first having a half-life of two hours, the second of 12 to 14 hours. The substance is eliminated via the kidney. == References ==",Olbetam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.0424259825376794e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025190545711666346)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acipimox?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Acipimox', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acipimox?utm_source=openai')])"

4067,"('Amantadine hydrochloride', 'Amantadine hcl', 'Symmetrel', 'Adamantan-1-amine hydrochloride', 'Amazolon')",Medical,"Amantadine, sold under the brand name Gocovri among others, is a medication used to treat dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism and influenza caused by type A influenzavirus, though its use for the latter is no longer recommended because of widespread drug resistance. It is also used for a variety of other uses. The drug is taken by mouth. Amantadine has a mild side-effect profile. Common neurological side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, and confusion. Because of its effects on the central nervous system (CNS), it should be combined cautiously with additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Given that it is cleared by the kidneys, amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end-stage kidney disease. Due to its anticholinergic effects, it should be taken with caution by those with enlarged prostates or glaucoma. The pharmacology of amantadine is complex. It acts as a sigma σ1 receptor agonist, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor negative allosteric modulator, dopaminergic agent, and weak NMDA receptor antagonist, among other actions. The precise mechanism of action of its therapeutic effects in the treatment of CNS disorders is unclear. The antiviral mechanism of action is inhibition of the influenza virus A M2 proton channel, which prevents endosomal escape (i.e., the release of viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm). Amantadine is an adamantane derivative and is related to memantine and rimantadine. Amantadine was first used for the treatment of influenza A. After its antiviral properties were initially reported in 1963, amantadine received approval for prophylaxis against the influenza virus A in 1966. In 1968, its antiparkinsonian effects were serendipitously discovered. In 1973, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2020, the extended-release formulation was approved for use in the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. == Medical uses == Amantadine was initially developed to prevent replication of the influenza A virus. Its main clinical use today is treatment of Parkinson's disease. Other uses include treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects, motor fluctuations during levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and autistic spectrum disorders. === Parkinson's disease === Amantadine is used to treat Parkinson's disease-related dyskinesia and drug-induced parkinsonism syndromes. Amantadine may be used alone or in combination with another anti-Parkinson's or anticholinergic drug. The specific symptoms targeted by amantadine therapy are dyskinesia and rigidity. The extended release amantadine formulation is commonly used to treat dyskinesias in people receiving levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease. A 2003 Cochrane review had concluded evidence was insufficient to prove the safety or efficacy of amantadine to treat dyskinesia. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported amantadine is not effective as a stand-alone parkinsonian therapy, but recommended it could be used in combination therapy with levodopa. === Influenza A === Amantadine is not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A in the United States. Amantadine has no effect preventing or treating influenza B infections. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples were resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) during the 2008–2009 flu season. The U.S. CDC guidelines recommend only neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza treatment and prophylaxis. The CDC recommends against amantadine and rimantadine to treat influenza A infections. Similarly, the 2011 WHO virology report showed all tested H1N1 influenza A viruses were resistant to amantadine. WHO guidelines recommend against use of M2 inhibitors for influenza A. The continued high rate of resistance observed in laboratory testing of influenza A has reduced the priority of M2 resistance testing. A 2014 Cochrane review did not find evidence for efficacy or safety of amantadine used for the prevention or treatment of influenza A. === Extrapyramidal symptoms === An extended-release formulation of amantadine is used to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. The WHO recommends the use of amantadine as a combination therapy to reduce levodopa side effects. === Off-label uses === ==== Fatigue in multiple sclerosis ==== A 2007 Cochrane literature review concluded that no overall evidence supports the use of amantadine in treating fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A follow-up 2012 Cochrane review stated that some amantadine-induced improvement in fatigue may occur in some people with MS. Despite multiple control trials that have also demonstrated improvements in subjective and objective ratings of fatigue, no final conclusion has been drawn regarding its effectiveness. Consensus guidelines from the German Multiple Sclerosis Society (GMSS) in 2006 state that amantadine produces moderate improvement in subjective fatigue, problem solving, memory, and concentration. Thus, in 2006, GMSS guidelines recommended the use of amantadine in MS-related fatigue. In the UK, NICE recommends considering amantadine for MS fatigue. ==== Disorders of consciousness ==== Disorders of consciousness (DoC) include coma, vegetative state (VS), and minimally conscious state (MCS). Amantadine has been shown to increase the rate of emergence from a MCS, defined by consistent demonstration of interactive communication and functional objective use. In traumatic brain injury patients in the intensive care unit, amantadine has also been shown in various randomized control trials to increase the rate of functional recovery and arousal, particularly in the time period immediately following an injury. Also, significantly improved consciousness has been reported in patients treated for nontraumatic cases of DoC, such as in the case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, and hypoxic encephalopathy. In 2018, the American Academy of Neurology updated treatment guidelines on the use of amantadine for patients with prolonged DoC, recommending the use of amantadine (100–200 mg b.i.d.) for adults with DoC 4 to 16 weeks after injury to support early functional recovery and reduce disability. ==== Brain injury recovery ==== In various studies, amantadine and memantine have been shown to accelerate the rate of recovery from a brain injury. The time-limited window following a brain injury is characterized by neuroplasticity, or the capacity of neurons in the brain to adapt and compensate after injury. Thus, physiatrists often start patients on amantadine as soon as impairments are recognized. Some case reports also show improved functional recovery with amantadine treatment occurring years after the initial brain injury. Evidence is insufficient to determine if the functional gains are a result of effects through the dopamine or norepinephrine pathways. Some patients may benefit from direct dopamine stimulation with amantadine, while others may benefit more from other stimulants that act more on the norepinephrine pathway, such as methylphenidate. If treatment with amantadine improves long-term outcomes or simply accelerates recovery is unclear. Nonetheless, amantadine-induced acceleration of recovery reduces the burden of disability, lessens health-care costs, and minimizes psychosocial stressors in patients. == Contraindications == Amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end-stage kidney disease, as the drug is renally cleared. Amantadine may have anticholinergic side effects. Thus, patients with an enlarged prostate or glaucoma should use with caution. Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated while taking amantadine. Amantadine might inhibit viral replication and reduce the efficacy of administered vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding amantadine for two weeks prior to vaccine administration and 48 hours afterward. == Side effects == Amantadine is generally well tolerated and has a mild side effect profile. === Neurological === Side effects include drowsiness (especially while driving), lightheadedness, falls, and dizziness. Patients on amantadine should avoid combination with other CNS-depressing agents, such as alcohol. Excessive alcohol usage may increase the potential for CNS effects such as dizziness, confusion, and light-headedness. Rare severe adverse effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, depression, convulsions, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. It has also been associated with disinhibited actions (gambling, sexual activity, spending, other addictions) and diminished control over compulsions. Amantadine may cause anxiety, feeling overexcited, hallucinations, and nightmares. === Cardiovascular === Amantadine may cause orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and peripheral edema. === Gastrointestinal === Amantadine has also been associated with dry mouth and constipation. === Skin === Rare cases of skin rashes, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and livedo reticularis have also been reported in patients treated with amantadine. === Kidney === Amantadine inhibits the kidney's active-transport removal and transfer of creatinine from blood to urine, which normally occurs in the proximal tubules of the nephrons. The active-transport removal mechanism accounts for about 15% of creatinine clearance, so amantadine may increase serum creatinine concentrations 15% above normal levels and give the false impression of mild kidney disease in patients whose kidneys are actually undamaged (because kidney function is often assessed by measuring the concentration of creatinine in blood.) Also, if the patient does have kidney disease, amantadine may cause it to appear as much as 15% worse than it actually is. === Pregnancy and lactation === Amantadine is USFDA category C for pregnancy. Teratogenic effects have been observed in humans (case reports) and animal reproduction studies. Amantadine may also be present in breast milk and negatively alter breast milk production or excretion. The decision to breastfeed during amantadine therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the drug to the mother. == Interactions == Amantadine may affect the CNS because of its dopaminergic and anticholinergic properties. The mechanisms of action are not fully known. Because of the CNS effects, caution is required when prescribing additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Thus, concurrent use of alcohol with amantadine is not recommended because of enhanced CNS depressant effects. In addition, antidopaminergic drugs such as metoclopramide and typical antipsychotics should be avoided. These interactions are likely related to opposing dopaminergic mechanisms of action, which inhibits amantadine's anti-Parkinson effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === ==== Central nervous system disorders ==== The mechanism of action of the antiparkinsonian effects of amantadine is poorly understood. The effects of amantadine in Parkinson's disease were originally assumed to be anticholinergic or dopaminergic, but the situation soon proved more complicated than this. The pharmacodynamics of amantadine are complex, and it interacts with many different biological targets at a variety of concentrations and hence potencies. The drug is a weak antagonist of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake. It is a negative allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically the α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In 1993, amantadine was found to bind to the sigma σ1 receptor with relatively high affinity (Ki = 20.25 μM). In 2004, it was discovered that amantadine and memantine bind to and act as agonists of the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 7.44 μM and 2.60 μM, respectively) and that activation of the σ1 receptor is potentially involved in the dopaminergic effects of amantadine at therapeutically relevant concentrations. σ1 receptor activation is one of amantadine's more potent actions. σ1 receptor agonists enhance tyrosine hydroxylase activity, modulate NMDA-stimulated dopamine release, increase dopamine release in the striatum in vivo, and decrease dopamine reuptake. As such, σ1 receptor activation may be involved in the antiparkinsonian and other central nervous system effects of amantadine. Binding of amantadine to the NMDA receptor was first reported in 1989, and antagonism of the receptor was first reported in 1991. Despite some reports, the NMDA receptor antagonism of amantadine is probably not its primary mechanism of action. It occurs at relatively high concentrations and many of the effects of amantadine are different from those of NMDA receptor antagonists. Some of its effects, such as enhancement of dopamine release in the striatum, are even reversed by NMDA receptor antagonists, but NMDA receptor antagonism could still contribute to the effects of amantadine. Although some publications have reported that amantadine inhibits monoamine oxidase, the drug probably does not actually inhibit this enzyme. Amantadine shows amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects (e.g., stimulation of locomotor activity) in animals at sufficiently high doses. It has been found to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and to induce the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The concentrations needed for these effects, though, are very high and may not be therapeutically relevant. It is about 1/25th to 1/50th as potent as amphetamines. Amantadine has been found to increase dopamine levels in the striatum. It does not act as a monoaminergic activity enhancer. Amantadine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for example of PDE1. Amantadine has been found to increase aromatic amino acid decarboxylase expression. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA. An imaging study in humans found that amantadine increased AADC activity in the striatum by up to 27%. Various additional actions of amantadine have been described. ==== Influenza ==== The mechanisms for amantadine's antiviral and antiparkinsonian effects are unrelated. Amantadine targets the influenza A M2 ion channel protein. The M2 protein's function is to allow the intracellular virus to replicate (M2 also functions as a proton channel for hydrogen ions to cross into the vesicle), and exocytose newly formed viral proteins to the extracellular space (viral shedding). By blocking the M2 channel, the virus is unable to replicate because of impaired replication, protein synthesis, and exocytosis. Amantadine and rimantadine function in a mechanistically identical fashion, entering the barrel of the tetrameric M2 channel and blocking pore function—i.e., proton translocation. Resistance to the drug class is a consequence of mutations to the pore-lining amino acid residues of the channel, preventing both amantadine and rimantadine from binding and inhibiting the channel in their usual way. === Pharmacokinetics === Amantadine is well-absorbed orally. The onset of action is usually within 48 hours when used for parkinsonian syndromes, including dyskinesia. As plasma concentrations of amantadine increase, the risk for toxicity increases. Half-life elimination averages eight days in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Amantadine is only minimally removed by hemodialysis. Amantadine is metabolized to a small extent (5–15%) by acetylation. It is mainly excreted (90%) unchanged in urine by kidney excretion. == Chemistry == Amantadine is the organic compound 1-adamantylamine or 1-aminoadamantane, which consists of an adamantane backbone with an amino group substituted at one of the four tertiary carbons. Rimantadine is a closely related adamantane derivative with similar biological properties; both target the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus. Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) is structurally related to other adamantanes including adapromine (1-(adamantan-1-yl)propan-1-amine), bromantane (N-(4-bromophenyl)adamantan-2-amine), memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane), and rimantadine (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane), among others. == History == === Influenza A === Antiviral properties were first reported in 1963 at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. In this amantadine trial study, volunteer college students were exposed to a viral challenge. The group who received amantadine (100 milligrams 18 hours before viral challenge) had less Asia influenza infections than the placebo group. Amantadine received approval for the treatment of influenza virus A in adults in 1976. It was first used in West Germany in 1966. Amantadine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1968, as a prophylactic agent against Asian (H2N2) influenza and received approval for prophylactic use for influenza A in 1976. During the 1980 influenza A epidemic, the first amantadine-resistance influenza viruses were reported. The frequency of amantadine resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1991 and 1995 was as low as 0.8%. In 2004, the resistance frequency increased to 12.3%. A year later, resistance increase significantly to 96%, 72%, and 14.5% in China, South Korea, and the United States, respectively. By 2006, 90.6% of H3N2 strains and 15.6% of H1N1 were amantadine resistant. A majority of the amantadine-resistant H3N2 isolates (98.2%) was found to contain an S31N mutation in the M2 transmembrane domain that confers resistance to amantadine. Currently, adamantane resistance is high among circulating influenza A viruses. Thus, they are no longer recommended for treatment of influenza A. === Parkinson's disease === An incidental finding in 1969 prompted investigations about amantadine's effectiveness for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A woman with Parkinson's disease was prescribed amantadine to treat her influenza infection and reported her cogwheel rigidity and tremors improved. She also reported that her symptoms worsened after she finished the course of amantadine. The published case report was not initially corroborated by any other instances by the medical literature or manufacturer data. A team of researchers looked at a group of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and gave them amantadine. Seven of them showed improvement, which was convincing evidence for the need of a clinical trial, which included 163 patients with Parkinson's disease; 66% experienced subjective or objective reduction of symptoms with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Additional studies followed patients for greater lengths of time and in different combinations of neurological drugs. It was found to be a safe drug that could be used over long periods of time with few side effects as monotherapy or in combination with L-dopa or anticholinergic drugs. By April 1973, the U.S. FDA approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2017, the U.S. FDA approved the use of amantadine in an extended-release formulation for the treatment of dyskinesia, an adverse effect of levodopa in people with Parkinson's disease. == Society and culture == === Names === Brand names of amantadine include Gocovri, Symadine, and Symmetrel. === Recreational use === Recreational use of amantadine at supratherapeutic doses has been reported. It is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and is reported to produce dissociative and phencyclidine-like effects in animals and humans at sufficiently high doses. However, the very long duration of action of amantadine (>40 hours) has likely limited its misuse potential. Recreational use of the related drug memantine has similarly been reported. === Veterinary misuse === In 2005, Chinese poultry farmers were reported to have used amantadine to protect birds against avian influenza. In Western countries and according to international livestock regulations, amantadine is approved only for use in humans. Chickens in China have received an estimated 2.6 billion doses of amantadine. Avian flu (H5N1) strains in China and southeast Asia are now resistant to amantadine, although strains circulating elsewhere still seem to be sensitive. If amantadine-resistant strains of the virus spread, the drugs of choice in an avian flu outbreak will probably be restricted to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which block the action of viral neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of influenza virus particles. Increasing incidence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating influenza strains (e.g., H1N1) exists, highlighting the need for new anti-influenza therapies. In September 2015, the U.S. FDA announced the recall of Dingo Chip Twists ""Chicken in the Middle"" dog treats because the product has the potential to be contaminated with amantadine. == Research == === Depression === Interest in and study of amantadine in the treatment of depression has arisen. A 2017 systematic review of off-label augmentation for treatment of unipolar depression found two open-label studies of amantadine for augmenting imipramine and found that it was effective. However, the quality of evidence was very low and no conclusions could be drawn about its effectiveness. A 2022 systematic review of randomized controlled trials of glutamatergic agents for treatment-resistant depression identified one clinical trial of amantadine for this use. Amantadine was found to be effective in treating depressive symptoms in the trial. The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of depression is unclear, but various mechanisms have been postulated. These include dopaminergic actions like indirect enhancement of dopamine release, dopamine reuptake inhibition, and D2 receptor interactions, noradrenergic actions, glutamatergic actions such as NMDA receptor antagonism, and immunomodulation, among many others. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 2010 randomized clinical trial showed similar improvements in ADHD symptoms in children treated with amantadine as in those treated with methylphenidate, with less frequent side effects. A 2021 retrospective study showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD-related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second- or third-generation antipsychotics. === COVID-19 === Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of COVID-19. == References == == External links ==",Symmetrel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.340433563105762e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0012038849527016282)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/symmetrel.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Symmetrel Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/symmetrel.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4068,"('Phenylpropanolamine', '(1s,2r)-norephedrine', 'Propadrine', 'Alpha-(1-aminoethyl)benzyl alcohol', 'Demazin')",Medical,"Chlorphenamine (CP, CPM), also known as chlorpheniramine, is an antihistamine used to treat the symptoms of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is taken orally (by mouth). The medication takes effect within two hours and lasts for about 4–6 hours. It is a first-generation antihistamine and works by blocking the histamine H1 receptor. Common side effects include sleepiness, restlessness, and weakness. Other side effects may include dry mouth and wheeziness. Chlorpheniramine was patented in 1948 and came into medical use in 1949. It is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2022, it was the 291st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Combination products === Chlorphenamine is often combined with phenylpropanolamine to form an allergy medication with both antihistamine and decongestant properties, although phenylpropanolamine was removed from the U.S. market per studies concluding that it increased the risk of stroke in young women. Vernate was a trade name of one such product available in the U.S. prior to the FDA ban; it was manufactured by Tutag and was among the medications prescribed to Elvis Presley. In the drug Coricidin, chlorphenamine is combined with the cough suppressant dextromethorphan. In the drug Cêgripe, chlorphenamine is combined with the analgesic paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol). == Side effects == The adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, constipation, anxiety, nausea, blurred vision, restlessness, decreased coordination, dry mouth, shallow breathing, hallucinations, irritability, problems with memory or concentration, tinnitus and trouble urinating. Chlorphenamine produces less sedation than other first-generation antihistamines. A large study on people 65 years old or older linked the development of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia to the ""higher cumulative"" use of chlorphenamine and other first-generation antihistamines, due to their anticholinergic properties. Chlorphenamine is rated as a ""high burden"" anticholinergic by experts on a semi-subjective scale. This is inconsistent with the in vitro experiments showing low affinity to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Chlorphenamine acts primarily as a potent H1 antihistamine. It is specifically a potent inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. The drug is also commonly described as possessing weak anticholinergic activity by acting as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The dextrorotatory stereoisomer, dexchlorpheniramine, has been reported to possess Kd values of 15 nM for the H1 receptor and 1,300 nM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human brain tissue. The smaller the Kd value, the greater the binding affinity of the ligand for its target. In addition to acting as an inverse agonist at the H1 receptor, chlorphenamine has been found to act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Kd = 15.2 nM for the serotonin transporter). It has only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (Kd = 1,440 nM and 1,060 nM, respectively). A study found that dexchlorphenamine had Ki values for the human cloned H1 receptor of 2.67 to 4.81 nM while levchlorphenamine had Ki values of 211 to 361 nM for this receptor, indicating that dexchlorphenamine is the active enantiomer. Another study found that dexchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 20 to 30 μM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor using rat brain tissue while levchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 40 to 50 μM for this receptor, indicating that both enantiomers have very low affinity for it. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of chlorphenamine has variously ranged between 13.9 and 43.4 hours in adults following a single dose in clinical studies. == Chemistry == Chlorphenamine is an alkylamine and is a part of a series of antihistamines including pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives including fluorpheniramine, dexchlorphenamine (Polaramine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral), deschlorpheniramine, and iodopheniramine. The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optical isomerism, and chlorphenamine in the indicated products is racemic chlorphenamine maleate, whereas dexchlorphenamine is the dextrorotary stereoisomer. === Synthesis === There are several patented methods for the synthesis of chlorphenamine. In one example, 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile is reacted with 2-chloropyridine in the presence of sodium amide to form 4-chlorophenyl(2-pyridyl)acetonitrile. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives γ-(4-chlorphenyl)-γ-cyano-N,N-dimethyl-2-pyridinepropanamine, the hydrolysis and decarboxylation of which lead to chlorphenamine. A second method boom starts from pyridine, which undergoes alkylation by 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile, giving 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)pyridine. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives chlorphenamine. == Society and culture == === Names === Chlorphenamine is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name while chlorpheniramine is the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and former BANTooltip British Approved Name. Brand names include Chlor-Trimeton, Demazin, Allerest 12 Hour, Piriton, Chlorphen-12, Tylenol Cold/Allergy, and numerous others according to country. == References ==",Demazin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0025630502495914698), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038112103939056396)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005233763717114925), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([inovapharma.com.au](https://inovapharma.com.au/brands-and-products/consumer-healthcare/demazin/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=126, start_index=9, title='Demazin - iNova Pharmaceuticals', type='url_citation', url='https://inovapharma.com.au/brands-and-products/consumer-healthcare/demazin/?utm_source=openai')])"
4069,"('Norephedrine', 'Phenylpropanolamine', '(1s,2r)-2-amino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol', 'Propadrine', 'Rhindecon')",Medical,"Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), sold under many brand names, is a sympathomimetic agent used as a decongestant and appetite suppressant. It was once common in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations. The medication is taken orally. Side effects of phenylpropanolamine include increased heart rate and blood pressure. Rarely, PPA has been associated with hemorrhagic stroke. PPA acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. It was once thought to act as a sympathomimetic with additional direct agonist action on adrenergic receptors, but this proved wrong. Chemically, phenylpropanolamine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine, and cathinone. It is usually a racemic mixture of the (1R,2S)- and (1S,2R)-enantiomers of β-hydroxyamphetamine and is also known as dl-norephedrine. Phenylpropanolamine was first synthesized around 1910 and its effects on blood pressure were characterized around 1930. It was introduced as medicine by the 1930s. It was withdrawn from many markets starting in 2000 after learning that it was associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. It was previously available both over-the-counter and by prescription. Phenylpropanolamine is available for both human and/or veterinary use in some countries. == Medical uses == Phenylpropanolamine is used as a decongestant to treat nasal congestion. It has also been used to suppress appetite and promote weight loss in the treatment of obesity and has shown effectiveness for this indication. === Available forms === Phenylpropanolamine was previously available in the United States over-the-counter and in certain combination drug forms by prescription. One such example of the latter was a combination of phenylpropanolamine and chlorpheniramine, which dually contained decongestant and antihistamine effects, marketed by Tutag as 'Vernate'. These forms have all been discontinued in the U.S., although. phenylpropanolamine remains available in some countries. == Side effects == Phenylpropanolamine produces sympathomimetic effects and can cause side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. It has been associated rarely with incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. Certain drugs increase the chances of déjà vu occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of déjà vu. The Journal of Clinical Neuroscience reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of déjà vu upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain, it was speculated that déjà vu occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain. == Interactions == There has been very little research on drug interactions with phenylpropanolamine. In one study, phenylpropanolamine taken with caffeine was found to quadruple caffeine levels. In another study, phenylpropanolamine reduced theophylline clearance by 50%. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Phenylpropanolamine acts primarily as a selective norepinephrine releasing agent. It also acts as a dopamine releasing agent with around 10-fold lower potency. The stereoisomers of the drug have only weak or negligible affinity for α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Phenylpropanolamine was originally thought to act as a direct agonist of adrenergic receptors and hence to act as a mixed acting sympathomimetic, However, phenylpropanolamine was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible affinity for these receptors and has been instead characterized as exclusively an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. It acts by inducing norepinephrine release and thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. Many sympathetic hormones and neurotransmitters are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and function generally in ""fight or flight"" type responses, such as increasing heart rate, blood pressure, dilating the pupils, increased energy, drying of mucous membranes, increased sweating, and a significant number of additional effects. Phenylpropanolamine has relatively low potency as a sympathomimetic. It is about 100 to 200 times less potent than epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine (noradrenaline) in its sympathomimetic effects, although responses are variable depending on tissue. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Phenylpropanolamine is readily- and well-absorbed with oral administration. Immediate-release forms of the drug reached peak levels about 1.5 hours (range 1.0 to 2.3 hours) following administration. Conversely, extended-release forms of phenylpropanolamine reach peak levels after 3.0 to 4.5 hours. The pharmacokinetics of phenylpropanolamine are linear across an oral dose range of 25 to 100 mg. Steady-state levels of phenylpropanolamine are achieved within 12 hours when the drug is taken once every 4 hours. There is 62% accumulation of phenylpropanolamine at steady state in terms of peak levels, whereas area-under-the-curve levels are not increased with steady state. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of phenylpropanolamine is 3.0 to 4.5 L/kg. Levels of phenylpropanolamine in the brain are about 40% of those in the heart and 20% of those in the lungs. The hydroxyl group of phenylpropanolamine at the β carbon increases its hydrophilicity, reduces its permeation through the blood–brain barrier, and limits its central nervous system (CNS) effects. Hence, phenylpropanolamine crosses into the brain only to some extent, has only weak CNS effects, and most of its effects are peripheral. In any case, phenylpropanolamine can produce amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects at very high doses. Phenylpropanolamine is more lipophilic than structurally related sympathomimetics with hydroxyl groups on the phenyl ring like epinephrine (adrenaline) and phenylephrine and has greater brain permeability than these agents. The plasma protein binding of phenylpropanolamine is approximately 20%. However, it has been said that no recent studies have substantiated this value. ==== Metabolism ==== Phenylpropanolamine is not substantially metabolized. It also does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism. Only about 3 to 4% of an oral dose of phenylpropanolamine is metabolized. Metabolites include hippuric acid (via oxidative deamination of the side chain) and 4-hydroxynorephedrine (via para-hydroxylation). The methyl group at the α carbon of phenylpropanolamine blocks metabolism by monoamine oxidases (MAOs). Phenylpropanolamine is also not a substrate of catechol O-methyltransferase. The hydroxyl group at the β carbon of phenylpropanolamine also helps to increase metabolic stability. ==== Elimination ==== Approximately 90% of a dose of phenylpropanolamine is excreted in the urine unchanged within 24 hours. About 4% of excreted material is in the form of metabolites. The elimination half-life of immediate-release phenylpropanolamine is about 4 hours, with a range in different studies of 3.7 to 4.9 hours. The half-life of extended-release phenylpropanolamine has ranged from 4.3 to 5.8 hours. The elimination of phenylpropanolamine is dependent on urinary pH. At a more acidic urinary pH, the elimination of phenylpropanolamine is accelerated and its half-life and duration are shortened, whereas at more basic urinary pH, the elimination of phenylpropanolamine is reduced and its half-life and duration are extended. Urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including phenylpropanolamine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them. Total body clearance of phenylpropanolamine has been reported to be 0.546 L/h/kg, while renal clearance was 0.432 L/h/kg. ==== Miscellaneous ==== As phenylpropanolamine is not extensively metabolized, it would probably not be affected by hepatic impairment. Conversely, there is likely to be accumulation of phenylpropanolamine with renal impairment due to its dependence on urinary excretion. Norephedrine is a minor metabolite of amphetamine and methamphetamine, as shown below. It is also a minor metabolite of ephedrine and a major metabolite of cathinone. == Chemistry == Phenylpropanolamine, also known as (1RS,2SR)-α-methyl-β-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1RS,2SR)-β-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is closely related to the cathinones (β-ketoamphetamines). β-Hydroxyamphetamine exists as four stereoisomers, which include d- (dextrorotatory) and l-norephedrine (levorotatory), and d- and l-norpseudoephedrine. d-Norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine, and is found naturally in Catha edulis (khat). Pharmaceutical drug preparations of phenylpropanolamine have varied in their stereoisomer composition in different countries, which may explain differences in misuse and side effect profiles. In any case, racemic dl-norephedrine, or (1RS,2SR)-phenylpropanolamine, appears to be the most commonly used formulation of phenylpropanolamine pharmaceutically. Analogues of phenylpropanolamine include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cathinone. Phenylpropanolamine, structurally, is in the substituted phenethylamine class, consisting of a cyclic benzene or phenyl group, a two carbon ethyl moiety, and a terminal nitrogen, hence the name phen-ethyl-amine. The methyl group on the alpha carbon (the first carbon before the nitrogen group) also makes this compound a member of the substituted amphetamine class. Ephedrine is the N-methyl analogue of phenylpropanolamine. Exogenous compounds in this family are degraded too rapidly by monoamine oxidase to be active at all but the highest doses. However, the addition of the α-methyl group allows the compound to avoid metabolism and confer an effect. In general, N-methylation of primary amines increases their potency, whereas β-hydroxylation decreases CNS activity, but conveys more selectivity for adrenergic receptors. Phenylpropanolamine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C9H13NO and a molecular weight of 151.21 g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.67, while its predicted log P values range from 0.57 to 0.89. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to phenylpropanolamine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of pseudoephedrine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7). Phenylpropanolamine has been used pharmaceutically exclusively as the hydrochloride salt. == History == Phenylpropanolamine was first synthesized in the early 20th century, in or around 1910. It was patented as a mydriatic in 1913. The pressor effects of phenylpropanolamine were characterized in the late 1920s and the 1930s. Phenylpropanolamine was first introduced for medical use by the 1930s. In the United States, phenylpropanolamine is no longer sold due to an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In a few countries in Europe, however, it is still available either by prescription or sometimes over-the-counter. In Canada, it was withdrawn from the market on 31 May 2001. It was voluntarily withdrawn from the Australian market by July 2001. In India, human use of phenylpropanolamine and its formulations was banned on 10 February 2011, but the ban was overturned by the judiciary in September 2011. == Society and culture == === Names === Phenylpropanolamine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt. It is also known by the synonym norephedrine. Brand names of phenylpropanolamine include Acutrim, Appedrine, Capton Diet, Control, Dexatrim, Emagrin Plus A.P., Glifentol, Kontexin, Merex, Monydrin, Mydriatine, Prolamine, Propadrine, Propagest, Recatol, Rinexin, Tinaroc, and Westrim, among many others. It has also been used in combinations under brand names including Allerest, Demazin, Dimetapp, and Sinarest, among others. === Availability === Phenylpropanolamine is available for medical and veterinary use in some countries. === Exercise and sports === There has been interest in phenylpropanolamine as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports. However, clinical studies suggest that phenylpropanolamine is not effective in this regard. Phenylpropanolamine is not on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of prohibited substances as of 2024. === Legal status === In Sweden, phenylpropanolamine is still available in prescription decongestants; Phenylpropanolamine is also still available in Germany. It is used in some polypill medications like Wick DayMed capsules. In the United Kingdom, phenylpropanolamine was available in many ""all in one"" cough and cold medications which usually also feature paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) or another analgesic and caffeine and could also be purchased on its own. It is no longer approved for human use, however, and a European Category 1 Licence is required to purchase or acquire phenylpropanolamine for academic or research use. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory recommending against the use of the drug in November 2000. In this advisory, the FDA requested but did not require that all drug companies discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine. The agency estimates that phenylpropanolamine caused between 200 and 500 strokes per year among 18-to-49-year-old users. In 2005, the FDA removed phenylpropanolamine from over-the-counter sale and removed its ""generally recognized as safe and effective"" (GRASE) status. Under the 2020 CARES Act, it requires FDA approval before it can be marketed again effectively banning the drug, even as a prescription. Because of its potential use in amphetamine manufacture, phenylpropanolamine is controlled by the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. However, It is still available for veterinary use in dogs as a treatment for urinary incontinence. Internationally, an item on the agenda of the 2000 Commission on Narcotic Drugs session called for including the stereoisomer norephedrine in Table I of United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Drugs containing phenylpropanolamine were banned in India on 27 January 2011. On 13 September 2011, Madras High Court revoked a ban on the manufacture and sale of pediatric drugs phenylpropanolamine and nimesulide. == Veterinary use == Phenylpropanolamine is available for use in veterinary medicine. It is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs. In June 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets for the control of urinary incontinence due to a weakening of the muscles that control urination (urethral sphincter hypotonus) in dogs. This is the first generic phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets for dogs. Urinary incontinence happens when a dog loses its ability to control when it urinates. Urinary incontinence due to urethral sphincter hypotonus can happen as dogs age and as the dog’s muscle in its urethra (the tube that leads from the dog’s bladder to outside its body) weakens and loses control over its ability to hold urine. Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets contain the same active ingredient (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride) in the same concentration and dosage form as the approved brand name drug product, Proin chewable tablets, which were first approved in August 2011. In addition, the FDA determined that Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets contain no inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient. == Notes == == Reference notes == == References ==",Rhindecon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.470901229884475e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0025440254248678684), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47414398193359375)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([jodrugs.com](https://www.jodrugs.com/tradenames/68351-rhindecon.aspx?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=6, title='JoDrugs.

It has been provided as an aqueous suspension or oil solution given by injection into muscle and as a vaginal cream applied inside of the vagina. It can also be taken by mouth as estradiol/estrone/estriol (brand name Hormonin) and in the form of prodrugs like estropipate (estrone sulfate; brand name Ogen) and conjugated estrogens (mostly estrone sulfate; brand name Premarin). Side effects of estrogens like estrone include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, nausea, fluid retention, and edema, among others. Estrone is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is a relatively weak estrogen, with much lower activity than estradiol. However, estrone is converted in the body into estradiol, which provides most or all of its estrogenic potency. As such, estrone is a prodrug of estradiol. Estrone was first discovered in 1929, and was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Although it has been used clinically in the past, estrone has largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer marketed. == Medical uses == Estrone has been marketed in intramuscular and vaginal formulations and was used as an estrogen in the treatment of symptoms of low estrogen levels such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal or ovariectomized women. Estrone has also been used as an antigonadotropin and form of high-dose estrogen to treat prostate cancer in men as well as a form of high-dose estrogen to treat breast cancer in women. It has since largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer available, having been superseded by other estrogens with better potency and pharmacokinetics (namely oral bioavailability and duration). Regardless of route of administration, if estrone is taken by a woman with an intact uterus, it should be combined with a progestogen such as progesterone to offset the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Estrone has been used by intramuscular injection at a dosage of 0.1 to 2 mg per week, or 0.1 to 0.5 mg given 2 or 3 times per week, for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy, and at a dosage of 0.1 to 1.0 mg weekly in single or divided doses for the treatment of female hypogonadism, surgical castration, and primary ovarian failure. The range of single doses of estrone by intramuscular injection that are typically used clinically in women is 0.1 to 5 mg. High doses of intramuscular estrone have been used for prostate cancer in men and for breast cancer in women. === Available forms === Estrone for intramuscular injection was provided as 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 mg/mL aqueous suspensions and/or oil solutions. It has also been available in the form of vaginal creams (1 mg/g (0.1%)) and suppositories (0.2 mg, 0.25 mg) as well as subcutaneous pellet implants and oral tablets (1.25 mg). A combined oral tablet formulation containing estradiol (0.3 mg, 0.6 mg), estrone (0.7 mg, 1.4 mg), and estriol (0.135 mg, 0.27 mg) has been marketed under the brand name Hormonin as well. In addition, a combined injectable preparation containing estrone (1 mg) and progesterone (10 mg) is available in the form of ampoules under the brand name Synergon. Although estrone by intramuscular injection was originally formulated as an oil solution, it was soon replaced by formulations of estrone as an aqueous suspension due to a longer duration of action of these formulations. == Side effects == Side effects of estrogens like estrone include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, nausea, fluid retention, and edema, among others. It can also cause endometrial hyperplasia. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Mechanism of action ==== Estrone is an estrogen, specifically an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERα and ERβ. It is a far less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and as such is a relatively weak estrogen. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. According to one study, the relative binding affinities of estrone for the human ERα and ERβ were 4.0% and 3.5% of those estradiol, respectively, and the relative transactivational capacities of estrone at the ERα and ERβ were 2.6% and 4.3% of those of estradiol, respectively. In accordance, the estrogenic activity of estrone has been reported to be approximately 4% of that of estradiol. Other studies have reported that estrone has about one-tenth of the potency of estradiol in activating the ERs in vitro. Because estrone can be transformed into estradiol, which is far more potent as an estrogen in comparison, most or all of the estrogenic potency of estrone in vivo is actually due to conversion into estradiol. As such, similarly to the case of estrone sulfate, estrone is considered to be a prodrug of estradiol. Some in vitro research has suggested that estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol, but this does not appear to be of clinical significance. In contrast to estradiol and estriol, estrone is not a ligand of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (affinity >10,000 nM). ==== Effects in the body and brain ==== In clinical research in the 1930s, estrone was given via intramuscular injection to ovariectomized women in order to study its effects and to elucidate the biological properties of estrogens in humans. In these studies, prior to administration of estrone, amenorrhea, atrophy of the breasts (as well as flaccidity and small and non-erectile nipples), vagina, and endometrium, vaginal dryness, and subjective symptoms of ovariectomy (e.g., hot flashes, mood changes) were all present in the women. Treatment with estrone was found to dose- and time-dependently produce a variety of effects, including breast changes, reproductive tract changes of the vagina, cervix, and endometrium/uterus, and relief from the subjective symptoms of ovariectomy, as well as increased libido. Breast changes specifically included enlargement and a sense of fullness, increased sensitivity and pigmentation of the nipples as well as nipple erection, tingling within the breast mammary glandular tissue, and aching and soreness of the breasts. Reproductive tract changes included increased growth, thickness, and differentiation of the endometrium, and reversal of vaginal and cervical atrophy, which were accompanied by increased congestion of the cervix and mucous discharge from the cervix, uterine cramps and needle-like pains, pelvic fullness, a ""bearing-down"" sensation, and increased vaginal lubrication, as well as uterine bleeding both during treatment and in the days following cessation of injections. Endometrial hyperplasia also occurred with sufficiently high doses of estrone. Clinical research has confirmed the nature of estrone as an inactive prodrug of estradiol. With oral administration of estradiol, the ratio of estradiol levels to estrone levels is about 5 times higher on average than under normal physiological circumstances in premenopausal women and with parenteral (non-oral) routes of estradiol. Oral administration of menopausal replacement dosages of estradiol results in low, follicular phase levels of estradiol, whereas estrone levels resemble the high levels seen during the first trimester of pregnancy. In spite of markedly elevated levels of estrone with oral estradiol but not with transdermal estradiol, clinical studies have shown that doses of oral and transdermal estradiol achieving similar levels of estradiol possess equivalent and non-significantly different potency in terms of measures including suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, inhibition of bone resorption, and relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. In addition, estradiol levels were found to correlate with these effects, while estrone levels did not. These findings confirm that estrone has very low estrogenic activity, and also indicate that estrone does not diminish the estrogenic activity of estradiol. This contradicts some cell-free in-vitro research suggesting that high concentrations of estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Like estradiol, estrone has poor oral bioavailability. It has been said that, taken by mouth in non-micronized form, a dose of 25 mg estrone is approximately equivalent to 2.5 mg conjugated estrogens, 50 μg ethinylestradiol, or 1 mg diethylstilbestrol in terms of estrogenic potency. Due to its weak oral activity, estrone has been used parenterally instead, for instance by intramuscular injection or vaginal administration. The pharmacokinetics of vaginal estrone have been studied. Estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a shorter duration than estrone in aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection. Estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection is rapidly absorbed, while estrone in aqueous suspension has a prolonged period of absorption. Upon intramuscular injection of estrone in aqueous solution, the water from the preparation is absorbed and a microcrystalline depot of estrone that is slowly absorbed by the body is formed. This is responsible for the prolonged duration of estrone in aqueous suspension compared to oil solution. ==== Distribution ==== Unlike estradiol and estriol, estrone is not accumulated in target tissues. In terms of plasma protein binding, estrone is bound approximately 16% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 80% to albumin, with the remainder (2.0 to 4.0%) circulating free or unbound. Estrone has about 24% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for SHBG, and hence is relatively poorly bound to SHBG. ==== Metabolism ==== Estrone is conjugated into estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide by sulfotransferases and glucuronidases, and can also be hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes into catechol estrogens such as 2-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestrone or into estriol. Both of these transformations take place predominantly in the liver. Estrone can also be reversibly converted into estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs), and this accounts for most or all of its estrogenic activity. 17β-HSD isoforms that are involved in the conversion of estrone into estradiol include 17β-HSD1, 17β-HSD3, 17β-HSD4, 17β-HSD7, 17β-HSD8, and 17β-HSD12, although the relative contributions of the different isoforms is unknown. The biological half-lives of estrone and estradiol in the circulation are both about 10 to 70 minutes, whereas the biological half-life of estrone sulfate in the circulation is about 10 to 12 hours. The metabolic clearance rate of estrone is 1,050 L/day/m2 and of estradiol is 580 L/day/m2, while that of estrone sulfate is 80 L/day/m2. For comparison, the metabolic clearance rate of estriol is 1,110 L/day/m2. A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estrone in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 2 or 3 days. As an aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection, estrone was used at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg 2 to 3 times per week, or at a dose of 0.1 to 2 mg once a week or in divided doses. In one rodent study, exogenous estrone was administered and increased circulating estradiol levels by about 10-fold; co-administration of a selective 17β-HSD1 inhibitor decreased estradiol levels by about 50%. The ratio of circulating estrone to circulating estradiol is the same at about 5:1 with both oral estradiol and oral estrone sulfate. An investigational estrone vaginal ring was found to result in a ratio of estrone to estradiol of 4:1 or 5:1 initially, but this decreased to about 1:1 with continuous therapy. ==== Excretion ==== Estrone is excreted in urine in the form of estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide. Following an intravenous injection of labeled estrone in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estrone. == Chemistry == Estrone, also known as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds at the C1, C3, and C5 positions, a hydroxyl group at the C3 position, and a ketone group at the C17 position. The name estrone was derived from the chemical terms estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and ketone. A variety of estrone esters have been synthesized and described. These include the marketed esters estrone acetate, estrone sulfate, estrone tetraacetylglucoside, and estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), and the never-marketed esters estrone benzoate, estrone cyanate, estrone glucuronide, and estrone sulfamate. == History == In 1927, Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim discovered that large amounts of estrogens were excreted in the urine of pregnant women. This rich source of estrogens allowed the development of potent estrogenic formulations for scientific and clinical use. In 1929, pure crystalline estrone was isolated from the urine of pregnant women by various researchers. By 1929, pharmaceutical preparations including Amniotin (Squibb), Progynon (Schering), and Theelin (Parke-Davis), purified from pregnancy urine, placentas, and/or amniotic fluid and containing purified estrone or mixtures of estrogens that included estrone, were being sold commercially for use by intramuscular injection. Other products and brand names of estrone marketed in the 1930s included Estrone (Abbott, Lilly), Oestroform (British Drug Houses), Folliculin (Organon), Menformon (Organon), and Ketodestrin (Paines & Byrne), among others. These formulations included ampoules of oil or aqueous solution for intramuscular injection, oral tablets, and vaginal suppositories. Estrone in aqueous suspension for use by intramuscular injection was first described in 1941 and was introduced for medical use under the brand name Theelin Aqueous Suspension by 1944. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Estrone is the generic name of estrone in American English and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Oestrone, in which the ""O"" is silent, was the former BANTooltip British Approved Name of estrone and its name in British English, but the spelling was eventually changed to estrone. === Brand names === Estrone has been marketed under a variety of brand names, including Andrestraq, Aquacrine, A.T.V., Bestrone, Centrogen, Cicatral, Cormone, Crinovaryl, Cristallovar, Crystogen, Destrone, Disynformon, Endofolliculina, Estragyn, Estroject, Estrol, Estrone, Estrone Aqueous Suspension, Estrone-A, Estrugenone, Estrusol, Femestrone, Femidyn, Folikrin, Folipex, Folisan, Folliculin, Follicunodis, Follidrin, Gineburno, Glandubolin, Grietalgen, Grietalgen Hidrocort, Gynogen, Hiestrone, Hormofollin, Hormonin, Hormovarine, Kestrin, Kestrone, Ketodestrin, Kolpon, Ladies Pearl, Livifolin, Menagen, Metharmon-F, Neo-Estrone, Oestrilin, Oestrin, Oestroform, Oestroperos, Ovex, Ovifollin, Perlatan, Progynon, Senikolp, Solliculin, Solutio Folliculinum, Synergon (in combination with progesterone), Theelin, Thynestron, Tokokin, Unden, Unigen, Wehgen, and Wynestron. Brand names of estrone in aqueous suspension specifically include Bestrone, Estaqua, Estrofol, Estroject, Estrone-A, Estronol, Femogen, Foygen Aqueous, Gravigen Aqueous, Gynogen, Hormogen-A, Kestrin Aqueous, Kestrone, Theelin Aqueous, Theogen, Unigen, and Wehgen. === Availability === Although estrone has been widely marketed in the past, it has mostly been discontinued and remains available in only a few countries. These countries reportedly include Canada, Georgia, Monaco, and Taiwan. However, estrone remains widely available throughout the world in the form of estrone sulfate, which can be found in estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), conjugated estrogens (Premarin), and esterified estrogens (Estratab, Menest). == Research == An estrone vaginal ring was developed and studied for use in menopausal hormone therapy. It increased estrogen levels, suppressed gonadotropin levels, and relieved menopausal symptoms. Subcutaneous pellet implantation of estrone has also been studied. == See also == Estradiol/estrone/estriol Estrone/progesterone Estrogenic substances == References == == Further reading ==",Cristallovar,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.04351029172539711), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.0007114782347343862), (' END', -2.963691804325208e-05), ('OG', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ENO', -0.0001589618914294988), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('INFO', -0.17219974100589752), (',', -0.10806304216384888), ('ĠMED', -0.046417880803346634), ('ICAL', -5.006777428206988e-06), (',', -0.12706401944160461), ('ĠEND', -0.0005651307292282581), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.007418110501021147)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4073,"('Terbinafine hydrochloride', 'Terbinafine hcl', 'Lamisil at', '(e)-n,6,6-trimethyl-n-(naphthalen-1-ylmethyl)hept-2-en-4-yn-1-amine hydrochloride', 'Terbinafina')",Medical,"Terbinafine is an antifungal medication used to treat pityriasis versicolor, fungal nail infections, and ringworm including jock itch and athlete's foot. It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Oral use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to synthesize ergosterol. It appears to result in fungal cell death. Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 255th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Terbinafine is mainly effective on molds of the order Onygenales and some yeasts in the genus Candida. As a cream or powder, it is used topically for superficial skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and other types of ringworm (tinea corporis). Tablets by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or Candida species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the cuticle to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to oral administration have been studied. Terbinafine may induce or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy. == Side effects == Many side effects and adverse drug reactions have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride, possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes: Gastrointestinal problems: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, fullness, abdominal pain, indigestion, dyspepsia, gastritis, cholestasis, flatulence, altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain Central nervous system or neurological problems: Headaches, dizziness, vertigo, light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles) Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver damage, liver failure Immune system problems: Decreased white blood cell counts including pancytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and neutropenia, autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus Psychological problems: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, increased or unusual dream activity, malaise Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste (ageusia), decreased taste (hypogeusia) and distorted taste (dysgeusia), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent Skin problems: Rashes, hives (urticaria), skin irritation, itching, jaundice, Stevens–Johnson syndrome Other side effects: Fatigue, increased heart rate (tachycardia), hair loss (alopecia), decreased red blood cell count (anemia), muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia) In 2015, physicians reported that a patient with an MTHFR enzyme mutation (specifically the C677T variant) had developed an adverse reaction to terbinafine (Lamisil) (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation. == Pharmacology == Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to lanosterol. In fungi, lanosterol is then converted to ergosterol; in humans, lanosterol becomes cholesterol. However, as fungi and animals diverged around 1.1 billion years ago - there is enough difference in this enzyme that terbinafine preferentially binds fungal squalene epoxidase, making it selective for inhibiting ergosterol production in fungi without significantly affecting cholesterol production in mammals. This is thought to fatally disrupt the fungal cell membrane. Terbinafine is highly lipophilic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fat cells. This accumulation results in therapeutic levels of terbinafine even after 80 days following one week treatment of 250 mg/day. Different dosing schedules have been proposed such as 500 mg/day for one week or 250 mg/day for two weeks each followed by a drug-free period of two or three weeks, totaling 3 months of treatment including the drug-free periods. Such intermittent dosing schedules appear to be as effective as continuous regimens. == Chemistry == Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. Terbinafine is produced by coupling of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne (tert-butylacetylene) with acrolein as a key step, followed by coupling of the product of that reaction, 6,6-dimethylhept-1-en-4-yn-3-ol, with N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. Multiple patents and publication to alternate syntheses are available. Despite its name it does not contain terbium. == History == Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is now approved for use by children age four and up. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat scalp fungus. In the United States the price in 1999 was $547 for a 12-week course; this fell to $10 by 2015, after the patent had expired. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Terbinafine is sold in India as Terboderm by Omega Pharma and Tyza (Abbott Healthcare). Lamisil in Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela Corbinal and Terbisil in Turkey, Pakistan, Undofen in Poland. Another alternate is Terbistad (Stada Arzneimittel). As a generic oral medication, it is sold as Sebifin, Tinasil, Terbisil, Terbicor, and Tamsil in Australia, whilst the generic topical medication is sold there as SolvEasyTinea and Tamsil.

4074,"('Pargyline hydrochloride', 'N-methyl-n-propargylbenzylamine hydrochloride', 'Pargyline hcl', 'Eutonyl-ten', 'N-benzyl-n-methylprop-2-yn-1-amine hydrochloride')",Medical,"Pargyline, sold under the brand name Eutonyl among others, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) medication which has been used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) but is no longer marketed. It has also been studied as an antidepressant, but was never licensed for use in the treatment of depression. The drug is taken by mouth. Side effects of pargyline include orthostatic hypotension among others. It has the potential for serious food and drug interactions with sympathomimetic agents like tyramine that can result in hypertensive crisis. Pargyline acts as a non-selective and irreversible inhibitor of the monoamine oxidases MAO-A and MAO-B. The exact mechanism of the hypotensive effects of pargyline and other MAOIs is unclear. Structurally, pargyline is a benzylamine derivative and is related to selegiline and clorgyline. Pargyline was first described in 1960 and was introduced for medical use in 1963. It was available in the United States and the United Kingdom. The clinical use of pargyline was limited due to its side effects and interactions. The drug remained available in the United States as late as 2000. However, it was fully discontinued worldwide by 2007. == Medical uses == Pargyline is used as an antihypertensive agent in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure). The dosage was 12.5 to 200 mg per day. Its onset of action is slow and several weeks of continuous administration are required for the effects to develop fully upon initiation of treatment. The decrease in blood pressure with pargyline is described as impressive and is especially strong when standing. However, the blood pressure decrease with pargyline is often difficult to control adequately. Pargyline shares its mechanism of action, monoamine oxidase inhibition, with a class of antidepressants that includes phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and isocarboxazid, among others. However, unlike other MAOIs, pargyline itself was never licensed for treatment of depression. In any case, the drug was studied in the treatment of depression and was advertised in the 1960s as an antihypertensive agent that also ""brightens emotional outlook"". == Side effects == Orthostatic hypotension (excessively low blood pressure when standing or standing up) is a prominent side effect of pargyline. Other side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, headaches, increased appetite, nervousness, insomnia, agitation, sedation, manic reactions, and psychotic reactions. == Interactions == Pargyline has the potential for serious food and drug interactions due to its MAOI actions. This includes hypertensive crisis with intake of norepinephrine releasing agents like tyramine, amphetamine, and ephedrine. Tyramine is found in high concentrations in certain cheeses and other foods and can result in hypertensive crisis often referred to as the ""cheese reaction"". Episodes of hypertensive crisis can be severe or fatal and this has greatly limited the clinical use of pargyline. Hypertensive crisis with pargyline is treated intravenously with sympatholytic alpha blockers like phentolamine. Combination of pargyline and the antihypertensive agent methyldopa has been found to result in intense and potentially fatal central nervous system excitation in rodents. This has been said to resemble the effects of amphetamine overdose. The interaction appears to be due to inhibition by pargyline of the metabolism of normally short-lived methyldopa metabolites like α-methyldopamine and α-methylnorepinephrine that act as potent catecholamine releasing agents. Visual hallucinations have been reported with coadministration of pargyline and methyldopa in humans. As such, use of methyldopa in combination with pargyline and other MAOIs is contraindicated. Pargyline is also a disulfiram-like drug and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor similarly to disulfiram and can produce alcohol intolerance-type reactions with alcohol. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Monoamine oxidase inhibition ==== Pargyline is a non-selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or an inhibitor of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Pargyline is said to have slight preference or selectivity for inhibition of MAO-B over MAO-A (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 8.20 nM and 11.52 nM, respectively). Using rodent systems however, pargyline showed 2- to 356-fold selectivity for MAO-B inhibition over MAO-A inhibition in different studies (compared to 16- to 6401-fold selectivity with selegiline). In relation to the preceding, pargyline has been referred to as a so-called semi-selective MAO-B inhibitor. It has also been found to show some selectivity for MAO-B inhibition with a single dose but results in non-selective inhibition with continuous administration. Pargyline produces its antihypertensive effects via MAO inhibition. However, the exact mechanism of action by which this occurs is unclear. Pargyline and other MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of norepinephrine and cause accumulation of norepinephrine in the heart, brain, and other adrenergic tissues. Some possibilities include diminished responsiveness to norepinephrine via increased norepinephrine levels in blood vessels and blockade blockade of the release of norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Another possibility is that pargyline increases levels of false neurotransmitters like octopamine and tyramine, which are weaker pressor agents than norepinephrine. However, the involvement of octopamine in the hypotensive effects of pargyline and other MAOIs is uncertain. Yet another possibility is that the hypotensive effects may be due to accumulation of N-acetylserotonin, which shows antihypertensive effects in animals. As of 2018, the precise mechanism of the hypotensive effects of MAOIs still remains unresolved. ==== Other actions ==== In addition to its actions as an MAOI, pargyline has been found to bind with high affinity to the I2 imidazoline receptor. This receptor has been found to actually be an allosteric site on the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme. A high dose of pargyline (10 mg/kg) has been found to stimulate locomotor activity, a psychostimulant-like effect, in certain behavioral tests in rats. This might be due to its MAOI activity and increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens or might be related to stimulant-like effects of its metabolites including benzylamine, N-methylbenzylamine, and/or N-propargylbenzylamine. However, no studies on this matter have been conducted. Certain other MAOIs, like iproniazid, phenelzine, pheniprazine, and tranylcypromine, but not nialamide, have likewise been found to produce amphetamine- and psychostimulant-like effects at high doses in animals. Several of these agents are known to metabolize into phenethylamines and amphetamines with catecholamine-releasing activity or to have intrinsic catecholamine-releasing actions of their own. Benzylamine derivatives have been found to act as catecholamine reuptake inhibitors. Pargyline has been found to act as an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. It is a disulfiram-like drug and can produce intolerance-type reactions with alcohol similarly to disulfiram. The ALDH inhibition of pargyline appears to be mediated by its metabolites, namely propiolaldehyde, but also propargylamine and benzylamine. Pargyline has been found to act as a reversible inhibitor of diamine oxidase (DAO)-mediated putrescine metabolism. It has additionally been found to act as a weak inhibitor of arylalkyl acylamidase and of histamine N-methyltransferase. In contrast to selegiline, pargyline does not appear to show catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE)-like effects. Similarly, pargyline is not an agonist of the mouse TAAR1. === Pharmacokinetics === Pargyline has high lipophilicity and is predicted to cross the blood–brain barrier. The drug has been shown to elevate brain monoamine levels, for instance of serotonin norepinephrine, dopamine, and trace amines, in animals. Pargyline is N-demethylated and N-depropargylated by CYP2E1 to form arylalkylamine and other metabolites including benzylamine, N-methylbenzylamine, and N-propargylbenzylamine, among others. These metabolites may then undergo additional metabolism, for instance hydroxylation and oxidation. It also forms propiolaldehyde and propargylamine. N‐Propargylbenzylamine, which is a major active metabolite of pargyline, is a potent and selective inhibitor of MAO-B in vivo in rats and may contribute importantly to MAO-B inhibition with pargyline. Other metabolites, like propiolaldehyde, are potent ALDH inhibitors. == Chemistry == Pargyline is an derivative of benzylamine and is also known as N-methyl-N-propargylbenzylamine. It is used pharmaceutically as the hydrochloride salt. Pargyline is a lipophilic compound, with a predicted log P of about 2.1. Pargyline preceded and is structurally related to the selective and irreversible MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (deprenyl; (R)-(–)-N-methyl-N-propargylamphetamine). Clorgyline (MB-9302; N-methyl-N-propargyl-3-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propylamine), another structural analogue of pargyline, is a selective and irreversible MAO-A inhibitor. == History == Pargyline was first described in the scientific literature in 1960. It was brought to market in the United States and the United Kingdom by Abbott Laboratories in 1963 as an antihypertensive drug. It was one of several MAOIs introduced in the 1960s including nialamide, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. By 2007, the drug was discontinued. As of 2014, there were no generic versions available in the United States. It continued to be available in the United States as late as 2000. == Society and culture == === Names === Pargyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt is pargyline hydrochloride. The drug is also known by the developmental code name MO-911. Marketed brand names of pargyline have included Eutonyl and Eutron. == Research == Pargyline has been studied in the treatment of depression. == References ==",Eutonyl-ten,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011152983643114567), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00021550717065110803), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008624449372291565)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([minclinic.eu](https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/E/Eutonyl-ten.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=9, title='MIN — what is Eutonyl-ten used for, medicine in english, dosing, side effects, generic, general information, pharmacology, interactions, contraindications, precautions, overdose, medication, treatment.', type='url_citation', url='https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/E/Eutonyl-ten.html?utm_source=openai')])"

4076,"('Naltrexone hydrochloride', 'Naltrexone hcl', 'Trexan', 'Depade', 'Antaxone')",Medical,"Naltrexone, sold under the brand name Revia among others, is a medication primarily used to manage alcohol use or opioid use disorder by reducing cravings and feelings of euphoria associated with substance use disorder. It has also been found effective in the treatment of other addictions and may be used for them off-label. An opioid-dependent person should not receive naltrexone before detoxification. It is taken orally or by injection into a muscle. Effects begin within 30 minutes, though a decreased desire for opioids may take a few weeks to occur. Side effects may include trouble sleeping, anxiety, nausea, and headaches. In those still on opioids, opioid withdrawal may occur. Use is not recommended in people with liver failure. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and works by blocking the effects of opioids, including both opioid drugs as well as opioids naturally produced in the brain. Naltrexone was first made in 1965 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. Naltrexone, as naltrexone/bupropion (brand name Contrave), is also used to treat obesity. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 254th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alcohol use disorder === Naltrexone has been best studied as a treatment for alcoholism. Naltrexone has been shown to decrease the quantity and frequency of ethanol consumption by reducing the dopamine release from the brain after consuming alcohol. It does not appear to change the percentage of people drinking. Its overall benefit has been described as ""modest"". Acamprosate may work better than naltrexone for eliminating alcohol abuse, while naltrexone may decrease the desire for alcohol to a greater extent. A method pioneered by scientist John David Sinclair (dubbed commercially the “Sinclair Method”) advocates for “pharmacological extinction” of problem drinking behavior by administering naltrexone alongside controlled alcohol consumption. In effect, he argues that naltrexone-induced opioid antagonism sufficiently disrupts reflexive reward mechanisms inherent in the consumption of alcohol and, given enough repetition, will dissociate positive associations formerly made with the consumption of alcohol. The Sinclair Method has a clinically proven success rate of 78%. === Opioid use disorder === Long-acting injectable naltrexone (under the brand name Vivitrol) is an opioid antagonist, blocking the effects of heroin and other opioids, and decreases heroin use compared to a placebo. Unlike methadone and buprenorphine, it is not a controlled medication. It may decrease cravings for opioids after a number of weeks, and decreases the risk of overdose, at least during the time period that naltrexone is still active, though concern about risk of overdose for those stopping treatment remains. It is given once per month and has better compliance and effect for opioid use than the oral formulation. A drawback of injectable naltrexone is that it requires patients with opioid use disorder and current physiological dependence to be fully withdrawn before it is initiated to avoid a precipitated opioid withdrawal that may be quite severe. In contrast, initiation of buprenorphine only requires delay of the first dose until the patient begins to manifest at least mild opioid withdrawal symptoms. Among patients able to successfully initiate injectable naltrexone, long-term remission rates were similar to those seen in clinical buprenorphine/naloxone administration. The consequence of relapse when weighing the best course of treatment for opiate use disorder remains a concern. Methadone and buprenorphine administration maintain greater drug tolerance while naltrexone allows tolerance to fade, leading to higher instances of an overdose in people who relapse and thus higher mortality. World Health Organization guidelines state that most patients should be advised to use opioid agonists (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) rather than opioid antagonists like naltrexone, citing evidence of superiority in reducing mortality and retaining patients in care. A 2011 review found insufficient evidence to determine the effect of naltrexone taken orally on opioid dependence. While some do well with this formulation, it must be taken daily, and a person whose cravings become overwhelming can obtain opioid intoxication simply by skipping a dose. Due to this issue, the usefulness of oral naltrexone in opioid use disorder is limited by the low retention in treatment. Naltrexone taken orally remains an ideal treatment for a small number of people with opioid use, usually those with a stable social situation and motivation. With additional contingency management support, naltrexone may be effective in a broader population. === Others === Unlike varenicline (brand name Chantix), naltrexone is not useful for quitting smoking. Naltrexone has also been under investigation for reducing behavioral addictions such as gambling, NSSID (non-suicidal self-injury disorder), and kleptomania, as well as compulsive sexual behaviors in both offenders and non-offenders (e.g. compulsive porn viewing and masturbation). The results were promising. In one study, the majority of sexual offenders reported a strong reduction in sexual urges and fantasies which reverted to baseline once the medication was discontinued. Case reports have also shown cessation of gambling and other compulsive behaviors, for as long as the medication was taken. When taken at much smaller doses, a regimen known as low-dose naltrexone (LDN), naltrexone may reduce pain and help to address neurological symptoms. Some patients report that LDN helps reduce their symptoms of ME/CFS, multiple sclerosis (MS), fibromyalgia, or autoimmune diseases. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, some have speculated that it may act as an anti-inflammatory. LDN is also being considered as a potential treatment for long COVID. === Available forms === Naltrexone is available and most commonly used in the form of an oral tablet (50 mg). Vivitrol, a naltrexone formulation for depot injection containing 380 mg of the medication per vial, is also available. Additionally, naltrexone subcutaneous implants that are surgically implanted are available. While these are manufactured in Australia, they are not authorized for use within Australia, but only for export. By 2009, naltrexone implants showed superior efficacy in the treatment of heroin dependence when compared to the oral form. == Contraindications == Naltrexone should not be used by persons with acute hepatitis or liver failure, or those with recent opioid use (typically 7–10 days). == Side effects == The most common side effects reported with naltrexone are gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are analogous to the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, as the μ-opioid receptor blockade will increase gastrointestinal motility. The side effects of naltrexone by incidence are as follows: Greater than 10%: difficulty sleeping, anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea and/or vomiting, low energy, joint/muscle pain, and headache. Less than 10%: loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, thirstiness, increased energy, feeling down, irritability, dizziness, skin rash, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and chills. A variety of other adverse events have also been reported with less than 1% incidence. === Opioid withdrawal === Naltrexone should not be started until several (typically 7–10) days of abstinence from opioids have been achieved. This is due to the risk of acute opioid withdrawal if naltrexone is taken, as naltrexone will displace most opioids from their receptors. The time of abstinence may be shorter than 7 days, depending on the half-life of the specific opioid taken. Some physicians use a naloxone challenge to determine whether an individual has any opioids remaining. The challenge involves giving a test dose of naloxone and monitoring for opioid withdrawal. If withdrawal occurs, naltrexone should not be started. === Adverse effects === Whether naltrexone causes dysphoria, depression, anhedonia, or other aversive effects has been studied and reviewed. In early studies of normal and opioid-abstinent individuals, acute and short-term administration of naltrexone was reported to produce a variety of aversive effects including fatigue, loss of energy, sleepiness, mild dysphoria, depression, lightheadedness, faintness, confusion, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweating, and occasional derealization. However, these studies were small, often uncontrolled, and used subjective means of assessing side effects. Most subsequent longer-term studies of naltrexone for indications like alcohol or opioid dependence have not reported dysphoria or depression with naltrexone in most individuals. According to one source: Naltrexone itself produces little or no psychoactive effect in normal research volunteers even at high doses, which is remarkable given that the endogenous opioid system is important in normal hedonic functioning. Because endogenous opioids are involved in the brain reward system, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that naltrexone might produce anhedonic or dysphoric effects. Although some evidence from small, early trials suggested that patients with a history of opiate dependence might be susceptible to dysphoric effects in response to naltrexone (Crowley et al. 1985; Hollister et al. 1981), reports of such effects have been inconsistent. Most large clinical studies of recovering opioid-dependent individuals have not found naltrexone to have an adverse effect on mood (Greenstein et al. 1984; Malcolm et al. 1987; Miotto et al. 2002; Shufman et al. 1994). Some studies have actually found improvements in mood during the course of treatment with naltrexone (Miotto et al. 1997; Rawlins and Randall 1976). Based on available evidence, naltrexone seems to have minimal untoward effects in the aforementioned areas, at least with long-term therapy. It has been suggested that differences in findings between acute and longer-term studies of naltrexone treatment might be related to altered function in the opioid system with chronic administration of naltrexone. For example, marked upregulation of opioid receptors and hyper-sensitivity to opioids have been observed with naltrexone in preclinical studies. Another possibility is that the central opioid system may have low endogenous functionality in most individuals, becoming active only in the presence of exogenously administered opioid receptor agonists or with stimulation by endogenous opioids induced by pain or stress. A third possibility is that normal individuals may experience different side effects with naltrexone than people with addictive disease such as alcohol or opioid dependence, who may have altered opioid tone or responsiveness. It is notable in this regard that most studies of naltrexone have been in people with substance dependence. Naltrexone may also initially produce opioid withdrawal-like symptoms in a small subset of people not dependent on opioids: The side-effect profile [of naltrexone], at least on the recommended dose of 50 mg per day, is generally benign, although 5 to 10 percent of detoxified opioid addicts experience immediate, intolerable levels of withdrawal-like effects including agitation, anxiety, insomnia, light-headedness, sweating, dysphoria, and nausea. Most patients on naltrexone experience few or no symptoms after the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment; for a substantial minority (20 to 30 percent) protracted discomfort is experienced. Persisting affective distress related to naltrexone may account for individuals taking the drug who drop out of treatment. Naltrexone has been reported to reduce feelings of social connection. The μ-opioid receptor has been found to play a major role in social reward in animals and the μ-opioid receptor knockout mouse is an animal model of autism. Studies on whether naltrexone can decrease the pleasurable effects of listening to music are conflicting. Besides humans, naltrexone has been found to produce aversive effects in rodents as assessed by conditioned place aversion. === Liver damage === Naltrexone has been reported to cause liver damage when given at doses higher than recommended. It carries an FDA boxed warning for this rare side effect. Due to these reports, some physicians may check liver function tests before starting naltrexone, and periodically thereafter. Concerns for liver toxicity initially arose from a study of nonaddicted obese patients receiving 300 mg of naltrexone. Subsequent studies have suggested limited or no toxicity in other patient populations and at typical recommended doses such as 50 to 100 mg/day. == Overdose == No toxic effects have been observed with naltrexone in doses of up to 800 mg/day in clinical studies. The largest reported overdose of naltrexone, which was 1,500 mg in a female patient and was equivalent to an entire bottle of medication (30 × 50 mg tablets), was uneventful. No deaths are known to have occurred with naltrexone overdose. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Opioid receptor blockade ==== Naltrexone and its active metabolite 6β-naltrexol are competitive antagonists of the opioid receptors. Naltrexone is specifically an antagonist preferentially of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), to a lesser extent of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and to a much lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). However, naltrexone is not actually a silent antagonist of these receptors but instead acts as a weak partial agonist, with Emax values of 14 to 29% at the MOR, 16 to 39% at the KOR, and 14 to 25% at the DOR in different studies. In accordance with its partial agonism, although naltrexone is described as a pure opioid receptor antagonist, it has shown some evidence of weak opioid effects in clinical and preclinical studies. By itself, naltrexone acts as an antagonist or weak partial agonist of the opioid receptors. In combination with agonists of the MOR such as morphine however, naltrexone appears to become an inverse agonist of the MOR. Conversely, the naltrexone remains a neutral antagonist (or weak partial agonist) of the KOR and DOR. In contrast to naltrexone, 6β-naltrexol is purely a neutral antagonist of the opioid receptors. The MOR inverse agonism of naltrexone, when it is co-present with MOR agonists, may in part underlie its ability to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. This may be due to suppression of basal MOR signaling via inverse agonism. Occupancy of the opioid receptors in the brain by naltrexone has been studied using positron emission tomography (PET). Naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/day has been found to occupy approximately 90 to 95% of brain MORs and 20 to 35% of brain DORs. Naltrexone at a dose of 100 mg/day has been found to achieve 87% and 92% brain occupancy of the KOR in different studies. Per simulation, a lower dose of naltrexone of 25 mg/day might be expected to achieve around 60% brain occupancy of the KOR but still close to 90% occupancy of the MOR. In a study of the duration of MOR blockade with naltrexone, the drug with a single 50 mg dose showed 91% blockade of brain [11C]carfentanil (a selective MOR ligand) binding at 48 hours (2 days), 80% blockade at 72 hours (3 days), 46% blockade at 120 hours (5 days), and 30% blockade at 168 hours (7 days). The half-time of brain MOR blockade by naltrexone in this study was 72 to 108 hours (3.0 to 4.5 days). Based on these findings, doses of naltrexone of even less than 50 mg/day would be expected to achieve virtually complete brain MOR occupancy. Blockade of brain MORs with naltrexone is much longer-lasting than with other opioid antagonists like naloxone (half-time of ~1.7 hours intranasally) or nalmefene (half-time of ~29 hours). The half-life of occupancy of the brain MOR and duration of clinical effect of naltrexone are much longer than suggested by its plasma elimination half-life. A single 50 mg oral dose of naltrexone has been found to block brain MORs and opioid effects for at least 48 to 72 hours. The half-time of brain MOR blockade by naltrexone (72–108 hours) is much longer than the fast plasma clearance component of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol (~4–12 hours) but was reported to correspond well to the longer terminal phase of plasma naltrexone clearance (96 hours). As an alternative possibility, the prolonged brain MOR occupancy by opioid antagonists like naltrexone and nalmefene may be due to slow dissociation from MORs consequent to their very high MOR affinity (<1.0 nM). Naltrexone blocks the effects of MOR agonists like morphine, heroin, and hydromorphone in humans via its MOR antagonism. Following a single 100 mg dose of naltrexone, the subjective and objective effects of heroin were blocked by 90% at 24 hours, with blockade then decreasing up to 72 hours. Similarly, 20 to 200 mg naltrexone dose-dependently antagonized the effects of heroin for up to 72 hours. Naltrexone also blocks the effects of KOR agonists like salvinorin A, pentazocine, and butorphanol in humans via its KOR antagonism. In addition to opioids, naltrexone has been found to block or reduce the rewarding and other effects of other euphoriant drugs including alcohol, nicotine, and amphetamines. The opioid receptors are involved in neuroendocrine regulation. MOR agonists produce increases in levels of prolactin and decreases in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone. Doses of naltrexone of 25 to 150 mg/day have been found to produce significant increases in levels of β-endorphin, cortisol, and LH, equivocal changes in levels of prolactin and testosterone, and no significant changes in levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Naltrexone influences the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) probably through interference with opioid receptor signaling by endorphins. Blockade of MORs is thought to be the mechanism of action of naltrexone in the management of opioid dependence—it reversibly blocks or attenuates the effects of opioids. It is also thought to be involved in the effectiveness of naltrexone in alcohol dependence by reducing the euphoric effects of alcohol. The role of KOR modulation by naltrexone in its effectiveness for alcohol dependence is unclear but this action may also be involved based on theory and animal studies. ==== Other activities ==== In addition to the opioid receptors, naltrexone binds to and acts as an antagonist of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interacts with high- and low-affinity binding sites in filamin A (FLNA). It is said that very low doses of naltrexone (<0.001–1 mg/day) interact with FLNA, low doses (1 to 5 mg/day) produce TLR4 antagonism, and standard clinical doses (50 to 100 mg/day) exert opioid receptor and OGFR antagonism. The interactions of naltrexone with FLNA and TLR4 are claimed to be involved in the therapeutic effects of low-dose naltrexone. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absorption of naltrexone with oral administration is rapid and nearly complete (96%). The bioavailability of naltrexone with oral administration is 5 to 60% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Peak concentrations of naltrexone are 19 to 44 μg/L after a single 100 mg oral dose and time to peak concentrations of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol (metabolite) is within 1 hour. Linear increases in circulating naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol concentrations occur over an oral dose range of 50 to 200 mg. Naltrexone does not appear to be accumulated with repeated once-daily oral administration and there is no change in time to peak concentrations with repeated administration. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of naltrexone is about 20% over a naltrexone concentration range of 0.1 to 500 μg/L. Its apparent volume of distribution at 100 mg orally is 16.1 L/kg after a single dose and 14.2 L/kg with repeated doses. ==== Metabolism ==== Naltrexone is metabolized in the liver mainly by dihydrodiol dehydrogenases into 6β-naltrexol (6β-hydroxynaltrexone). Levels of 6β-naltrexol are 10- to 30-fold higher than those of naltrexone with oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Conversely, 6β-naltrexol exposure is only about 2-fold higher than that of naltrexone with intramuscular injection of naltrexone in microspheres (brand name Vivitrol). 6β-Naltrexol is an opioid receptor antagonist similarly to naltrexone and shows a comparable binding profile to the opioid receptors. However, 6β-naltrexol is peripherally selective and crosses into the brain much less readily than does naltrexone. In any case, 6β-naltrexol does still show some central activity and may contribute significantly to the central actions of oral naltrexone. Other metabolites of naltrexone include 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6β-naltrexol and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxynaltrexone. Following their formation, the metabolites of naltrexone are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to form glucuronides. Naltrexone is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has low potential for drug interactions. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination of naltrexone is biexponential and rapid over the first 24 hours followed by a third extremely slow decline after 24 hours. The fast elimination half-lives of naltrexone and its metabolite 6β-naltrexol are about 4 hours and 13 hours, respectively. In Contrave oral tablets, which also contain bupropion and are described as extended-release, the half-life of naltrexone is 5 hours. The slow terminal-phase elimination half-life of naltrexone is approximately 96 hours. As microspheres of naltrexone by intramuscular injection (Vivitrol), the elimination half-lives of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol are both 5 to 10 days. Whereas oral naltrexone is administered daily, naltrexone in microspheres by intramuscular injection is suitable for administration once every 4 weeks or once per month. Naltrexone and its metabolites are excreted in urine. === Pharmacogenetics === Tentative evidence suggests that family history and presence of the Asn40Asp polymorphism predict naltrexone being effective. == Chemistry == Naltrexone, also known as N-cyclopropylmethylnoroxymorphone, is a derivative of oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone). It is specifically the derivative of oxymorphone in which the tertiary amine methyl substituent is replaced with methylcyclopropane. === Analogues === The closely related medication, methylnaltrexone (N-methylnaltrexone), is used to treat opioid-induced constipation but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Nalmefene (6-desoxy-6-methylenenaltrexone) is similar to naltrexone and is used for the same purposes as naltrexone. Naltrexone should not be confused with naloxone (N-allylnoroxymorphone), which is used in emergency cases of opioid overdose. Other opioid antagonists related to naltrexone include 6β-naltrexol (6β-hydroxynaltrexone), samidorphan (3-carboxamido-4-hydroxynaltrexone), β-funaltrexamine (naltrexone fumarate methyl ester), nalodeine (N-allylnorcodeine), nalorphine (N-allylnormorphine), and nalbuphine (N-cyclobutylmethyl-14-hydroxydihydronormorphine). == History == Naltrexone was first synthesized in 1963 by Metossian at Endo Laboratories, a small pharmaceutical company in New York City. It was characterized by Blumberg, Dayton, and Wolf in 1965 and was found to be an orally active, long-acting, and very potent opioid antagonist. The drug showed advantages over earlier opioid antagonists such as cyclazocine, nalorphine, and naloxone, including its oral activity, a long duration of action allowing for once-daily administration, and a lack of dysphoria, and was selected for further development. It was patented by Endo Laboratories in 1967 under the developmental code name EN-1639A and Endo Laboratories was acquired by DuPont in 1969. Clinical trials for opioid dependence began in 1973, and a developmental collaboration of DuPont with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for this indication started the next year in 1974. The drug was approved by the FDA for the oral treatment of opioid dependence in 1984, with the brand name Trexan, and for the oral treatment of alcohol dependence in 1995, when the brand name was changed by DuPont to Revia. A depot formulation for intramuscular injection was approved by the FDA under the brand name Vivitrol for alcohol dependence in 2006 and opioid dependence in 2010. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Naltrexone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, while naltrexone hydrochloride is its USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia and BANMTooltip British Approved Name. === Brand names === Naltrexone is or has been sold under a variety of brand names, including Adepend, Antaxone, Celupan, Depade, Destoxican, Nalorex, Narcoral, Nemexin, Nodict, Revia, Trexan, Vivitrex, and Vivitrol. It is also marketed in combination with bupropion (naltrexone/bupropion) as Contrave, and was marketed with morphine (morphine/naltrexone) as Embeda. A combination of naltrexone with buprenorphine (buprenorphine/naltrexone) has been developed, but has not been marketed. === Controversies === The FDA authorized use of injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid addiction using a single study that was led by Evgeny Krupitsky at Bekhterev Research Psychoneurological Institute, St Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University, St Petersburg, Russia, a country where opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine are not available. The study was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized"", 24-week trial running ""from July 3, 2008, through October 5, 2009"" with ""250 patients with opioid dependence disorder"" at ""13 clinical sites in Russia"" on the use of injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence. The study was funded by the Boston-based biotech Alkermes firm which produces and markets naltrexone in the United States. Critics charged that the study violated ethical guidelines since it compared the formulation of naltrexone not to the best available, evidence-based treatment (methadone or buprenorphine), but to a placebo. Further, the trial did not follow patients who dropped out of the trial to evaluate subsequent risk of fatal overdose, a major health concern . Subsequent trials in Norway and the US did compare injectable naltrexone to buprenorphine and found them to be similar in outcomes for patients willing to undergo the withdrawal symptoms required before naltrexone administration. Nearly 30% of patients in the US trial did not complete induction. In real-world settings, a review of more than 40,000 patient records found that while methadone and buprenorphine reduced risk of fatal overdose, naltrexone administration showed no greater effect on overdose or subsequent emergency care than counseling alone. Despite these findings, naltrexone's manufacturer and some health authorities have promoted the medicine as superior to methadone and buprenorphine since it is not an opioid and does not induce dependence. The manufacturer has also marketed directly to law enforcement and criminal justice officials, spending millions of dollars on lobbying and providing thousands of free doses to jails and prisons. The technique has been successful, with the criminal justice system in 43 states now incorporating long-acting naltrexone. Many do this through Vivitrol courts that offer only this option, leading some to characterize this as ""an offer that cannot be refused."" The company's marketing techniques have led to a Congressional investigation, and warning from the FDA about failure to adequately state risks of fatal overdose to patients receiving the medicine. In May 2017, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price praised [Vivitrol] as the future of opioid addiction treatment after visiting the company's plant in Ohio. His remarks set off sharp criticism with almost 700 experts in the field of substance use submitting a letter to Price cautioning him about Vivitrol's ""marketing tactics"" and warning him that his comments ""ignore widely accepted science"". The experts pointed out that Vivitrol's competitors, buprenorphine and methadone, are ""less expensive"", ""more widely used"", and have been ""rigorously studied"". Price had claimed that buprenorphine and methadone were ""simply substitute[s]"" for ""illicit drugs"" whereas according to the letter, ""the substantial body of research evidence supporting these treatments is summarized in guidance from within your own agency, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Buprenorphine and methadone have been demonstrated to be highly effective in managing the core symptoms of opioid use disorder, reducing the risk of relapse and fatal overdose, and encouraging long-term recovery."" === Film === One Little Pill was a 2014 documentary film about the use of naltrexone to treat alcohol use disorder. Four Good Days is a 2020 film about the four days a drug addict woman has to stay sober to get a shot of naltrexone in a detox facility. == Research == === Depersonalization === Naltrexone is sometimes used in the treatment of dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization and derealization. Some studies suggest it might help. Other small, preliminary studies have also shown benefit. Blockade of the KOR by naltrexone and naloxone is thought to be responsible for their effectiveness in ameliorating depersonalization and derealization. Since these drugs are less efficacious in blocking the KOR relative to the MOR, higher doses than typically used seem to be necessary. === Low-dose naltrexone === Naltrexone has been used off-label at low doses for diseases not related to chemical dependency or intoxication, such as multiple sclerosis. Evidence for recommending low-dose naltrexone is lacking. This treatment has received attention on the Internet. In 2022, four studies (in a few hundred patients) were conducted on naltrexone for long COVID. === Self-injury === One study suggests that self-injurious behaviors present in persons with developmental disabilities (including autism) can sometimes be remedied with naltrexone. In these cases, the self-injury is believed to be done to release beta-endorphin, which binds to the same receptors as heroin and morphine. If the ""rush"" generated by self-injury is removed, the behavior may stop. === Behavioral disorders === Some indications exist that naltrexone might be beneficial in the treatment of impulse-control disorders such as kleptomania, compulsive gambling, or trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling), but evidence of its effectiveness for gambling is conflicting. A 2008 case study reported successful use of naltrexone in suppressing and treating an internet pornography addiction. === Interferon alpha === Naltrexone is effective in suppressing the cytokine-mediated adverse neuropsychiatric effects of interferon alpha therapy. === Critical addiction studies === Some historians and sociologists have suggested that the meanings and uses attributed to anti-craving medicine, such as naltrexone, are context-dependent. Studies have suggested the use of naltrexone in drug courts or healthcare rehabs is a form of ""post-social control,"" or ""post-disciplinary control,"" whereby control strategies for managing offenders and addicts shift from imprisonment and supervision toward more direct control over biological processes. === Sexual addiction === Small studies have shown a reduction of sexual addiction and problematic sexual behaviours from naltrexone. == References ==",Depade,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002320735511602834), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0052612656727433205)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/drugs/pharmacology/naltrexone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=116, start_index=9, title='Naltrexone | Encyclopedia.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/drugs/pharmacology/naltrexone?utm_source=openai')])"
4077,"('Naltrexone', 'Revia', 'N-cyclopropylmethylnoroxymorphone', 'Vivitrex', 'Vivitrol')",Medical,"Naltrexone, sold under the brand name Revia among others, is a medication primarily used to manage alcohol use or opioid use disorder by reducing cravings and feelings of euphoria associated with substance use disorder. It has also been found effective in the treatment of other addictions and may be used for them off-label. An opioid-dependent person should not receive naltrexone before detoxification. It is taken orally or by injection into a muscle. Effects begin within 30 minutes, though a decreased desire for opioids may take a few weeks to occur. Side effects may include trouble sleeping, anxiety, nausea, and headaches. In those still on opioids, opioid withdrawal may occur. Use is not recommended in people with liver failure. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and works by blocking the effects of opioids, including both opioid drugs as well as opioids naturally produced in the brain. Naltrexone was first made in 1965 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. Naltrexone, as naltrexone/bupropion (brand name Contrave), is also used to treat obesity. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 254th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alcohol use disorder === Naltrexone has been best studied as a treatment for alcoholism. Naltrexone has been shown to decrease the quantity and frequency of ethanol consumption by reducing the dopamine release from the brain after consuming alcohol. It does not appear to change the percentage of people drinking. Its overall benefit has been described as ""modest"". Acamprosate may work better than naltrexone for eliminating alcohol abuse, while naltrexone may decrease the desire for alcohol to a greater extent. A method pioneered by scientist John David Sinclair (dubbed commercially the “Sinclair Method”) advocates for “pharmacological extinction” of problem drinking behavior by administering naltrexone alongside controlled alcohol consumption. In effect, he argues that naltrexone-induced opioid antagonism sufficiently disrupts reflexive reward mechanisms inherent in the consumption of alcohol and, given enough repetition, will dissociate positive associations formerly made with the consumption of alcohol. The Sinclair Method has a clinically proven success rate of 78%. === Opioid use disorder === Long-acting injectable naltrexone (under the brand name Vivitrol) is an opioid antagonist, blocking the effects of heroin and other opioids, and decreases heroin use compared to a placebo. Unlike methadone and buprenorphine, it is not a controlled medication. It may decrease cravings for opioids after a number of weeks, and decreases the risk of overdose, at least during the time period that naltrexone is still active, though concern about risk of overdose for those stopping treatment remains. It is given once per month and has better compliance and effect for opioid use than the oral formulation. A drawback of injectable naltrexone is that it requires patients with opioid use disorder and current physiological dependence to be fully withdrawn before it is initiated to avoid a precipitated opioid withdrawal that may be quite severe. In contrast, initiation of buprenorphine only requires delay of the first dose until the patient begins to manifest at least mild opioid withdrawal symptoms. Among patients able to successfully initiate injectable naltrexone, long-term remission rates were similar to those seen in clinical buprenorphine/naloxone administration. The consequence of relapse when weighing the best course of treatment for opiate use disorder remains a concern. Methadone and buprenorphine administration maintain greater drug tolerance while naltrexone allows tolerance to fade, leading to higher instances of an overdose in people who relapse and thus higher mortality. World Health Organization guidelines state that most patients should be advised to use opioid agonists (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) rather than opioid antagonists like naltrexone, citing evidence of superiority in reducing mortality and retaining patients in care. A 2011 review found insufficient evidence to determine the effect of naltrexone taken orally on opioid dependence. While some do well with this formulation, it must be taken daily, and a person whose cravings become overwhelming can obtain opioid intoxication simply by skipping a dose. Due to this issue, the usefulness of oral naltrexone in opioid use disorder is limited by the low retention in treatment. Naltrexone taken orally remains an ideal treatment for a small number of people with opioid use, usually those with a stable social situation and motivation. With additional contingency management support, naltrexone may be effective in a broader population. === Others === Unlike varenicline (brand name Chantix), naltrexone is not useful for quitting smoking. Naltrexone has also been under investigation for reducing behavioral addictions such as gambling, NSSID (non-suicidal self-injury disorder), and kleptomania, as well as compulsive sexual behaviors in both offenders and non-offenders (e.g. compulsive porn viewing and masturbation). The results were promising. In one study, the majority of sexual offenders reported a strong reduction in sexual urges and fantasies which reverted to baseline once the medication was discontinued. Case reports have also shown cessation of gambling and other compulsive behaviors, for as long as the medication was taken. When taken at much smaller doses, a regimen known as low-dose naltrexone (LDN), naltrexone may reduce pain and help to address neurological symptoms. Some patients report that LDN helps reduce their symptoms of ME/CFS, multiple sclerosis (MS), fibromyalgia, or autoimmune diseases. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, some have speculated that it may act as an anti-inflammatory. LDN is also being considered as a potential treatment for long COVID. === Available forms === Naltrexone is available and most commonly used in the form of an oral tablet (50 mg). Vivitrol, a naltrexone formulation for depot injection containing 380 mg of the medication per vial, is also available. Additionally, naltrexone subcutaneous implants that are surgically implanted are available. While these are manufactured in Australia, they are not authorized for use within Australia, but only for export. By 2009, naltrexone implants showed superior efficacy in the treatment of heroin dependence when compared to the oral form. == Contraindications == Naltrexone should not be used by persons with acute hepatitis or liver failure, or those with recent opioid use (typically 7–10 days). == Side effects == The most common side effects reported with naltrexone are gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are analogous to the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, as the μ-opioid receptor blockade will increase gastrointestinal motility. The side effects of naltrexone by incidence are as follows: Greater than 10%: difficulty sleeping, anxiety, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, nausea and/or vomiting, low energy, joint/muscle pain, and headache. Less than 10%: loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, thirstiness, increased energy, feeling down, irritability, dizziness, skin rash, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, and chills. A variety of other adverse events have also been reported with less than 1% incidence. === Opioid withdrawal === Naltrexone should not be started until several (typically 7–10) days of abstinence from opioids have been achieved. This is due to the risk of acute opioid withdrawal if naltrexone is taken, as naltrexone will displace most opioids from their receptors. The time of abstinence may be shorter than 7 days, depending on the half-life of the specific opioid taken. Some physicians use a naloxone challenge to determine whether an individual has any opioids remaining. The challenge involves giving a test dose of naloxone and monitoring for opioid withdrawal. If withdrawal occurs, naltrexone should not be started. === Adverse effects === Whether naltrexone causes dysphoria, depression, anhedonia, or other aversive effects has been studied and reviewed. In early studies of normal and opioid-abstinent individuals, acute and short-term administration of naltrexone was reported to produce a variety of aversive effects including fatigue, loss of energy, sleepiness, mild dysphoria, depression, lightheadedness, faintness, confusion, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweating, and occasional derealization. However, these studies were small, often uncontrolled, and used subjective means of assessing side effects. Most subsequent longer-term studies of naltrexone for indications like alcohol or opioid dependence have not reported dysphoria or depression with naltrexone in most individuals. According to one source: Naltrexone itself produces little or no psychoactive effect in normal research volunteers even at high doses, which is remarkable given that the endogenous opioid system is important in normal hedonic functioning. Because endogenous opioids are involved in the brain reward system, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that naltrexone might produce anhedonic or dysphoric effects. Although some evidence from small, early trials suggested that patients with a history of opiate dependence might be susceptible to dysphoric effects in response to naltrexone (Crowley et al. 1985; Hollister et al. 1981), reports of such effects have been inconsistent. Most large clinical studies of recovering opioid-dependent individuals have not found naltrexone to have an adverse effect on mood (Greenstein et al. 1984; Malcolm et al. 1987; Miotto et al. 2002; Shufman et al. 1994). Some studies have actually found improvements in mood during the course of treatment with naltrexone (Miotto et al. 1997; Rawlins and Randall 1976). Based on available evidence, naltrexone seems to have minimal untoward effects in the aforementioned areas, at least with long-term therapy. It has been suggested that differences in findings between acute and longer-term studies of naltrexone treatment might be related to altered function in the opioid system with chronic administration of naltrexone. For example, marked upregulation of opioid receptors and hyper-sensitivity to opioids have been observed with naltrexone in preclinical studies. Another possibility is that the central opioid system may have low endogenous functionality in most individuals, becoming active only in the presence of exogenously administered opioid receptor agonists or with stimulation by endogenous opioids induced by pain or stress. A third possibility is that normal individuals may experience different side effects with naltrexone than people with addictive disease such as alcohol or opioid dependence, who may have altered opioid tone or responsiveness. It is notable in this regard that most studies of naltrexone have been in people with substance dependence. Naltrexone may also initially produce opioid withdrawal-like symptoms in a small subset of people not dependent on opioids: The side-effect profile [of naltrexone], at least on the recommended dose of 50 mg per day, is generally benign, although 5 to 10 percent of detoxified opioid addicts experience immediate, intolerable levels of withdrawal-like effects including agitation, anxiety, insomnia, light-headedness, sweating, dysphoria, and nausea. Most patients on naltrexone experience few or no symptoms after the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment; for a substantial minority (20 to 30 percent) protracted discomfort is experienced. Persisting affective distress related to naltrexone may account for individuals taking the drug who drop out of treatment. Naltrexone has been reported to reduce feelings of social connection. The μ-opioid receptor has been found to play a major role in social reward in animals and the μ-opioid receptor knockout mouse is an animal model of autism. Studies on whether naltrexone can decrease the pleasurable effects of listening to music are conflicting. Besides humans, naltrexone has been found to produce aversive effects in rodents as assessed by conditioned place aversion. === Liver damage === Naltrexone has been reported to cause liver damage when given at doses higher than recommended. It carries an FDA boxed warning for this rare side effect. Due to these reports, some physicians may check liver function tests before starting naltrexone, and periodically thereafter. Concerns for liver toxicity initially arose from a study of nonaddicted obese patients receiving 300 mg of naltrexone. Subsequent studies have suggested limited or no toxicity in other patient populations and at typical recommended doses such as 50 to 100 mg/day. == Overdose == No toxic effects have been observed with naltrexone in doses of up to 800 mg/day in clinical studies. The largest reported overdose of naltrexone, which was 1,500 mg in a female patient and was equivalent to an entire bottle of medication (30 × 50 mg tablets), was uneventful. No deaths are known to have occurred with naltrexone overdose. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Opioid receptor blockade ==== Naltrexone and its active metabolite 6β-naltrexol are competitive antagonists of the opioid receptors. Naltrexone is specifically an antagonist preferentially of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), to a lesser extent of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and to a much lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). However, naltrexone is not actually a silent antagonist of these receptors but instead acts as a weak partial agonist, with Emax values of 14 to 29% at the MOR, 16 to 39% at the KOR, and 14 to 25% at the DOR in different studies. In accordance with its partial agonism, although naltrexone is described as a pure opioid receptor antagonist, it has shown some evidence of weak opioid effects in clinical and preclinical studies. By itself, naltrexone acts as an antagonist or weak partial agonist of the opioid receptors. In combination with agonists of the MOR such as morphine however, naltrexone appears to become an inverse agonist of the MOR. Conversely, the naltrexone remains a neutral antagonist (or weak partial agonist) of the KOR and DOR. In contrast to naltrexone, 6β-naltrexol is purely a neutral antagonist of the opioid receptors. The MOR inverse agonism of naltrexone, when it is co-present with MOR agonists, may in part underlie its ability to precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals. This may be due to suppression of basal MOR signaling via inverse agonism. Occupancy of the opioid receptors in the brain by naltrexone has been studied using positron emission tomography (PET). Naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/day has been found to occupy approximately 90 to 95% of brain MORs and 20 to 35% of brain DORs. Naltrexone at a dose of 100 mg/day has been found to achieve 87% and 92% brain occupancy of the KOR in different studies. Per simulation, a lower dose of naltrexone of 25 mg/day might be expected to achieve around 60% brain occupancy of the KOR but still close to 90% occupancy of the MOR. In a study of the duration of MOR blockade with naltrexone, the drug with a single 50 mg dose showed 91% blockade of brain [11C]carfentanil (a selective MOR ligand) binding at 48 hours (2 days), 80% blockade at 72 hours (3 days), 46% blockade at 120 hours (5 days), and 30% blockade at 168 hours (7 days). The half-time of brain MOR blockade by naltrexone in this study was 72 to 108 hours (3.0 to 4.5 days). Based on these findings, doses of naltrexone of even less than 50 mg/day would be expected to achieve virtually complete brain MOR occupancy. Blockade of brain MORs with naltrexone is much longer-lasting than with other opioid antagonists like naloxone (half-time of ~1.7 hours intranasally) or nalmefene (half-time of ~29 hours). The half-life of occupancy of the brain MOR and duration of clinical effect of naltrexone are much longer than suggested by its plasma elimination half-life. A single 50 mg oral dose of naltrexone has been found to block brain MORs and opioid effects for at least 48 to 72 hours. The half-time of brain MOR blockade by naltrexone (72–108 hours) is much longer than the fast plasma clearance component of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol (~4–12 hours) but was reported to correspond well to the longer terminal phase of plasma naltrexone clearance (96 hours). As an alternative possibility, the prolonged brain MOR occupancy by opioid antagonists like naltrexone and nalmefene may be due to slow dissociation from MORs consequent to their very high MOR affinity (<1.0 nM). Naltrexone blocks the effects of MOR agonists like morphine, heroin, and hydromorphone in humans via its MOR antagonism. Following a single 100 mg dose of naltrexone, the subjective and objective effects of heroin were blocked by 90% at 24 hours, with blockade then decreasing up to 72 hours. Similarly, 20 to 200 mg naltrexone dose-dependently antagonized the effects of heroin for up to 72 hours. Naltrexone also blocks the effects of KOR agonists like salvinorin A, pentazocine, and butorphanol in humans via its KOR antagonism. In addition to opioids, naltrexone has been found to block or reduce the rewarding and other effects of other euphoriant drugs including alcohol, nicotine, and amphetamines. The opioid receptors are involved in neuroendocrine regulation. MOR agonists produce increases in levels of prolactin and decreases in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone. Doses of naltrexone of 25 to 150 mg/day have been found to produce significant increases in levels of β-endorphin, cortisol, and LH, equivocal changes in levels of prolactin and testosterone, and no significant changes in levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Naltrexone influences the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) probably through interference with opioid receptor signaling by endorphins. Blockade of MORs is thought to be the mechanism of action of naltrexone in the management of opioid dependence—it reversibly blocks or attenuates the effects of opioids. It is also thought to be involved in the effectiveness of naltrexone in alcohol dependence by reducing the euphoric effects of alcohol. The role of KOR modulation by naltrexone in its effectiveness for alcohol dependence is unclear but this action may also be involved based on theory and animal studies. ==== Other activities ==== In addition to the opioid receptors, naltrexone binds to and acts as an antagonist of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interacts with high- and low-affinity binding sites in filamin A (FLNA). It is said that very low doses of naltrexone (<0.001–1 mg/day) interact with FLNA, low doses (1 to 5 mg/day) produce TLR4 antagonism, and standard clinical doses (50 to 100 mg/day) exert opioid receptor and OGFR antagonism. The interactions of naltrexone with FLNA and TLR4 are claimed to be involved in the therapeutic effects of low-dose naltrexone. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absorption of naltrexone with oral administration is rapid and nearly complete (96%). The bioavailability of naltrexone with oral administration is 5 to 60% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Peak concentrations of naltrexone are 19 to 44 μg/L after a single 100 mg oral dose and time to peak concentrations of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol (metabolite) is within 1 hour. Linear increases in circulating naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol concentrations occur over an oral dose range of 50 to 200 mg. Naltrexone does not appear to be accumulated with repeated once-daily oral administration and there is no change in time to peak concentrations with repeated administration. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of naltrexone is about 20% over a naltrexone concentration range of 0.1 to 500 μg/L. Its apparent volume of distribution at 100 mg orally is 16.1 L/kg after a single dose and 14.2 L/kg with repeated doses. ==== Metabolism ==== Naltrexone is metabolized in the liver mainly by dihydrodiol dehydrogenases into 6β-naltrexol (6β-hydroxynaltrexone). Levels of 6β-naltrexol are 10- to 30-fold higher than those of naltrexone with oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Conversely, 6β-naltrexol exposure is only about 2-fold higher than that of naltrexone with intramuscular injection of naltrexone in microspheres (brand name Vivitrol). 6β-Naltrexol is an opioid receptor antagonist similarly to naltrexone and shows a comparable binding profile to the opioid receptors. However, 6β-naltrexol is peripherally selective and crosses into the brain much less readily than does naltrexone. In any case, 6β-naltrexol does still show some central activity and may contribute significantly to the central actions of oral naltrexone. Other metabolites of naltrexone include 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6β-naltrexol and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxynaltrexone. Following their formation, the metabolites of naltrexone are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to form glucuronides. Naltrexone is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has low potential for drug interactions. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination of naltrexone is biexponential and rapid over the first 24 hours followed by a third extremely slow decline after 24 hours. The fast elimination half-lives of naltrexone and its metabolite 6β-naltrexol are about 4 hours and 13 hours, respectively. In Contrave oral tablets, which also contain bupropion and are described as extended-release, the half-life of naltrexone is 5 hours. The slow terminal-phase elimination half-life of naltrexone is approximately 96 hours. As microspheres of naltrexone by intramuscular injection (Vivitrol), the elimination half-lives of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol are both 5 to 10 days. Whereas oral naltrexone is administered daily, naltrexone in microspheres by intramuscular injection is suitable for administration once every 4 weeks or once per month. Naltrexone and its metabolites are excreted in urine. === Pharmacogenetics === Tentative evidence suggests that family history and presence of the Asn40Asp polymorphism predict naltrexone being effective. == Chemistry == Naltrexone, also known as N-cyclopropylmethylnoroxymorphone, is a derivative of oxymorphone (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone). It is specifically the derivative of oxymorphone in which the tertiary amine methyl substituent is replaced with methylcyclopropane. === Analogues === The closely related medication, methylnaltrexone (N-methylnaltrexone), is used to treat opioid-induced constipation but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Nalmefene (6-desoxy-6-methylenenaltrexone) is similar to naltrexone and is used for the same purposes as naltrexone. Naltrexone should not be confused with naloxone (N-allylnoroxymorphone), which is used in emergency cases of opioid overdose. Other opioid antagonists related to naltrexone include 6β-naltrexol (6β-hydroxynaltrexone), samidorphan (3-carboxamido-4-hydroxynaltrexone), β-funaltrexamine (naltrexone fumarate methyl ester), nalodeine (N-allylnorcodeine), nalorphine (N-allylnormorphine), and nalbuphine (N-cyclobutylmethyl-14-hydroxydihydronormorphine). == History == Naltrexone was first synthesized in 1963 by Metossian at Endo Laboratories, a small pharmaceutical company in New York City. It was characterized by Blumberg, Dayton, and Wolf in 1965 and was found to be an orally active, long-acting, and very potent opioid antagonist. The drug showed advantages over earlier opioid antagonists such as cyclazocine, nalorphine, and naloxone, including its oral activity, a long duration of action allowing for once-daily administration, and a lack of dysphoria, and was selected for further development. It was patented by Endo Laboratories in 1967 under the developmental code name EN-1639A and Endo Laboratories was acquired by DuPont in 1969. Clinical trials for opioid dependence began in 1973, and a developmental collaboration of DuPont with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for this indication started the next year in 1974. The drug was approved by the FDA for the oral treatment of opioid dependence in 1984, with the brand name Trexan, and for the oral treatment of alcohol dependence in 1995, when the brand name was changed by DuPont to Revia. A depot formulation for intramuscular injection was approved by the FDA under the brand name Vivitrol for alcohol dependence in 2006 and opioid dependence in 2010. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Naltrexone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, while naltrexone hydrochloride is its USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia and BANMTooltip British Approved Name. === Brand names === Naltrexone is or has been sold under a variety of brand names, including Adepend, Antaxone, Celupan, Depade, Destoxican, Nalorex, Narcoral, Nemexin, Nodict, Revia, Trexan, Vivitrex, and Vivitrol. It is also marketed in combination with bupropion (naltrexone/bupropion) as Contrave, and was marketed with morphine (morphine/naltrexone) as Embeda. A combination of naltrexone with buprenorphine (buprenorphine/naltrexone) has been developed, but has not been marketed. === Controversies === The FDA authorized use of injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol) for opioid addiction using a single study that was led by Evgeny Krupitsky at Bekhterev Research Psychoneurological Institute, St Petersburg State Pavlov Medical University, St Petersburg, Russia, a country where opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine are not available. The study was a ""double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized"", 24-week trial running ""from July 3, 2008, through October 5, 2009"" with ""250 patients with opioid dependence disorder"" at ""13 clinical sites in Russia"" on the use of injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence. The study was funded by the Boston-based biotech Alkermes firm which produces and markets naltrexone in the United States. Critics charged that the study violated ethical guidelines since it compared the formulation of naltrexone not to the best available, evidence-based treatment (methadone or buprenorphine), but to a placebo. Further, the trial did not follow patients who dropped out of the trial to evaluate subsequent risk of fatal overdose, a major health concern . Subsequent trials in Norway and the US did compare injectable naltrexone to buprenorphine and found them to be similar in outcomes for patients willing to undergo the withdrawal symptoms required before naltrexone administration. Nearly 30% of patients in the US trial did not complete induction. In real-world settings, a review of more than 40,000 patient records found that while methadone and buprenorphine reduced risk of fatal overdose, naltrexone administration showed no greater effect on overdose or subsequent emergency care than counseling alone. Despite these findings, naltrexone's manufacturer and some health authorities have promoted the medicine as superior to methadone and buprenorphine since it is not an opioid and does not induce dependence. The manufacturer has also marketed directly to law enforcement and criminal justice officials, spending millions of dollars on lobbying and providing thousands of free doses to jails and prisons. The technique has been successful, with the criminal justice system in 43 states now incorporating long-acting naltrexone. Many do this through Vivitrol courts that offer only this option, leading some to characterize this as ""an offer that cannot be refused."" The company's marketing techniques have led to a Congressional investigation, and warning from the FDA about failure to adequately state risks of fatal overdose to patients receiving the medicine. In May 2017, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price praised [Vivitrol] as the future of opioid addiction treatment after visiting the company's plant in Ohio. His remarks set off sharp criticism with almost 700 experts in the field of substance use submitting a letter to Price cautioning him about Vivitrol's ""marketing tactics"" and warning him that his comments ""ignore widely accepted science"". The experts pointed out that Vivitrol's competitors, buprenorphine and methadone, are ""less expensive"", ""more widely used"", and have been ""rigorously studied"". Price had claimed that buprenorphine and methadone were ""simply substitute[s]"" for ""illicit drugs"" whereas according to the letter, ""the substantial body of research evidence supporting these treatments is summarized in guidance from within your own agency, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Buprenorphine and methadone have been demonstrated to be highly effective in managing the core symptoms of opioid use disorder, reducing the risk of relapse and fatal overdose, and encouraging long-term recovery."" === Film === One Little Pill was a 2014 documentary film about the use of naltrexone to treat alcohol use disorder. Four Good Days is a 2020 film about the four days a drug addict woman has to stay sober to get a shot of naltrexone in a detox facility. == Research == === Depersonalization === Naltrexone is sometimes used in the treatment of dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization and derealization. Some studies suggest it might help. Other small, preliminary studies have also shown benefit. Blockade of the KOR by naltrexone and naloxone is thought to be responsible for their effectiveness in ameliorating depersonalization and derealization. Since these drugs are less efficacious in blocking the KOR relative to the MOR, higher doses than typically used seem to be necessary. === Low-dose naltrexone === Naltrexone has been used off-label at low doses for diseases not related to chemical dependency or intoxication, such as multiple sclerosis. Evidence for recommending low-dose naltrexone is lacking. This treatment has received attention on the Internet. In 2022, four studies (in a few hundred patients) were conducted on naltrexone for long COVID. === Self-injury === One study suggests that self-injurious behaviors present in persons with developmental disabilities (including autism) can sometimes be remedied with naltrexone. In these cases, the self-injury is believed to be done to release beta-endorphin, which binds to the same receptors as heroin and morphine. If the ""rush"" generated by self-injury is removed, the behavior may stop. === Behavioral disorders === Some indications exist that naltrexone might be beneficial in the treatment of impulse-control disorders such as kleptomania, compulsive gambling, or trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling), but evidence of its effectiveness for gambling is conflicting. A 2008 case study reported successful use of naltrexone in suppressing and treating an internet pornography addiction. === Interferon alpha === Naltrexone is effective in suppressing the cytokine-mediated adverse neuropsychiatric effects of interferon alpha therapy. === Critical addiction studies === Some historians and sociologists have suggested that the meanings and uses attributed to anti-craving medicine, such as naltrexone, are context-dependent. Studies have suggested the use of naltrexone in drug courts or healthcare rehabs is a form of ""post-social control,"" or ""post-disciplinary control,"" whereby control strategies for managing offenders and addicts shift from imprisonment and supervision toward more direct control over biological processes. === Sexual addiction === Small studies have shown a reduction of sexual addiction and problematic sexual behaviours from naltrexone. == References ==",Vivitrol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012361239350866526), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00409122696146369)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/vivitrol.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=77, start_index=9, title='Vivitrol Injection: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/vivitrol.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4078,"('Uracil 1-beta-d-arabinofuranoside', 'Spongouridin', 'Arabinosyluracil', 'Uracil arabinoside', 'Uracil, 1-.beta.-d-ribofuranosyl-')","Endogenous, Medical"," A number of antiherpesviral 5-substituted derivatives of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (araU) were significantly resistant to phosphorolysis by rat liver extract (S-9), but were gradually deglycosylated in a 2% enterobacteria cell suspension. The relative order of the resistance conferred by the different C-5 substituents was: 5-propynyl > 5-(E)-2-bromovinyl > 5-(E)-2-chlorovinyl > 5-methyl > 5-iodo. The 2'-fluoro derivatives of araU were completely resistant to phosphorolysis by both liver extract and enterobacteria, whereas the corresponding ribofuranosyl and 2'-deoxyribofuranosyl nucleosides were easily phosphorolysed by S-9, and were immediately cleaved in a 1% enterobacteria cell suspension. These findings suggest that antiherpesviral 5-substituted araU analogues can be relatively stable in vivo, when injected intravenously, and that degradation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-(E-2-bromovinyl)uracil (sorivudine) following oral administration is due primarily to the action of enterobacteria. Results are described which demonstrate that the cytotoxic action of 2',5-difluoro-1-arabinosyluracil (FFara-Ura) involves conversion to the corresponding 5'-phosphate, FFara-UMP, and subsequent inhibition of thymidylate synthetase. The evidence for this is as follows: (a) cells lacking thymidine kinase are 120-fold more resistant to FFara-Ura; (b) FFara-Ura markedly inhibits the incorporation of 2'-deoxyuridine (dUrd) into DNA with little or no effect on 2'-deoxythymidine (dThd) incorporation; (c) FFara-Ura causes changes in deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool sizes, which are characteristic of specific inhibition of dTMP synthetase. Binding and spectroscopic studies demonstrate that FFara-UMP inactivates dTMP synthetase from Lactobacillus casei in a manner analogous to that described for FdUMP. Furthermore, FFara-Ura is not a substrate for the pyrimidine phosphorylases; the significance of this finding with regard to the possible chemotherapeutic utility of FFara-Ura is discussed. Arabinosylcytosine (ara-C) is the most effective nucleoside analogue for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. The cytotoxicity of ara-C depends on its conversion to the triphosphate ara-CTP. In plasma, a major metabolite of ara-C is its deamination product, arabinosyluracil (ara-U). Both ara-U and ara-U monophosphate have been detected in primary leukemia cells during in vitro investigations. Because other ara-U metabolites, especially the triphosphate (ara-UTP), may serve as additional effectors of cytotoxicity, the present study investigated whether ara-UTP accumulates in circulating leukemia blasts during ara-C therapy. Patients with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia received 2- or 4-h infusions of 0.5 g/m2/h ara-C. Intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP and ara-UTP in circulating leukemia blasts from six patients was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography, revealing that ara-UTP accumulated during ara-C therapy. The intracellular concentration of ara-UTP ranged from 6-50 microM and was between 2 and 10% of the accumulated ara-CTP. In circulating blasts, ara-UTP was maintained for several hours after the end of ara-C infusion. Leukemia blasts from patients (n=27) were incubated for 1-2 h with 1, 10, or 25 microM [3H]ara-C, and radiolabeled metabolites of ara-C were separated and quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Consistent with data obtained during ara-C therapy, [3H]ara-UTP also accumulated in blasts from all these patients during in vitro incubations with [3H]ara-C. The concentration of ara-UTP after 1 h of incubation ranged from 0.2-40 microM. Incubation of cells with the cytidine deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrouridine did not perturb ara-UTP accumulation, whereas incubation with the deoxycytidylate deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrodeoxyuridine suppressed ara-UTP formation from ara-C. These observations suggested that ara-UTP is generated through deamination of ara-C monophosphate to ara-U monophosphate by deoxycytidylate deaminase, followed by its phosphorylation to ara-UTP. Consistent with these results, incubation of blasts with up to 100 microM [3H]ara-U did not result in ara-UTP accumulation, indicating that ara-U is not phosphorylated directly in these cells.

This study aims to systematically review related studies on the dietary sources, metabolism, and pharmacological effects of ALA. Information on ALA was collected from the internet database PubMed, Elsevier, ResearchGate, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, and Europe PMC using a combination of keywords including ""pharmacology,"" ""metabolism,"" ""sources."" The following findings are mainly contained. (a) ALA can only be ingested from food and then converted into eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in the body. (b) This conversion process is relatively limited and affected by many factors such as dose, gender, and disease. (c) Pharmacological research shows that ALA has the anti-metabolic syndrome, anticancer, antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-obesity, neuroprotection, and regulation of the intestinal flora properties. (d) There are the most studies that prove ALA has anti-metabolic syndrome effects, including experimental studies and clinical trials. (e) The therapeutic effect of ALA will be affected by the dosage. In short, ALA is expected to treat many diseases, but further high quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of ALA. Birth presents a metabolic challenge to cardiomyocytes as they reshape fuel preference from glucose to fatty acids for postnatal energy production Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6) is an omega-6 (n-6), 18 carbon (18C-) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in human milk and several botanical seed oils and is typically consumed as part of a dietary supplement. While there have been numerous in vitro and in vivo animal models which illustrate that GLA-supplemented diets attenuate inflammatory responses, clinical studies utilizing GLA or GLA in combination with omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs have been much less conclusive. A central premise of this review is that there are critical metabolic and genetic factors that affect the conversion of GLA to dihommo-gamma linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6), which consequently affects the balance of DGLA- and AA- derived metabolites. As a result, these factors impact the clinical effectiveness of GLA or GLA/(n-3) PUFA supplementations in treating inflammatory conditions. Specifically, these factors include: 1) the capacity for different human cells and tissues to convert GLA to DGLA and AA and to metabolize DGLA and AA to bioactive metabolites; 2) the opposing effects of DGLA and AA metabolites on inflammatory processes and diseases; and 3) the impact of genetic variations within the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster, in particular, on AA/DGLA ratios and bioactive metabolites. We postulate that these factors influence the heterogeneity of results observed in GLA supplement-based clinical trials and suggest that ""one-size fits all"" approaches utilizing PUFA-based supplements may no longer be appropriate for the prevention and treatment of complex human diseases.",Linolenic acid-[13c18],PUBMED,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.014194305054843426), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.02817765437066555), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.004136221949011087), ('ĠEND', -0.4761590361595154), ('OG', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.048621393740177155), ('ĠMED', -0.0019124329555779696), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01822078227996826)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00033546582562848926)])","('INFO; ([isotope.com](https://isotope.com/fatty-acids-lipids/linolenic-acid-18-3-u-13c18-clm-8386-1?utm_source=openai), [scbt.com](https://www.scbt.com/p/linolenic-acid-13c18-287111-28-8?utm_source=openai), [pharmaffiliates.com](https://www.pharmaffiliates.com/en/287111-28-8-linolenic-acid-13c18-pasti056700.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='Linolenic acid (18:3) (U-¹³C₁₈, 98%) CP 95% - Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CLM-8386-1', type='url_citation', url='https://isotope.com/fatty-acids-lipids/linolenic-acid-18-3-u-13c18-clm-8386-1?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='Linolenic Acid-13C18 | CAS 287111-28-8 | SCBT - Santa Cruz Biotechnology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.scbt.com/p/linolenic-acid-13c18-287111-28-8?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='CAS No : 287111-28-8| Chemical Name : Linolenic Acid-13C18 | Pharmaffiliates', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmaffiliates.com/en/287111-28-8-linolenic-acid-13c18-pasti056700.html?utm_source=openai')])"

4082,"('Methylphenidate', 'Methylphenidan', 'Phenidylate', 'Concerta', 'Calocain')",Medical,"Methylphenidate, sold under the brand names Ritalin ( RIT-ə-lin) and Concerta ( kən-SUR-tə) among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It may be taken by mouth or applied to the skin, and different formulations have varying durations of effect. For ADHD, the effectiveness of methylphenidate is comparable to atomoxetine but modestly lower than amphetamines, alleviating the executive functioning deficits of sustained attention, inhibition, working memory, reaction time and emotional self-regulation. Common adverse reactions of methylphenidate include euphoria, dilated pupils, tachycardia, palpitations, headache, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, weight loss, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, and abdominal pain. Withdrawal symptoms may include chills, depression, drowsiness, dysphoria, exhaustion, headache, irritability, lethargy, nightmares, restlessness, suicidal thoughts, and weakness. Methylphenidate is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine by neurons. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine and piperidine classes. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 32nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. == Uses == Methylphenidate is most commonly used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Methylphenidate is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The dosage may vary and is titrated to effect, with some guidelines recommending initial treatment with a low dose. Methylphenidate is available in both immediate-release and modified-release formulations. Methylphenidate is not approved for children under six years of age. The International Consensus Statement on ADHD shows that the results from systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large scale studies are clear: methylphenidate is safe and among the most efficacious drugs in all of medicine; treatment in the long-term substantially reduces accidental injuries, traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, educational underachievement, bone fractures, sexually transmitted infections, depression, suicide, criminal activity, teenage pregnancy, vehicle crashes, burn injuries and overall-cause mortality, and eliminates the increased risk for obesity. One committee from the World Health Organization (WHO) responsible for the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List rejected an application in 2019, and a second application endorsed by 51 professional medical groups in 2021, for methylphenidate's inclusion due to uncertainty about its efficacy and safety. However, in November 2023, the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Guidelines for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders recommended that methylphenidate should be considered for children aged 6 years and older who have ADHD, noting specifically that, ""methylphenidate treatment shows substantial effects on symptom reduction"", in addition to other WHO publications. In 2024, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) and the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) endorsed the inclusion of methylphenidate in the WHO EML. A new application for methylphenidate's inclusion is currently pending review, having sparked debate in the comment process among researchers engaged in the evaluation of the evidence-base. Safety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency), the developers of evidence-based national guidelines (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics), and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines (e.g., the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council). These professional groups unanimously conclude, based on the scientific evidence, that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first-line treatment for ADHD. Since ADHD diagnosis has increased around the world, methylphenidate may be misused as a ""study drug"" by some populations, which may be harmful. This also applies to people who may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. People in this category are prone to experience the negative side-effects of the drug, which can worsen their condition. Long-term meta-analyses and systematic reviews show that the medications used to treat ADHD are not associated with observed deficits in brain structure, but with improved brain development and functioning, most prominently in inferior frontal and striatal regions. The most comprehensive meta-analysis available (19 studies with over 3.9 million participants) found ""no statistically significant association between ADHD medications [including methylphenidate] and the risk of cardiovascular event among children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, or older adults""; as do other systematic reviews and meta-analyses. === Narcolepsy === Narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and uncontrollable sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. Methylphenidate is considered effective in increasing wakefulness, vigilance, and performance. Methylphenidate improves measures of somnolence on standardized tests, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy people. === Other medical uses === Methylphenidate may also be prescribed for off-label use in treatment-resistant cases of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. It can also improve depression in several groups, including stroke, cancer, and HIV-positive patients. There is weak evidence in favor of methylphenidate's effectiveness for depression, including providing additional benefit in combination with antidepressants. In individuals with terminal cancer, methylphenidate can be used to counteract opioid-induced somnolence, to increase the analgesic effects of opioids, to treat depression, and to improve cognitive function. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that all studies on geriatric depression reported positive results of methylphenidate use; the review recommended short-term use in combination with citalopram. A 2018 review found low-quality evidence supporting its use to treat apathy as seen in Alzheimer's disease, in addition to slight benefits for cognition and cognitive performance. === Enhancing performance === Methylphenidate's efficacy as an athletic performance enhancer, cognitive enhancer, aphrodisiac, and euphoriant is supported by research. However, the manner in which methylphenidate is used for these purposes (high dosages, alternate routes of administration, during sleep deprivation, etc.) can result in severe unintended side effects. A 2015 review found that therapeutic doses of amphetamine and methylphenidate result in modest improvements in cognition, including working memory, episodic memory, and inhibitory control, in normal healthy adults; the cognition-enhancing effects of these drugs are known to occur through the indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor α2 in the prefrontal cortex. Methylphenidate and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency and increase arousal. Stimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks, and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid. Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, performance-enhancing use rather than use as a recreational drug, is the primary reason that students use stimulants. Excessive doses of methylphenidate, above the therapeutic range, can interfere with working memory and cognitive control. Like amphetamine and bupropion, methylphenidate increases stamina and endurance in humans primarily through reuptake inhibition of dopamine in the central nervous system. Similar to the loss of cognitive enhancement when using large amounts, large doses of methylphenidate can induce side effects that impair athletic performance, such as rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia. While literature suggests it might improve cognition, most authors agree that using the drug as a study aid when an ADHD diagnosis is not present does not actually improve GPA. Moreover, it has been suggested that students who use the drug for studying may be self-medicating for potentially deeper underlying issues. == Contraindications == Methylphenidate is contraindicated for individuals with agitation, tics, glaucoma, heart defects or a hypersensitivity to any ingredients contained in methylphenidate pharmaceuticals. Pregnant women are advised to only use the medication if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Not enough human studies have been conducted to conclusively demonstrate an effect of methylphenidate on fetal development. In 2018, a review concluded that it has not been teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and that it ""is not a major human teratogen"". == Adverse effects == The most common side effects associated with methylphenidate (in standard and extended-release formulations) are appetite loss, dry mouth, anxiety/nervousness, nausea, and insomnia. Gastrointestinal adverse effects may include abdominal pain and weight loss. Nervous system adverse effects may include akathisia (agitation/restlessness), irritability, dyskinesia (tics), lethargy (drowsiness/fatigue), and dizziness. Cardiac adverse effects may include palpitations, changes in blood pressure, and heart rate (typically mild), and tachycardia (rapid heart rate). Ophthalmologic adverse effects may include blurred vision caused by pupil dilatation and dry eyes, with less frequent reports of diplopia and mydriasis. In some cases, tolerance might be an issue with stimulants like methylphenidate. Results from a 2024 systematic review showed that methylphenidate significantly improves ADHD symptoms and broadband measures but can cause appetite suppression and other adverse events in children and adolescents. Smokers with ADHD who take methylphenidate may increase their nicotine dependence, and smoke more often than before they began using methylphenidate, with increased nicotine cravings and an average increase of 1.3 cigarettes per day. There is some evidence of mild reductions in height with prolonged treatment in children. This has been estimated at 1 centimetre (0.4 in) or less per year during the first three years with a total decrease of 3 centimetres (1.2 in) over 10 years. Hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, and fever) is sometimes reported when using transdermal methylphenidate. The Daytrana patch has a much higher rate of skin reactions than oral methylphenidate. Methylphenidate can worsen psychosis in people who are psychotic, and in very rare cases it has been associated with the emergence of new psychotic symptoms. It should be used with extreme caution in people with bipolar disorder due to the potential induction of mania or hypomania. There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation, but some authors claim that evidence does not support a link. Logorrhea is occasionally reported and visual hallucinations are very rarely reported. Priapism is a very rare adverse event that can be potentially serious. U.S. Food and Drug Administration-commissioned studies in 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults, there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of methylphenidate or other ADHD stimulants. Because some adverse effects may only emerge during chronic use of methylphenidate, a constant watch for adverse effects is recommended. A 2018 Cochrane review found that methylphenidate might be associated with serious side effects such as heart problems, psychosis, and death. The certainty of the evidence was stated as very low. The same review found tentative evidence that it may cause both serious and non-serious adverse effects in children. === Overdose === The symptoms of a moderate acute overdose of methylphenidate primarily arise from central nervous system overstimulation; these symptoms include: vomiting, nausea, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, hyperthermia, sweating, flushing, headache, tachycardia, heart palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, mydriasis, and dryness of mucous membranes. A severe overdose may involve symptoms such as hyperpyrexia, sympathomimetic toxidrome, convulsions, paranoia, stereotypy (a repetitive movement disorder), rhabdomyolysis, coma, and circulatory collapse. A methylphenidate overdose is rarely fatal with appropriate care. Following injection of methylphenidate tablets into an artery, severe toxic reactions involving abscess formation and necrosis have been reported. Treatment of a methylphenidate overdose typically involves the administration of benzodiazepines, with antipsychotics, α-adrenoceptor agonists and propofol serving as second-line therapies. === Addiction and dependence === Methylphenidate is a stimulant with an addiction liability and dependence liability similar to amphetamine. It has moderate liability among addictive drugs; accordingly, addiction and psychological dependence are possible and likely when methylphenidate is used as a recreational drug. When used above the medical dose range, stimulants are associated with the development of stimulant psychosis. ==== Biomolecular mechanisms ==== Methylphenidate has the potential to induce euphoria due to its pharmacodynamic effect (i.e., dopamine reuptake inhibition) in the brain's reward system. At therapeutic doses, ADHD stimulants do not sufficiently activate the reward system; consequently, when taken as directed in doses that are commonly prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, methylphenidate use lacks the capacity to cause an addiction. == Interactions == Methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of vitamin K anticoagulants, certain anticonvulsants, and some antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Concomitant administration may require dose adjustments, possibly assisted by monitoring of plasma drug concentrations. There are several case reports of methylphenidate inducing serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of antidepressants. When methylphenidate is coingested with ethanol, a metabolite called ethylphenidate is formed via hepatic transesterification, not unlike the hepatic formation of cocaethylene from cocaine and ethanol. The reduced potency of ethylphenidate and its minor formation means it does not contribute to the pharmacological profile at therapeutic doses, and even in overdose cases, ethylphenidate concentrations remain negligible. Coingestion of alcohol also increases the blood plasma levels of d-methylphenidate by up to 40%. Liver toxicity from methylphenidate is extremely rare, but limited evidence suggests that intake of β-adrenergic agonists with methylphenidate may increase the risk of liver toxicity. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Methylphenidate acts primarily as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is a benzylpiperidine and phenethylamine derivative which also shares part of its basic structure with catecholamines. Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant and increases the activity of the central nervous system through inhibition on reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. As models of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest, it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and locus coeruleus. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. When reuptake of those neurotransmitters is halted, its concentration and effects in the synapse increase and last longer, respectively. Therefore, methylphenidate is called a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor. By increasing the effects of norepinephrine and dopamine, methylphenidate increases the activity of the central nervous system and produces effects such as increased alertness, reduced fatigue, and improved attention. Methylphenidate is most active at modulating levels of dopamine (DA) and to a lesser extent norepinephrine (NE). Methylphenidate binds to and blocks dopamine transporters (DAT) and norepinephrine transporters (NET). Variability exists between DAT blockade, and extracellular dopamine, leading to the hypothesis that methylphenidate amplifies basal dopamine activity, leading to nonresponse in those with low basal DA activity. In animals and brain tissue, methylphenidate has been shown to dose-dependently increase brain dopamine levels. On average, methylphenidate elicits a 3 to 4 times increase in dopamine and norepinephrine in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with ADHD stimulants (specifically, amphetamine and methylphenidate) decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD. Both amphetamine and methylphenidate are predominantly dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. Methylphenidate acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase neuronal firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate, but causes monoamine release by reversing the flow of the monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms. The difference in mechanism of action between methylphenidate and amphetamine results in methylphenidate inhibiting amphetamine's effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered. Methylphenidate has both dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter binding affinity, with the dextromethylphenidate enantiomers displaying a prominent affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. Both the dextrorotary and levorotary enantiomers displayed receptor affinity for the serotonergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B subtypes, though direct binding to the serotonin transporter was not observed. A later study confirmed the d-threo-methylphenidate (dexmethylphenidate) binding to the 5-HT1A receptor, but no significant activity on the 5-HT2B receptor was found. There exist some paradoxical findings that oppose the notion that methylphenidate acts as silent antagonist of the DAT (DAT inhibitor). DAT occupancy of 80% is necessary for methylphenidate's euphoriant effect, but re-administration of methylphenidate beyond this level of DAT occupancy has been found to produce similarly potent euphoriant effects (despite DAT occupancy being unchanged with repeated administration). By contrast, other DAT inhibitors such as bupropion have not been observed to exhibit this effect. These observations, among others, have prompted the hypothesis that methylphenidate may actually act as a ""DAT inverse agonist"" or ""negative allosteric modifier of the DAT"" by reversing the direction of the dopamine flux by the DAT at higher dosages rather than by acting as a simple competitive transporter blocker. Methylphenidate may protect neurons from the neurotoxic effects of Parkinson's disease and methamphetamine use disorder. The hypothesized mechanism of neuroprotection is through inhibition of methamphetamine–DAT interactions, and through reducing cytosolic dopamine, leading to decreased production of dopamine-related reactive oxygen species. The dextrorotary enantiomers are significantly more potent than the levorotary enantiomers, and some medications therefore only contain dexmethylphenidate. The studied maximized daily dosage of OROS methylphenidate appears to be 144 mg/day. === Pharmacokinetics === Methylphenidate taken by mouth has a bioavailability of 11–52% with a duration of action around 2–4 hours for immediate-release (IR) (i.e., Ritalin), 3–8 hours for sustained-release (i.e., Ritalin LA), and 8–12 hours for extended-release (ER) (i.e., Concerta). The half-life of methylphenidate is 2–3 hours, depending on the individual. The peak plasma time is achieved at about 2 hours. Methylphenidate has a low plasma protein binding of 10–33% and a volume of distribution of 2.65 L/kg. d-Methylphenidate is much more bioavailable than l-methylphenidate when administered orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of racemic methylphenidate. The oral bioavailability and speed of absorption for immediate-release methylphenidate is increased when administered with a meal. The effects of a high fat meal on the observed Cmax differ between some extended-release formulations, with combined IR/ER and OROS formulations showing reduced Cmax levels while liquid-based extended-release formulations showed increased Cmax levels when administered with a high-fat meal, according to some researchers. A 2003 study, however, showed no difference between a high-fat meal administration and a fasting administration of oral methylphenidate. Methylphenidate is metabolized into ritalinic acid by CES1A1 enzymes in the liver. Dextromethylphenidate is selectively metabolized at a slower rate than levomethylphenidate. 97% of the metabolised drug is excreted in the urine, and between 1 and 3% is excreted in the faeces. A small amount, less than 1%, of the drug is excreted in the urine in its unchanged form. == Chemistry == Despite the claim made by some urban legends, it is not a cocaine derivative nor analog, however, both compounds contain a methyl piperidinylcarboxylate moiety with 2-carbon distance between nitrogen and methanoate, methylphenidate containing methyl (piperidin-2-yl)-ethanoate and cocaine containing methyl (piperidin-3-yl)-methanoate. Cocaine is a local anesthetic and ligand channel blocker with SNDRI action, while methylphenidate is an NDRI with 2–3 fold selectivity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) over the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Cocaine is also more potent in serotonin transporters (SERTs) than NDRI sites. Four isomers of methylphenidate are possible, since the molecule has two chiral centers. One pair of threo isomers and one pair of erythro are distinguished, from which primarily d-threo-methylphenidate exhibits the pharmacologically desired effects. The erythro diastereomers are pressor amines, a property not shared with the threo diastereomers. When the drug was first introduced it was sold as a 4:1 mixture of erythro:threo diastereomers, but it was later reformulated to contain only the threo diastereomers. ""TMP"" refers to a threo product that does not contain any erythro diastereomers, i.e. (±)-threo-methylphenidate. Since the threo isomers are energetically favored, it is easy to epimerize out any of the undesired erythro isomers. The drug that contains only dextrorotatory methylphenidate is sometimes called d-TMP, although this name is only rarely used and it is much more commonly referred to as dexmethylphenidate, d-MPH, or d-threo-methylphenidate. A review on the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (2R,2'R)-(+)-threo-methylphenidate hydrochloride has been published. === Detection in biological fluids === The concentration of methylphenidate or ritalinic acid, its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis of potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. == History == Methylphenidate was first synthesized in 1944 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It was synthesized by chemist Leandro Panizzon and sold by Swiss company CIBA (now Novartis). He named the drug after his wife Marguerite, nicknamed Rita, who used Ritalin to compensate for low blood pressure. Methylphenidate was not reported to be a stimulant until 1954. The drug was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1957. Originally, it was marketed as a mixture of two racemates, 80% (±)-erythro and 20% (±)-threo, under the brand name Centedrin. Subsequent studies of the racemates showed that the central stimulant activity is associated with the threo racemate and were focused on the separation and interconversion of the erythro isomer into the more active threo isomer. The erythro isomer was eliminated, and now modern formulations of methyphenidate contain only the threo isomer in a 50:50 mixture of d- and l-isomers. Methylphenidate was first used to allay barbiturate-induced coma, narcolepsy and depression. It was later used to treat memory deficits in the elderly. Beginning in the 1960s, it was used to treat children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on earlier work, starting with the studies by American psychiatrist Charles Bradley on the use of psychostimulant drugs, such as Benzedrine, with then-called ""maladjusted children"". Production and prescription of methylphenidate rose significantly in the 1990s, especially in the United States, as the ADHD diagnosis came to be better understood and more generally accepted within the medical and mental health communities. In 2000, Alza Corporation received FDA approval to market Concerta, a modified-release form of methylphenidate that uses the osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system. It was estimated that the number of doses of methylphenidate used globally in 2013 increased by 66% compared to 2012. In 2022, it was the 32nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Society and culture == === Names === Methylphenidate is sold in the majority of countries worldwide.: 8–9 Brand names for methylphenidate include Ritalin (in honor of Rita, the wife of the molecule discoverer Leandro Panizzon), Rilatine (in Belgium to avoid a conflict of commercial name with the RIT pharmaceutical company), Concerta, Medikinet, Adaphen, Addwize, Inspiral, Methmild, Artige, Attenta, Cognil, Konsenidat, Equasym, Foquest, Methylin, Penid, Phenida, Prohiper, and Tradea.: 8–9 === Available forms === The dextrorotary enantiomer of methylphenidate, known as dexmethylphenidate, is sold as a generic and under the brand names Focalin and Attenade in both an immediate-release and an extended-release form. There is some evidence that dexmethylphenidate has better bioavailability and a longer duration of action than methylphenidate. ==== Immediate-release ==== In the Ritalin tablets series (Ritalin, Ritalin LA, Ritalin SR), the volume of distribution was 2.65±1.11 L/kg for d-methylphenidate and 1.80±0.91 L/kg for l-methylphenidate subsequent to swallowing. Following administration of Concerta, plasma concentrations of the l-isomer were approximately ⁠1/40⁠ the plasma concentrations of the d-isomer. Methylphenidate was originally available as an immediate-release racemic mixture formulation under the Novartis brand name Ritalin, although a variety of generics are available, some under other brand names. Generic brand names include Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, Penid, Tranquilyn, and Rubifen. ==== Modified-release ==== Modified-release methylphenidate products include: Concerta tablets are marked with the letters ""ALZA"" and followed by: ""18"", ""27"", ""36"", or ""54"", relating to the dosage strength in milligrams. They use osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system. Approximately 22% of the dose is immediate-release, and the remaining 78% of the dose is released over 10–12 hours post-ingestion, with an initial increase over the first 6–7 hours, and subsequent decline in the released drug. Ritalin LA capsules are marked with the letters ""NVR"" (abbrev.: Novartis) and followed by: ""R20"", ""R30"", or ""R40"", depending on the (mg) dosage strength. Ritalin LA provides two standard doses – half the total dose being released immediately and the other half released four hours later. In total, each capsule is effective for about eight hours. Metadate CD capsules contain two types of beads: 30% are immediate-release, and the other 70% are evenly sustained release. Medikinet Retard/CR/Adult/Modified Release tablets are an extended-release oral capsule form of methylphenidate. It delivers 50% of the dosage as IR MPH and the remaining 50% in 3–4 hours. Jornay PM is a delayed release formulation that is taken at bedtime. An outer polymer coating delays the initial release of the drug until 8 hours after administration, after which an inner coating regulates the rate of drug absorption. Peak plasma concentration occurs 14 hours following administration. This formulation was motivated by the need for a pediatric ADHD medication that is active immediately after morning waking, as most long-acting formulations exhibit a delay between administration and absorption that leads to inadequate therapeutic effect in the early morning. ==== Skin patch ==== A methylphenidate skin patch is sold under the brand name Daytrana in the United States. It was developed and marketed by Noven Pharmaceuticals and approved in the US in 2006. It is also referred to as methylphenidate transdermal system (MTS). It is approved as a once-daily treatment in children with ADHD aged 6–17 years. It is mainly prescribed as a second-line treatment when oral forms are not well tolerated, or if people have difficulty with compliance. Noven's original FDA submission indicated that it should be used for 12 hours. When the FDA rejected the submission, they requested evidence that a shorter time period was safe and effective; Noven provided such evidence, and it was approved for a 9-hour period. Orally administered methylphenidate is subject to first-pass metabolism, by which the levo-isomer is extensively metabolized. By circumventing this first-pass metabolism, the relative concentrations of ℓ-threo-methylphenidate are much higher with transdermal administration (50–60% of those of dexmethylphenidate instead of about 14–27%). A 39 nanograms/mL peak serum concentration of methylphenidate has been found to occur between 7.5–10.5 hours after administration. However, the onset to peak effect is 2 hours, and the clinical effects remain up to 2 hours after the patch has been removed. The absorption is increased when the transdermal patch is applied onto inflamed skin or skin that has been exposed to heat. The absorption lasts for approximately 9 hours after application (onto normal, unexposed to heat and uninflamed skin). 90% of the medication is excreted in the urine as metabolites and unchanged drug. ==== Parenteral formulation ==== When it was released in the United States, methylphenidate was available from CIBA in a parenteral form for use by medical professionals. It came in 10mL multiple-dose vials containing 100 mg methylphenidate HCl and 100 mg lactose in lyophilized (freeze-dried) form. It was also available as single-dose ampoules containing 20 mg methylphenidate HCl. Instructions were to reconstitute with 10mL sterile solvent (water). The indication was 10 to 20 mg (1.0mL from MDV's, up to one full single-use ampoule) to produce a focused, talkative state that could help certain patients break down the resistance to therapy. Parenteral methylphenidate was discontinued out of a concern for the actual benefit and of inducing a psychic dependence. This is not truth serum in the normal sense, as it does not impair the ability to control the flow of information like a barbiturate agent (Pentothal) or similar might. === Cost === Brand-name and generic formulations are available. === Legal status === Internationally, methylphenidate is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In December 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a pediatric use marketing authorization for the medicinal product Tuzulby, intended for the treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The applicant for this medicinal product is Neuraxpharm Pharmaceuticals S.L. Tuzulby is a hybrid medicine of Ritalin, which has been authorized in the EU since January 1997. Tuzulby contains the same active substance as Ritalin, but is available in a different formulation and strength, and is given once daily. Methylphenidate was authorized for medical use in the European Union in February 2025. === Controversy === Methylphenidate has been the subject of controversy in relation to its use in the treatment of ADHD. The prescription of psychostimulant medication to children to reduce ADHD symptoms has been a major point of criticism. The contention that methylphenidate acts as a gateway drug has been discredited by multiple sources, according to which abuse is statistically very low and ""stimulant therapy in childhood does not increase the risk for subsequent drug and alcohol abuse disorders later in life"". A study found that ADHD medication was not associated with an increased risk of cigarette use, and in fact, stimulant treatments such as Ritalin seemed to lower this risk. People treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate during childhood were less likely to have substance use disorders in adulthood. Among countries with the highest rates of use of methylphenidate medication is Iceland, where research shows that the drug was the most commonly used substance among people who inject drugs. The study involved 108 people who inject drugs and 88% of them had injected methylphenidate within the last 30 days and for 63% of them, methylphenidate was the most preferred substance. Treatment of ADHD by way of methylphenidate has led to legal actions, including malpractice suits regarding informed consent, inadequate information on side effects, misdiagnosis, and coercive use of medications by school systems. == Etymology == The word methylphenidate is a portmanteau of the chemical name, Methyl-2-phenyl-2-(piperidin-2-yl) acetate. The name ""Ritalin"" derives from Marguerite ""Rita"" Panizzon, the wife of Leandro Panizzon, who first synthesized the drug in 1944. Rita was the first person to take methylphenidate and described its effects to her husband. == Research == === Apathy === Methylphenidate may be effective as a treatment for apathy in Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. It may also be useful in the treatment of more severe disorders of diminished motivation, like abulia and akinetic mutism. === Schizophrenia === Methylphenidate has been shown to reduce rates of hospitalization in patients with schizophrenia, although repeated, elevated doses can provoke psychosis. === Addiction === Methylphenidate has shown some benefits as a replacement therapy for individuals who are addicted to and dependent upon methamphetamine. Methylphenidate and amphetamine have been investigated as a chemical replacement for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Its effectiveness in treatment of cocaine or psychostimulant addiction or psychological dependence has not been proven. === Social anxiety === Methylphenidate has been reported to be effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in people who are comorbid for both this condition and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in small preliminary clinical studies and case reports. == Footnotes == == References == == External links ==",Calocain,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.576114296913147)])","('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.16150040924549103), (',', -0.30068230628967285), ('ĠMED', -0.3393339216709137), ('ICAL', -7.629365427419543e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00154066551476717)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10020732134580612)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4083,"('Alphaxalone', 'Alfaxalone', 'Alfaxalonum [inn-latin]', 'Alfaxalona [inn-spanish]', 'Gr 2/234')",Medical,"Alfaxalone, also known as alphaxalone or alphaxolone and sold under the brand name Alfaxan, is a neuroactive steroid and general anesthetic which is used currently in veterinary practice as an induction agent for anesthesia and as an injectable anesthetic. Though it is more expensive than other induction agents, it often preferred due to the lack of depressive effects on the cardiovascular system. The most common side effect seen in current veterinary practice is respiratory depression when Alfaxan is administered concurrently with other sedative and anesthetic drugs; when premedications are not given, veterinary patients also become agitated and hypersensitive when waking up. Alfaxalone works as a positive allosteric modulator on GABAA receptors and, at high concentrations, as a direct agonist of the GABAA receptor. It is cleared quickly by the liver, giving it a relatively short terminal half-life and preventing it from accumulating in the body, lowering the chance of overdose. == Veterinary use == Alfaxalone is used as an induction agent, an injectable anesthetic, and a sedative in animals. While it is commonly used in cats and dogs, it has also been successfully used in rabbits, horses, sheep, pigs, and exotics such as red-eared turtles, axolotl, green iguanas, marmosets, and koi fish. As an induction agent, alfaxalone causes the animal to relax enough to be intubated, which then allows the administration of inhalational anesthesia. Premedication (administering sedative drugs prior to induction) increases the potency of alfaxalone as an induction agent. Alfaxalone can be used instead of gas anesthetics in surgeries that are under 30 minutes, where it is given at a constant rate via IV (constant rate infusion); this is especially useful in procedures such as bronchoscopies or repairing tracheal tears, as there is no endotracheal tube in the way. Once the administration of alfaxalone stops, the animal quickly recovers from anesthesia. Alfaxalone can be used as a sedative when given intramuscularly (IM), though this requires a larger volume (and not all countries allow alfaxalone to be administered IM). Despite its use as an anesthetic, alfaxalone itself has no analgesic properties. === Available forms === Though alfaxalone is not licensed for IM or subcutaneous use in the United States (as both cause longer recoveries with greater agitation and hypersensitivity to stimuli), it is routinely used IM in cats, and is licensed as such in other countries. Alfaxalone is dissolved in 2-hydroxypropyl-β cyclodextrin. The cyclodextrin is a large, starch-derived molecule with a hydrophobic core where alfaxalone stays, allowing the mixture to be dissolved in water and sold as an aqueous solution. They act as one unit, and only dissociate once in vivo. == Specific populations == Alfaxalone has been used to perform C-sections in pregnant cats; though it crosses the placental barrier and had some effects on the kittens, there is no respiratory depression and no lasting effect. Alfaxalone has also been found to be safe in young puppies and kittens. Alfaxalone has been noted to be a good anesthetic agent for dogs with ventricular arrhythmias and for sighthounds. There seems to be marked difference in sex response: anaesthesia in the male rat requires about four times more than in the female. == Side effects == Alfaxalone has relatively few side effects compared to other anesthetics; most notable is its lack of cardiovascular depression at clinical doses, which makes it unique among anesthetics. The most common side effect is respiratory depression: in addition to apnea, the most prevalent, alfaxalone can also decrease the respiratory rate, minute volume, and oxygen saturation in the blood. Alfaxalone should be administered slowly over a period of at least 60 seconds or until anesthesia is induced, as quick administration increases the risk of apnea. Alfaxalone has some depressive effects on the central nervous system, including a reduction in cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and body temperature. Greyhounds, who are particularly susceptible to anesthetic side effects, can have decreased blood flow and oxygen supply to the liver. When no premedications are used, alfaxalone causes animals (especially cats) to be agitated when recovering. Dogs and cats will paddle in the air, vocalize excessively, may remain rigid or twitch, and have exaggerated reactions to external stimuli such as light and noise. For this reason, it is recommended that animals recovering from anesthesia by alfaxalone stay in a quiet, dark area. == Overdose == The quick metabolism and elimination of alfaxalone from the body decreases the chance of overdose. It would take over 28 times the normal dose to cause toxicity in cats. Such doses, however, can cause low blood pressure, apnea, hypoxia, and arrhythmia (caused by the apnea and hypoxia). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Alfaxalone is a neuroactive steroid derived from progesterone, though it has no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid action. Instead, it works by acting on GABAA receptors. It binds to the M3/M4 domains of the α subunit and allosterically modifies the receptor to facilitate the movement of chloride ions into the cell, resulting in hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic nerve (which inhibits actions potentials). At concentrations over 1 micromolar, alfaxalone binds to a site at the interface between the α and β subunits (near the actual GABA binding site) and acts as a GABA agonist, similar to benzodiazepines. Alfaxalone, however, does not share the benzodiazepine binding site, and actually prefers different GABAA receptors than benzodiazepenes do. It works best on the α1-β2-γ2-L isoform. Research suggests that neuroactive steroids increase the expression of GABAA receptors, making it more difficult to build tolerance. === Pharmacokinetics === Alfaxalone is metabolized quickly and does not accumulate in the body; its use as an induction agent thus doesn't increase the time needed to recover from anesthesia. If it administered more slowly by diluting it in sterile water, less actual alfaxalone is needed. Alfaxalone binds to 30–50% of plasma proteins, and has a terminal half-life of 25 minutes in dogs and 45 minutes in cats when given at clinical doses (2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg respectively). The pharmacokinetics are nonlinear in cats and dogs. Most alfaxalone metabolism takes place in the liver, though some takes place in the lungs and kidneys as well. In the liver, it undergoes both phase I (cytochrome P450-dependent) and phase II (conjugation-dependent) metabolism. The phase I products are the same in cats and dogs: allopregnatrione, 3β-alfaxalone, 20-hydroxy-3β-alfaxalone, 2-hydroxyalfaxalone, and 2α-hydroxyalfaxalone. In dogs, the phase II metabolites are alfaxalone glucuronide (the major metabolite), 20-hydroxyalfaxalone sulfate, and 2α-hydroxyalfaxalone glucuronide. In cats, there is a greater production of 20-hydroxyalfaxalone sulfate than alfaxalone glucuronide; cats also have 3β-alfaxalone-sulfate, which is not present in dogs. Alfaxalone is mostly excreted in the urine, though some is excreted in the bile as well. == Chemistry == Alfaxalone, also known as 11-oxo-3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-11,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a modification of progesterone in which the C3 ketone has been reduced to a hydroxyl group, the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced and is now a single bond, and a ketone has been substituted at the C11 position. Alfaxalone is also a derivative of allopregnanolone, differing from it only by the addition of the C11 ketone. Other closely related steroids include ganaxolone, hydroxydione, minaxolone, pregnanolone, and renanolone. == History == In 1941, progesterone and 5β-pregnanedione were discovered to have CNS depressant effects in rodents. This began a search to make a synthetic steroid that could be used as an anesthetic. Most of these efforts were aimed at making alfaxalone more water-soluble. In 1971, a combination of alfaxalone and alfadolone acetate was released as the anesthetics Althesin (for human use) and Saffan (for veterinary use). The two were dissolved in Cremophor EL: a polyoxyelthylated castor oil surfactant. Althesin was removed from the market in 1984 for causing anaphylaxis; it was later found that this was due to Cremphor EL, which caused the body to release histamine, rather than alfaxolone or alfadolone. Saffan was removed from use for dogs only, but stayed on for other animals, none of which histamine release to the same extent that dogs did. It was still especially valued in cats for its lack of depressant effects on the cardiovascular system, which made it three times less fatal than any other anesthetic on the market at the time. The release of histamine caused most cats (69%) to have edema and hyperemia in their ears and paws; only some also got laryngeal or pulmonary edema. In 1999, a lyophilized form of alfaxalone was released for cats. The new drug, Alfaxan, used a cyclodextrin as a carrier agent to make alfaxalone more water-soluble rather than Camphor EL. Alfadolone was not included in the mixture, as its hypnotic effects were quite weak. An aqueous form of Alfaxan was released in Australia in 2000–2001, and Saffan was finally removed from the market in 2002. Alfaxan was released in the UK in 2007, central Europe in 2008, Canada in 2011, and the United States in 2012. Currently, a human form of alfaxalone is in development under the name ""Phaxan"": alfaxalone will be dissolved in 7-sulfo-butyl-ether-β-cyclodextrin, which, unlike the cyclodextrin used in Alfaxan, is not toxic to people. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Alfaxalone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of alfaxolone. Alphaxalone was the former BAN of the drug, but this was eventually changed. Alphaxolone and alfaxolone are additional alternative spellings. === Brand names === Alfaxalone was marketed in 1971 in combination with alfadolone acetate under the brand name Althesin for human use and Saffan for veterinary use. Althesin was withdrawn from the market in 1984, whereas Saffan remained marketed. A new formulation containing alfaxalone only was introduced for veterinary use in 1999 under the brand name Alfaxan. Following the introduction of Alfaxan, Saffan was gradually discontinued and is now no longer marketed. Another new formulation containing alfaxalone alone is currently under development for use in humans with the tentative brand name Phaxan. === Availability === Alfaxalone is marketed for veterinary use under the brand name Alfaxan in a number of countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. == References ==",Alfaxalone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1724250614643097), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02477806806564331), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5760225653648376)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfaxalone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Alfaxalone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfaxalone?utm_source=openai')])"
4084,"('Cyproteron', 'Cyproterone acetate impurity f')",Medical,"Cyproterone, also known by its developmental code name SH-80881, is a steroidal antiandrogen which was studied in the 1960s and 1970s but was never introduced for medical use. It is a precursor of cyproterone acetate (CPA), an antiandrogen, progestin, and antigonadotropin which was introduced instead of cyproterone and is widely used as a medication. Cyproterone and CPA were among the first antiandrogens to be developed. The term cyproterone is often used as a synonym and shorthand for cyproterone acetate, and when the term occurs, what is almost always being referred to is, confusingly, CPA and not actually cyproterone. Cyproterone itself, unlike CPA, was never introduced for medical use and hence is not available as a medication. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Cyproterone is a potent antiandrogen, similarly to CPA. However, it has approximately three-fold lower potency as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) relative to CPA. Like CPA, cyproterone is actually a weak partial agonist of the AR, and hence has the potential for both antiandrogenic and androgenic activity in some contexts. Unlike CPA (which is a highly potent progestogen), cyproterone is a pure antiandrogen and is virtually devoid of progestogenic activity. As such, it is not an antigonadotropin, and is actually progonadotropic in males, increasing gonadotropin and testosterone levels due to inhibition of AR-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Due to its progonadotropic effects in males, unlike CPA, cyproterone has been found, in male rodents, to increase testicular weight, increase the total number of type A spermatogonia, increase the total number of Sertoli cells, hyperstimulate the Leydig cells, and to have almost no effect on spermatogenesis. Conversely, it has also been reported for male rodents that spermiogenesis is inhibited and that accessory sexual gland weights (e.g., prostate gland, seminal vesicles) and fertility were markedly reduced, although with rapid recovery from the changes upon cessation of treatment. In any case, the medication is said to not be an effective antispermatogenic agent, whereas CPA is effective. Also unlike CPA, due to its lack of progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity, cyproterone does not suppress ovulation in women. ==== Other activities ==== Both CPA and, to a smaller extent, cyproterone possess some weak glucocorticoid activity and suppress adrenal gland and spleen weight in animals, with CPA having about one-fifth the potency of prednisone in mice. Unlike CPA, cyproterone seems to show some inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5α-reductase in vitro. In contrast to CPA, cyproterone shows no affinity for opioid receptors. == Chemistry == Cyproterone, also known as 1α,2α-methylene-6-chloro-17α-hydroxy-δ6-progesterone or as 1α,2α-methylene-6-chloro-17α-hydroxypregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is the free alcohol or 17α-deacetylated analogue of CPA. == History == Cyproterone, along with CPA, was first patented in 1962, with subsequent patents in 1963 and 1965. It was studied clinically between 1967 and 1972. Unlike CPA, the medication was never marketed for medical use. Cyproterone was the first pure antiandrogen to be developed, with other closely following examples of this class including the steroidal antiandrogens benorterone and BOMT and the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Cyproterone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name. It is also known by the developmental code names SH-80881 and SH-881. == Research == In clinical studies, cyproterone was found to be far less potent and effective as an antiandrogen than CPA, likely in significant part due to its lack of concomitant antigonadotropic action. Cyproterone was studied as a treatment for precocious puberty by Bierich (1970, 1971), but no significant improvement was observed. In men, 100 mg/day cyproterone proved to be rather ineffective in treating acne, which was hypothesized to be related to its progonadotropic effects in males and counteraction of its antiandrogen activity. In women however, who have much lower levels of testosterone and in whom the medication has no progonadotropic activity, 100 to 200 mg/day oral cyproterone was effective in reducing sebum production in all patients as early as 2 to 4 weeks following the start of treatment. In contrast, topical cyproterone was far less effective and barely outperformed placebo. Another study showed disappointing results with 100 mg/day cyproterone for reducing sebum production in women with hyperandrogenism. Similarly, the medication showed disappointing results in the treatment of hirsutism in women, with a distinct hair reduction occurring in only a limited percentage of cases. In the same study, the reduction of acne was better, but was clearly inferior to that produced by CPA, and only the improvement in seborrhea was regarded as satisfactory. The addition of an oral contraceptive to cyproterone resulted in a somewhat better improvement in acne and seborrhea relative to cyproterone alone. According to Jacobs (1979), ""[cyproterone] proved to be without clinical value for reasons that cannot be discussed here."" In any case, cyproterone has been well tolerated by patients in dosages of up to 300 mg/day. == References == == Further reading == Hughes A, Hasan SH, Oertel GW, Voss HE, Bahner F, Neumann F, et al.

4085,"('Minocyn', 'Tri-minocycline', 'Oprea1_104816')",Medical,"Minocycline, sold under the brand name Minocin among others, is a tetracycline antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections such as some occurring in certain forms of pneumonia. It is generally (but not always) less preferred than the tetracycline doxycycline. Minocycline is also used for the treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, allergic reactions, and kidney problems. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, a lupus-like syndrome, and easy sunburning. Use in the later part of pregnancy may harm the baby and safety during breastfeeding is unclear. It works by decreasing a bacterium's ability to make protein thus stopping its growth. Minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 269th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Acne === Minocycline and doxycycline are frequently used for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Minocycline is specifically indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in people nine years of age and older. Both minocycline and doxycycline have similar levels of effectiveness and common adverse effects for acne, although doxycycline may have a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. Both oral/systemic and more recently topical formulations of minocycline are available to treat acne. Historically, oral minocycline has been an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, acne that is caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. In Europe and North America, a number of people with acne no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily Cutibacterium acnes) that are resistant to these antibiotics. In order to reduce resistance rates as well as increase the effectiveness of treatment, oral antibiotics should be generally combined with topical acne creams such as benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid (tretinoin, adapalene, etc.). There have also been concerns about systemic minocycline having a variety of rare adverse effects in terms of its use to treat acne. Oral minocycline is used to treat acne for up to 3 to 4 months. Data beyond 3 to 4 months are limited. === Other infections === Minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although minocycline's broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against Neisseria meningitidis, its use for prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo). It may be used to treat certain strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and a disease caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. A list of uses includes: Amoebic dysentery Anthrax Bubonic plague Cholera Ehrlichiosis Gonorrhea (when penicillin cannot be given) Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome (confluent and reticulated papillomatosis) Hidradenitis suppurativa For use as an adjuvant to HAART Leprosy Periodontal disease Perioral dermatitis Respiratory infections such as pneumonia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Rosacea Syphilis (when penicillin cannot be given) Urinary tract infections (UTIs), rectal infections, and infections of the cervix caused by certain microbes Minocycline has been reported to be effective in the eradication of UTIs and prostatitis. A 2013 Cochrane review identified and included two comparative clinical trials of minocycline for chronic bacterial prostatitis. For this condition, minocycline has been found to be equivalent or superior to doxycycline, equivalent to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and superior to the first-generation cephalosporin cephalexin. It was also equivalent to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum. Treatment durations of minocycline for chronic bacterial prostatitis have ranged from 2 to 4 weeks. === Other uses === Both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune-suppressing effects. Minocycline and doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline. === Available forms === Minocycline is available in the form of 50 and 100 mg oral capsules, among a variety of other formulations. The oral form of minocycline is usually taken twice daily, once every 12 hours, although divided doses four times daily can also be employed. Extended-release oral forms are also available. A topical formulation is available as well. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics, as there is complete cross sensitivity in this group. It is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment and after the 16th week of pregnancy. == Side effects == Minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, migraines, and vomiting. It increases sensitivity to sunlight, and may affect the quality of sleep and rarely causes sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline can lead to blue-gray staining of skin, fingernails, and scar tissue. This staining is not permanent, but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; however, a muddy brown skin color in sun-exposed areas is usually permanent. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization. Occasionally, minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug-related lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, which usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline-induced lupus; however, women are more likely to develop minocycline-induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline-induced autoimmune problems within a period of a few weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy, but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances, including symptoms of dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, and tinnitus. These effects are thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. The vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, reportedly occurring in 50 to 70% of women receiving minocycline. However, other sources state that vestibular side effects occur in only 1 to 10% of patients. In any case, other studies have found that side effects occur more frequently in women than in men (~58% vs. 34%, respectively). Due to its vestibular side effects, minocycline has been said to be rarely used in female patients. Minocycline's vestibular side effects typically resolve after discontinuation of the drug. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage if not recognized early and treated. Contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis. Minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension, which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. Brain swelling and rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects of minocycline in some people. Minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date. While most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. Expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline. Minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly. Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep. A 2007 study suggested that minocycline harms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. The effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses. Other possible rare side effects of minocycline include hyperpigmentation and hypersensitivity reactions, among others. It has been associated with more rare and serious adverse effects than other tetracyclines. Some of the rare adverse effects of minocycline may result in death. This has spurred interest in topical instead of systemic minocycline for treatment of acne. Minocycine has shown thyroid toxicity in animals, including in rodents, mini pigs, dogs, and monkeys. The use of minocycline to treat acne has been associated with skin and gut dysbiosis (see antibiotic misuse). == Overdose == Symptoms of minocycline overdose may include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. There is no specific antidote for overdose of minocycline and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. The drug is not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == Interactions == The combination of minocycline with dairy, antacids, calcium and magnesium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants may decrease minocycline's effectiveness by forming chelates. Combining it with isotretinoin, acitretin or other retinoids can increase the risk for intracranial hypertension. Minocycline significantly reduces concentrations of the anti-HIV drug atazanavir in the body. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antibiotic activity ==== Minocycline mediates its antibiotic activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. It is primarily bacteriostatic. The drug is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and shows activity against a wide range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. ==== Other activities ==== Minocycline shows a number of off-target activities in addition to its antibiotic activity. These include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), anti-inflammatory effects, antiapoptotic effects, antioxidant effects, and neuroprotective effects. Some other reported activities of minocycline include: PARP1 inhibition Ki = 13.8 nM Neuroprotection IC50 = 10 nM Microglia full inhibition = 20 nM Suppression of the mouse's locomotor activity = 0.5 mg/kg Indirect inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Minocycline is quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. Taking it together with food, including milk, has no relevant influence on resorption. It reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 1 to 2 hours. ==== Distribution ==== The drug has a plasma protein binding of 70 to 75%. It penetrates into almost all tissues; very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder and liver. It crosses the blood–brain barrier better than doxycycline and other tetracyclines, reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and also in inflamed meninges. Minocycline achieves good concentrations in the urinary bladder, and many other tissues. It shows excellent penetration into the prostate gland. However, while permeation of prostate tissue and semen is good, levels are lower in prosatic fluid. ==== Metabolism ==== Minocycline is inactivated by metabolism in the liver to about 50%. It is primarily metabolized into 9-hydroxyminocycline. Two N-demethylated metabolites are also formed. ==== Elimination ==== The rest is predominantly excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels) and eliminated via the feces. About 10–15% are eliminated via the kidneys. It is excreted about 5 to 10% unchanged in urine. For comparison, other tetracyclines, like doxycycline and tetracycline, are excreted 30 to 70% unchanged in urine. The biological half-life of minocycline is 11 to 26 hours in healthy people, up to 30 hours in those with kidney failure, and significantly longer in those with liver disease. == Chemistry == Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative. It is closely structurally related to other tetracyclic antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and tigecycline. The drug is used in form of minocycline hydrochloride dihydrate, which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Minocycline reacts acidic in aqueous solution. The partition coefficient (P) of minocycline has been reported to be 39.4 (i.e., log P of 1.60). However, other sources have stated the experimental log P of minocycline to be 0.05, 0.5, and 1.1. In any case, minocycline is consistently described as a highly lipophilic compound with excellent tissue penetration and distribution. It has been said to be unique among the tetracyclines in that it is the most lipophilic of all of the members of this group. Minocycline has 10 to 30 times greater lipophilicity than tetracycline and 5 times greater lipophilicity than doxycycline. The improved lipophilicity of minocycline is thought to be advantageous in terms of its clinical antibiotic effectiveness. == History == Minocycline was patented in 1961, was first described in the scientific literature in 1967, and came into commercial use in 1971. A topical foam for treatment of acne was approved in 2019. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Minomycin Minostad (in Europe, for the treatment of acne) Akamin Minocin Minoderm Cyclimycin Arestin (1-mg doses administered locally into periodontal pockets, after scaling and root planing, for treatment of periodontal disease.) Aknemin Solodyn (extended-release, for the treatment of acne) Dynacin Sebomin Mino-Tabs Acnamino Minopen (in Japan) Maracyn 2 (for treatment of bacterial infections in aquarium fish and amphibians) Quatrocin (in Syria) Minox (in Ireland) Minoz (in India and Romania) Divaine (in India) Vinocyclin 100 (100-mg dose approved for treatment of acne in Vietnam) Dentomycin (2% minocylcine gel for use in periodontal pockets) Amzeeq (4% foam, approved for treatment of acne United States) Zilxi (1.5% foam, approved for treatment of rosacea in the United States) Cleeravue-M === Generic availability === It is available as a generic medication. == Research == === Neuropsychiatric disorders === ==== Depression ==== Minocycline has been studied in the treatment of depression. According to a 2023 systematic review of minocycline for treatment-resistant depression based on four clinical trials, ""There is no significant difference with minocycline compared to placebo for depression not responding to first-line antidepressant therapy."" Likewise, a 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found that minocycline was not significantly more effective than placebo in treating depression. Minocycline might have some benefit in treatment-resistant depression with inflammation however. Yet another meta-analysis, also published in 2023, found that minocycline was effective in the treatment of depression, including treatment-resistant depression, with a small to moderate effect size. ==== Schizophrenia ==== Early research has found a tentative benefit from minocycline in schizophrenia, with several trials underway as of 2012. A 2014 meta-analysis found minocycline may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated. A 2019 meta-analysis, which included 13 randomized controlled trials, found that minocycline was effective in the treatment of the positive, negative, and general symptoms of schizophrenia, with small to moderate effect sizes. Similarly, a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials found that minocycline was effective in treating the total, negative, and general symptoms of schizophrenia but not the positive or cognitive symptoms, again with small to moderate effect sizes. ==== Other conditions ==== Some early studies suggest that minocycline may be beneficial as an add-on treatment for moderate-to-severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when used with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). === Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases === In ongoing research and trial, minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seems a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients, especially in AIS subgroup. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline among ICH patients. Research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As mentioned above, minocycline harms ALS patients. A trial found no difference between minocycline and placebo in people with Alzheimers' disease. Minocycline is somewhat neuroprotective in mouse models of Huntington's disease. === Multiple sclerosis === A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS. === Delirium === A 2024 randomized controlled trial found that prophylactic minocycline provided a small but significant decrease in delirium incidence in critically ill patients. Unexpectedly, there was also a significant decrease in hospital mortality with minocycline prophylaxis. The mortality benefits of minocycline might have simply been due to its bactericidal effects. === Hearing protection === Several preclinical studies (in vitro cell cultures and animal models) suggest that minocycline may have otoprotective benefits. Animal models indicate it could potentially reduce noise-induced and blast-induced hearing loss, possibly by protecting hair cells and mitigating inflammation. In vitro and animal studies also show minocycline may help decrease ototoxicity from certain drugs like gentamicin, neomycin, and cisplatin. === Other uses === Minocycline also has been used as a ""last-ditch"" treatment for toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Minocycline has been suggested as a possible treatment for post-COVID-19 syndrome (""long COVID""), but no quality clinical trials exist. The same is true of minocycline as a potential treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). == References ==",Minocyn,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.590759246842936e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002485997276380658)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([1mg.com](https://www.1mg.com/drugs/minocyn-50mg-tablet-285004?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Minocyn 50mg Tablet: View Uses, Side Effects, Price and Substitutes | 1mg', type='url_citation', url='https://www.1mg.com/drugs/minocyn-50mg-tablet-285004?utm_source=openai')])"
4086,"('Moxifloxacin hydrochloride', 'Moxifloxacin hcl', 'Avelox', 'Avalox', 'Vigamox')",Medical,"Moxifloxacin is an antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections, including pneumonia, conjunctivitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis, and sinusitis. It can be given by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as an eye drop. Common side effects include diarrhea, dizziness, and headache. Severe side effects may include spontaneous tendon ruptures, nerve damage, and worsening of myasthenia gravis. Safety of use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. Moxifloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It usually kills bacteria by blocking their ability to duplicate DNA. Moxifloxacin was patented in 1988 and approved for use in the United States in 1999. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 273rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Moxifloxacin treats a number of infections, including respiratory-tract infections, bubonic plague, cellulitis, anthrax, intra-abdominal infections, endocarditis, meningitis, and tuberculosis. In the United States, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated infections of the skin and of the skin structure, and complicated intra-abdominal infections. In the European Union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. On the basis of its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the intravenous) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. In the United States, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings of skin reactions. The initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States (December 1999) encompassed these indications: Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis Acute bacterial sinusitis Community acquired pneumonia Additional indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration: April 2001: Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections May 2004: Community-acquired pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae June 2005: Complicated skin and skin-structure infections November 2005: Complicated intra-abdominal infections The European Medicines Agency has advised that, for pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute exacerbations of COPD, it should only be used when other antibiotics are inappropriate. Oral and intravenous moxifloxacin have not been approved for children. Several drugs in this class, including moxifloxacin, are not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children, because of the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system. Moxifloxacin eye drops are approved for conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Recently, alarming reports of moxifloxacin resistance rates among anaerobes have been published. In Austria 36% of Bacteroides have been reported to be resistant to moxifloxacin, while in Italy resistance rates as high as 41% have been reported. === Susceptible bacteria === Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus pneumoniae Stenotrophomonas spp. Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella spp. Moraxella catarrhalis Enterobacter spp. Mycobacterium spp. Bacillus anthracis Mycoplasma genitalium Borrelia Burgdoferi (found to be effective in vitro) == Adverse effects == Rare but serious adverse effects that may occur as a result of moxifloxacin therapy include irreversible peripheral neuropathy, spontaneous tendon rupture and tendonitis, hepatitis, psychiatric effects (hallucinations, depression), torsades de pointes, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, and photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions. Several reports suggest the use of moxifloxacin may lead to uveitis. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Exposure of the developing fetus to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. There is limited data about the appearance of moxifloxacin in human breastmilk. Animal studies have found that moxifloxacin appears in significant concentration in breastmilk. Decisions as to whether to continue therapy during pregnancy or while breast feeding should take the potential risk of harm to the fetus or child into account, as well as the importance of the drug to the well-being of the mother. == Contraindications == Only two listed contraindications are found within the 2008 package insert: ""Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions."" ""Moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components."" Though not stated as such within the package insert, ziprasidone is also considered to be contraindicated, as it may have the potential to prolong QT interval. Moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants). Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered. Moxifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with a history of tendon disorder, patients with documented QT prolongation, and patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. Coadministration of moxifloxacin with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. Careful consideration should be given in the use of moxifloxacin in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities. === Children and adolescents === The safety of moxifloxacin in human patients under age 18 has not been established. Animal studies suggest a risk of musculoskeletal harm in juveniles. == Interactions == Moxifloxacin is not believed to be associated with clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. Thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety. Moxifloxacin has a potential for a serious drug interaction with NSAIDs. The combination of corticosteroids and moxifloxacin has increased potential to result in tendonitis and disability. Antacids containing aluminium or magnesium ions inhibit the absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., pimozide) may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin. == Overdose == ""In the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained. ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. About 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively."" (Quoting from 29 December 2008 package insert for Avelox) == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell replication. === Pharmacokinetics === About 52% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin. In vitro studies with cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied. The elimination half-life of moxifloxacin is 11.5 to 15.6 hours (single-dose, oral). About 45% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). A total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 L/h and 2.6 ± 0.5 L/h, respectively. The CSF penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis. == Chemistry == Moxifloxacin monohydrochloride is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline substance. It is synthesized in several steps, the first involving the preparation of racemic 2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane which is then resolved using tartaric acid. A suitably derivatised quinolinecarboxylic acid is then introduced, in the presence of DABCO, followed by acidification to form moxifloxacin hydrochloride. == History == Moxifloxacin was first patented (United States patent) in 1991 by Bayer A.G., and again in 1997. Avelox was subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States in 1999 to treat specific bacterial infections. Ranking 140th within the top 200 prescribed drugs in the United States for 2007, Avelox generated sales of $697.3 million worldwide. Moxifloxacin is also manufactured by Alcon as Vigamox. === Patent === A United States patent application was made on 30 June 1989, for Avelox, Bayer A.G. being the assignee, which was subsequently approved on 5 February 1991. This patent was scheduled to expire on 30 June 2009. However, this patent was extended for an additional two and one half years on 16 September 2004, and as such was not expected to expire until 2012. Moxifloxacin was subsequently (ten years later) approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 1999. At least four additional United States patents have been filed regarding moxifloxacin hydrochloride since the 1989 United States application, as well as patents outside of the US. == Society and culture == === Regulatory actions === Regulatory agencies have taken actions to address certain rare but serious adverse events associated with moxifloxacin therapy. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. Similarly, the Canadian label includes a warning of the risk of liver injury. The U.S. label does not contain restrictions similar to the European label, but a carries a ""black box"" warning of the risk of tendon damage and/or rupture and warnings regarding the risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy. === Generic equivalents === In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware held that two Bayer patents on Avelox are valid and enforceable, and infringed by Dr. Reddy's ANDA for a generic version of Avelox. The district court sided with Bayer, citing the Federal Circuit's prior decision in Takeda v. Alphapharm as ""affirming the district court's finding that defendant failed to prove a prima facie case of obviousness where the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds, any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation, and defendant did not prove that the prior art would have led to the selection of the particular compound singled out by defendant."" According to Bayer's press release announcing the court's decision, it was noted that Teva had also challenged the validity of the same Bayer patents at issue in the Dr. Reddy's case. Within Bayer's first-quarter 2008 stockholder's newsletter Bayer stated that they had reached an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., the adverse party, to settle their patent litigation with regard to the two Bayer patents. Under the settlement terms agreed upon, Teva would obtain a license to sell its generic moxifloxacin tablet product in the U.S. shortly before the second of the two Bayer patents expires in March 2014. In Bangladesh, it is available with brand name of Optimox. == References ==",Vigamox,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002924968139268458), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00256423931568861)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

On the basis of its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the intravenous) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. In the United States, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings of skin reactions. The initial approval by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States (December 1999) encompassed these indications: Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis Acute bacterial sinusitis Community acquired pneumonia Additional indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration: April 2001: Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections May 2004: Community-acquired pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae June 2005: Complicated skin and skin-structure infections November 2005: Complicated intra-abdominal infections The European Medicines Agency has advised that, for pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute exacerbations of COPD, it should only be used when other antibiotics are inappropriate. Oral and intravenous moxifloxacin have not been approved for children. Several drugs in this class, including moxifloxacin, are not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children, because of the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system. Moxifloxacin eye drops are approved for conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Recently, alarming reports of moxifloxacin resistance rates among anaerobes have been published. In Austria 36% of Bacteroides have been reported to be resistant to moxifloxacin, while in Italy resistance rates as high as 41% have been reported. === Susceptible bacteria === Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus pneumoniae Stenotrophomonas spp. Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella spp. Moraxella catarrhalis Enterobacter spp. Mycobacterium spp. Bacillus anthracis Mycoplasma genitalium Borrelia Burgdoferi (found to be effective in vitro) == Adverse effects == Rare but serious adverse effects that may occur as a result of moxifloxacin therapy include irreversible peripheral neuropathy, spontaneous tendon rupture and tendonitis, hepatitis, psychiatric effects (hallucinations, depression), torsades de pointes, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, and photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions. Several reports suggest the use of moxifloxacin may lead to uveitis. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Exposure of the developing fetus to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. There is limited data about the appearance of moxifloxacin in human breastmilk. Animal studies have found that moxifloxacin appears in significant concentration in breastmilk. Decisions as to whether to continue therapy during pregnancy or while breast feeding should take the potential risk of harm to the fetus or child into account, as well as the importance of the drug to the well-being of the mother. == Contraindications == Only two listed contraindications are found within the 2008 package insert: ""Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions."" ""Moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components."" Though not stated as such within the package insert, ziprasidone is also considered to be contraindicated, as it may have the potential to prolong QT interval. Moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants). Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered. Moxifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with a history of tendon disorder, patients with documented QT prolongation, and patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. Coadministration of moxifloxacin with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. Careful consideration should be given in the use of moxifloxacin in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities. === Children and adolescents === The safety of moxifloxacin in human patients under age 18 has not been established. Animal studies suggest a risk of musculoskeletal harm in juveniles. == Interactions == Moxifloxacin is not believed to be associated with clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. Thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety. Moxifloxacin has a potential for a serious drug interaction with NSAIDs. The combination of corticosteroids and moxifloxacin has increased potential to result in tendonitis and disability. Antacids containing aluminium or magnesium ions inhibit the absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., pimozide) may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin. == Overdose == ""In the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained. ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. About 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively."" (Quoting from 29 December 2008 package insert for Avelox) == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell replication. === Pharmacokinetics === About 52% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin. In vitro studies with cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied. The elimination half-life of moxifloxacin is 11.5 to 15.6 hours (single-dose, oral). About 45% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). A total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 L/h and 2.6 ± 0.5 L/h, respectively. The CSF penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis. == Chemistry == Moxifloxacin monohydrochloride is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline substance. It is synthesized in several steps, the first involving the preparation of racemic 2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane which is then resolved using tartaric acid. A suitably derivatised quinolinecarboxylic acid is then introduced, in the presence of DABCO, followed by acidification to form moxifloxacin hydrochloride. == History == Moxifloxacin was first patented (United States patent) in 1991 by Bayer A.G., and again in 1997. Avelox was subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States in 1999 to treat specific bacterial infections. Ranking 140th within the top 200 prescribed drugs in the United States for 2007, Avelox generated sales of $697.3 million worldwide. Moxifloxacin is also manufactured by Alcon as Vigamox. === Patent === A United States patent application was made on 30 June 1989, for Avelox, Bayer A.G. being the assignee, which was subsequently approved on 5 February 1991. This patent was scheduled to expire on 30 June 2009. However, this patent was extended for an additional two and one half years on 16 September 2004, and as such was not expected to expire until 2012. Moxifloxacin was subsequently (ten years later) approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 1999. At least four additional United States patents have been filed regarding moxifloxacin hydrochloride since the 1989 United States application, as well as patents outside of the US. == Society and culture == === Regulatory actions === Regulatory agencies have taken actions to address certain rare but serious adverse events associated with moxifloxacin therapy. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. Similarly, the Canadian label includes a warning of the risk of liver injury. The U.S. label does not contain restrictions similar to the European label, but a carries a ""black box"" warning of the risk of tendon damage and/or rupture and warnings regarding the risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy. === Generic equivalents === In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware held that two Bayer patents on Avelox are valid and enforceable, and infringed by Dr. Reddy's ANDA for a generic version of Avelox. The district court sided with Bayer, citing the Federal Circuit's prior decision in Takeda v. Alphapharm as ""affirming the district court's finding that defendant failed to prove a prima facie case of obviousness where the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds, any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation, and defendant did not prove that the prior art would have led to the selection of the particular compound singled out by defendant."" According to Bayer's press release announcing the court's decision, it was noted that Teva had also challenged the validity of the same Bayer patents at issue in the Dr. Reddy's case. Within Bayer's first-quarter 2008 stockholder's newsletter Bayer stated that they had reached an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., the adverse party, to settle their patent litigation with regard to the two Bayer patents. Under the settlement terms agreed upon, Teva would obtain a license to sell its generic moxifloxacin tablet product in the U.S. shortly before the second of the two Bayer patents expires in March 2014. In Bangladesh, it is available with brand name of Optimox. == References ==",Izilox,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.018882637843489647), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0026656591799110174)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015023599844425917), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/izilox?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='IZILOX - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/izilox?utm_source=openai')])"

Captopril was the first oral ACE inhibitor found for the treatment of hypertension. It does not cause fatigue as associated with beta-blockers. Due to the adverse drug event of causing hyperkalemia, as seen with most ACE Inhibitors, the medication is usually paired with a diuretic. Captopril was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1980. == Structure–activity relationship == Captopril has an L-proline group which allows it to be more bioavailable in oral formulations. The thiol moiety within the molecule has been associated with two significant adverse effects: the hapten or immune response. This immune response, also known as agranulocytosis, can explain the adverse drug events which may be seen in captopril with the allergic response which includes hives, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat. In terms of interaction with the enzyme, the molecule's thiol moiety will attach to the binding site of the ACE enzyme. This will inhibit the port at which the angiotensin-1 molecule would normally bind, therefore inhibiting the downstream effects within the renin-angiotensin system. == Medical uses == Captopril's main uses are based on its vasodilation and inhibition of some renal function activities. These benefits are most clearly seen in: Hypertension Cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure and after myocardial infarction Preservation of kidney function in diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, it has shown mood-elevating properties in some patients. This is consistent with the observation that animal screening models indicate putative antidepressant activity for this compound, although one study has been negative. Formal clinical trials in depressed patients have not been reported. It has also been investigated for use in the treatment of cancer. Captopril stereoisomers were also reported to inhibit some metallo-β-lactamases. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects of captopril include cough due to increase in the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia. Except for postural hypotension, which occurs due to the short and fast mode of action of captopril, most of the side effects mentioned are common for all ACE inhibitors. Among these, cough is the most common adverse effect. Hyperkalemia can occur, especially if used with other drugs which elevate potassium level in blood, such as potassium-sparing diuretics. Other side effects are: Itching Headache Tachycardia Chest pain Palpitations Dysgeusia Weakness The adverse drug reaction (ADR) profile of captopril is similar to other ACE inhibitors, with cough being the most common ADR. However, captopril is also commonly associated with rash and taste disturbances (metallic or loss of taste), which are attributed to the unique thiol moiety. == Overdose == ACE inhibitor overdose can be treated with naloxone. == History == In the late 1960s, John Vane of the Royal College of Surgeons of England was working on mechanisms by which the body regulates blood pressure. He was joined by Sérgio Henrique Ferreira of Brazil, who had been studying the venom of a Brazilian pit viper, the jararaca (Bothrops jararaca), and brought a sample of the viper's venom. Vane's team found that one of the venom's peptides selectively inhibited the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which was thought to function in blood pressure regulation; the snake venom functions by severely depressing blood pressure. During the 1970s, ACE was found to elevate blood pressure by controlling the release of water and salts from the kidneys. Captopril, an analog of the snake venom's ACE-inhibiting peptide, was first synthesized in 1975 by three researchers at the U.S. drug company E.R. Squibb & Sons Pharmaceuticals (now Bristol-Myers Squibb): Miguel Ondetti, Bernard Rubin, and David Cushman. Squibb filed for U.S. patent protection on the drug in February 1976, which was granted in September 1977, and captopril was approved for medical use in 1980. It was the first ACE inhibitor developed and was considered a breakthrough both because of its mechanism of action and also because of the development process. In the 1980s, Vane received the Nobel prize and was knighted for his work and Ferreira received the National Order of Scientific Merit from Brazil. The development of captopril was among the earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of structure-based drug design. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system had been extensively studied in the mid-20th century, and this system presented several opportune targets in the development of novel treatments for hypertension. The first two targets that were attempted were renin and ACE. Captopril was the culmination of efforts by Squibb's laboratories to develop an ACE inhibitor. Ondetti, Cushman, and colleagues built on work that had been done in the 1960s by a team of researchers led by John Vane at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The first breakthrough was made by Kevin K.F. Ng in 1967, when he found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II took place in the pulmonary circulation instead of in the plasma. In contrast, Sergio Ferreira found bradykinin disappeared in its passage through the pulmonary circulation. The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin were thought to be mediated by the same enzyme. In 1970, using bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) provided by Sergio Ferreira, Ng and Vane found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. BPF was later found to be a peptide in the venom of a lancehead viper (Bothrops jararaca), which was a “collected-product inhibitor” of the converting enzyme. Captopril was developed from this peptide after it was found via QSAR-based modification that the terminal sulfhydryl moiety of the peptide provided a high potency of ACE inhibition. Captopril gained FDA approval on April 6, 1981. The drug became a generic medicine in the U.S. in February 1996, when the market exclusivity held by Bristol-Myers Squibb for captopril expired. == Chemical synthesis == A chemical synthesis of captopril by treatment of L-proline with (2S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl chloride under basic conditions (NaOH), followed by aminolysis of the protective acetyl group to unmask the drug's free thiol, is depicted in the figure at right. Procedure 2 taken out of patent US4105776. See examples 28, 29a and 36. == Mechanism of action == Captopril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and prevents the degradation of vasodilatory prostaglandins, thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction and promoting systemic vasodilation. == Pharmacokinetics == Unlike the majority of ACE inhibitors, captopril is not administered as a prodrug (the only other being lisinopril). About 70% of orally administered captopril is absorbed. Bioavailability is reduced by presence of food in stomach. It is partly metabolised and partly excreted unchanged in urine. Captopril also has a relatively poor pharmacokinetic profile. The short half-life necessitates dosing two or three times per day, which may reduce patient compliance. Captopril has a short half-life of 2–3 hours and a duration of action of 12–24 hours. == See also == Captopril challenge test Captopril suppression test == References == == External links == ""Captopril"".

4090,"('Pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate', 'Mirapex', '(s)-n6-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole-2,6-diamine dihydrochloride hydrate', 'Pramipexole 2hcl monohydrate', 'Pramipexole hydrochloride hydrate')",Medical,"Pramipexole, sold under the brand Mirapex among others, is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. In Parkinson's disease it may be used alone or together with levodopa. It is taken by mouth. Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist of the non-ergoline class. Pramipexole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997 and was first manufactured by Pharmacia and Upjohn. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 193rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Pramipexole is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown. A 2008 meta-analysis found that pramipexole was more effective than ropinirole in the treatment of restless legs syndrome. It is occasionally prescribed off-label for depression. Its effectiveness as an antidepressant may be a product of its strong partial agonistic activity on and preferential occupation of dopamine D3 receptors at low doses (see table below); as well, the drug has been shown to desensitize the inhibitory D2 autoreceptors but not the postsynaptic D2 receptors, leading to an increase in dopamine and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex. Chronic administration of pramipexole may also result in desensitization of D3 autoreceptors, leading to reduced dopamine transporter function. Trials have shown mixed results for depression. Pramipexole has also been used as a treatment for REM sleep behaviour disorder, but it is not licensed for use in this disorder. Observational studies suggest it may reduce the frequency and intensity of REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms, but randomized controlled trials have not been performed, so the evidence for its role in this disorder is weak. == Side effects == Common side effects of pramipexole include: Headache Peripheral edema Hyperalgesia (body aches and pains) Nausea and vomiting Sedation and somnolence Decreased appetite and subsequent weight loss Orthostatic hypotension (resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness, and possibly fainting, especially when standing up) Insomnia Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or feeling things that are not there), amnesia and confusion Twitching, twisting, or other unusual body movements Unusual tiredness or weakness Pramipexole (and related D3-preferring dopamine agonist medications such as ropinirole) can induce ""impulsive-compulsive spectrum disorders"" such as compulsive gambling, punding, hypersexuality, and overeating, even in people without any prior history of these behaviors. There have also been reported detrimental side effects related to impulse-control disorders resulting from off-label use of Pramipexole or other dopamine agonists in treating clinical depression. The incidence and severity of impulse-control disorders for those taking the drug for depression are not fully understood because the drug has not been approved for the treatment of depression and the first major studies of its efficacy in treating anhedonic depression were conducted in 2022. There have been anecdotal reports of abrupt and severe personality changes related to impulsivity and loss of self-control in a minority of patients regardless of the condition being treated, although the incidence of these side effects is not yet fully known. Augmentation: Especially when used to treat restless legs syndrome, long-term pramipexole treatment may exhibit drug augmentation, which is ""an iatrogenic worsening of [restless legs syndrome] symptoms following treatment with dopaminergic agents"" and may include an earlier onset of symptoms during the day or a generalized increase in symptoms. == Pharmacology == The activity profile of Pramipexole at various sites has been characterized as follows: While Pramipexole is used clinically (see below), its D3-preferring receptor binding profile has made it a popular tool compound for preclinical research. For example, pramipexole has been used (in combination with D2- and or D3-preferring antagonists) to discover the role of D3 receptor function in rodent models and tasks for neuropsychiatric disorders. Of note, it appears that pramipexole, in addition to having effects on dopamine D3 receptors, may also affect mitochondrial function via a mechanism that remains less understood. A pharmacological approach to separate dopaminergic from non-dopaminergic (e.g. mitochondrial) effects of pramipexole has been to study the effects of the R-stereoisomer of pramipexole (which has much lower affinity to the dopamine receptors when compared to the S-isomer) side by side with the effects of the S-isomer. This property can be characterised using dopaminergic activity equivalent (a relative measure comparing doses of different doses of stereoisomers in mg). Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the substantia nigra, a component of the basal ganglia. The substantia nigra has a high quantity of dopaminergic neurons, which are nerve cells that release the neurotransmitter known as dopamine. When dopamine is released, it may activate dopamine receptors in the striatum, which is another component of the basal ganglia. When neurons of the substantia nigra deteriorate in Parkinson's disease, the striatum no longer properly receives dopamine signals. As a result, the basal ganglia can no longer regulate body movement effectively and motor function becomes impaired. By acting as an agonist for the D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptors, pramipexole may directly stimulate the underfunctioning dopamine receptors in the striatum, thereby restoring the dopamine signals needed for proper functioning of the basal ganglia. Pramipexole can increase growth hormone indirectly through its inhibition of somatostatin. Pramipexole has also been shown to be protective against dopaminergic-related methamphetamine neurotoxicity. Immediate-release pramipexole displays a Tmax of approximately 2 hours and 3 hours if taken with a high-fat meal. Extended-release pramipexole displays a Tmax of ~6 hours and ~8 hours if taken with food. The AUC of Pramipexole remains unaltered regardless of food presence. Steady-state is achieved within 3 days and 5 days for the IR and ER formulation respectively. Pramipexole is eliminated via the renal organic cation transporter as an unchanged drug showing no signs of any metabolism. Pramipexole has been shown to inhibit CYP2D6 with a Ki of 30μM which is significantly higher than the maximum approved dosage of 4.5mg/day thus any enzyme-mediated drug interactions are not clinically relevant. It comes in strengths of 0.125mg, 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 1.5mg instant release; the extended-release comes in 0.375mg, 0.75mg, 1.5mg, 2.25mg, 3mg, 3.75mg, and 4.5mg. The instant release is meant to be dosed three times daily for Parkinson's and once two hours before bedtime for restless leg syndrome. The extended-release is not approved for restless leg syndrome. It is not metabolized, with >90% of the dose excreted unchanged via SCL22A2/OCT2. Therefore, inhibitors of the renal organic cation transporter system (e.g., cimetidine ) will increase the area under the curve ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } by 50% and increase the t1/2 by 40%. == Synthesis == 4-Acetamidocyclohexanone (1) is reacted with bromine, yielding 2-bromo-4-acetamidocyclohexanone (2). Then, 2 reacts with thiourea, giving compound 3. Through reaction with HBr, amide is converted into a primary amine (compound 4), which then reacts with diethyl mesoxalate and tetrahydroborane, yielding pramipexole (5). == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Mirapex, Mirapex ER, Mirapexin, Sifrol, Pexola, Pipexus, Glepark, Oprymea, Astepen, Calmolan, Erimexol, Ezaprev, Frodix, Galipeks, Labrixile, Mariprax, Medopexol, Mepimer, Minergi, Miparkan, Miraper, Miviren, Nulipar, Pacto, Panarak, Parim, Parixol, Parkipex, Parkyn, Parmital, Parpex, Pexa XR, Peximyr, Pexopar, Pisa, Portiv, Pradose, Pramigen, Pramipexin, Pramirol, Pramithon, Pranow, Prapex, Quera LP, Rampiex, Ramixole, Rapexole, Ritmorest, Axalanz, Biopsol, Derinik, Elderpat, Intaxel, Mirapapkin, Mirapezol, Movial, Muvend, Nervius, Neurosomat, Newmirex, Noxopran, Nulipar, Oxpola, Parmital, Periamid, Pralexan, Pramexol, Pramifer, Pramiola, Pramip, Pramitrem, Primizol, Ramipex, Rapexole, Simipex, Simpral, Stabil, Treminel, Trimexol, X-Tremble. == Research == === Further Parkinson's disease symptoms treatment === Parkinson's disease, apart from motor symptoms, is associated with chronic pain, which is mediated through three different mechanisms: nociception, neuropathy and nociplasty. In animal models, it was shown that pramipexole alleviates allodynia and hyperalgesia caused by excessive glial cell (astrocytes, microglia) activation in the spinal cord, which is the causative effect of Parkinson's disease-relatet nociceptive pain. Pramipexole appears to exert this effect through its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-18). and NF-κB. === Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury === Pramipexole in combination with levodopa was shown to alleviate neurological repercussions, improve neuron morphology and their survival after cerebral ischemia-related reperfusion injury through ferroptosis inhibition (via Nrf2/GPX4/SLC7A11 pathway) or by mitochondrial membrane potential stabilization. === Traumatic brain injury === After traumatic brain injury, neurons can undergo necroptosis via necrosome formation and RIPK1 pathway. Pramipexole was shown to act as a neuroprotective agent by inducing hypothermia. === Psychiatry === Pramipexole has been evaluated for the treatment of sexual dysfunction experienced by some users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. It has shown effects on pilot studies in a placebo-controlled proof of concept study in bipolar disorder. It is also being investigated for the treatment of clinical depression, including neuroinflammatory subtypes via NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. === Other indications === Pramipexole is under clinical trials for the treatment of fibromyalgia, essential tremor, primary orthostatic tremor ('shaky leg syndrome'), persistent genital arousal disorder. == Derivatives == Derivatives of Pramipexole include CJ-998, CJ-1037, CJ-1638, CJ-1639, D-264, D-440, and D-512. == Explanatory notes == == References ==",Mirapex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.6491513785440475e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002087136817863211)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/mirapex.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Mirapex: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/mirapex.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4091,"('Amethopterin', 'Ledertrexate', '(+/-)amethopterin', 'Amethopterin (r,s)', 'Methotrexate (hydrate)')",Medical,"Methotrexate, formerly known as amethopterin, is a chemotherapy agent and immune-system suppressant. It is used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and ectopic pregnancies. Types of cancers it is used for include breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, and osteosarcoma. Types of autoimmune diseases it is used for include psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. It can be given by mouth or by injection. Common side effects include nausea, feeling tired, fever, increased risk of infection, low white blood cell counts, and breakdown of the skin inside the mouth. Other side effects may include liver disease, lung disease, lymphoma, and severe skin rashes. People on long-term treatment should be regularly checked for side effects. It is not safe during breastfeeding. In those with kidney problems, lower doses may be needed. It acts by blocking the body's use of folic acid. Methotrexate was first made in 1947 and initially was used to treat cancer, as it was less toxic than the then-current treatments. In 1956 it provided the first cures of a metastatic cancer. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Methotrexate is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 132nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Chemotherapy === Methotrexate was originally developed and continues to be used for chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with other agents. It is effective for the treatment of several cancers, including solid tumours of breast, head and neck, lung, bladder, as well as acute lymphocytic leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and choriocarcinoma and other trophoblastic neoplasms. It is also used in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). === Autoimmune disorders === Although originally designed as a chemotherapy drug, in lower doses methotrexate is a generally safe and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Methotrexate is used as a disease-modifying treatment for several autoimmune diseases in adults, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, myositis, systemic sclerosis, lupus, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, and many forms of vasculitis. In children, it can be used for juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, uveitis and localised scleroderma. Methotrexate is one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Weekly doses of 5 to 25mg were found by a Cochrane review to be beneficial for 12–52 weeks duration of therapy, though it is used longer-term in clinical practice. Discontinuation rates are as high as 16% due to adverse effects. Use of low doses of methotrexate together with NSAIDs such as aspirin or analgesics such as paracetamol is relatively safe in people being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, with appropriate monitoring. Methotrexate is also sometimes used in combination with other conventional DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Studies and reviews have found that most rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving methotrexate, with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug. Those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate have been found to have a lower risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Results of a systematic review exploring the comparative effectiveness of treatments of early rheumatoid arthritis show that treatment efficacy can be improved with combination therapy with anti-TNF or other biologic medications, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Likewise, a 2016 study found the use of methotrexate, in combination with anti-TNF agents, is effective for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Methotrexate has also been used for multiple sclerosis and is used occasionally in systemic lupus erythematosus, with tentative evidence to support such use. === Atopic dermatitis === Along with other immunosuppressants, methotrexate is used to treat severe atopic dermatitis (eczema). === During pregnancy === Methotrexate is an abortifacient and is used to treat ectopic pregnancies, provided the fallopian tube has not ruptured. Methotrexate with dilation and curettage is used to treat molar pregnancy. Rarely, it is used in combination with misoprostol to abort intrauterine pregnancies. === Administration === Methotrexate can be given by mouth or by injection (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intrathecal). Doses are usually taken weekly, not daily, to limit toxicity. Routine monitoring of the complete blood count, liver function tests, and creatinine are recommended. Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every two months. Folic acid is commonly co-prescribed with methotrexate to minimise the risk of adverse effects. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, stomatitis, blood abnormalities (leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia), increased risk of infection, hair loss, nausea, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, acute pneumonitis and renal impairment. Methotrexate can also cause mucositis. Methotrexate pneumonitis is a rare complication of therapy and appears to be reducing in frequency in most recent rheumatoid arthritis treatment trials. In the context of rheumatoid arthritis interstitial lung disease, methotrexate treatment may be associated with a lower incidence of ILD over time. Methotrexate is teratogenic and it is advised to stop taking it at least 4 weeks before becoming pregnant and it should be avoided during pregnancy (pregnancy category X) and while breastfeeding. Guidelines have been updated to state that it is safe for a male partner to take at any point while trying to conceive. Central nervous system reactions to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), which include myelopathies and leukoencephalopathies. It has a variety of cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses. Another little-understood but serious possible adverse effect of methotrexate is neurological damage and memory loss. Neurotoxicity may result from the drug crossing the blood–brain barrier and damaging neurons in the cerebral cortex. People with cancer who receive the medication often nickname these effects ""chemo brain"" or ""chemo fog"". === Drug interactions === Penicillins may decrease the elimination of methotrexate and increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides neomycin and paromomycin have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like cyclosporins may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene. === Vaccine interactions === Taking methotrexate can reduce the effectiveness of vaccinations against various diseases, such as influenza and hepatitis A. It does this by blunting the immune response of the body to the vaccine. Methotrexate also dampens the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines, making them less effective. Pausing methotrexate for two weeks following COVID-19 vaccination may result in improved immunity. Not taking the medicine for two weeks might result in a minor increase of inflammatory disease flares in some people. == Mechanism of action == Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of dihydrofolate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for de-novo purine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins. For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not thought to be the main mechanism, but rather multiple mechanisms appear to be involved, including the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, leading to accumulation of adenosine; inhibition of T cell activation and suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule expression by T cells; selective down-regulation of B cells; increasing CD95 sensitivity of activated T cells; and inhibition of methyltransferase activity, leading to deactivation of enzyme activity relevant to immune system function. Another mechanism of MTX is the inhibition of the binding of interleukin 1-beta to its cell surface receptor. Thereby, it acts as anticytokine. == History == In 1947, a team of researchers led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukaemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate. In 1951, Jane C. Wright demonstrated the use of methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer. Wright's group was the first to demonstrate use of the drug in solid tumors, as opposed to leukemias, which are a cancer of the marrow. Min Chiu Li and his collaborators then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, and in 1960 Wright et al. produced remissions in mycosis fungoides. == References == == External links == Methotrexate Injection MedlinePlus article from NIH",Ledertrexate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00471586873754859), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0020248640794306993)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03804149478673935), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/ledertrexate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='LEDERTREXATE - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/ledertrexate?utm_source=openai')])"
4092,"('Hexitol', 'Hexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol', 'Hexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexaol', 'Mannitol;mannite', 'Sorbitol;d-glucitol')","Food, Medical","Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and medication. It is used as a low calorie sweetener as it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease pressure in the eyes, as in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection or inhalation. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours. Common side effects from medical use include electrolyte problems and dehydration. Other serious side effects may include worsening heart failure and kidney problems. It is unclear if use is safe in pregnancy. Mannitol is in the osmotic diuretic family of medications and works by pulling fluid from the brain and eyes. The discovery of mannitol is attributed to Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna due to its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food. Mannitol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list due to concerns that it may mask prohibited drugs. == Uses == === Medical uses === In the United States, mannitol is indicated for the reduction of intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intraocular pressure. In the European Union, mannitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to best standard of care. Mannitol is used intravenously to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma. While mannitol injection is the mainstay for treating high pressure in the skull after a bad brain injury, it is no better than hypertonic saline as a first-line treatment. In treatment-resistant cases, hypertonic saline works better. Intra-arterial infusions of mannitol can transiently open the blood–brain barrier by disrupting tight junctions. It may also be used for certain cases of kidney failure with low urine output, decreasing pressure in the eye, to increase the elimination of certain toxins, and to treat fluid build up. Intraoperative mannitol prior to vessel clamp release during renal transplant has been shown to reduce post-transplant kidney injury, but has not been shown to reduce graft rejection. Mannitol acts as an osmotic laxative in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children. The use of mannitol, when inhaled, as a bronchial irritant as an alternative method of diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma has been proposed. A 2013 systematic review concluded evidence to support its use for this purpose at this time is insufficient. Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage. Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an artificial pacemaker) while it passes through the venous system. Because the mannitol dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point becomes exposed at its destination. Mannitol is also the first drug of choice to treat acute glaucoma in veterinary medicine. It is administered as a 20% solution intravenously. It dehydrates the vitreous humor and, therefore, lowers the intraocular pressure. However, it requires an intact blood-ocular barrier to work. === Food === Mannitol increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets. === Analytical chemistry === Mannitol can be used to form a complex with boric acid. This increases the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid. === Other === Mannitol is the primary ingredient of mannitol salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others. Mannitol is used as a cutting agent in various drugs that are used intranasally (snorted), such as heroin and cocaine. A mixture of mannitol and fentanyl (or fentanyl analogs) in ratio 1:10 is labeled and sold as ""China white"", a popular heroin substitute. Mannitol is a sugar alcohol with ""50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea."" == Contraindications == Mannitol is contraindicated in people with anuria, severe hypovolemia, pre-existing severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy. Adverse effects include hyponatremia and volume depletion leading to metabolic acidosis. == Chemistry == Mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. == Production == Mannitol is classified as a sugar alcohol; that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol. === Industrial synthesis === Mannitol is commonly produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, the transformation of starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields. === Biosyntheses === Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields 200 g (7.1 oz) mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities. === Natural extraction === Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction – 141.7 g (5.00 oz) CO2 versus 194.4 g (6.86 oz) ethanol per 1 g (0.035 oz) olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only 4.01 g (0.141 oz) water per 1 g (0.035 oz) of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique. == History == In the early 1880s, Julije Domac elucidated the structure of hexene and mannitol obtained from Caspian manna. He determined the place of the double bond in hexene obtained from mannitol and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved the structure of mannitol, which was unknown until then. == Controversy == The three studies that originally found high-dose mannitol effective in treating severe head injury were the subject of an investigation. Published in 2007 after the lead author Dr Julio Cruz's death, the investigation questioned whether the studies had actually taken place. The co-authors of the paper were not able to confirm the existence of the study patients, and the Federal University of São Paulo, which Cruz gave as his affiliation, had never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only four studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol has not been reached. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Mannitol at Wikimedia Commons",Hexitol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.016374045982956886), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.00025228000595234334), (',', -0.47431132197380066), (' INDUSTR', -0.012587585486471653), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.21656747162342072), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -1.6569954823353328e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0005788319394923747), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20167352259159088)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.011047814972698689), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.3868749439716339), (' INDUSTR', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/hexitol, https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/H/Hexitol.html, https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/784996-HEXITOL/ ', [])"

Perospirone hydrochloride (perospirone), which was identified as a novel serotonin-dopamine antagonist (SDA)-type antipsychotic agent in 1987 by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, possesses high affinities both for dopamine 5-HT2 and D2 receptors. Perospirone, like conventional antipsychotics, significantly inhibited various behaviors induced by dopaminergic hyperactivation. Perospirone also produced a significant improvement in animal models of the negative symptoms and mood disorders, where the conventional antipsychotics were unaffected. In addition, perospirone was weaker than the conventional antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol) in inducing EPS signs (e.g., catalepsy and bradykinesia), suggesting that the drug has an atypical antipsychotic property. A recent double-blind study with schizophrenia patients demonstrated that perospirone was comparative with haloperidol in improving the positive symptoms, but was significantly superior to haloperidol against the negative symptoms. Furthermore, the extrapyramidal score in patients with perospirone treatment was lower that those with haloperidol treatment. These findings suggested that perospirone acts as an antagonist both for 5-HT2 and D2 receptors and has broader clinical efficacy and lower EPS liability than haloperidol in schizophrenia treatment. A 32-year-old man with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with circulatory collapse and deep coma after 9 days of treatment with perospirone hydrochloride, a recently developed atypical antipsychotic agent available only in Japan. The new drug had been added to the long-standing treatment with risperidone. Diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, he was given insulin and saline with discontinuation of all antipsychotics. Ultimately, diabetes was controlled by dietary therapy alone despite reintroduction of risperidone. The risk of new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with diabetic risk factors who are taking perospirone hydrochloride or other atypical antipsychotics should be kept in mind. A 36-year-old female, in whom 8 mg perospirone hydrochloride tablets had been prescribed, took 178 tablets (corresponding to 1,424 mg) as a single dose. After 4.5 hours, she was admitted under a diagnosis of acute drug intoxication. We investigated her clinical course and medical records including the laboratory data, and measured serial changes in the serum levels of perospirone hydrochloride and prolactin by HPLC and ELISA. Concerning the clinical course, the consciousness level on admission was JCS II-10, but normalized 18 hours after dosing. Thereafter, there were no intoxication symptoms or sequelae related to massive administration of this agent, and the patient was discharged 3 days after admission. There were no abnormalities in the laboratory data obtained on admission and 2 days after admission. The serum levels of perospirone hydrochloride were 695 ng/mL 4.5 hours after dosing and approximately 60 ng/mL 18 hours after dosing, when consciousness became clear. The t1/2 beta value was 8 hours, similar to that in healthy adults.

These chains organize in two different types of broad layers of opposite handedness, related by a glide plane. The enthalpies of micellization of the surfactant series benzyl(2-acylaminoethyl)dimethylammonium chlorides, RABzMe(2)Cl, have been determined by calorimetry and conductivity measurements in the temperature range 15-75 degrees C. Here R stands for an acyl group containing 10-16 carbon atoms and A, Bz, and Me stand for NH(CH(2))(2)N(+), benzyl, and methyl groups, respectively. The enthalpy of micellization, DeltaH(mic) degrees , and the critical micelle concentration, cmc, were calculated directly from calorimetric data. The free energy of micellization, DeltaG(mic) degrees , was obtained from the cmc and the conductance-based degree of counterion dissociation. There is an excellent agreement between DeltaG(mic) degrees calculated from the data of both techniques, but the DeltaH(mic) degrees , the entropy of micellization, values differ. The dependence of the thermodynamic parameters of micellization on the chain length of the hydrophobic group and on the temperature has been analyzed by considering the delicate balance between the factors that contribute to micelle formation, including transfer of the surfactant hydrocarbon chain from the aqueous environment to the micelle, with concomitant release of the solvating water molecules, and the effect of temperature on the structure of water. DeltaG(mic) degrees is more negative, that is, more favorable for RABzMe(2)Cl than for the structurally related alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides. This is attributed to direct and water-mediated H bonding between the amide groups of molecules of the former series. The interaction between multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and aqueous poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) was studied by X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and photoacoustic Fourier transform infrared (PA-FTIR) spectroscopies. We have found that the mild sonication of MWCNTs in aqueous PDDA results in a significant improvement of CNT dispersibility and greatly enhances their adhesion to Au and Si substrates. The MWCNT-PDDA interaction is due to the presence of an unsaturated contaminant in the PDDA chain, as confirmed by both XPS and PA-FTIR, which enters into a pi-pi interaction with the CNTs. Electrostatic group repulsions of the coated CNTs then provide the dispersibility and adhesion.",(2-benzoyloxy-2-methylbutyl)dimethylammonium chloride,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.018151817843317986)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.576080858707428), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048847224563360214)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB8879431.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=115, start_index=6, title='(2-benzoyloxy-2-methylbutyl)dimethylammonium chloride | 532-59-2', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB8879431.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a highly potent butyrophenone derivative and is the most potent neuroleptic in the European market, with chlorpromazine equivalency as high as 75 to 100 (about 150 to 200% the potency per dose of haloperidol). It is sometimes prescribed to sex offenders as a condition of their parole, as an alternative to anti-androgen drugs such as cyproterone acetate. Benperidol was discovered by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961 and has been marketed since 1966. It is mainly used in Germany, but it is also available in Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Benperidol is a strong dopamine receptor antagonist (D2 (Ki 0.027 nM) and D4 (Ki 0.066 nM)) with weaker serotonin receptor antagonism (5-HT2A (Ki 3.75 nM)). In high doses, it has antihistaminergic and alpha-adrenergic properties. It possesses minimal anticholinergic properties. What benperidol though being developed relatively early in the history of antipsychotics is sharing (with just viewing the raw nanomolar-affinityvalues of each respective typical and also atypical antipsychotic) a unique and clearly potent selectivity of the human D2 receptor over all other human dopaminreceptors (also considered to have the greatest range of its selectivity of dopaminereceptors over the 5HT2A-serotoninereceptors, but topped from the neuroleptics Ami- and Sulpiride here), since dopaminreceptors beside the centrally viewed abilitys for schizophrenic diseases namely human cognition, emotions, motorcontroll, also playing central roles in unconscious biological mechanisms, so the erose of focusing on D2 receptorblockade, also stemmed from its considered central functioning in the above mentioned human abilities accounting brainregions (striatal- and frontalregions for example) in respective.

4099,"('Once-daily ondansetron',)",Medical," We investigated the pharmacokinetic profile and the efficacy of ondansetron (day 1) given as 16 mg suppository once a day, as compared with ondansetron 8 mg tablets twice daily, in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The study was primarily aimed at investigating the pharmacokinetics and was part of a large multinational, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy efficacy trial. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in a total of 20 patients, 11 of whom had received a suppository containing ondansetron, and nine patients had received the oral formulation. The median area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) obtained with the oral formulation was 226 ng ml-1h-1 (range 91-750), and the median maximum plasma level (Cmax) was 50.5 ng ml-1 (range 24.7-199.6) after a dose of 8 mg. For the ondansetron suppository the median AUC was 140 ng ml-1h-1 range (77-405) and the median Cmax was 17.1 ng ml-1 (range 13-48.3) after a dose of 16 mg. The systemic exposure after correction for the dose difference after the suppository was on average 70% lower than after the tablet. The median time to reach the maximum level (Tmax) was 60 min (range 28-120) with the oral formulation and 209 min (range 90-420) with the suppository. For both the tablet and suppository, there was no apparent relationship between either Cmax or AUC, and efficacy. Although the patient numbers were too small for a formal exposure-response relationship to be derived, the slightly poorer pharmacokinetic performance of the suppository did not appear to be associated with a lessening of control of emesis following chemotherapy. The study demonstrates that the pharmacokinetic analysis of a once-daily 16 mg ondansetron suppository results in appropriate plasma concentrations and AUC, and that this rectal formulation is effective in the protection against nausea and vomiting associated with cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. This formulation will provide a useful alternative to the currently available oral formulation. We examined the anti-emetic effect, safety and usefulness of ondansetron hydrochloride, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, given orally once daily at the dosage of 4 mg, for 3 to 5 consecutive days to patients with nausea and emesis induced by non-platinum anti-cancer drugs such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and carboplatin. Out of 84 cases where anti-emetic effects were evaluated, numbers of cases assessed as excellent and good were 36 (83.3%) and 34 (40.5%), respectively, the efficacy rate being 83.3% (70/84). Side effects, such as moderate constipation (3 cases) and mild headache (3 cases), were observed in 8/85 cases (9.4%). Abnormalities in clinical laboratory findings including elevation of hepatic function and uricacid values and increase in eosinocyte counts, were observed in 3/85 cases (3.5%). As to overall safety, 78/85 cases (91.8%) were evaluated as having no problem in safety, and 7/85 cases (8.2%), as having minor problem in safety. As to clinical usefulness based on anti-emetic effect and overall safety, out of 79 cases the drug was assessed as very useful in 29 cases (36.7%) and useful in 35 cases (44.3%), the rate of ""useful"" or above being 81.0% (64/79). Furthermore, when ondansetron was administered in 3 courses of chemotherapy, though the number of patients was small, it was shown that anti-emetic effect of ondansetron did not decline and no problem in safety was observed. From the above, ondansetron which exerted adequate anti-emetic effect in 4 mg once daily doses was considered as a useful and safe anti-emetic in treatment of nausea and emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy. Previous, small studies have suggested that ondansetron has beneficial effects in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). This randomized, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily 12 mg RHB-102, an investigational bimodal release ondansetron tablet, in IBS-D. Men and women with IBS-D by the Rome III criteria, Bristol Stool Scale ≥6 on 2 or more days weekly, and average daily worst pain intensity ≥3/10 were randomized 60:40 to RHB-102 or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. The primary end point was overall stool consistency response for at least 4 of 8 weeks. Secondary end points included overall worst abdominal pain and overall composite response, defined as response on both abdominal pain and stool consistency end points. Overall stool consistency response rates were 56.0% and 35.3% (RHB-102 vs placebo, P = 0.036) and similar among male and female patients. Overall pain response (50.7% vs 39.2%) and composite response rates (40.0% vs 25.5%) favored RHB-102, although these differences were not statistically significant. Stool consistency response rates were enhanced in patients with baseline C-reactive protein above the median (2.09 mg/L), 59.5%, vs 23.1% (P = 0.009). Overall rates of adverse events were similar, with a higher rate of constipation in RHB-102 patients (13.3% vs 3.9%) that resolved rapidly on withholding treatment. RHB-102 was effective and safe in the treatment of men and women with IBS-D.

4100,"('Zofran', 'Ondemet', 'Emeset', 'Ondansetron (hydrochloride)', 'Ondansetronhydrochloride')",Medical,"Ondansetron, sold under the brand name Zofran among others, is a medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, migraines, or surgery. It is also effective for treating gastroenteritis. It can be given orally (by mouth), intramuscularly (injection into a muscle), or intravenously (injection into a vein). Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, sleepiness, and itchiness. Serious side effects include QT prolongation and severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe during pregnancy but has not been well studied in this group. It is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and therefore does not cause akathisia. Ondansetron was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 61st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ondansetron is indicated for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and postoperative nausea and vomiting. === Pregnancy === Ondansetron is used off-label to treat morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarum of pregnancy. It is typically used after other antiemetic drugs have failed. A large multi-center cohort study found no association between ondansetron exposure and fetal risk compared to other antiemetics. === Cyclic vomiting syndrome === Ondansetron is one of several antiemetics used during the vomiting phase of cyclic vomiting syndrome. === Gastroenteritis === Trials in emergency department settings support the use of ondansetron to abort vomiting episodes associated with gastroenteritis and dehydration. A randomized controlled trial using a single dose of oral ondansetron in children with presumably viral gastroenteritis found it to be highly effective in stopping vomiting and increasing the effectiveness of oral rehydration therapy, thereby significantly increasing patient satisfaction. Only 16 of the 123 children treated with ondansetron vomited in the following 6 hours. A retrospective review found that ondansetron was used commonly for vomiting due to gastroenteritis, being administered in over 58% of cases. Its use reduced hospital admissions, but was also associated with higher rates of return visits to the emergency department. Furthermore, people who had initially received ondansetron were more likely to be admitted on the return visit than people who had not received the drug. However, this effect may simply be due to the agent being used more frequently in people who present with more severe illness. Its use was not found to mask serious diagnoses. === Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) === In a study of patients diagnosed as having IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), ondansetron showed statistically significant effects on stool consistency, frequency, urgency and bloating, but not on pain scores. This was confirmed in a later trial and meta-analysis and is included in international guidelines. == Special populations == === Children === Ondansetron has rarely been studied in people under 4 years of age. As such, little data is available to guide dosage recommendations. Three open non-comparative studies have been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of ondansetron in children receiving a variety of chemotherapy regimens. Ondansetron was well tolerated and none of the patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. == Adverse effects == Headache is the most common adverse effect. A review of use for post-operative nausea and vomiting found that for every 36 people treated, one would experience headache, which could be severe. Constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness are other commonly reported side effects. It is broken down by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. === QT prolongation === Use of ondansetron has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to a potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any person with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in people taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in people with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16 mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24 mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. People are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron. === Overdose === No specific treatment is available for ondansetron overdose; people are managed with supportive measures. An antidote to ondansetron is not known. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ondansetron is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema in the medulla. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors. The R– and S–ondansetron isomers have similar potency as serotonin antagonists when tested on ex vivo rat vagus nerve. However, the R–ondansetron enantiomer was 7.9 times more potent as an antagonist of serotonin and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methylserotonin) when tested on the longitudinal smooth muscle from guinea pig ileum. However, the guinea pig ileum test was likely not as faithful as a test of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism, because ondansetron only partially blocked the effect of serotonin, while it completely blocked the effect of 2-methylserotonin. === Pharmacokinetics === Ondansetron may have a degree of peripheral selectivity due to binding to P-glycoprotein and efflux out of the brain at the blood–brain barrier. Ondansetron is marketed as a racemic mixture of R–(–)–ondansetron and S–(+)–ondansetron, and the two enantiomers have significantly different kinetics. In rats given 2 mg/kg intravenous doses of each enantiomer separately, R–(–)–ondansetron was found to have a 37% longer half-life (P < 0.05) and an 87% higher area-under-curve or AUC (P < 0.01) compared to S–(+)–ondansetron, indicating that the R enantiomer is metabolized more slowly. The chiral carbon in ondansetron is adjacent to a carbonyl group, so keto-enol tautomerism could theoretically lead to interconversion between the two enantiomers under physiologic conditions, if the hydrogen on the chiral carbon were removed and then replaced with opposite chirality. An experiment in rats given each enantiomer separately showed no evidence of this interconversion, the chirality was stable in vivo. A study of 141 human patients given 4 or 8 mg of intravenous ondansetron for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting also found that R and S–ondansetron have different pharmacokinetic properties. Each patient was classified according to their genotype for the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, and they were put on a spectrum between poor metabolizers (slow) and ultra metabolizers (fast). CYP2D6 was found to be more important for the elimination of S–ondansetron, whereas CYP3A5 genotype had no impact on S–ondansetron plasma levels, measured 3 hours after drug administration. CYP3A5 was more important for R–ondansetron clearance, and CYP2D6 genotype had no consistent effect on plasma levels of R–ondansetron at 3 hours. == History == Ondansetron (marketed under the brand name Zofran) was developed in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted U.S. patent protection in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 1991. It was granted another divisional patent in November 1996. Finally, owing to GlaxoSmithKline's research on pediatric use, ondansetron's patent protection was extended until December 2006. By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US). The first generic versions were approved by the U.S. FDA in December 2006, with marketing approval granted to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and SICOR Pharmaceuticals. In December 2012, the FDA announced that the 32 mg, single intravenous (IV) dose of ondansetron was being withdrawn from U.S. market because of the potential for serious cardiac issues from prolonged QT interval. In 2018, University of São Paulo and Biolab were granted a patent for an orodispersible form of the drug. == Society and culture == === Publication bias === In 1997, ondansetron was the subject of a meta-analysis case study. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 people receiving ondansetron, published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous ondansetron 4 mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vomiting within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron's antiemetic efficacy. In addition, the authors found the covert duplication of reports on ondansetron was not easy to detect, because of lack of cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug. Their analysis was a subject of an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999. === Availability === Ondansetron is a generic medication and is available in many countries under many brand names. == Research == Ondansetron may be useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting that can sometimes be induced by certain serotonergic psychedelics. == References ==",Emeset,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012263881508260965), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015670888824388385)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0031777136027812958), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Its use was not found to mask serious diagnoses. === Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) === In a study of patients diagnosed as having IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), ondansetron showed statistically significant effects on stool consistency, frequency, urgency and bloating, but not on pain scores. This was confirmed in a later trial and meta-analysis and is included in international guidelines. == Special populations == === Children === Ondansetron has rarely been studied in people under 4 years of age. As such, little data is available to guide dosage recommendations. Three open non-comparative studies have been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of ondansetron in children receiving a variety of chemotherapy regimens. Ondansetron was well tolerated and none of the patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. == Adverse effects == Headache is the most common adverse effect. A review of use for post-operative nausea and vomiting found that for every 36 people treated, one would experience headache, which could be severe. Constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness are other commonly reported side effects. It is broken down by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. === QT prolongation === Use of ondansetron has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to a potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Although this may happen in any person with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in people taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in people with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16 mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24 mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. People are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron. === Overdose === No specific treatment is available for ondansetron overdose; people are managed with supportive measures. An antidote to ondansetron is not known. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ondansetron is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema in the medulla. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors. The R– and S–ondansetron isomers have similar potency as serotonin antagonists when tested on ex vivo rat vagus nerve. However, the R–ondansetron enantiomer was 7.9 times more potent as an antagonist of serotonin and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methylserotonin) when tested on the longitudinal smooth muscle from guinea pig ileum. However, the guinea pig ileum test was likely not as faithful as a test of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism, because ondansetron only partially blocked the effect of serotonin, while it completely blocked the effect of 2-methylserotonin. === Pharmacokinetics === Ondansetron may have a degree of peripheral selectivity due to binding to P-glycoprotein and efflux out of the brain at the blood–brain barrier. Ondansetron is marketed as a racemic mixture of R–(–)–ondansetron and S–(+)–ondansetron, and the two enantiomers have significantly different kinetics. In rats given 2 mg/kg intravenous doses of each enantiomer separately, R–(–)–ondansetron was found to have a 37% longer half-life (P < 0.05) and an 87% higher area-under-curve or AUC (P < 0.01) compared to S–(+)–ondansetron, indicating that the R enantiomer is metabolized more slowly. The chiral carbon in ondansetron is adjacent to a carbonyl group, so keto-enol tautomerism could theoretically lead to interconversion between the two enantiomers under physiologic conditions, if the hydrogen on the chiral carbon were removed and then replaced with opposite chirality. An experiment in rats given each enantiomer separately showed no evidence of this interconversion, the chirality was stable in vivo. A study of 141 human patients given 4 or 8 mg of intravenous ondansetron for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting also found that R and S–ondansetron have different pharmacokinetic properties. Each patient was classified according to their genotype for the liver enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A5, and they were put on a spectrum between poor metabolizers (slow) and ultra metabolizers (fast). CYP2D6 was found to be more important for the elimination of S–ondansetron, whereas CYP3A5 genotype had no impact on S–ondansetron plasma levels, measured 3 hours after drug administration. CYP3A5 was more important for R–ondansetron clearance, and CYP2D6 genotype had no consistent effect on plasma levels of R–ondansetron at 3 hours. == History == Ondansetron (marketed under the brand name Zofran) was developed in the mid-1980s by GlaxoSmithKline in London. It was granted U.S. patent protection in September 1987, received a use patent June 1988, and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 1991. It was granted another divisional patent in November 1996. Finally, owing to GlaxoSmithKline's research on pediatric use, ondansetron's patent protection was extended until December 2006. By this final year of its patent (2006), Zofran had become the 20th highest-selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales of US$1.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2006 (80% from the US). The first generic versions were approved by the U.S. FDA in December 2006, with marketing approval granted to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and SICOR Pharmaceuticals. In December 2012, the FDA announced that the 32 mg, single intravenous (IV) dose of ondansetron was being withdrawn from U.S. market because of the potential for serious cardiac issues from prolonged QT interval. In 2018, University of São Paulo and Biolab were granted a patent for an orodispersible form of the drug. == Society and culture == === Publication bias === In 1997, ondansetron was the subject of a meta-analysis case study. Researchers examined 84 trials, with 11,980 people receiving ondansetron, published between 1991 and September 1996. Intravenous ondansetron 4 mg versus placebo was investigated in 16 reports and three further reports which had been duplicated a total of six times. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent vomiting within 24 hours was 9.5, with 95% confidence interval 6.9 to 15, in the 16 nonduplicated reports. In the three duplicated reports, the NNT was significantly lower at 3.9 (3.3 to 4.8). When all 25 reports were combined, the apparent NNT improved to 4.9 (4.4 to 5.6). Inclusion of duplicate reports led to a 23% overestimation of ondansetron's antiemetic efficacy. In addition, the authors found the covert duplication of reports on ondansetron was not easy to detect, because of lack of cross-referencing between papers, and reports containing duplicate findings were cited in eight reviews of the drug. Their analysis was a subject of an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1999. === Availability === Ondansetron is a generic medication and is available in many countries under many brand names. == Research == Ondansetron may be useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting that can sometimes be induced by certain serotonergic psychedelics. == References ==",Ondansetron,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.245195097813848e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010227633902104571)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondansetron,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601209.html,https://www.drugs.com/ondansetron.html ', [])"
4102,"('L-tartaric acid', 'Tartaric acid', 'Ltartaric acid', '(2r,3r)-2,3-dihydroxysuccinic acid', '(2r,3r)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid')","Food, Medical","Tartaric acid is a white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many fruits, most notably in grapes but also in tamarinds, bananas, avocados, and citrus. Its salt, potassium bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar, develops naturally in the process of fermentation. Potassium bitartrate is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant E334 and to impart its distinctive sour taste. Naturally occurring tartaric acid is a useful raw material in organic synthesis. Tartaric acid, an alpha-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, is diprotic and aldaric in acid characteristics and is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid. == History == Tartaric acid has been known to winemakers for centuries. However, the chemical process for extraction was developed in 1769 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Tartaric acid played an important role in the discovery of chemical chirality. This property of tartaric acid was first observed in 1832 by Jean Baptiste Biot, who observed its ability to rotate polarized light. Louis Pasteur continued this research in 1847 by investigating the shapes of sodium ammonium tartrate crystals, which he found to be chiral. By manually sorting the differently shaped crystals, Pasteur was the first to produce a pure sample of levotartaric acid. == Stereochemistry == Naturally occurring form of the acid is dextro tartaric acid or L-(+)-tartaric acid (obsolete name d-tartaric acid). Because it is available naturally, it is cheaper than its enantiomer and the meso isomer. The dextro and levo prefixes are archaic terms. Modern textbooks refer to the natural form as (2R,3R)-tartaric acid (L-(+)-tartaric acid), and its enantiomer as (2S,3S)-tartaric acid (D-(−)-tartaric acid). The meso diastereomer is referred to as (2R,3S)-tartaric acid or (2S,3R)-tartaric acid. Dextro and levo form monoclinic sphenoidal crystals and orthorhombic crystals. Racemic tartaric acid forms monoclinic and triclinic crystals (space group P1). Anhydrous meso tartaric acid form two anhydrous polymorphs: triclinic and orthorhombic. Monohydrated meso tartaric acid crystallizes as monoclinic and triclinic polymorphys depending on the temperature at which crystallization from aqueous solution occurs. Tartaric acid in Fehling's solution binds to copper(II) ions, preventing the formation of insoluble hydroxide salts. == Production == === L-(+)-Tartaric acid === The L-(+)-tartaric acid isomer of tartaric acid is industrially produced in the largest amounts. It is obtained from lees, a solid byproduct of fermentations. The former byproducts mostly consist of potassium bitartrate (KHC4H4O6). This potassium salt is converted to calcium tartrate (CaC4H4O6) upon treatment with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2): KH(C4H4O6) + Ca(OH)2 → Ca(C4H4O6) + KOH + H2O In practice, higher yields of calcium tartrate are obtained with the addition of calcium sulfate. Calcium tartrate is then converted to tartaric acid by treating the salt with aqueous sulfuric acid: Ca(C4H4O6) + H2SO4 → H2(C4H4O6) + CaSO4 === Racemic tartaric acid === Racemic tartaric acid can be prepared in a multistep reaction from maleic acid. In the first step, the maleic acid is epoxidized by hydrogen peroxide using potassium tungstate as a catalyst. HO2CCH=CHCO2H + H2O2 → HO2C(CHCH)(O)CO2H + H2O In the next step, the epoxide is hydrolyzed. HO2C(CHCH)(O)CO2H + H2O → HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H === meso-Tartaric acid === A mixture of racemic acid and meso-tartaric acid is formed when dextro-Tartaric acid is heated in water at 165 °C for about 2 days. meso-Tartaric acid can also be prepared from dibromosuccinic acid using silver hydroxide: HO2CCHBrCHBrCO2H + 2 AgOH → HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + 2 AgBr meso-Tartaric acid can be separated from residual racemic acid by crystallization, the racemate being less soluble. == Reactivity == L-(+)-tartaric acid, can participate in several reactions. As shown the reaction scheme below, dihydroxymaleic acid is produced upon treatment of L-(+)-tartaric acid with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a ferrous salt. HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + H2O2 → HO2CC(OH)C(OH)CO2H + 2 H2O Dihydroxymaleic acid can then be oxidized to tartronic acid with nitric acid. == Derivatives == Important derivatives of tartaric acid include: Sodium ammonium tartrate, the first material separated into its enantiomers cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), used in cooking Rochelle salt (potassium sodium tartrate), which has unusual piezoelectric properties tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate), a resolving agent. Diisopropyl tartrate is used as a co-catalyst in asymmetric synthesis. Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death. The median lethal dose (LD50) is about 7.5 grams/kg for a human, 5.3 grams/kg for rabbits, and 4.4 grams/kg for mice. Given this figure, it would take over 500 g (18 oz) to kill a person weighing 70 kg (150 lb) with 50% probability, so it may be safely included in many foods, especially sour-tasting sweets. As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334; tartrates are other additives serving as antioxidants or emulsifiers. When cream of tartar is added to water, a suspension results which serves to clean copper coins very well, as the tartrate solution can dissolve the layer of copper(II) oxide present on the surface of the coin. The resulting copper(II)-tartrate complex is easily soluble in water. == Tartaric acid in wine == Tartaric acid may be most immediately recognizable to wine drinkers as the source of ""wine diamonds"", the small potassium bitartrate crystals that sometimes form spontaneously on the cork or bottom of the bottle. These ""tartrates"" are harmless, despite sometimes being mistaken for broken glass, and are prevented in many wines through cold stabilization (which is not always preferred since it can change the wine's profile). The tartrates remaining on the inside of aging barrels were at one time a major industrial source of potassium bitartrate. Tartaric acid plays an important role chemically, lowering the pH of fermenting ""must"" to a level where many undesirable spoilage bacteria cannot live, and acting as a preservative after fermentation. In the mouth, tartaric acid provides some of the tartness in the wine, although citric and malic acids also play a role. == Tartaric acid in fruits == Grapes and tamarinds have the highest levels of tartaric acid concentration. Other fruits with tartaric acid are bananas, avocados, prickly pear fruit, apples, cherries, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, strawberries, mangoes and citrus fruits. Trace amounts of tartaric acid have been found in cranberries and other berries. Tartaric acid is also present in the leaves and pods of Pelargonium plants and beans. == Applications == Tartaric acid and its derivatives have a plethora of uses in the field of pharmaceuticals. For example, it has been used in the production of effervescent salts, in combination with citric acid, to improve the taste of oral medications. The potassium antimonyl derivative of the acid known as tartar emetic is included, in small doses, in cough syrup as an expectorant. Tartaric acid also has several applications for industrial use. The acid has been observed to chelate metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. Therefore, the acid has served in the farming and metal industries as a chelating agent for complexing micronutrients in soil fertilizer and for cleaning metal surfaces consisting of aluminium, copper, iron, and alloys of these metals, respectively. == Toxicity in canines == While tartaric acid is well-tolerated by humans and lab animals, an April 2021 letter to the editor of JAVMA hypothesized that the tartaric acid in grapes could be the cause of grape and raisin toxicity in dogs. Other studies have observed tartaric acid toxicity in kidney cells of dogs, but not in human kidney cells. In dogs, the tartaric acid of tamarind causes acute kidney injury, which can often be fatal. A review identified a relationship between grape ingestion and illness, though the specific type or quantity of grapes that cause toxicity remains unclear. Grape ingestion commonly leads to gastrointestinal and/or renal issues, with treatment depending on the symptoms; outcomes can vary. == References == == External links == PDB file for MSE Archived 2018-09-20 at the Wayback Machine",Tartaric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.00019328886992298067), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0005532711511477828), (' INDUSTR', -0.030178658664226532), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.25217321515083313), (' PERSONAL', -0.5760278105735779), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.5762313008308411), (' MED', -0.0010401944164186716), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0014040146488696337), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.023271769285202026), ('ĠINDU', -0.008103705942630768), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20146985352039337)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.06196802109479904), (' INDUSTR', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartaric_acid ', [])"
4103,"('Epinephrine bitartrate', 'Adrenaline bitartrate', 'Epinephrine acid tartrate', 'Epinephrine (bitartrate)', 'Adrenaline tartrate')","Endogenous, Medical","Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a medication and hormone. As a medication, it is used to treat several conditions, including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, asthma, and superficial bleeding. Inhaled epinephrine may be used to improve the symptoms of croup. It may also be used for asthma when other treatments are not effective. It is given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, by inhalation, or by injection just under the skin. Common side effects include shakiness, anxiety, and sweating. A fast heart rate and high blood pressure may occur. Occasionally, it may result in an abnormal heart rhythm. While the safety of its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear, the benefits to the mother must be taken into account. Epinephrine is normally produced by both the adrenal glands and a small number of neurons in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter. It plays an essential role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, heart output, pupil dilation, and blood sugar. Epinephrine does this through its effects on alpha and beta receptors. It is found in many animals and some single-celled organisms, but the medication is produced synthetically and is not harvested from animals. Jōkichi Takamine first isolated epinephrine in 1901, and it came into medical use in 1905. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 240th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Etymology == The word epinephrine is formed from the Ancient Greek ἐπι- (epi-, ""on"") and νεφρός (nephros, ""kidney"") because the adrenal glands, where it is produced, are located just above the kidneys. == Medical uses == Epinephrine is used to treat a number of conditions, including cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, and superficial bleeding. It has been used historically for bronchospasm and low blood sugar, but newer treatments for these that are selective for β2 adrenoceptors, such as salbutamol, are preferred. === Heart problems === While epinephrine is often used to treat cardiac arrest, it has not been shown to improve long-term survival or mental function after recovery. It does, however, improve return of spontaneous circulation. === Anaphylaxis === Epinephrine is the only life-saving treatment for anaphylaxis. The commonly used epinephrine autoinjector delivers a 0.3 mg epinephrine injection (0.3 mL, 1:1000). It is indicated in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis to stings, contrast agents, medicines, or people with a history of anaphylactic reactions to known triggers. A lower-strength product is available for children. Intramuscular injection can be complicated in that the depth of subcutaneous fat varies and may result in subcutaneous injection, or may be injected intravenously in error, or the wrong strength used. Intramuscular injection gives a faster and higher pharmacokinetic profile compared to subcutaneous injection. In August 2024, an epinephrine nasal spray (brand name Neffy) was approved in the United States for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (type I), including those that are life-threatening (anaphylaxis), in people who weigh at least 30 kilograms (66 lb). It is the first nasal spray for the treatment of anaphylaxis approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In March 2025, the FDA expanded the indication of Neffy to include children aged four years of age and older who weigh 15 to 30 kilograms (33 to 66 lb). The approval of epinephrine nasal spray is based on four studies in 175 healthy adults, without anaphylaxis, that measured the epinephrine concentrations in the blood following administration of epinephrine nasal spray or approved epinephrine injection products. Results from these studies showed comparable epinephrine blood concentrations between epinephrine nasal spray and approved epinephrine injection products. Epinephrine nasal spray also demonstrated similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate as epinephrine injection products, two critical effects of epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis. A study of epinephrine nasal spray in children weighing more than 66 pounds showed that epinephrine concentrations in children were similar to adults who received epinephrine nasal spray. The most common side effects of epinephrine nasal spray include throat irritation, tingling nose (intranasal paresthesia), headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, tingling sensation (paresthesia), fatigue, tremor, runny nose (rhinorrhea), itchiness inside the nose (nasal pruritus), sneezing, abdominal pain, gum (gingival) pain, numbness in the mouth (hypoesthesia oral), nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The FDA granted the application of epinephrine nasal spray fast track designation and granted the approval of Neffy to ARS Pharmaceuticals. === Asthma === Epinephrine is also used as a bronchodilator for asthma if specific β2 agonists are unavailable or ineffective. Because of the high intrinsic efficacy (receptor binding ability) of epinephrine, high drug concentrations cause adverse side effects when treating asthma. The value of using nebulized epinephrine in acute asthma is unclear. === Croup === Racemic epinephrine has been used for the treatment of croup. Racemic adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers of adrenaline. The L-form is the active component. Racemic adrenaline works by stimulating the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulating the β adrenergic receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle. === Bronchiolitis === There is a lack of consensus as to whether inhaled nebulized epinephrine is beneficial in the treatment of bronchiolitis, with most guidelines recommending against its use. === Local anesthetics === When epinephrine is mixed with local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine or lidocaine, and used for local anesthesia or intrathecal injection, it prolongs the numbing effect and motor block effect of the anesthetic by up to an hour. Epinephrine is frequently combined with local anesthetic and can cause panic attacks. Epinephrine is mixed with cocaine to form Moffett's solution, used in nasal surgery. === Upper airway obstruction === Upper airway obstruction with edema and stridor can be treated with racemic epinephrine. == Adverse effects == Adverse reactions to adrenaline include palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmia, anxiety, panic attack, headache, anorexia, tremor, hypertension, and acute pulmonary edema. The use of epinephrine based eye-drops, commonly used to treat glaucoma, may also lead to a buildup of adrenochrome pigments in the conjunctiva, iris, lens, and retina. Rarely, exposure to medically administered epinephrine may cause Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Use is contraindicated in people on nonselective β-blockers because severe hypertension and even cerebral hemorrhage may result. The most common side effects of epinephrine nasal spray include throat irritation, tingling nose (intranasal paresthesia), headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, tingling sensation (paresthesia), fatigue, tremor, runny nose (rhinorrhea), itchiness inside the nose (nasal pruritus), sneezing, abdominal pain, gum (gingival) pain, numbness in the mouth (hypoesthesia oral), nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The FDA granted the application of epinephrine nasal spray fast track designation and granted the approval of Neffy to ARS Pharmaceuticals. == Mechanism of action == Epinephrine acts by binding to a variety of adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3. Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers several metabolic changes. Binding to α-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle, and stimulates glycolysis and inhibits insulin-mediated glycogenesis in muscle. β adrenergic receptor binding triggers glucagon secretion in the pancreas, increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland, and increased lipolysis by adipose tissue. Together, these effects increase blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body. In the heart, the coronary arteries have a predominance of β2 receptors, which cause vasodilation of the coronary arteries in the presence of epinephrine. Its actions increase peripheral resistance via α1 receptor-dependent vasoconstriction and increase cardiac output via its binding to β1 receptors. The goal of reducing peripheral circulation is to increase coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures and therefore increase oxygen exchange at the cellular level. While epinephrine does increase aortic, cerebral, and carotid circulation pressure, it lowers carotid blood flow and end-tidal CO2 or ETCO2 levels. It appears that epinephrine may improve macrocirculation at the expense of the capillary beds where perfusion takes place. == Chemistry == Epinephrine, or adrenaline, also known as 3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and catecholamine. It is the N-methylated analogue of norepinephrine (noradrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine) and the N-methylated and β-hydroxylated analogue of dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine). == History == Extracts of the adrenal gland were first obtained by Polish physiologist Napoleon Cybulski in 1895. These extracts, which he called nadnerczyna, contained adrenaline and other catecholamines. American ophthalmologist William H. Bates discovered adrenaline's usage for eye surgeries prior to 20 April 1896. Japanese chemist Jōkichi Takamine and his assistant Keizo Uenaka independently discovered adrenaline in 1900. In 1901, Takamine successfully isolated and purified the hormone from the adrenal glands of sheep and oxen. Adrenaline was first synthesized in the laboratory by Friedrich Stolz and Henry Drysdale Dakin, independently, in 1904. == Society and culture == === Names === === Brand names === Epinephrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, while adrenaline is its BANTooltip British Approved Name. Epinephrine is sold under various brand names including Asthmanefrin, Micronefrin, Neffy, Nephron, VapoNefrin, and Primatene Mist, among others. === Legal status === In June 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Eurneffy, intended for emergency treatment of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) due to insect stings or bites, foods, medicinal products, and other allergens as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The applicant for this medicinal product is ARS Pharmaceuticals IRL Limited. Eurneffy was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2024. === Delivery forms === Epinephrine is available in an autoinjector delivery system and a nasal spray. There is an epinephrine metered-dose inhaler sold over the counter in the United States to relieve bronchial asthma. It was introduced in 1963 by Armstrong Pharmaceuticals. A common concentration for epinephrine is 2.25% w/v epinephrine in solution, which contains 22.5 mg/mL, while a 1% solution is typically used for aerosolization. == References ==",Epinephrine bitartrate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.03808292746543884), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' END', -1.3856492842023727e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.682846287731081e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0006467396160587668), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -1.7404405298293568e-05), ('ĠEND', -6.639736966462806e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00037555795279331505)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07888989895582199), (' END', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB3108435.htm,https://www.drugs.com/monograph/epinephrine-bitartrate-epinephrine-hydrochloride-epinephryl-borate-mydriatic-eent.html,https://go.drugbank.com/salts/DBSALT000788 ', [])"

The free base is the most efficient plasticiser of the three species for Eudragit RL and Eudragit RS, but with limited solubility in the polymers. Due to its hydrophobicity, it can interact with the hydrophobic polymer backbones. In contrast, in salt containing films, ionic interactions between the positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and the negatively charged tartrate anions apparently occur, this being suggested by the different effects on Eudragit RL versus RS, which have different contents of quaternary ammonium groups. Importantly, the combination of acid and base as a salt avoids drug precipitation at higher metoprolol contents. The obtained new insight into the occurring drug-polymer interactions can help to facilitate the development/optimisation of this type of dosage forms. The use of L-(+)-tartaric acid as a chiral mobile phase additive (CMPA) has been investigated in a packed-column SFC system. The CMPA, carbon dioxide, and methanol, containing a high concentration of aliphatic amine additive, were used as the mobile phase and Hypercarb as support [Gyllenhaal O., Karlsson A., SFC of metoprolol and other amino alcohols on Hypercarb (in preparation)]. Good enantioselectivities were obtained for tertiary amine homologues of 2-amino alcohols, used as beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs. Moderate selectivities were observed for aromatic compounds having a second substituent in the ortho-position. The overall retention was influenced by the aromaticity of the analytes as well as the presence of free electron pairs in the molecule. Increased concentrations of CMPA gave higher retention and also increased the enantioselectivity. The practical utility of this present enantioselective system was demonstrated on one batch of (S)-metoprolol that was N-methylated with methyl iodide. The enantiomeric separation was accomplished within 10 min.",Metoprolol tartaric acid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03804321587085724), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.009818119928240776), ('ICAL', -4.887569048150908e-06), (',', -0.2521311938762665), ('ĠINDU', -0.12515492737293243), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008925186470150948)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlibrary.org](https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/metoprolol-tartrate-73/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=105, start_index=9, title='METOPROLOL TARTRATE (Youngtech Pharmaceuticals, Inc.): FDA Package Insert', type='url_citation', url='https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/metoprolol-tartrate-73/?utm_source=openai')])"
4105,"('Tartaric acid', '(2s,3s)-2,3-dihydroxysuccinic acid', 'Dtartaric acid', '(2s,3s)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid', 'Threaric acid')","Food, Medical","Tartaric acid is a white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many fruits, most notably in grapes but also in tamarinds, bananas, avocados, and citrus. Its salt, potassium bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar, develops naturally in the process of fermentation. Potassium bitartrate is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant E334 and to impart its distinctive sour taste. Naturally occurring tartaric acid is a useful raw material in organic synthesis. Tartaric acid, an alpha-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, is diprotic and aldaric in acid characteristics and is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid. == History == Tartaric acid has been known to winemakers for centuries. However, the chemical process for extraction was developed in 1769 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Tartaric acid played an important role in the discovery of chemical chirality. This property of tartaric acid was first observed in 1832 by Jean Baptiste Biot, who observed its ability to rotate polarized light. Louis Pasteur continued this research in 1847 by investigating the shapes of sodium ammonium tartrate crystals, which he found to be chiral. By manually sorting the differently shaped crystals, Pasteur was the first to produce a pure sample of levotartaric acid. == Stereochemistry == Naturally occurring form of the acid is dextro tartaric acid or L-(+)-tartaric acid (obsolete name d-tartaric acid). Because it is available naturally, it is cheaper than its enantiomer and the meso isomer. The dextro and levo prefixes are archaic terms. Modern textbooks refer to the natural form as (2R,3R)-tartaric acid (L-(+)-tartaric acid), and its enantiomer as (2S,3S)-tartaric acid (D-(−)-tartaric acid). The meso diastereomer is referred to as (2R,3S)-tartaric acid or (2S,3R)-tartaric acid. Dextro and levo form monoclinic sphenoidal crystals and orthorhombic crystals. Racemic tartaric acid forms monoclinic and triclinic crystals (space group P1). Anhydrous meso tartaric acid form two anhydrous polymorphs: triclinic and orthorhombic. Monohydrated meso tartaric acid crystallizes as monoclinic and triclinic polymorphys depending on the temperature at which crystallization from aqueous solution occurs. Tartaric acid in Fehling's solution binds to copper(II) ions, preventing the formation of insoluble hydroxide salts. == Production == === L-(+)-Tartaric acid === The L-(+)-tartaric acid isomer of tartaric acid is industrially produced in the largest amounts. It is obtained from lees, a solid byproduct of fermentations. The former byproducts mostly consist of potassium bitartrate (KHC4H4O6). This potassium salt is converted to calcium tartrate (CaC4H4O6) upon treatment with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2): KH(C4H4O6) + Ca(OH)2 → Ca(C4H4O6) + KOH + H2O In practice, higher yields of calcium tartrate are obtained with the addition of calcium sulfate. Calcium tartrate is then converted to tartaric acid by treating the salt with aqueous sulfuric acid: Ca(C4H4O6) + H2SO4 → H2(C4H4O6) + CaSO4 === Racemic tartaric acid === Racemic tartaric acid can be prepared in a multistep reaction from maleic acid. In the first step, the maleic acid is epoxidized by hydrogen peroxide using potassium tungstate as a catalyst. HO2CCH=CHCO2H + H2O2 → HO2C(CHCH)(O)CO2H + H2O In the next step, the epoxide is hydrolyzed. HO2C(CHCH)(O)CO2H + H2O → HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H === meso-Tartaric acid === A mixture of racemic acid and meso-tartaric acid is formed when dextro-Tartaric acid is heated in water at 165 °C for about 2 days. meso-Tartaric acid can also be prepared from dibromosuccinic acid using silver hydroxide: HO2CCHBrCHBrCO2H + 2 AgOH → HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + 2 AgBr meso-Tartaric acid can be separated from residual racemic acid by crystallization, the racemate being less soluble. == Reactivity == L-(+)-tartaric acid, can participate in several reactions. As shown the reaction scheme below, dihydroxymaleic acid is produced upon treatment of L-(+)-tartaric acid with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a ferrous salt. HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + H2O2 → HO2CC(OH)C(OH)CO2H + 2 H2O Dihydroxymaleic acid can then be oxidized to tartronic acid with nitric acid. == Derivatives == Important derivatives of tartaric acid include: Sodium ammonium tartrate, the first material separated into its enantiomers cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), used in cooking Rochelle salt (potassium sodium tartrate), which has unusual piezoelectric properties tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate), a resolving agent. Diisopropyl tartrate is used as a co-catalyst in asymmetric synthesis. Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death. The median lethal dose (LD50) is about 7.5 grams/kg for a human, 5.3 grams/kg for rabbits, and 4.4 grams/kg for mice. Given this figure, it would take over 500 g (18 oz) to kill a person weighing 70 kg (150 lb) with 50% probability, so it may be safely included in many foods, especially sour-tasting sweets. As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334; tartrates are other additives serving as antioxidants or emulsifiers. When cream of tartar is added to water, a suspension results which serves to clean copper coins very well, as the tartrate solution can dissolve the layer of copper(II) oxide present on the surface of the coin. The resulting copper(II)-tartrate complex is easily soluble in water. == Tartaric acid in wine == Tartaric acid may be most immediately recognizable to wine drinkers as the source of ""wine diamonds"", the small potassium bitartrate crystals that sometimes form spontaneously on the cork or bottom of the bottle. These ""tartrates"" are harmless, despite sometimes being mistaken for broken glass, and are prevented in many wines through cold stabilization (which is not always preferred since it can change the wine's profile). The tartrates remaining on the inside of aging barrels were at one time a major industrial source of potassium bitartrate. Tartaric acid plays an important role chemically, lowering the pH of fermenting ""must"" to a level where many undesirable spoilage bacteria cannot live, and acting as a preservative after fermentation. In the mouth, tartaric acid provides some of the tartness in the wine, although citric and malic acids also play a role. == Tartaric acid in fruits == Grapes and tamarinds have the highest levels of tartaric acid concentration. Other fruits with tartaric acid are bananas, avocados, prickly pear fruit, apples, cherries, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, strawberries, mangoes and citrus fruits. Trace amounts of tartaric acid have been found in cranberries and other berries. Tartaric acid is also present in the leaves and pods of Pelargonium plants and beans. == Applications == Tartaric acid and its derivatives have a plethora of uses in the field of pharmaceuticals. For example, it has been used in the production of effervescent salts, in combination with citric acid, to improve the taste of oral medications. The potassium antimonyl derivative of the acid known as tartar emetic is included, in small doses, in cough syrup as an expectorant. Tartaric acid also has several applications for industrial use. The acid has been observed to chelate metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. Therefore, the acid has served in the farming and metal industries as a chelating agent for complexing micronutrients in soil fertilizer and for cleaning metal surfaces consisting of aluminium, copper, iron, and alloys of these metals, respectively. == Toxicity in canines == While tartaric acid is well-tolerated by humans and lab animals, an April 2021 letter to the editor of JAVMA hypothesized that the tartaric acid in grapes could be the cause of grape and raisin toxicity in dogs. Other studies have observed tartaric acid toxicity in kidney cells of dogs, but not in human kidney cells. In dogs, the tartaric acid of tamarind causes acute kidney injury, which can often be fatal. A review identified a relationship between grape ingestion and illness, though the specific type or quantity of grapes that cause toxicity remains unclear. Grape ingestion commonly leads to gastrointestinal and/or renal issues, with treatment depending on the symptoms; outcomes can vary. == References == == External links == PDB file for MSE Archived 2018-09-20 at the Wayback Machine",Threaric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.00814548134803772), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0067170290276408195), (' INDUSTR', -0.03554220497608185), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.3135910630226135), (' PERSONAL', -0.3155076503753662), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.31355342268943787), (' MED', -0.0134318508207798), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0065159243531525135), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.018186485394835472), ('ĠINDU', -0.020761199295520782), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -8.940656698541716e-06), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133672773838043)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([silverfernchemical.com](https://www.silverfernchemical.com/products/tartaric-acid/?utm_source=openai), [uk.typology.com](https://uk.typology.com/library/profile-tartaric-acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=217, start_index=21, title='', type='url_citation', url='https://www.silverfernchemical.com/products/tartaric-acid/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=217, start_index=21, title='Tartaric Acid: Origin, Properties and Use.', type='url_citation', url='https://uk.typology.com/library/profile-tartaric-acid?utm_source=openai')])"

4108,"('Minocycline hcl', 'Arestin', 'Minomycin', 'Minocin', 'Solodyn')",Medical,"Minocycline, sold under the brand name Minocin among others, is a tetracycline antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections such as some occurring in certain forms of pneumonia. It is generally (but not always) less preferred than the tetracycline doxycycline. Minocycline is also used for the treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, allergic reactions, and kidney problems. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, a lupus-like syndrome, and easy sunburning. Use in the later part of pregnancy may harm the baby and safety during breastfeeding is unclear. It works by decreasing a bacterium's ability to make protein thus stopping its growth. Minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 269th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Acne === Minocycline and doxycycline are frequently used for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Minocycline is specifically indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in people nine years of age and older. Both minocycline and doxycycline have similar levels of effectiveness and common adverse effects for acne, although doxycycline may have a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. Both oral/systemic and more recently topical formulations of minocycline are available to treat acne. Historically, oral minocycline has been an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, acne that is caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. In Europe and North America, a number of people with acne no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily Cutibacterium acnes) that are resistant to these antibiotics. In order to reduce resistance rates as well as increase the effectiveness of treatment, oral antibiotics should be generally combined with topical acne creams such as benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid (tretinoin, adapalene, etc.). There have also been concerns about systemic minocycline having a variety of rare adverse effects in terms of its use to treat acne. Oral minocycline is used to treat acne for up to 3 to 4 months. Data beyond 3 to 4 months are limited. === Other infections === Minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although minocycline's broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against Neisseria meningitidis, its use for prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo). It may be used to treat certain strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and a disease caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. A list of uses includes: Amoebic dysentery Anthrax Bubonic plague Cholera Ehrlichiosis Gonorrhea (when penicillin cannot be given) Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome (confluent and reticulated papillomatosis) Hidradenitis suppurativa For use as an adjuvant to HAART Leprosy Periodontal disease Perioral dermatitis Respiratory infections such as pneumonia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Rosacea Syphilis (when penicillin cannot be given) Urinary tract infections (UTIs), rectal infections, and infections of the cervix caused by certain microbes Minocycline has been reported to be effective in the eradication of UTIs and prostatitis. A 2013 Cochrane review identified and included two comparative clinical trials of minocycline for chronic bacterial prostatitis. For this condition, minocycline has been found to be equivalent or superior to doxycycline, equivalent to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and superior to the first-generation cephalosporin cephalexin. It was also equivalent to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum. Treatment durations of minocycline for chronic bacterial prostatitis have ranged from 2 to 4 weeks. === Other uses === Both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune-suppressing effects. Minocycline and doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline. === Available forms === Minocycline is available in the form of 50 and 100 mg oral capsules, among a variety of other formulations. The oral form of minocycline is usually taken twice daily, once every 12 hours, although divided doses four times daily can also be employed. Extended-release oral forms are also available. A topical formulation is available as well. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics, as there is complete cross sensitivity in this group. It is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment and after the 16th week of pregnancy. == Side effects == Minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, migraines, and vomiting. It increases sensitivity to sunlight, and may affect the quality of sleep and rarely causes sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline can lead to blue-gray staining of skin, fingernails, and scar tissue. This staining is not permanent, but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; however, a muddy brown skin color in sun-exposed areas is usually permanent. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization. Occasionally, minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug-related lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, which usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline-induced lupus; however, women are more likely to develop minocycline-induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline-induced autoimmune problems within a period of a few weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy, but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances, including symptoms of dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, and tinnitus. These effects are thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. The vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, reportedly occurring in 50 to 70% of women receiving minocycline. However, other sources state that vestibular side effects occur in only 1 to 10% of patients. In any case, other studies have found that side effects occur more frequently in women than in men (~58% vs. 34%, respectively). Due to its vestibular side effects, minocycline has been said to be rarely used in female patients. Minocycline's vestibular side effects typically resolve after discontinuation of the drug. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage if not recognized early and treated. Contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis. Minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension, which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. Brain swelling and rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects of minocycline in some people. Minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date. While most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. Expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline. Minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly. Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep. A 2007 study suggested that minocycline harms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. The effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses. Other possible rare side effects of minocycline include hyperpigmentation and hypersensitivity reactions, among others. It has been associated with more rare and serious adverse effects than other tetracyclines. Some of the rare adverse effects of minocycline may result in death. This has spurred interest in topical instead of systemic minocycline for treatment of acne. Minocycine has shown thyroid toxicity in animals, including in rodents, mini pigs, dogs, and monkeys. The use of minocycline to treat acne has been associated with skin and gut dysbiosis (see antibiotic misuse). == Overdose == Symptoms of minocycline overdose may include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. There is no specific antidote for overdose of minocycline and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. The drug is not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == Interactions == The combination of minocycline with dairy, antacids, calcium and magnesium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants may decrease minocycline's effectiveness by forming chelates. Combining it with isotretinoin, acitretin or other retinoids can increase the risk for intracranial hypertension. Minocycline significantly reduces concentrations of the anti-HIV drug atazanavir in the body. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antibiotic activity ==== Minocycline mediates its antibiotic activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. It is primarily bacteriostatic. The drug is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and shows activity against a wide range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. ==== Other activities ==== Minocycline shows a number of off-target activities in addition to its antibiotic activity. These include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), anti-inflammatory effects, antiapoptotic effects, antioxidant effects, and neuroprotective effects. Some other reported activities of minocycline include: PARP1 inhibition Ki = 13.8 nM Neuroprotection IC50 = 10 nM Microglia full inhibition = 20 nM Suppression of the mouse's locomotor activity = 0.5 mg/kg Indirect inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Minocycline is quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. Taking it together with food, including milk, has no relevant influence on resorption. It reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 1 to 2 hours. ==== Distribution ==== The drug has a plasma protein binding of 70 to 75%. It penetrates into almost all tissues; very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder and liver. It crosses the blood–brain barrier better than doxycycline and other tetracyclines, reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and also in inflamed meninges. Minocycline achieves good concentrations in the urinary bladder, and many other tissues. It shows excellent penetration into the prostate gland. However, while permeation of prostate tissue and semen is good, levels are lower in prosatic fluid. ==== Metabolism ==== Minocycline is inactivated by metabolism in the liver to about 50%. It is primarily metabolized into 9-hydroxyminocycline. Two N-demethylated metabolites are also formed. ==== Elimination ==== The rest is predominantly excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels) and eliminated via the feces. About 10–15% are eliminated via the kidneys. It is excreted about 5 to 10% unchanged in urine. For comparison, other tetracyclines, like doxycycline and tetracycline, are excreted 30 to 70% unchanged in urine. The biological half-life of minocycline is 11 to 26 hours in healthy people, up to 30 hours in those with kidney failure, and significantly longer in those with liver disease. == Chemistry == Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative. It is closely structurally related to other tetracyclic antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and tigecycline. The drug is used in form of minocycline hydrochloride dihydrate, which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Minocycline reacts acidic in aqueous solution. The partition coefficient (P) of minocycline has been reported to be 39.4 (i.e., log P of 1.60). However, other sources have stated the experimental log P of minocycline to be 0.05, 0.5, and 1.1. In any case, minocycline is consistently described as a highly lipophilic compound with excellent tissue penetration and distribution. It has been said to be unique among the tetracyclines in that it is the most lipophilic of all of the members of this group. Minocycline has 10 to 30 times greater lipophilicity than tetracycline and 5 times greater lipophilicity than doxycycline. The improved lipophilicity of minocycline is thought to be advantageous in terms of its clinical antibiotic effectiveness. == History == Minocycline was patented in 1961, was first described in the scientific literature in 1967, and came into commercial use in 1971. A topical foam for treatment of acne was approved in 2019. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Minomycin Minostad (in Europe, for the treatment of acne) Akamin Minocin Minoderm Cyclimycin Arestin (1-mg doses administered locally into periodontal pockets, after scaling and root planing, for treatment of periodontal disease.) Aknemin Solodyn (extended-release, for the treatment of acne) Dynacin Sebomin Mino-Tabs Acnamino Minopen (in Japan) Maracyn 2 (for treatment of bacterial infections in aquarium fish and amphibians) Quatrocin (in Syria) Minox (in Ireland) Minoz (in India and Romania) Divaine (in India) Vinocyclin 100 (100-mg dose approved for treatment of acne in Vietnam) Dentomycin (2% minocylcine gel for use in periodontal pockets) Amzeeq (4% foam, approved for treatment of acne United States) Zilxi (1.5% foam, approved for treatment of rosacea in the United States) Cleeravue-M === Generic availability === It is available as a generic medication. == Research == === Neuropsychiatric disorders === ==== Depression ==== Minocycline has been studied in the treatment of depression. According to a 2023 systematic review of minocycline for treatment-resistant depression based on four clinical trials, ""There is no significant difference with minocycline compared to placebo for depression not responding to first-line antidepressant therapy."" Likewise, a 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found that minocycline was not significantly more effective than placebo in treating depression. Minocycline might have some benefit in treatment-resistant depression with inflammation however. Yet another meta-analysis, also published in 2023, found that minocycline was effective in the treatment of depression, including treatment-resistant depression, with a small to moderate effect size. ==== Schizophrenia ==== Early research has found a tentative benefit from minocycline in schizophrenia, with several trials underway as of 2012. A 2014 meta-analysis found minocycline may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated. A 2019 meta-analysis, which included 13 randomized controlled trials, found that minocycline was effective in the treatment of the positive, negative, and general symptoms of schizophrenia, with small to moderate effect sizes. Similarly, a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials found that minocycline was effective in treating the total, negative, and general symptoms of schizophrenia but not the positive or cognitive symptoms, again with small to moderate effect sizes. ==== Other conditions ==== Some early studies suggest that minocycline may be beneficial as an add-on treatment for moderate-to-severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when used with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). === Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases === In ongoing research and trial, minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seems a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients, especially in AIS subgroup. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline among ICH patients. Research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As mentioned above, minocycline harms ALS patients. A trial found no difference between minocycline and placebo in people with Alzheimers' disease. Minocycline is somewhat neuroprotective in mouse models of Huntington's disease. === Multiple sclerosis === A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS. === Delirium === A 2024 randomized controlled trial found that prophylactic minocycline provided a small but significant decrease in delirium incidence in critically ill patients. Unexpectedly, there was also a significant decrease in hospital mortality with minocycline prophylaxis. The mortality benefits of minocycline might have simply been due to its bactericidal effects. === Hearing protection === Several preclinical studies (in vitro cell cultures and animal models) suggest that minocycline may have otoprotective benefits. Animal models indicate it could potentially reduce noise-induced and blast-induced hearing loss, possibly by protecting hair cells and mitigating inflammation. In vitro and animal studies also show minocycline may help decrease ototoxicity from certain drugs like gentamicin, neomycin, and cisplatin. === Other uses === Minocycline also has been used as a ""last-ditch"" treatment for toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Minocycline has been suggested as a possible treatment for post-COVID-19 syndrome (""long COVID""), but no quality clinical trials exist. The same is true of minocycline as a potential treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). == References ==",Solodyn,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000309657771140337), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004112240858376026)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/solodyn.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Solodyn: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/solodyn.html?utm_source=openai')])"

4110,"('Pizotifen malate', 'Pizotyline malate', 'Pizotifen (malate)', 'Pizotifen hydrogen malate', 'Sanomtgran')",Medical," Targeted therapy attempts are needed to enhance esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients' overall survival and satisfaction of life. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), as a high-confidence cancer driver gene, controls the antioxidant response, metabolic balance and redox homeostasis in cancer and is regarded as a potent molecular target for cancer treatment. Here, we attempted to find a new NRF2 inhibitor and study the underlying molecular mechanism in ESCC. We found that up-regulated NRF2 protein was negatively correlated with patient prognosis and promoted tumor proliferation in ESCC. Moreover, Pizotifen malate (PZM), a FDA-approved medication, bound to the Neh1 domain of NRF2 and prevented NRF2 protein binding to the ARE motif of target genes, suppressing transcription activity of NRF2. PZM treatment suppressed tumor development in ESCC PDX model by inducing ferroptosis via down-regulating the transcription of GPX4, GCLC, ME1 and G6PD. Our study illustrates that the over expression of NRF2 indicates poor prognosis and promotes tumor proliferation in ESCC. PZM, as a novel NRF2 inhibitor, inhibits the tumor growth by inducing ferroptosis and elucidates a potent NRF2-based therapy strategy for patients with ESCC. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a transdermal delivery system of pizotifen malate. Pizotifen is frequently used in the preventive treatment of migraine, but is also indicated in eating disorders. In the course of the project, the effects of chemical enhancers such as ethanol, 1,8-cineole, limonene, azone and different fatty acids (decanoic, decenoic, dodecanoic, linoleic and oleic acids) were determined, first using a pizotifen solution. Steady state flux, diffusion and partition parameters were estimated by fitting the Scheuplein equation to the data obtained. Among the chemical enhancers studied, decenoic acid showed the highest enhancement activity, which seemed to be due to the length of its alkyl chain and unsaturation at the 9th carbon. The influence of iontophoresis and the involvement of electrotransport in said process was determined. The absorption profile obtained with iontophoresis was similar to that obtained with fatty acids and terpenes, though skin deposition of the drug was lower with the former. Transdermal delivery systems (TDS) of pizotifen were manufactured by including chemical enhancers, decenoic acid or oleic acid, and were subsequently characterized. When the results obtained with solutions were compared with those obtained with the TDS, a positive enhancement effect was observed with the latter with respect to the partitioning and diffusion of the drug across the skin. Our findings endorse the suitability of our TDS for delivering therapeutic amounts of pizotifen malate. We analyzed the physicochemical characteristics of solid dispersions of pizotifen malate and povidone (Kollidon 12) at different proportions; we used X-ray diffraction, infrared spectrometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tested the solubility of the solid dispersions in equilibrium. The results were compared with findings for physical mixtures with the same proportions. A solid dispersion with a drug proportion of 16%-17% formed a eutectic mixture. Solubility of pizotifen malate increased with the proportion of drug in the solid dispersion up to a drug:polymer ratio of 40:60. The hydrotropic effect of the polymer also favored solubility: In physical mixtures, this effect was greatest at a drug:polymer ratio of 10:90; solubility at this proportion was equal to that of the solid dispersion at the same proportion.",Pizotifen malate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008393579046241939), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02983905002474785)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/salts/DBSALT003065?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Pizotifen malate | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/salts/DBSALT003065?utm_source=openai')])"
4111,"('Lormetazepam', 'Methyllorazepam', 'N-methyllorazepam', 'Noctamid', 'Loramet')",Medical,"Lormetazepam, sold under the brand name Noctamid among others, is a drug which is a short to intermediate acting 3-hydroxy benzodiazepine derivative and temazepam analogue. It possesses hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1980. Lormetazepam is not approved for sale in the United States or Canada. It is licensed in the UK as 0.5 and 1 mg tablets for short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of moderately severe insomnia. It is licensed in the Netherlands as 1 and 2 mg tablets, under the brand names Loramet and Noctamid and as generic, available from several manufacturers. It is sold in Poland as Noctofer. It is also sold in France as generic as 1 and 2mg tablets, with a maximum prescription duration of 4 weeks. A Dutch analysis stated that lormetazepam could be suitable to be included in drug prescribing formularies, although zolpidem, zopiclone, and temazepam appear better. == Medical uses == Lormetazepam is considered a hypnotic benzodiazepine and is officially indicated for moderate-to-severe insomnia. Lormetazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or falling asleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or, in those with chronic insomnia, on an occasional basis. == Side effects == Side effects of lormetazepam are similar to those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines and can for the most part be regarded as a class effect. In a sleep study, 1 mg lormetazepam increased total sleep time, reduced wakefulness, but did not alter REM sleep. However, at 2 mg doses, there were significant increases in stage 3 sleep and reductions in REM sleep. Rebound effects have been reported after chronic use including rebound REM. In one clinical trial with patients who had prior experience with older hypnotics temazepam and nitrazepam, most preferred lormetazepam due to less heavy sedation, amnesia, and residual effects. Some side effects, including drowsiness, amnesia, and respiratory depression, are increased when lormetazepam is combined with other drugs with similar effects, e.g. alcohol and nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Although lormetazepam has been associated with adversely affecting immediate and delayed recall memory functions, studies have shown that lormetazepam's amnesic properties may be lesser compared to other hypnotic benzodiazepines. For example, in a 1984 study comparing the amnesic effects of lormetazepam to temazepam and flurazepam showed that amnesia was smallest after lormetazepam and greatest after temazepam, which had produced greater amnesia than both lormetazepam and flurazepam by a significant margin. Side effects of lormetazepam include: Somnolence Paradoxical increase in aggression Lightheadedness Confusion Muscle weakness Ataxia (particularly in the elderly) Anterograde amnesia Headache Vertigo Hypotension Salivation changes Gastrointestinal disturbances Visual disturbances Dysarthria Tremor Changes in libido Urinary incontinence Urinary retention Blood disorders and jaundice Skin reactions Dependence and withdrawal reactions Residual ""hangover"" effects after nighttime administration of lormetazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Lormetazepam may be unsuitable for the elderly due to residual effects on memory and body sway which may result in falls. Lormetazepam causes impaired driving skills, thus caution is required in individuals who drive or operate machinery. === Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal === The risks of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal are very low when the drug is used for 2–4 weeks only, and lormetazepam is generally a safe and effective drug when used for no longer than 2–4 weeks. Some sleep disturbance in the form of rebound insomnia can, however, occur even after short-term usage of 7 days. Those with a history of addiction may be at increased risk of problems of tolerance and dependence especially those with a past history of dependency on sedative hypnotic drugs. Lormetazepam as with other benzodiazepines is generally only recommended for short-term use (2–4 weeks) due to tolerance and loss of efficacy. Tolerance to and loss of the sedative effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics can occur within 14 days of regular use. Some studies however suggest such treatments retain their effectiveness in the long term - such a lack of consistency in the findings of many studies could be due to the variation of responses to benzodiazepine treatment. Dependence is the medical term for addiction. Dependence can either be psychological and/or physical. Psychological dependence can manifest itself as a reliance on a drug to cope with everyday life or in the form of craving. Physical dependence occurs due to physiological adaptations occurring as the body attempts to overcome the drugs effects which is known as tolerance and the continuing need to take the drug to avoid or suppress withdrawal symptoms which can sometimes resemble the original condition being treated. When the dose or the drug is discontinued withdrawal symptoms typically occur. Lormetazepam as with all other benzodiazepines produces both physical and psychological dependence but the main problem of concern is physical dependence which appears in the form of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome after the dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped completely. The dependence induced by lormetazepam is related to changes in the sensitivity of the GABA-BZD receptor complex. Withdrawal symptoms typically subside after 4–8 weeks but in approximately 10-15% of individuals symptoms can persist for many months and in rare cases years. Some ""Withdrawal Symptoms"" can emerge despite a constant dosage with the body needing extra dosage in order to feel normal. This is sometimes associated with dosage escalation. Lormetazepam has a short to intermediate half-life of approximately 10–12 hours. Shorter acting benzodiazepine compounds are generally associated with a more intense and immediate withdrawal reaction compared to longer acting benzodiazepines. For this reason it is generally recommended to cross from lormetazepam to an equivalent dose of diazepam to gradually taper the dosage. == Pharmacology == The bioavailability of lormetazepam was found to be 80%. Lormetazepam and other benzodiazepine drugs act as positive modulators at the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complex. Lormetazepam binds to the benzodiazepine receptor which in turn enhances the effect of the GABAA receptor producing its therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects. When lormetazepam binds to the benzodiazepine receptor sites in sufficient quantities it produces sedation which is used clinically as a therapeutic treatment for insomnia. Lormetazepam alters the brain electrical activity which has been studied via EEG readings. Lormetazepam appears to be more selective in the type of benzodiazepine receptor it binds to showing a higher affinity for the omega 1 receptor which is responsible for sedation. Changes in EEG can therefore be used to measure the sedative sleep promoting properties of lormetazepam. == Chemistry == === Stereochemistry === Lormetazepam has a stereocenter and two enantiomers.

4113,"('Fluvastatin sodium salt', 'Lescol', 'Vastin', 'Canef', 'Fluvastatin (sodium)')",Medical,"Fluvastatin is a member of the statin drug class, used to treat hypercholesterolemia and to prevent cardiovascular disease. It was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are comparable to other statins. Common are nausea, indigestion, insomnia and headache. Myalgia (muscle pain), and rarely rhabdomyolysis, characteristic side effects for statins, can also occur. == Interactions == Contrary to lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin, fluvastatin has no relevant interactions with drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and a generally lower potential for interactions than most other statins. Fluconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, does increase fluvastatin levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Fluvastatin works by blocking the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which facilitates an important step in cholesterol synthesis. === Pharmacodynamics === In a Cochrane systematic review the dose-related magnitudes of fluvastatin on blood lipids was determined. Over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/day total cholesterol was reduced by 10.7% to 24.9%, LDL cholesterol by 15.2% to 34.9%, and triglycerides by 3% to 17.5%. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is quickly and almost completely (98%) absorbed from the gut. Food intake slows down absorption, but does not decrease it. Due to its first-pass effect, bioavailability is lower: about 24–30% according to different sources. Over 98% of the substance is bound to plasma proteins. Several cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP2C9, but also CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) are involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin, which makes is less liable to interactions than most other statins.

It is reported to be used in various over-the-counter cough and cold preparations throughout the world, including Japan. The drug is an ephedrine-like sympathomimetic and activates α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Chemically, it is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine. Methylephedrine was discovered by 1927. It is mostly no longer marketed as a prescription drug. The drug is also found naturally as an alkaloid in Ephedra species including Ephedra sinica, Ephedra vulgaris, and Ephedra distachya. == Side effects == Rarely, heart failure and stroke in association with use of methylephedrine have been reported. Methylephedrine shows reinforcing effects, a measure of addiction and misuse potential, in monkeys. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Methylephedrine is a sympathomimetic and ephedrine-like agent. Ephedrine and related agents act as norepinephrine releasing agents and hence as indirectly acting sympathomimetics. In relation to this, methylephedrine stimulates α- and β-adrenergic receptors. The drug has bronchodilator and nasal decongestant effects. The occupancy of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by racemic methylephedrine has been studied. === Pharmacokinetics === Methylephedrine is metabolized into ephedrine and norephedrine. It is excreted in urine 33 to 40% unchanged, 15% as methylephedrine N-oxide, and 8% as ephedrine after 24 hours. == Chemistry == Methylephedrine, also known as (1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-α-methyl-β-phenethylamine and as (1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is the N-methylated derivative of ephedrine ((1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine). A closely related compound and stereoisomer of methylephedrine is N-methylpseudoephedrine. Another related analogue is dimethylamphetamine (N,N-dimethylamphetamine), which is said to be a prodrug of methamphetamine and/or amphetamine. Other analogues include etafedrine (N-ethylephedrine) and cinnamedrine (N-cinnamylephedrine). The experimental log P of methylephedrine is 2.47 and its predicted log P ranges from 1.7 to 1.74. In organic chemistry, N-methylephedrine is used as a resolving agent and as a precursor to chiral supporting electrolytes, phase-transfer catalysts, and reducing agents. == History == Methylephedrine was discovered via isolation from Ephedra by 1927. == Society and culture == === Names === Methylephedrine is the generic name of the drug and its BANTooltip British Approved Name. In the case of the hydrochloride salt, its generic name is methylephedrine hydrochloride and this is its BANMTooltip British Approved Name. Brand names of methylephedrine include Metheph, Methy-F, and Tybraine, among others. === Recreational use === Similarly to ephedrine, methylephedrine may have misuse potential. The drug shows reinforcing effects in monkeys. It is one of the four constituents of BRON, a Japanese over-the-counter cough medicine with reports of misuse. However, addiction liability of BRON was attributed primarily to the codeine component.

C., Panini , S.R., Azran , F., and Rudney , H. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5687-5692). Treatment of cells with U18666A (5-50 ng/ml) caused a progressive inhibition of reductase activity. Further increases in the level of the drug paradoxically lessened the inhibition such that at a level of 1 microgram/ml, no inhibition of enzyme activity was observed. Cellular metabolism of squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide to compounds with the chromatographic properties of polar sterols led to an inhibition of reductase activity that could be prevented by U18666A (1 microgram/ml). The drug was unable to prevent the inhibition of enzyme activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonolactone, but totally abolished the inhibitory action of low density lipoproteins. Pretreatment with U18666A did not affect the ability of cells to degrade either the apoprotein or the cholesteryl ester component of low density lipoproteins. These results suggest that oxysterols derived from squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide may act as physiological regulators of reductase and raise the possibility that the suppressive action of low density lipoproteins on reductase may be partially or wholly mediated by such endogenous oxysterols generated through incomplete inhibition of the cyclase. Treatment of rat intestinal epithelial cell cultures with the oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitor, 3 beta-[2-(diethylamino)-ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A), resulted in an accumulation of squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide (SDO). When U18666A was withdrawn and the cells were treated with the sterol 14 alpha-demethylase inhibitor, ketoconazole, SDO was metabolized to a product identified as 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol. To test the biological effects and cellular metabolism of this compound, we prepared 24(RS),25-epoxylanosterol by chemical synthesis. The epimeric mixture of 24,25-epoxylanosterols could be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography on a wide-pore, non-endcapped, reverse phase column. Both epimers were effective suppressors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity of IEC-6 cells. The suppressive action of the natural epimer, 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol, but not that of 24(R),25-epoxylanosterol could be completely prevented by ketoconazole. IEC-6 cells could efficiently metabolize biosynthetic 24(S),25-epoxy[3H]anosterol mainly to the known reductase-suppressor 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. This metabolism was substantially reduced by ketoconazole. These data support the conclusion that 24(S),25-epoxylanosterol per se is not a suppressor of HMG-CoA reductase activity but is a precursor to a regulatory oxysterol(s). It has recently been reported that 25-hydroxycholesterol can occur naturally in cultured cells in amounts sufficient to effect regulation of HMG-CoA reductase (Saucier et al. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260: 14571-14579). In order to investigate the biological effects of possible precursors of 25-hydroxycholesterol, we chemically synthesized 25-hydroxylanosterol and 25-hydroxylanostene-3-one. Both oxylanosterol derivatives suppressed cellular sterol synthesis at the level of HMG-CoA reductase. U18666A had the unusual effect of potentiating the inhibitory effect of 25-hydroxylanostene-3-one but did not influence the effect of other oxylanosterols. All the oxylanosterols, with the exception of 25-hydroxylanostene-3-one, enhanced intracellular esterification of cholesterol. The foregoing observations support consideration of oxylanosterols as playing an important role in the biological formation of regulatory oxysterols that modulate sterol biosynthesis at the level of HMG-CoA reductase. Incubating Hep G2 cells for 18 h with triparanol, buthiobate and low concentrations (less than 0.5 microM) of U18666A, inhibitors of desmosterol delta 24-reductase, of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and of squalene-2,3-epoxide cyclase (EC 5.4.99.7) respectively, resulted in a decrease of the HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase activity. However, U18666A at concentrations higher than 3 microM increased the HMG-CoA reductase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. None of these inhibitors influenced directly the reductase activity in Hep G2 cell homogenates. Analysis by t.l.c. of 14C-labelled non-saponifiable lipids formed from either [14C]acetate or [14C]mevalonate during the cell incubations confirmed the sites of action of the drugs used. Beside the 14C-labelled substrates of the blocked enzymes and 14C-labelled cholesterol, another non-saponifiable lipid fraction was observed, which behaves as polar sterols on t.l.c. This was the case with triparanol and at those concentrations of U18666A that decreased the reductase activity, suggesting that polar sterols may play a role in suppressing the reductase activity. In the presence of 30 microM-U18666A (sterol formation blocked) the increase produced by simultaneously added compactin could be prevented by addition of mevalonate. This indicates the existence of a non-sterol mevalonate-derived effector in addition to a sterol-dependent regulation. LDL (low-density lipoprotein), which was shown to be able to decrease the compactin-induced increase in reductase activity, could not prevent the U18666A-induced increase. On the contrary, LDL enhanced the U18666A effect, showing that the LDL regulation is not merely the result of introducing cholesterol to the cells.","Androst-5-en-17-one, 3-hydroxy-",PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.010864000767469406)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.012637179344892502), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001947531825862825)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.6931495666503906), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasterone?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=192, start_index=20, title='Prasterone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasterone?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=192, start_index=20, title='Dehydroepiandrosterone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone?utm_source=openai')])"

4119,"('Ketanserin tartrate', 'Ketanserin (tartrate)', 'Ketanserin tartrate salt', 'Ketanserin tartarate', 'Ketanserin tartrate- bio-x')",Medical," In man ketanserin tartrate reduces plasma LDL cholesterol. To clarify the mechanism of this effect the effect of ketanserin on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase and LDL receptor activity in cultured human skin fibroblasts has been examined. After incubation with ketanserin for 14 h HMG CoA reductase activity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner up to 300 ng/ml (550 nM) without changing the free cholesterol content in the cells. Ketanserin increased specific binding and specific internalization of 125I-LDL dose-dependently. There was a significant inverse relationship between the percentage changes in HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor activity. It appears that ketanserin induces up-regulation of LDL receptor activity by direct suppression of HMG CoA reductase, and this may be one mechanism by which plasma LDL-cholesterol is reduced by ketanserin. Several antihypertensive agents such as thiazide diuretics and some beta-blockers have recently been shown to adversely affect lipid metabolism. Moreover, there is a growing suspicion that the adverse effect on plasma lipids might outweigh the favourable effect of lowering blood pressure. The effect of ketanserin tartrate (20 to 60 mg daily), a new antihypertensive drug, on blood lipids was evaluated in a 12-week non-comparative clinical trial in 34 patients with mild or moderate hypertension. Ketanserin reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 12.2 and 9.8%, respectively, without altering heart rates. Total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels in the fasting plasma were observed to decrease significantly by 6.3 and 8.8% respectively, whereas mean triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol remained almost unchanged. These changes were consistent irrespective of their initial values. Significant decrease in apolipoprotein B and E was also observed. Apolipoprotein A-I, A-II, C-II and C-III were not altered significantly. It is speculated that ketanserin affects mainly LDL-cholesterol. Based on these findings, ketanserin is considered to have a potentially beneficial effect on coronary risk profile and should be given full consideration when drug therapy is selected for patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Ketanserin tartrate (ketanserin) is a new antihypertensive drug that is a selective 5HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist and at high concentrations antagonizes the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. Several reports have indicated that ketanserin clinically decreases plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In order to clarify the mechanisms of this LDL cholesterol reduction by ketanserin, we investigated the effects of ketanserin on 3-hydroxy, 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A(HMG CoA) reductase activity to cultured human skin fibroblasts. We also studied the effects of ritanserin (a 5HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist) and prazosin HCl (an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) on HMG CoA reductase activity in cultured human skin fibroblasts. Human skin fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Before the cells reached confluence, the medium was changed to DME containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum. After incubation for 48-72 hours, the drugs under investigation were added to the medium. The cells were incubated for 14 hours and harvested after washing with phosphate buffered saline. In our study, ketanserin decreased HMG CoA reductase activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 300 ng/ml (550 nM). Prazosin also decreased HMG CoA reductase activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 40 ng/ml (95 nM); ritanserin decreased HMG CoA reductase activity at concentrations of 100 nM and 200 nM. These findings suggest that the combination of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and 5HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist effects of ketanserin inhibits HMG CoA reductase activity and that this suppression is probably one of the mechanisms for the plasma LDL cholesterol reduction resulting from ketanserin treatment.",Ketanserin tartrate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002232540718978271), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00672647962346673)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4120,"('Retinol', 'Vitamin a', 'All-trans-retinol', 'Vitamin a1', 'Alphalin')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Retinol, also called vitamin A1, is a fat-soluble vitamin in the vitamin A family that is found in food and used as a dietary supplement. Retinol or other forms of vitamin A are needed for vision, cellular development, maintenance of skin and mucous membranes, immune function and reproductive development. Dietary sources include fish, dairy products, and meat. As a supplement it is used to treat and prevent vitamin A deficiency, especially that which results in xerophthalmia. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle. As an ingredient in skin-care products, it is used to reduce wrinkles and other effects of skin aging. Retinol at normal doses is well tolerated. High doses may cause enlargement of the liver, dry skin, and hypervitaminosis A. High doses during pregnancy may harm the fetus. The body converts retinol to retinal and retinoic acid, through which it acts. Retinol was discovered in 1909, isolated in 1931, and first made in 1947. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Retinol is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2021, vitamin A was the 298th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Retinol is used to treat vitamin A deficiency. Three approaches may be used when populations have low vitamin A levels: Through dietary modification involving the adjustment of menu choices of affected persons from available food sources to optimize vitamin A content. Enriching commonly eaten and affordable foods with vitamin A, a process called fortification. It involves the addition of synthetic vitamin A to staple foods like margarine, bread, flour, cereals, and infant formula during processing. By giving high doses of vitamin A to the targeted deficient population, a method known as supplementation. In regions where deficiency is common, a single large dose is recommended to those at high risk twice a year. Retinol is also used to reduce the risk of complications in measles patients. == Side effects == The Recommended Daily Intake (RDA) for preformed supplemental vitamin A for adult men and women is 900 and 700 Retinol Activity Units(RAE)/day, respectively, or about 3,000 IU and 2,300 IU. In pregnancy, the vitamin A RDA is 750–770 RAE/day (about 2,500–2,550 IU). During lactation, the RDA increases to 1,200–1,300 RAE/day (about 4,000–4,300 IU, with differences depending on age). Retinol Activity Units can only be converted to IU (International Units) when the source of the vitamin A is known. The IU values listed above do not apply to food sources of vitamin A. Too much vitamin A in retinoid form can be harmful. The body converts the dimerized form, carotene, into vitamin A as it is needed, so high levels of carotene are not toxic, whereas the ester (animal) forms are. The livers of certain animals, especially those adapted to polar environments, such as polar bears and seals, often contain amounts of vitamin A that would be toxic to humans. Thus, vitamin A toxicity is typically reported in Arctic explorers and people taking large doses of synthetic vitamin A. The first documented death possibly caused by vitamin A poisoning was that of Xavier Mertz, a Swiss scientist, who died in January 1913 on an Antarctic expedition that had lost its food supplies and fell to eating its sled dogs. Mertz may have consumed lethal amounts of vitamin A by eating the dogs' livers. Vitamin A acute toxicity occurs when a person ingests vitamin A in large amounts more than the daily recommended value in the threshold of 25,000 IU/kg or more. Often, the patient consumes about 3–4 times the RDA's specification. Toxicity of vitamin A is believed to be associated with the methods of increasing vitamin A in the body, such as food modification, fortification, and supplementation, all of which are used to combat vitamin A deficiency. Toxicity is classified into two categories: acute and chronic. The former occurs a few hours or days after ingestion of a large amount of vitamin A. Chronic toxicity takes place when about 4,000 IU/kg or more of vitamin A is consumed for a long time. Symptoms of both include nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, weight loss, and menstrual abnormalities. Excess vitamin A is suspected to be a contributor to osteoporosis. This seems to happen at much lower doses than those required to induce acute intoxication. Only preformed vitamin A can cause these problems because the conversion of carotenoids or retinyl esters into vitamin A is downregulated when physiological requirements are met; but excessive uptake of carotenoids can cause carotenosis. Excess preformed vitamin A during early pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in birth defects. These defects may be severe, even life-threatening. Even twice the daily recommended amount can cause severe birth defects. The FDA recommends that pregnant women get their vitamin A from foods containing beta carotene and that they ensure that they consume no more than 5,000 IU of preformed vitamin A (if any) per day. Although vitamin A is necessary for fetal development, most women carry sufficient stores of vitamin A in their liver cells, so over-supplementation should be strictly avoided. A review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the Cochrane Collaboration published in JAMA in 2007 found that supplementation with beta carotene or vitamin A increased mortality by 5% and 16%, respectively. This effect has been attributed to the role of retinol and retinoic acid in increasing circulating cholesterol and triglycerides as well as promoting cancer incidence. Studies emerging from developing countries India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia strongly suggest that, in populations in which vitamin A deficiency is common and maternal mortality is high, dosing expectant mothers with retinol can greatly reduce maternal mortality. Similarly, dosing newborn infants with 50,000 IU (15 mg) of vitamin A within two days of birth can significantly reduce neonatal mortality. == Biological roles == Retinol or other forms of vitamin A are needed for eyesight, maintenance of the skin, and human development. Other than for vision, which requires 11-cis retinal, the active compound is retinoic acid, synthesized from retinal, in turn synthesized from retinol. The differing biological roles of retinoic acid depend on its stereochemistry and whether it is present in the all-trans, 9-cis, or 13-cis forms. === Embryology === Retinoic acid via the retinoic acid receptor influences the process of cell differentiation and, hence, the growth and development of embryos. During development, there is a concentration gradient of retinoic acid along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. Cells in the embryo respond to retinoic acid differently depending on the amount present. For example, in vertebrates, the hindbrain transiently forms eight rhombomeres and each rhombomere has a specific pattern of genes being expressed. If retinoic acid is not present the last four rhombomeres do not develop. Instead, rhombomeres 1–4 grow to cover the same amount of space as all eight would normally occupy. Retinoic acid has its effects by turning on a differential pattern of Homeobox (Hox) genes that encode different homeodomain transcription factors which in turn can turn on cell type-specific genes. Deletion of the Homeobox (Hox-1) gene from rhombomere 4 makes the neurons growing in that region behave like neurons from rhombomere 2. Retinoic acid is not required for patterning of the retina as originally proposed, but retinoic acid synthesized in the retina is secreted into the surrounding mesenchyme where it is required to prevent overgrowth of perioptic mesenchyme which can cause microphthalmia, defects in the cornea and eyelid, and rotation of the optic cup. === Stem cell biology === Synthetic retinoic acid is used in differentiation of stem cells to more committed fates, echoing retinoic acid's importance in natural embryonic developmental pathways. It is thought to initiate differentiation into several different cell lineages through activation of the Retinoic acid receptor. It has numerous applications in the experimental induction of stem cell differentiation; amongst these is the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to posterior foregut lineages. === Vision === Retinol is an essential compound in the cycle of light-activated chemical reactions called the ""visual cycle"" that underlies vertebrate vision. Retinol is converted by the protein RPE65 within the pigment epithelium of the retina into 11-cis-retinal. This molecule is then transported into the retina's photoreceptor cells (the rod or cone cells in mammals) where it binds to an opsin protein and acts as a light-activated molecular switch. When 11-cis-retinal absorbs light it isomerizes into all-trans-retinal. The change in the shape of the molecule in turn changes the configuration of the opsin in a cascade that leads to the neuronal firing, which signals the detection of light. The opsin then splits into the protein component (such metarhodopsin) and the cofactor all-trans-retinal. The regeneration of active opsin requires conversion of all-trans-retinal back to 11-cis-retinal via retinol. The regeneration of 11-cis-retinal occurs in vertebrates via the conversion of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol in a sequence of chemical transformations that occurs primarily in the pigment epithelial cells. Without adequate amounts of retinol, regeneration of rhodopsin is incomplete and night blindness occurs. Night blindness, the inability to see well in dim light, is associated with a deficiency of vitamin A, a class of compounds that includes retinol and retinal. In the early stages of vitamin A deficiency, the more light-sensitive and abundant rods, which have rhodopsin, have impaired sensitivity, and the cone cells are less affected. The cones are less abundant than rods and come in three types, each contains its own type of iodopsin, the opsins of the cones. The cones mediate color vision, and vision in bright light (day vision). === Glycoprotein synthesis === Glycoprotein synthesis requires adequate vitamin A status. In severe vitamin A deficiency, lack of glycoproteins may lead to corneal ulcers or liquefaction. === Immune system === Vitamin A is involved in maintaining a number of immune cell types from both the innate and acquired immune systems. These include the lymphocytes (B-cells, T-cells, and natural killer cells), as well as many myelocytes (neutrophils, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells). Vitamin A maintains immune barriers in the gut through its activity as retinoic acid. === Skin === Deficiencies in vitamin A have been linked to an increased susceptibility to skin infection and inflammation. Vitamin A appears to modulate the innate immune response and maintains homeostasis of epithelial tissues and mucosa through its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA). As part of the innate immune system, toll-like receptors in skin cells respond to pathogens and cell damage by inducing a pro-inflammatory immune response which includes increased RA production. The epithelium of the skin encounters bacteria, fungi and viruses. Keratinocytes of the epidermal layer of the skin produce and secrete antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Production of AMPs resistin and cathelicidin, are promoted by RA. Another way that vitamin A helps maintain a healthy skin and hair follicle microbiome, especially on the face, is by reduction of sebum secretion, which is a nutrient source for bacteria. Retinol has been the subject of clinical studies related to its ability to reduce the appearance of fine lines on the face and neck. === Red blood cells === Vitamin A may be needed for normal red blood cell formation; deficiency causes abnormalities in iron metabolism. Vitamin A is needed to produce the red blood cells from stem cells through retinoid differentiation. == Units of measurement == When referring to dietary allowances or nutritional science, retinol is usually measured in international units (IU). IU refers to biological activity and therefore is unique to each individual compound, however, 1 IU of retinol is equivalent to approximately 0.3 micrograms (300 nanograms). == Nutrition == This vitamin plays an essential role in vision, particularly night vision, normal bone and tooth development, reproduction, and the health of skin and mucous membranes (the mucus-secreting layer that lines body regions such as the respiratory tract). While Vitamin A is often considered to be an antioxidant that prevents cancers, it does not have antioxidant activity and is shown to promote the development of many cancers. There are two sources of dietary vitamin A. Retinyl ester or retinol forms, which are immediately available to the body or carotene precursors, also known as provitamins, which must be converted to active forms by the body. These are obtained from fruits and vegetables containing yellow, orange and dark green pigments, known as carotenoids, the most well-known being β-carotene. For this reason, amounts of vitamin A are measured in Retinol Equivalents (RE). One RE is equivalent to 0.001 mg of retinol, or 0.006 mg of β-carotene, or 3.3 International Units of vitamin A. Vitamin A is fat-soluble and is stored in the liver and fat tissue. When required by a particular part of the body, the liver releases some vitamin A, which is carried by the blood and delivered to the target cells and tissues. === Dietary intake === The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) for vitamin A for a 25-year-old male is 900 micrograms/day, or 3000 IU. National Health Service daily recommended values are slightly lower at 700 micrograms for men and 600 micrograms for women. During the absorption process in the intestines, retinol is incorporated into chylomicrons as the ester form, and it is these particles that mediate transport to the liver. Liver cells store vitamin A as the ester, and when retinol is needed in other tissues, it is de-esterifed and released into the blood as the alcohol. Retinol then attaches to a serum carrier, retinol binding protein, for transport to target tissues. A binding protein inside cells, cellular retinoic acid binding protein, serves to store and move retinoic acid intracellularly. === Deficiency === Vitamin A deficiency is common in developing countries but rarely seen in developed countries. Approximately 250,000 to 500,000 malnourished children in the developing world go blind each year from a deficiency of vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency in expecting mothers increases the mortality rate of children shortly after childbirth. Night blindness is one of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency contributes to blindness by depleting the necessary form needed for rhodopsin. === Sources === Retinoids are found naturally only in foods of animal origin. Each of the following contains at least 0.15 mg of retinoids per 1.75–7 oz (50–198 g): Cod liver oil Butter Liver (beef, pork, chicken, turkey, fish) Eggs Cheese, milk == Chemistry == Many different geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and retinoic acid are possible as a result of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown at the top of this page). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the opsin protein (either rod opsin or blue, red, or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. Many of the non-visual functions of vitamin A are mediated by retinoic acid, which regulates gene expression by activating nuclear retinoic acid receptors. The non-visual functions of vitamin A are essential in the immunological function, reproduction, and embryonic development of vertebrates as evidenced by the impaired growth, susceptibility to infection, and birth defects observed in populations receiving suboptimal vitamin A in their diet. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Retinol is synthesized from the breakdown of β-carotene. First, the β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase cleaves β-carotene at the central double bond, creating an epoxide. This epoxide is then attacked by water creating two hydroxyl groups in the center of the structure. The cleavage occurs when these alcohols are oxidized to the aldehydes using NADH. This compound is called retinal. Retinal is then reduced to retinol by the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase. Retinol dehydrogenase is an enzyme that is dependent on NADH. === Industrial synthesis === Retinol is made industrially via total synthesis using either a method developed by BASF or a Grignard reaction utilized by Hoffman-La Roche. The two major suppliers, DSM and BASF, are believed to use total synthesis. The world market for synthetic retinol is primarily for animal feed, leaving approximately 13% for a combination of food, prescription medication, and dietary supplement use. The first industrialized synthesis of retinol was achieved by the company Hoffmann-La Roche in 1947. In the following decades, eight other companies developed their own processes. β-Ionone, synthesized from acetone, is the essential starting point for all industrial syntheses. Each process involves elongating the unsaturated carbon chain. Pure retinol is extremely sensitive to oxidization and is prepared and transported at low temperatures and oxygen-free atmospheres. When prepared as a dietary supplement or food additive, retinol is stabilized as the ester derivatives retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate. Before 1999, three companies, Roche, BASF, and Rhone-Poulenc controlled 96% of global vitamin A sales. In 2001, the European Commission imposed total fines of 855.22 Euros on these and five other companies for their participation in eight distinct market-sharing and price-fixing cartels that dated back to 1989. Roche sold its vitamin division to DSM in 2003. DSM and BASF have the major share of industrial production. == History == In 1912, Frederick Gowland Hopkins demonstrated that unknown accessory factors found in milk, other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were necessary for growth in rats. Hopkins received a Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1929. One year later, Elmer McCollum, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and colleague Marguerite Davis identified a fat-soluble nutrient in butterfat and cod liver oil. Their work confirmed that of Thomas Burr Osborne and Lafayette Mendel, at Yale, also in 1913, which suggested a fat-soluble nutrient in butterfat. The ""accessory factors"" were termed ""fat-soluble"" in 1918 and later ""vitamin A"" in 1920. In 1931, Swiss chemist Paul Karrer described the chemical structure of vitamin A. Retinoic acid and retinol were first synthesized in 1946 and 1947 by two Dutch chemists, David Adriaan van Dorp and Jozef Ferdinand Arens. In 1967, George Wald was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine ""...""for their discoveries concerning the primary physiological and chemical visual processes in the eye."" Photoreceptor cells in the eye contain a chromophore composed of the protein opsin and 11-cis retinal. When struck by light, 11-cis retinal undergoes photoisomerization to all-trans retinal and via signal transduction cascade sends a nerve signal to the brain. The all-trans retinal is reduced to all-trans retinol and travels back to the retinal pigment epithelium to be recycled to 11-cis retinal and conjugated to opsin. Although vitamin A was not confirmed as an essential nutrient and a chemical structure described until the 20th century, written observations of conditions created by deficiency of this nutrient appeared much earlier in history. Sommer classified historical accounts related to vitamin A and/or manifestations of deficiency as follows: ""ancient"" accounts; 18th- to 19th-century clinical descriptions (and their purported etiologic associations); early 20th-century laboratory animal experiments, and clinical and epidemiologic observations that identified the existence of this unique nutrient and manifestations of its deficiency. == References == == External links == Jane Higdon, ""Vitamin A"", Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University NIH Office of Dietary Supplements – Vitamin A Vitamin A Deficiency at the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy",Alphalin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.23568452894687653), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.18799473345279694), ('OG', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ENO', -0.0005536287208087742), ('US', 0.0), (',', -5.512236498361744e-07), (' FOOD', -0.00407923199236393), (',', -4.56102097814437e-05), (' PERSONAL', -0.00029625516617670655), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.31345653533935547), (' INDUSTR', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('IAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.4091905951499939), ('ICAL', -2.622600959512056e-06), (',', -4.9232225137529895e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.20850948989391327), (',', -0.023262567818164825), ('ĠPERSON', -0.12781080603599548), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ĠCARE', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47418665885925293)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Alphalin,https://zellbio.eu/product/retinol/ ', [])"

Randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, left and right arm comparison study. Academic referral center. The study population comprised 36 elderly subjects (mean age, 87 years), residing in 2 senior citizen facilities. Topical 0.4% retinol lotion or its vehicle was applied at each visit by study personnel to either the right or the left arm, up to 3 times a week for 24 weeks. Clinical assessment using a semiquantitative scale (0, none; 9, most severe) and biochemical measurements from skin biopsy specimens obtained from treated areas. After 24 weeks, an intent-to-treat analysis using the last-observation-carried-forward method revealed that there were significant differences between retinol-treated and vehicle-treated skin for changes in fine wrinkling scores (-1.64 [95% CI, -2.06 to -1.22] vs -0.08 [95% CI, -0.17 to 0.01]; P<.001). As measured in a subgroup, retinol treatment significantly increased glycosaminoglycan expression (P = .02 [n = 6]) and procollagen I immunostaining (P = .049 [n = 4]) compared with vehicle. Topical retinol improves fine wrinkles associated with natural aging. Significant induction of glycosaminoglycan, which is known to retain substantial water, and increased collagen production are most likely responsible for wrinkle effacement. With greater skin matrix synthesis, retinol-treated aged skin is more likely to withstand skin injury and ulcer formation along with improved appearance. The study was undertaken to compare the skin care related activities of retinol and bakuchiol, a potential alternative to retinoids. Retinol is a pivotal regulator of differentiation and growth of developing as well as adult skin. Retinoic acid is the major physiologically active metabolite of retinol regulating gene expression through retinoic acid receptor - dependant and independent pathways. Comparative gene expression profiling of both substances in the EpiDerm FT full thickness skin substitute model was undertaken. Furthermore, type I, III and IV collagen, as well as aquaporin 3 expression was analyzed by ELISA and/or histochemistry in human dermal fibroblasts and/or Epiderm FT skin substitutes. Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abundant in seeds and leaves of the plant Psoralea corylifolia. We present evidence that bakuchiol, having no structural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression profile. This similarity was confirmed by the side-by-side comparison of the modulation of individual genes, as well as on the protein level by ELISA and histochemistry. Retinol-like functionality was further confirmed for the upregulation of types I and IV collagen in DNA microarray study and also show stimulation of type III collagen in the mature fibroblast model. Bakuchiol was also formulated into a finished skin care product and was tested in clinical case study by twice-a-day facial application. The results showed that, after 12 weeks treatment, significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall reduction in photo-damage was observed, without usual retinol therapy-associated undesirable effects. Based on these data, we propose that bakuchiol can function as an anti-ageing compound through retinol-like regulation of gene expression. Retinol, the alcohol form of vitamin A is a key dietary component that plays a critical role in vertebrate development, cell differentiation, reproduction, vision and immune system. Natural and synthetic analogs of retinol, called retinoids, have generally been associated with the cell differentiation via retinoic acid which is the most potent metabolite of retinol. However, a direct function of retinol has not been fully investigated. New evidence has now emerged that retinol supports the self-renewal of stem cells including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), germ line stem cells (GSCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) by activating the endogenous machinery for self-renewal by a retinoic acid independent mechanism. The studies have also revealed that stem cells do not contain enzymes that are responsible for metabolizing retinol into retinoic acid. This new function of retinol may have important implications for stem cell biology which can be exploited for quantitative production of pure population of pluripotent stem cells for regenerative medicine as well as clinical applications for cancer therapeutics.",A retinol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.41878560185432434), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.6437869668006897), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0009122979827225208), (' FOOD', -0.008616226725280285)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.16775262355804443), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.00012516192509792745), ('ĠPERSON', -0.08386973291635513), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.1086402082582936e-05), (',', -0.03804967552423477), ('ĠFOOD', -0.12695734202861786), (',', -0.47414445877075195), ('ĠEND', -0.00037102968781255186), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.976056415122002e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.1406426876783371), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.4141509532928467), (',', -7.941850526549388e-06), (' PERSONAL', -6.704273118884885e-07), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinol,https://www.safecosmetics.org/chemicals/retinol-and-retinol-compounds/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31616211/ ', [])"

Various compounds, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), can be generated from FMN photolysis upon irradiation with visible light. The ROS generated from FMN photolysis are harmful to microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). This article presents a protocol for deactivating S. aureus, as an example, via photochemical reactions involving FMN under visible light irradiation. The superoxide radical anion () generated during the FMN photolysis is evaluated via nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction. The microbial viability of S. aureus that is attributed to reactive species was used to determine the effectiveness of the process. The bacterial inactivation rate is proportional to FMN concentration. Violet light is more efficient in inactivating S. aureus than blue light irradiation, while the red or green light does not drive FMN photolysis. The present article demonstrates FMN photolysis as a simple and safe method for sanitary processes. The pathway of riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis is significantly different in archaea, eubacteria, fungi and plants. Specifically, the first committed intermediate, 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate, can either undergo hydrolytic cleavage of the position 2 amino group by a deaminase (in plants and most eubacteria) or reduction of the ribose side chain by a reductase (in fungi and archaea).

It is a corticosteroid and works as an anti-inflammatory and by immune suppression. Uses include conditions such as adrenocortical insufficiency, adrenogenital syndrome, high blood calcium, thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, asthma, and COPD. It is the treatment of choice for adrenocortical insufficiency. It can be given by mouth, topically, or by injection. Stopping treatment after long-term use should be done slowly. Side effects may include mood changes, increased risk of infection, and edema (swelling). With long-term use, common side effects include osteoporosis, upset stomach, physical weakness, easy bruising, and candidiasis (yeast infections). It is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy. Hydrocortisone was patented in 1936 and approved for medical use in 1941. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 202nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term for cortisol used in oral administration, intravenous injection, or topical application. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients needing steroid treatment but unable to take oral medication, and perioperatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis. It may also be injected into inflamed joints resulting from diseases such as gout. It may be used topically for allergic rashes, eczema, psoriasis, itching, and other inflammatory skin conditions. Topical hydrocortisone creams and ointments are available in most countries without prescription in strengths ranging from 0.05% to 2.5% (depending on local regulations) with stronger forms available by prescription only. It may also be used rectally in suppositories to relieve the swelling, itch, and irritation in hemorrhoids. It may be used as an acetate form (hydrocortisone acetate), which has slightly different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid, acting specifically as both a glucocorticoid and as a mineralocorticoid. That is, it is an agonist of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Hydrocortisone has low potency relative to synthetic corticosteroids. Compared to hydrocortisone, prednisolone is about 4 times as potent and dexamethasone about 40 times as potent in terms of anti-inflammatory effect. Prednisolone can also be used as cortisol replacement, and at replacement dose levels (rather than anti-inflammatory levels), prednisolone is about 8 times more potent than cortisol. The equivalent doses and relative potencies of hydrocortisone compared to various other synthetic corticosteroids have also been reviewed and summarized. The endogenous production rate of cortisol is approximately 5.7 to 9.9 mg/m2 per day, which corresponds to an oral hydrocortisone dose of approximately 15 to 20 mg/day (for a 70-kg person). One review described daily cortisol production of 10 mg in healthy volunteers and reported that daily cortisol production could increase up to 400 mg in conditions of severe stress (e.g., surgery). The total and/or free concentrations of cortisol/hydrocortisone required for various glucocorticoid effects have been determined. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The bioavailability of oral hydrocortisone is about 96% ± 20% (SD). The pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone are non-linear. The peak level of oral hydrocortisone is 15.3 ± 2.9 (SD) μg/L per 1 mg dose. The time to peak concentrations of oral hydrocortisone is 1.2 ± 0.4 (SD) hours. The topical percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone varies widely depending on experimental circumstances and has been reported to range from 0.5 to 14.9% in different studies. Some skin application sites, like the scrotum and vulva, absorb hydrocortisone much more efficiently than other application sites, like the forearm. In one study, the amount of hydrocortisone absorbed ranged from 0.2% to 36.2% depending on the application site, with the ball of the foot having the lowest absorption and the scrotum having the highest absorption. The absorption of hydrocortisone by the vulva has ranged from 4.4 to 8.1%, relative to 1.3 to 2.8% for the arm, in different studies and subjects. ==== Distribution ==== Most cortisol in the blood (all but about 4%) is bound to proteins, including corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and serum albumin. A pharmacokinetic review stated that 92% ± 2% (SD) (92–93%) of hydrocortisone is plasma protein-bound. Free cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes. Inside cells it interacts with corticosteroid receptors. ==== Metabolism ==== Hydrocortisone is metabolized by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs) into cortisone, an inactive metabolite. It is additionally 5α-, 5β-, and 3α-reduced into dihydrocortisols, dihydrocortisones, tetrahydrocortisols, and tetrahydrocortisones. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of hydrocortisone ranges from about 1.2 to 2.0 (SD) hours, with an average of around 1.5 hours, regardless of oral versus parenteral administration. The duration of action of systemic hydrocortisone has been listed as 8 to 12 hours. == Chemistry == Hydrocortisone, also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid. A variety of hydrocortisone esters exist and have been marketed for medical use. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In March 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Efmody, intended for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. The applicant for this medicinal product is Diurnal Europe BV. Hydrocortisone (Efmody) was approved for medical use in the European Union, in May 2021, for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. === Anti-competitive practices === In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded an investigation into the supply of hydrocortisone tablets, finding that from October 2008 onwards, drug suppliers Auden McKenzie and Actavis plc had charged ""excessive and unfair prices"" for 10mg and 20mg tablets and entered into agreements with potential competitors, paying companies who agreed not to enter the hydrocortisone market and enabling Auden McKenzie and Actavis to supply the drugs as ""generic"" rather than branded products and thereby escape price controls until eventually other companies entered the market. Auden and Actavis overcharged the UK's National Health Service for over ten years. Fines totalling over £255m were levied against the companies involved in this breach of competition law. == Research == === COVID-19 === Hydrocortisone was found to be effective in reducing mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients when compared to other usual care or a placebo. == References ==",Hydrocortisone-17-valerate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0017084944993257523), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002084703417494893), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47443222999572754)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/hydrocortisone-valerate.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Hydrocortisone valerate Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/hydrocortisone-valerate.html?utm_source=openai')])"

4126,"('Thiazol', 'Thiazoles', 'Tz', 'A thiazole', 'Racemic thiazole')",Medical,"Thiazole (), or 1,3-thiazole, is a 5-membered heterocyclic compound that contains both sulfur and nitrogen. The term 'thiazole' also refers to a large family of derivatives. Thiazole itself is a pale yellow liquid with a pyridine-like odor and the molecular formula C3H3NS. The thiazole ring is notable as a component of the vitamin thiamine (B1). == Molecular and electronic structure == Thiazoles are members of the azoles, heterocycles that include imidazoles and oxazoles. Thiazole can also be considered a functional group when part of a larger molecule. Being planar thiazoles are characterized by significant pi-electron delocalization and have some degree of aromaticity, more so than the corresponding oxazoles. This aromaticity is evidenced by the 1H NMR chemical shift of the ring protons, which absorb between 7.27 and 8.77 ppm, indicating a strong diamagnetic ring current. The calculated pi-electron density marks C5 as the primary site for electrophilic substitution, and C2-H as susceptible to deprotonation. == Occurrence of thiazoles and thiazolium salts == Thiazoles are found in a variety of specialized products, often fused with benzene derivatives, the so-called benzothiazoles. In addition to vitamin B1, the thiazole ring is found in epothilone. Other important thiazole derivatives are benzothiazoles, for example, the firefly chemical luciferin. Whereas thiazoles are well represented in biomolecules, oxazoles are not. It is found in naturally occurring peptides, and utilised in the development of peptidomimetics (i.e. molecules that mimic the function and structure of peptides). Commercial significant thiazoles include mainly dyes and fungicides. Thifluzamide, Tricyclazole, and Thiabendazole are marketed for control of various agricultural pests. Another widely used thiazole derivative is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Meloxicam. The following anthroquinone dyes contain benzothiazole subunits: Algol Yellow 8 (CAS# [6451-12-3]), Algol Yellow GC (CAS# [129-09-9]), Indanthren Rubine B (CAS# [6371-49-9]), Indanthren Blue CLG (CAS# [6371-50-2], and Indanthren Blue CLB (CAS#[6492-78-0]). These thiazole dye are used for dyeing cotton. == Synthesis == Various laboratory methods exist for the organic synthesis of thiazoles. Prominent is the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis, which is a reaction between haloketones and thioamides. For example, 2,4-dimethylthiazole is synthesized from thioacetamide and chloroacetone. In the Cook-Heilbron synthesis, thiazoles arise by the condensation of α-aminonitrile with carbon disulfide. Thiazoles can be accessed by acylation of 2-aminothiolates, often available by the Herz reaction. === Biosynthesis === Thiazoles are generally formed via reactions of cysteine, which provides the N-C-C-S backbone of the ring. Thiamine does not fit this pattern however. Several biosynthesis routes lead to the thiazole ring as required for the formation of thiamine. Sulfur of the thiazole is derived from cysteine. In anaerobic bacteria, the CN group is derived from dehydroglycine. == Reactions == With a pKa of 2.5 for the conjugate acid, thiazoles are far less basic than imidazole (pKa =7). Deprotonation with strong bases occurs at C2-H. The negative charge on this position is stabilized as an ylide. Hauser bases and organolithium compounds react at this site, replacing the proton. 2-Lithiothiazoles are also generated by metal-halogen exchange from 2-bromothiazole. Electrophilic aromatic substitution at C5 but require activating groups such as a methyl group, as illustrated in bromination: Oxidation at nitrogen gives the aromatic thiazole N-oxide; many oxidizing agents exist, such as mCPBA; a novel one is hypofluorous acid prepared from fluorine and water in acetonitrile; some of the oxidation takes place at sulfur, leading to non-aromatic sulfoxide/sulfone: Thiazole N-oxides are useful in Palladium-catalysed C-H arylations, where the N-oxide is able to shift the reactivity to reliably favor the 2-position, and allows for these reactions to be carried out under much more mild conditions. Thiazoles are formyl synthons; conversion of R-thia to the R-CHO aldehyde takes place with, respectively, methyl iodide (N-methylation), organic reduction with sodium borohydride, and hydrolysis with Mercury(II) chloride in water. Thiazoles can react in cycloadditions, but in general at high temperatures due to favorable aromatic stabilization of the reactant; Diels-Alder reactions with alkynes are followed by extrusion of sulfur, and the endproduct is a pyridine; in one study, a very mild reaction of a 2-(dimethylamino)thiazole with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) to a pyridine was found to proceed through a zwitterionic intermediate in a formal [2+2]cycloaddition to a cyclobutene, then to a 1,3-thiazepine in a 4-electron electrocyclic ring opening and then to a 7-thia-2-azanorcaradiene in a 6-electron electrocyclic ring, closing before extruding the sulfur atom. === Thiazolium salts === Alkylation of thiazoles at nitrogen forms a thiazolium cation. Thiazolium salts are catalysts in the Stetter reaction and the Benzoin condensation. Deprotonation of N-alkyl thiazolium salts give the free carbenes and transition metal carbene complexes. Alagebrium is a thiazolium-based drug. == References ==",Thiazoles,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('IND', -0.4224473237991333), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0052350712940096855), (' FOOD', -0.5647314786911011), (',', -0.0011714138090610504), (' MED', -0.02326679229736328), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, FOOD', [('IN', -0.38199904561042786), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0009170140838250518), ('ĠMED', -0.4038015604019165), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.2520190179347992), ('ĠFOOD', -0.015671079978346825), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3134106695652008)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4127,"('Capecitabine (xeloda)',)",Medical," Home-based therapy with oral capecitabine (Xeloda) has a number of advantages over i.v. hospital-based chemotherapy regimens, including improvement in patients' quality of life, and medical resource/cost savings compared with 5-FU/LV in metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition, the ability of capecitabine to extend survival beyond docetaxel in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer means that capecitabine plus docetaxel is a very cost-effective combination. Oncology nurses should prepare for the increased use of oral capecitabine as a single agent or in combination regimens in the outpatient setting. The use of this drug requires enhanced patient education skills, communication (e.g. telephone contact) and patient management on the part of the nurse. Oncology nurses will also need to accept a more significant and pivotal role in the clinical oncology team, not only as a point of contact between the patient and clinician, but also in documenting the benefits of capecitabine to ensure the effective management of patients receiving the drug. Attempts at improving the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by protracted continuous infusion and/or biochemical modulation have been hindered by the need for indwelling central venous catheters and their associated toxicity. Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate, has been rationally synthesized as an inactive precursor that is absorbed intact through the intestinal mucosa and is sequentially converted by an enzymatic cascade involving 3 distinct enzymes to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine, to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR), and finally to 5-FU. Preclinical studies provided evidence of preferential intratumoral conversion of inactive 5'-DFUR to active 5-FU due to the relative overexpression of the final anabolizing enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase, in tumor tissues, with a resultant decrease of 5-FU exposure in normal tissues. The safety of capecitabine and optimal dosing schedules have been explored in phase I/II studies, resulting in the evaluation of the intermittent schedule (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days, every 3 weeks) in most subsequent clinical trials. Two large randomized phase III studies in patients with metastatic colon cancer established at least equivalent efficacy and improved tolerability with capecitabine compared to the Mayo Clinic bolus 5-FU/leucovorin regimen. The most common treatment-related adverse events are palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, diarrhea, and stomatitis, with grade 3/4 events occurring in 17%, 15%, and 2%-8% of patients, respectively. Myelosuppression was minimal. Overall toxicity was easily managed, with a significant reduction in the frequency of hospitalizations and medical resource use. The spectrum of clinical efficacy of capecitabine is expected to encompass other tumor types and administration in the adjuvant setting. As a home-based outpatient regimen, capecitabine represents a safe and effective advance in modern drug development. The treatment of advanced triple-negative breast cancer, which failed in first-line or second-line therapy, is a significant challenge. We conducted this retrospective study to explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib and capecitabine as the third-line treatment for advanced triple-negative breast cancer.This retrospective study involved 44 advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who failed in first-line or second-line therapy in Tangshan People's Hospital from January 2016 to February 2017. Twenty-two patients received apatinib and capecitabine, while 22 patients were treated with capecitabine monotherapy as third-line therapy. The progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events were compared between 2 groups.The apatinib and capecitabine group exhibited a higher PFS than capecitabine group (P = .001). Meanwhile, ORR and DCR in apatinib and capecitabine group were better than in capecitabine group (P = .042; .016). The 2 groups showed no significant difference in adverse events except degree I-II bleeding (P = .021). Both the apatinib and capecitabine and the capecitabine regimens revealed good tolerability.The apatinib and capecitabine regimen can achieve a better efficacy and similar serious adverse events compared with capecitabine regimen as the third-line treatment for advanced triple-negative breast cancer.",Capecitabine (xeloda),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.578839045483619e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015309053706005216)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/xeloda.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Xeloda: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/xeloda.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4128,"('Vinorelbine (navelbine)',)",Medical," Vinorelbine (Navelbine) is a new, semisynthetic 5'Nor-vinca-alkaloid, modified on the catharantine ring, developed by Pierre Fabre Médicament. Vinorelbine is a potent as the other vinca alkaloids to inhibit mitotic microtubule polymerization. On the other hand, its activity is lower on axonal microtubule. Preclinical studies have shown its broad spectrum of activity in vitro and its antitumoral efficacy comparable or higher to that of other vinca alkaloids against murine tumors and in xenograft models. The main experimental toxicity of vinorelbine is a reversible leucopenia. No neurotoxicity was evidenced in rats, dogs and monkeys. After i.v. injection in patients, the plasma kinetic is described by a tricompartimental model with a high clearance, a very large volume of distribution and a long terminal half life, intermediate between vincristine and vinblastine. Tissue uptake of vinorelbine is very intense, probably related to its high liposolubility, leading to high tissue concentration compared to plasma. Phase I trial using weekly i.v. administration demonstrated a maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of 27.5 to 35.4 mg/m2 and the recommended dose was established at 30 mg/m2 weekly. In Phase II studies, Vinorelbine was shown to be effective in at least 4 types of cancer: Non-small cell lung cancer (remission rate: 33%), breast cancer (45%), advanced ovarian cancer (15% in heavily pretreated patients), Hodgkin's disease (90%). In all the trials, side effects are generally limited to a reversible and non-cumulative leucopenia. Neurotoxicity appears to be mild, similar to that observed with vinblastine and much less severe than with vincristine. No evidence of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic or other organ system toxicity has emerged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The vinca alkaloids represent one of the oldest classes of antineoplastic agents used in humans with a wide spectrum of activity against both animal and human tumors. These agents are known to inhibit microtubule polymerization. Vinorelbine is a semisynthetic analog that reached clinical trial on the basis of less preclinical evidence of toxicity to neuronal tissue and greater cytotoxic activity in preclinical models than the older compounds of this class. In humans, the clearance of this agent shows a wide variation among subjects with the predominant toxicity being hematological. Significant antitumor activity has been observed in diseases that previously have been shown to respond to vinca alkaloids. Phase II studies of vinorelbine (Navelbine; Burroughs Wellcome Co, Research Triangle Park, NC; Pierre Fabre Médicament, Paris, France) have been conducted mainly at a dose of 30 mg/m2/wk, and this schedule has been used extensively in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Vinorelbine used in a first-line setting as a single agent in 25 patients with previously untreated advanced metastatic breast cancer produced objective responses in 15 patients (60%) and complete responses (CR) in five (20%). A large multicenter study to assess the response rate by the main site of disease involvement included 145 assessable patients. The overall response rate was 41% (10 CRs and 50 partial responses: skin, 70%; lymph nodes, 67%; primary tumor, 56%; lungs, 33%; measurable bone, 27%; and liver, 23%). The median time to disease progression was 25 weeks and the median overall survival duration was 18 months. Neutropenia was the principal toxicity with grade 3/4 suppression noted; however, this was not accompanied by serious infection (incidence of grade 3/4 infection < 1%). Other grade 3/4 toxicity also was uncommon. Another phase II study included 50 patients assessable for toxicity and response. The overall response rate was 50% (2% CRs). In a salvage setting (second- and third-line treatment), 33 patients were treated with an overall response rate of 30% (two CRs). Rates of toxicity were no greater than in first-line patients. The most notable results for combination vinorelbine therapy were with a schedule of vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1, with cycles repeated every 21 days. The overall response rate for the 89 evaluable patients was 74% (19 [21%] CRs; 47 [53%] partial responses). These data indicate that vinorelbine is a highly active agent with a favorable toxicity profile in the treatment of breast cancer.",Vinorelbine (navelbine),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011801023356383666), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001192097319290042)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinorelbine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Vinorelbine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinorelbine?utm_source=openai')])"
4129,"('Eszopiclone', 'Lunesta', '(s)-zopiclone', 'Estorra', 'Esopiclone')",Medical,"Eszopiclone, sold under the brand name Lunesta among others, is a medication used in the treatment of insomnia. Evidence supports slight to moderate benefit up to six months. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness. Severe side effects may include suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, and angioedema. Rapid decreasing of the dose may result in withdrawal. Eszopiclone is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine or Z-drug and a sedative and hypnotic of the cyclopyrrolone group. It is the S-stereoisomer of zopiclone. It works by interacting with the GABA receptors. Approved for medical use in the United States in 2004, eszopiclone is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 232nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Eszopiclone is not sold in the European Union; as of 2009, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) ruled that it was too similar to zopiclone to be considered a new active substance. == Medical uses == A 2018 Cochrane review found that it produced moderate improvement in sleep onset and maintenance. The authors suggest that where preferred non-pharmacological treatment strategies have been exhausted, eszopiclone provides an efficient treatment for insomnia. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration asked that the starting dose be lowered from 2 milligrams to 1 milligram after it was observed in a study that even eight hours after taking the drug at night, some people were not able to cope with their next-day activities like driving and other activities that require full alertness. Eszopiclone is slightly effective in the treatment of insomnia where difficulty in falling asleep is the primary complaint. The benefit over placebo was found to be of questionable clinical significance. Although the drug effect and the placebo response were rather small and of questionable clinical importance, the two together produce a reasonably large clinical response. === Elderly === Sedative hypnotic drugs including eszopiclone are more commonly prescribed to the elderly than to younger patients despite benefits of medication being generally unimpressive. In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society reviewed the safety information about eszopiclone and similar drugs and concluded that the ""nonbenzodiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (eszopiclone, zaleplon, zolpidem) are to be avoided without consideration of duration of use because of their association with harms balanced with their minimal efficacy in treating insomnia."" The review made this determination both because of the relatively large dangers to elderly individuals from zolpidem and other ""z-drugs"" together with the fact the drugs have ""minimal efficacy in treating insomnia."" This was a change from the 2012 AGS recommendation, which suggested limiting use to 90 days or less. The review stated: ""the 90‐day‐use caveat [was] removed from nonbenzodiazepine, benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics, resulting in an unambiguous 'avoid' statement (without caveats) because of the increase in the evidence of harm in this area since the 2012 update."" An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, including eszopiclone appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin receptor agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia. A 2009 meta-analysis found a higher rate of infections. == Adverse effects == Sleeping pills, including eszopiclone, have been associated with an increased risk of death. Hypersensitivity to eszopiclone is a contraindication to its use. The presence of liver impairment, lactation and activities requiring mental alertness (e.g., driving) may be considered when determining frequency and dosage. A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking eszopiclone or other hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo. === Dependence === In the United States, eszopiclone is a schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Use of eszopiclone may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of non-medical use and dependence increases with the dose and duration of usage and concomitant use of other psychoactive substances. The risk is also greater in patients with a history of alcohol use disorder or other substance use disorder or history of psychiatric disorders. Tolerance may develop after repeated use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs for a few weeks. A study funded and carried out by Sepracor, the manufacturer of eszopiclone, found no signs of tolerance or dependence in a group of patients followed for up to six months. === Non-medical use === A study of non-medical use potential of eszopiclone found that in persons with a known history of non-medical benzodiazepine use, eszopiclone at doses of 6 and 12 mg produced effects similar to those of diazepam 20 mg. The study found that at these doses which are two or more times greater than the maximum recommended doses, a dose-related increase in reports of amnesia, sedation, sleepiness, and hallucinations was observed for both eszopiclone (Lunesta) as well as for diazepam (Valium). === Overdose === Overdoses of eszopiclone up to 90 times the recommended dose have been reported in which the patient fully recovered. Fatalities have been reported only in cases in which eszopiclone was combined with other drugs or alcohol. Overdose may be successfully treated with flumazenil, a GABAA receptor antagonist used also for benzodiazepine overdose. Poison control centers reported that between 2005 and 2006 there were 525 total eszopiclone overdoses recorded in the state of Texas, the majority of which were intentional suicide attempts. If consumed within the last hour, eszopiclone overdose can be treated with the administration of activated charcoal or via gastric lavage. == Interactions == There is an increased risk of central nervous system depression when eszopiclone is taken together with other CNS depressant agents, including antipsychotics, sedative hypnotics (like barbiturates or benzodiazepines), antihistamines, opioids, phenothiazines, and some antidepressants. There is also increased risk of central nervous system depression with other medications that inhibit the metabolic activities of the CYP3A4 enzyme system of the liver. Substances that inhibit this enzyme system include nelfinavir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin and grapefruit juice. Alcohol also has an additive effect when used concurrently with eszopiclone. Eszopiclone is most effective if it is not taken after a heavy meal with high fat content. == Pharmacology == Eszopiclone acts on benzodiazepine binding site situated on GABAA neurons as a positive allosteric modulator. Eszopiclone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with serum levels peaking between .45 and 1.3 hours. The elimination half-life of eszopiclone is approximately 6 hours and it is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation. Approximately 52% to 59% of a dose is weakly bound to plasma protein. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 are involved in the biotransformation of eszopiclone; thus, drugs that induce or inhibit these CYP isozymes may affect the metabolism of eszopiclone. Less than 10% of the orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as racemic zopiclone. In terms of benzodiazepine receptor binding and relevant potency, 3 mg of eszopiclone is equivalent to 10 mg of diazepam. == History == In a controversial 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, ""Lost in Transmission — FDA Drug Information That Never Reaches Clinicians"", it was reported that the largest of three Lunesta trials found that compared to placebo Lunesta ""was superior to placebo"" while it only shortened initial time falling asleep by 15 minutes on average. ""Clinicians who are interested in the drug’s efficacy cannot find efficacy information in the label: it states only that Lunesta is superior to placebo. The FDA’s medical review provides efficacy data, albeit not until page 306 of the 403-page document. In the longest, largest phase 3 trial, patients in the Lunesta group reported falling asleep an average of 15 minutes faster and sleeping an average of 37 minutes longer than those in the placebo group. However, on average, Lunesta patients still met criteria for insomnia and reported no clinically meaningful improvement in next-day alertness or functioning."" === Availability in Europe === On September 11, 2007, Sepracor signed a marketing deal with British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline for the rights to sell eszopiclone (under the name Lunivia rather than Lunesta) in Europe. Sepracor was expected to receive approximately $155 million if the deal went through. In 2008 Sepracor submitted an application to the EMA (the European Union's equivalent to the U.S. FDA) for authorization to market the drug in the EU, and initially received a favorable response. However, Sepracor withdrew its authorization application in 2009 after the EMA stated it would not be granting eszopiclone 'new active substance' status, as it was essentially pharmacologically and therapeutically too similar to zopiclone to be considered a new patentable product. Since the patent on zopiclone has expired, this ruling would have allowed rival companies to also legally produce cheaper generic versions of eszopiclone for the European market. As of November 2012, Sepracor has not resubmitted its authorization application and eszopiclone is not available in Europe. The deal with GSK fell through, and GSK instead launched a $3.3 billion deal to market Actelion's almorexant sleeping tablet, which entered phase 3 medical trials before development was abandoned due to side effects. == References ==",Estorra,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014065706636756659), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015135272406041622)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.061968132853507996)])","('MEDICAL; ([minclinic.eu](https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/E/Estorra.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='MIN — what is Estorra used for, medicine in english, dosing, side effects, generic, general information, pharmacology, interactions, contraindications, precautions, overdose, medication, treatment.', type='url_citation', url='https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/E/Estorra.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4130,"('Zopiclone', 'Imovane', 'Zimovane', 'Amoban', '(+-)-zopiclone')",Medical,"Zopiclone, sold under the brand name Imovane among others, is a nonbenzodiazepine, specifically a cyclopyrrolone, used to treat difficulty sleeping. Zopiclone is molecularly distinct from benzodiazepine drugs and is classed as a cyclopyrrolone. However, zopiclone increases the normal transmission of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system, via modulating GABAA receptors similarly to the way benzodiazepine drugs do inducing sedation but not with the anti-anxiety properties of the benzodiazepines. Zopiclone is a sedative. It works by causing a depression or tranquilization of the central nervous system. After prolonged use, the body can become accustomed to the effects of zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is abruptly stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Although withdrawal symptoms from therapeutic doses of zopiclone and its isomers (i.e., eszopiclone) do not typically present with convulsions and are therefore not considered life-threatening, patients may experience such significant agitation or anxiety that they seek emergency medical attention. In the United States, zopiclone is not commercially available, although its active stereoisomer, eszopiclone, is. Zopiclone is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. Zopiclone is known colloquially as a ""Z-drug"". Other Z-drugs include zaleplon and zolpidem and were initially thought to be less addictive than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken at the lowest effective dose, with a duration of 2–3 weeks for short-term insomnia. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with benzodiazepines, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system. == Medical uses == Zopiclone is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia where sleep initiation or sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms. Long-term use is not recommended, as tolerance, dependence, and addiction can occur. One low-quality study found that zopiclone is ineffective in improving sleep quality or increasing sleep time in shift workers, and more research in this area has been recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be superior to zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy. === Specific populations === ==== Elderly ==== Zopiclone, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Zopiclone increases postural sway and increases the number of falls in older people, as well as cognitive side effects. Falls are a significant cause of death in older people. An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as zopiclone, offer few if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the melatonin receptor agonists may be more suitable and effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined. ==== Liver disease ==== Patients with liver disease eliminate zopiclone much more slowly than normal patients and in addition experience exaggerated pharmacological effects of the drug. == Adverse reactions == Sleeping pills, including zopiclone, have been associated with an increased risk of death. The British National Formulary states adverse reactions as follows: ""taste disturbance (some report a metallic taste); less commonly nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache; rarely amnesia, confusion, depression, hallucinations, nightmares; very rarely light headedness, incoordination, paradoxical effects [...] and sleep-walking also reported"". == Contraindications == Zopiclone causes impaired driving skills similar to those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving, with users of hypnotic drugs even after one year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone as there is a significantly increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand-eye coordination. A double-blind study on the effect on performance of several hypnotic medications, relevant to military personnel who may have to be awakened to carry out duties, found that drugs listed in increasing order of performance impact duration were melatonin (with no impact), zaleplon, temazepam, and zopiclone. The effects on serial reaction time (SRT), logical reasoning (LRT), serial subtraction (SST), and multitask (MT) were measured. For zaleplon (10 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg) and temazepam (15 mg) respectively the times to recover normal performance for SRT were 3.25, 6.25, and 5.25 hours; for LRT 3.25, >6.25, and 4.25 hours; for SST 2.25, >6.25, and 4.25 hours; and for MT 2.25, 4.25, and 3.25 hours. The study did not consider the effectiveness of the drugs on sleep. == EEG and sleep == It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. Zopiclone reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. Zopiclone reduces the total amount of time spent in REM sleep as well as delaying its onset. In EEG studies, zopiclone significantly increases the energy of the beta frequency band, increasing stage 2. Zopiclone is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than zaleplon. Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines. == Overdose == Zopiclone is sometimes used as a method of suicide. It has a similar fatality index to that of benzodiazepine drugs, apart from temazepam, which is particularly toxic in overdose. Deaths have occurred from zopiclone overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs. Overdose of zopiclone may present with excessive sedation and depressed respiratory function that may progress to coma and possibly death. Zopiclone combined with alcohol, opiates, or other central nervous system depressants may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zopiclone overdosage can be treated with the GABAA receptor benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zopiclone from its binding site, thereby rapidly reversing its effects. Serious effects on the heart may also occur from a zopiclone overdose when combined with piperazine. Death certificates show the number of zopiclone-related deaths is on the rise. When taken alone, it usually is not fatal, but when mixed with alcohol or other drugs such as opioids, or in patients with respiratory, or hepatic disorders, the risk of a serious and fatal overdose increases. == Interactions == Zopiclone also interacts with trimipramine and caffeine. Alcohol has an additive effect when combined with zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Due to these risks and the increased risk for dependence, alcohol should be avoided when using zopiclone. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly. Rifampicin causes a very notable reduction in half-life of zopiclone and peak plasma levels, which results in a large reduction in the hypnotic effect of zopiclone. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may also provoke similar interactions. Ketoconazole and sulfaphenazole interfere with the metabolism of zopiclone. Nefazodone impairs the metabolism of zopiclone leading to increased zopiclone levels and marked next-day sedation. == Pharmacology == The therapeutic pharmacological properties of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind to the same sites on GABAA receptors, causing an enhancement of the actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to GABAA receptors containing α1, α2, α3, and α5 subunits. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug zopiclone, which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z drugs such as zolpidem and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness. Zopiclone is in the cyclopyrrolone family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include suriclone. Zopiclone, although molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability around 75–80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1–2 hours. A high-fat meal preceding zopiclone administration does not change absorption (as measured by AUC), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay the onset of therapeutic effects. The plasma protein-binding of zopiclone has been reported to be weak, between 45 and 80% (mean 52–59%). It is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues, including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva, and breast milk. Zopiclone is partly extensively metabolized in the liver to form an active N-demethylated derivative (N-desmethylzopiclone) and an inactive zopiclone-N-oxide. Hepatic enzymes playing the most significant role in zopiclone metabolism are CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. In addition, about 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs. In urine, the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the initial dose. Between 7 and 10% of zopiclone is recovered from the urine, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug before excretion. The terminal elimination half-life of zopiclone ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hours (5 hours on average). The pharmacokinetics of zopiclone in humans are stereoselective. After oral administration of the racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are higher than those of the respective antipodes. The pharmacokinetics of zopiclone are altered by aging and are influenced by renal and hepatic functions. In severe chronic kidney failure, the area under the curve value for zopiclone was larger and the half-life associated with the elimination rate constant longer, but these changes were not considered to be clinically significant. Sex and race have not been found to interact with pharmacokinetics of zopiclone. == Chemistry == The melting point of zopiclone is 178 °C. Zopiclone's solubility in water, at room temperature (25 °C) are 0.151 mg/mL. The logP value of zopiclone is 0.8. === Detection in biological fluids === Zopiclone may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by chromatographic methods. Plasma concentrations are typically less than 100 μg/L during therapeutic use, but frequently exceed 100 μg/L in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability and may exceed 1000 μg/L in acutely poisoned patients. Post mortem blood concentrations are usually in a range of 400 to 3900 μg/L in victims of fatal acute overdose. == History == Zopiclone was developed and first introduced in 1986 by Rhône-Poulenc S.A., now part of Sanofi, the main worldwide manufacturer. Initially, it was promoted as an improvement on benzodiazepines, but a recent meta-analysis found it was no better than benzodiazepines in any of the aspects assessed. On April 4, 2005, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration listed zopiclone under schedule IV, due to evidence that the drug has addictive properties similar to benzodiazepines. Zopiclone, as traditionally sold worldwide, is a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers, only one of which is active. In 2005, the pharmaceutical company Sepracor of Marlborough, Massachusetts, began marketing the active stereoisomer eszopiclone under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a generic drug in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Generic forms of Lunesta have since become available in the United States. Zopiclone is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, and New Zealand. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosage—the strongest eszopiclone dosage contains 3 mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (10 mg) contains 5 mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.). == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Zopiclone has the potential for non-medical use, dosage escalation, and drug dependence. It is taken orally and sometimes intravenously when used non-medically, and often combined with alcohol to achieve euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence. Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. Zopiclone may be more addictive than benzodiazepines. Those with a history of substance misuse or mental health disorders may be at an increased risk of high-dose zopiclone misuse. High dose misuse of zopiclone and increasing popularity amongst people who use substances who have been prescribed with zopiclone The symptoms of zopiclone addiction can include depression, dysphoria, hopelessness, slow thoughts, social isolation, worrying, sexual anhedonia, and nervousness. Zopiclone and other sedative hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Other sedating drugs, including benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with alcohol, illegal, or addictive prescription drugs, suggesting a high degree of potential for non-medical use of benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone, as with other hypnotic drugs, is sometimes used to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults. Zopiclone has crosstolerance with barbiturates and is able to suppress barbiturate withdrawal symptoms. It is frequently self-administered intravenously in studies on monkeys, suggesting a high risk of addictive potential. Zopiclone is in the top ten medications obtained using a false prescription in France. == References == == External links == Detailed pharmacological information Archived 2006-04-04 at the Wayback Machine Scheduling recommendation (PDF file) Details on scheduling Erowid zopiclone vault Support for zopiclone dependency/addiction Archived 2015-04-02 at the Wayback Machine",Amoban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.018651926890015602), ('ICAL', -3.2186455882765586e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02982412464916706)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6931484937667847)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/amoban?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='AMOBAN - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/amoban?utm_source=openai')])"
4131,"('(rs)-carbocisteine', 'S-(carboxymethyl)cysteine', 'S-(carboxymethyl)-dl-cysteine', 'Loviscol', 'Cysteine, s-(carboxymethyl)-')",Medical," To examine the effects of l-carbocisteine on airway infection with respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, human tracheal epithelial cells were pretreated with l-carbocisteine and infected with RS virus. Viral titer, virus RNA, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, including interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, increased with time after infection. l-carbocisteine reduced the viral titer in the supernatant fluids, the amount of RS virus RNA, RS virus infection susceptibility, and the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by virus infection. l-carbocisteine reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, an RS virus receptor, on the cells. However, l-carbocisteine had no effects on the expression of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan that binds to the RS virus attachment protein, or on the amount of intracellular activated-RhoA, isoform A of the Ras-homologous family, that binds to the RS virus fusion protein. These findings suggest that l-carbocisteine may inhibit RS virus infection by reducing the expression of ICAM-1. It may also modulate airway inflammation during RS virus infection. A novel method for the determination of carbocisteine (S-CMC), a mucolytic and expectorant drug with an acidic amino acid structure, was developed and validated, using non-suppressed ion-chromatographic system with conductimetric detection, and anion or cation exchange columns. Among the various combinations of column type and eluent composition tested, a cation exchange column with a 0.25 mM tri-fluoroacetic acid (TFA) as eluent in isocratic mode at 1.2 ml/min gave the best results.

4132,"('Methyltestosterone', 'Testred', 'Metandren', 'Android', 'Androsan')",Medical,"Methyltestosterone, sold under the brand names Android, Metandren, and Testred among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which is used in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men, delayed puberty in boys, at low doses as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, osteoporosis, and low sexual desire in women, and to treat breast cancer in women. It is taken by mouth or held in the cheek or under the tongue. Side effects of methyltestosterone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It can also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement in men and liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has moderate androgenic effects and moderate anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculinization. Methyltestosterone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in 1936. It was made shortly after the discovery of testosterone and was one of the first synthetic AAS to be developed. In addition to its medical use, methyltestosterone is used to improve physique and performance, although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for such purposes due to its androgenic effects, estrogenic effects, and risk of liver damage. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. == Uses == === Medical === Methyltestosterone is or has been used in the treatment of delayed puberty, hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women. It is specifically approved in the United States for the treatment of hypogonadism and delayed puberty in males and the treatment of advanced inoperable breast cancer in females. It was also approved in low doses in combination with esterified estrogens for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in women in the United States, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer used. Methyltestosterone is less effective in inducing masculinization than testosterone, but is useful for maintaining established masculinization in adults. The dosages of methyltestosterone used are 10 to 50 mg/day in men for common medical uses like hypogonadism and delayed puberty as well as physique- and performance-enhancing purposes and 2.5 mg/day in women for menopausal symptoms. Higher dosages of 50 to 200 mg/day have been used to treat women with inoperable breast cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies, although such dosages are associated with severe irreversible virilization. === Non-medical === Methyltestosterone is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters, although it is not commonly used relative to other AAS for such purposes. === Available forms === Methyltestosterone is typically used as an oral medication. It is also available under the brand names Metandren and Oreton Methyl for use specifically by buccal or sublingual administration. Methyltestosterone is available in the form of 2, 5, 10, and 25 mg oral tablets. It was also available in combination with estrogens as esterified estrogens/methyltestosterone (0.625 mg/1.25 mg, 1.25 mg/2.5 mg) and conjugated estrogens/methyltestosterone (0.625 mg/5.0 mg, 1.25 mg/10 mg). == Contraindications == Methyltestosterone should be used with caution in women and children, as it can cause irreversible virilization. Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate epiphyseal closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methyltestosterone should not be used in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression. The drug should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatotoxicity, due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity. == Side effects == Adverse effects of methyltestosterone include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, as well as estrogenic side effects like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages. Methyltestosterone can sometimes cause hepatotoxicity, for instance elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with extended use. It can also have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. AAS like methyltestosterone stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and increase hematocrit levels and at high dosages can cause polycythemia (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of thrombic events such as embolism and stroke. With long-term treatment, AAS can increase the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Violent and even homicidal behavior, hypomania/mania, depression, suicidality, delusions, and psychosis have all been associated with very high dosages of AAS. == Interactions == Aromatase inhibitors can be used to reduce or prevent the estrogenic effects of methyltestosterone and 5α-reductase inhibitors can be used to reduce its virilizing effects and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic side effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As an AAS, methyltestosterone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, and so is potentiated analogously in so-called ""androgenic"" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient aromatization into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. The drug possesses negligible progestogenic activity. Due to its combined disadvantages of a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, and the potential for hepatotoxicity (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Methyltestosterone has dramatically improved oral bioavailability and metabolic stability relative to testosterone. This difference is due to the C17α methyl group, which results in steric hindrance and prevents metabolism. The oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone is about 70%, and it is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Methyltestosterone can also be taken buccally or sublingually. Although effective orally, methyltestosterone is more effective by these non-oral routes, which are said to approximately double its bioavailability and require half the oral dosage. Circulating levels of methyltestosterone with administration of 1.25 to 2.5 mg/day oral methyltestosterone in women are in the range of 20 to 30 ng/dL. For comparison to testosterone, methyltestosterone is at least as potent as an AAS. However, due to the large decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and hence increase in free unbound testosterone caused by methyltestosterone, androgenic effects may be greater than reflected merely by methyltestosterone levels. ==== Distribution ==== Methyltestosterone is highly protein-bound, by approximately 98%. The medication has low but significant affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 25% of that of testosterone and 5% of that of DHT. ==== Metabolism ==== The biological half-life of methyltestosterone is approximately 3 hours (range 2.5–3.5 hours). The duration of action of methyltestosterone is said to be 1 to 3 days, and is described as relatively short among AAS. ==== Excretion ==== Methyltestosterone is excreted 90% in the urine as conjugates and other metabolites, and 6% in feces. == Chemistry == Methyltestosterone, also known as 17α-methyltestosterone or as 17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone differing from it only in the presence of a methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of methyltestosterone include metandienone (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone) and fluoxymesterone (9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone). === Derivatives === Methyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are the parent structures of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and stanozolol. === Synthesis === A chemical synthesis of methyltestosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with methandriol as an intermediate proceeds as follows: == History == Methyltestosterone was first synthesized in 1935 along with methandriol and mestanolone. It was the second synthetic AAS to be developed, following mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) in 1934, and was the first 17α-alkylated AAS to be synthesized. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1936. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Methyltestosterone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of the drug and its generic name in English and Japanese, while méthyltestostérone is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and French name and metiltestosterone is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana and Italian name. The generic name of the drug is methyltestosterone in Latin, methyltestosteron in German, and metiltestosterona in Spanish. Methyltestosterone is also known by its former developmental code name NSC-9701. === Brand names === Brand names under which methyltestosterone is or has been marketed for medical use include Afro, Agovirin, Android, Androral, Mesteron, Metandren, Methitest, Methyltestosterone, Methyl Testosterone, Oraviron, Oreton, Oreton Methyl, Testormon, Testovis, Testred, and Virilon, among others. ==== With an estrogen ==== Methyltestosterone is available at a low-dose in combination with esterified estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes in women under the brand names Covaryx, Essian, Estratest, Menogen, and Syntest. === Availability === ==== United States ==== Although it is not commonly used, methyltestosterone is one of the few AAS that remains available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone, testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone undecanoate, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and fluoxymesterone. ==== Other countries ==== Methyltestosterone has also been marketed in many other countries throughout the world. === Legal status === Methyltestosterone, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act and a schedule IV controlled substance in Canada under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. == See also == Esterified estrogens/methyltestosterone Conjugated estrogens/methyltestosterone == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Methyltestosterone"".

4133,"('Clomipramine hydrochloride', 'Clomipramine hcl', 'Anafranil', 'Chlorimipramine hydrochloride', 'Chloroimipramine monohydrochloride')",Medical,"Clomipramine, sold under the brand name Anafranil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is used in the treatment of various conditions, most notably obsessive–compulsive disorder but also many other disorders, including hyperacusis, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, trichotillomania, body dysmorphic disorder and chronic pain. It has also been notably used to treat premature ejaculation and the cataplexy associated with narcolepsy. It may also address certain fundamental features surrounding narcolepsy besides cataplexy (especially hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations). The evidence behind this, however, is less robust. As with other antidepressants (notably including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), it may paradoxically increase the risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, at least in the first few weeks of treatment. It is typically taken by mouth, although intravenous preparations are sometimes used. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, loss of appetite, sleepiness, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and trouble urinating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicidal behavior in those under the age of 25, seizures, mania, and liver problems. If stopped suddenly, a withdrawal syndrome may occur with headaches, sweating, and dizziness. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but is believed to involve increased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Clomipramine was discovered in 1964 by the Swiss drug manufacturer Ciba-Geigy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Clomipramine has a number of uses in medicine, including in the treatment of: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which happens to be its only US FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration-labeled indication. Other regulatory agencies (such as the TGA of Australia and the MHRA of the UK) have also approved clomipramine for this indication. Major depressive disorder (MDD), a popular off-label use in the US. It is approved by the Australian TGA and the United Kingdom MHRA for this indication. In Japan it is also approved for depression. Some have suggested the possible superior efficacy of clomipramine compared to other antidepressants in the treatment of MDD, especially the more severe, although at the current time the evidence may be insufficient to more fully substantiate this claim. As-with other tricyclic antidepressants, the antidepressant response specifically may be augmented, including in treatment-resistant cases, with triiodothyronine, at a dosage of 50 mcg. In the case of clomipramine specifically, this may also be the case with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Body dysmorphic disorder Repetitive self-injurious/self-harming behaviours in those with intellectual disability specifically. The subtype of systemised paranoia characterised by somatic phenomena. Compulsive nail-biting (onychophagia). Cataplexy associated with narcolepsy. This is a TGA and MHRA-labeled indication for clomipramine. Self-bloodletting Premature ejaculation, where it may be more effective than paroxetine Depersonalization-derealization disorder Chronic pain with or without organic disease, particularly headache of the tension type. Developmental stuttering Sleep paralysis, with or without narcolepsy Enuresis (involuntary urinating in sleep) in children. The effect may not be sustained following treatment, and alarm therapy may be more effective in both the short-term and the long-term. Combining a tricyclic (such as clomipramine) with anticholinergic medication may be more effective for treating enuresis than the tricyclic alone. Trichotillomania In combination with lithium and tryptophan for severe, particularly treatment-resistant depression. This combination, in a similar vein, has also been used for clomipramine-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. When electro-convulsive therapy is performed alongside this treatment-regime (as may be the case in severe depression and accompanied with thyroxine,) however, great care must be taken with lithium. The overall risk of seizures may have to be weighted against the refractory severity of the current illness and necessity of the amalgamation of treatment(s). Isolated cataplexy unto itself (i.e., in the absence of characteristically associated narcolepsy), admittedly a rare condition There is anecdotal and tentative, as-yet-undocumented information suggesting that clomipramine may address certain core features of hyperacusis, and possibly misophonia. In the case of hyperacusis, this appears to be especially the case at doses > 150 mg/d. As-with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a full response to any one dose may not be experienced for up to 12–16 weeks. Although lithium is most-associated with the treatment of bipolar disorder (where it is known for its general mood-stabilising features and to be especially useful in treating and preventing mania), it may have a certain place in the management of treatment-resistant depression (which is often of higher severity than other depressions which have not been addressed with ECT). In these cases is often prescribed alongside SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine), venlafaxine and various of the tricyclics (e.g., clomipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, maprotiline), which is why it may feature sometimes in the discussion of depression being managed with clomipramine. Lithium also significantly reduces the long-term risk of suicide in general. In any case, it is not necessary to have a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (manic-depressive illness), or even to be considered to have subtle elements of it (“soft bipolarity”), to benefit from lithium in the context of treatment with clomipramine. In a meta-analysis of various trials involving fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Faverin/Luvox), and sertraline (Zoloft) to test their relative efficacies in treating OCD, clomipramine was found to be significantly more effective. Other studies have borne similar results even when risk of bias is eliminated. A potentially significantly greater inherent side-effect profile, however, makes it a second-line choice in the treatment of OCD. SSRIs are generally better-tolerated but appear to be inferior in terms of actual clinical efficacy. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Known hypersensitivity to clomipramine, or any of the excipients or cross-sensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants of the dibenzazepine group Recent myocardial infarction Any degree of heart block or other cardiac arrhythmias Mania Severe liver disease Narrow angle glaucoma Untreated urinary retention It must not be given in combination or within 3 weeks before or after treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. (Moclobemide-included; however, clomipramine may be initiated sooner at 48 hours following discontinuation of moclobemide.) === Pregnancy and lactation === Clomipramine use during pregnancy is associated with congenital heart defects in the newborn. It is also associated with reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. Clomipramine is also distributed in breast milk and hence nursing while taking clomipramine is advised against. == Side effects == Clomipramine has been associated with the side effects listed below: Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1–10% frequency): Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): Convulsions Ataxia Arrhythmias Elevated blood pressure Activation of psychotic symptoms Very rare (<0.01% frequency): Conduction disorder (e.g. widening of QRS complex, prolonged QT interval, PR/PQ interval changes, bundle-branch block, torsade de pointes, particularly in patients with hypokalaemia) Individual side-effects may or may not be amendable to treatment. As noted below, bethanechol may alleviate anti-muscarinic/anti-cholinergic side-effects. It may also treat sexual side-effects common to the likes of clomipramine, SSRIs and phenelzine. Topiramate has been used to off-set the weight-gain induced from various antidepressants and antipsychotics, and more broadly for general weight-loss (likewise with bupropion). This option may be especially attractive in patients either overweight prior to clomipramine treatment or who have gained an undesirable amount of weight on it. Another potential advantage of topiramate in the adjunctive treatment of people taking clomipramine is engendered in its status as an anti-convulsant medication, thereby theoretically increasing the seizure-threshold in patients (which clomipramine decreases to an extent which precludes its dosage ranging above 250 m.g./d. in normal circumstances, likewise with maprotiline and its 225 m.g./d. upper-ceiling). It may, thus, be useful and of increased importance in any case for patients with a familial or personal history of epilepsy or seizures of some other kind to concurrently take a daily dose of an anti-convulsant drug (topiramate, gabapentin, etc.) should they require or opt for treatment with an antidepressant which reduces the seizure-threshold significantly (bupropion, clomipramine, amoxapine, maprotiline, venlafaxine). In the case of seizures occurring due to overdose of tricyclic antidepressants, intravenous lorazepam may successfully terminate them. Phenytoin may or may not prevent them in the first instance but its status as an appropriate acute treatment for these seizures is somewhat controversial. Tremor may be relieved with a beta-blocker (e.g., pindolol, propranolol, atenolol). In certain cases of tremor, pindolol may be an especially sensible option for serious consideration, as there is substantial evidence that its utilisation is an effective augmentation-strategy for obsessive-compulsive disorder, an important indication for clomipramine. == Withdrawal == Withdrawal symptoms may occur during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between the return of the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important. Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when clomipramine is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive cholinergic activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by tricyclic antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate. == Overdose == Clomipramine overdose usually presents with the following symptoms: There is no specific antidote for overdose and all treatment is purely supportive and symptomatic. Treatment with activated charcoal may be used to limit absorption in cases of oral overdose. Anyone suspected of overdosing on clomipramine should be hospitalised and kept under close surveillance for at least 72 hours. Clomipramine has been reported as being less toxic in overdose than most other TCAs in one meta-analysis but this may well be due to the circumstances surrounding most overdoses as clomipramine is more frequently used to treat conditions for which the rate of suicide is not particularly high such as OCD. In another meta-analysis, however, clomipramine was associated with a significant degree of toxicity in overdose. == Interactions == Clomipramine may interact with a number of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine, antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine due to the fact that clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine)] and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin-toxicity | serotonin syndrome). Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors, due to the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity. Fluvoxamine increases the serotoninergic effects of clomipramine and, likewise, clomipramine increases fluvoxamine levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Clomipramine is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, or a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); that is, it blocks the reuptake of these neurotransmitters back into neurons by preventing them from interacting with their transporters, thereby increasing their extracellular concentrations in the synaptic cleft and resulting in increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. In addition, clomipramine also has antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, antidopaminergic, and anticholinergic activities. It is specifically an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 receptor, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5). Like other TCAs, clomipramine weakly blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels as well. Probably all “anticholinergic” side-effects may be successfully reversed in a majority of people with bethanechol chloride, although knowledge of this amenability has unfortunately decreased in medical circles over the decades. Bethanechol supplementation arguably should, however, be seriously considered as an add-on treatment when tricyclics (which often carry significant anti-muscarinic effects, especially for amitriptyline, protriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine) are prescribed, as it may alleviate potentially otherwise-limiting side-effects (blurry vision, dry mouth, urinary hesitancy/retention, etc.). This practice can make drugs of otherwise indispensably potent value more tolerable to certain patients and spare them needless suffering, hence-reducing the overall side-effect burden or concern thereof. Although clomipramine shows around 100- to 200-fold preference in affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) over the norepinephrine transporter (NET), its major active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (norclomipramine), binds to the NET with very high affinity (Ki = 0.32 nM) and with dramatically reduced affinity for the SERT (Ki = 31.6 nM). Moreover, desmethylclomipramine circulates at concentrations that are approximately twice those of clomipramine. In accordance, occupancy of both the SERT and the NET has been shown with clomipramine administration in positron emission tomography studies with humans and non-human primates. As such, clomipramine is in fact a fairly balanced SNRI rather than only a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). The antidepressant effects of clomipramine are thought to be due to reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine, while serotonin reuptake inhibition only is thought to be responsible for the effectiveness of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. Conversely, antagonism of the H1, α1-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is thought to contribute to its side effects. Blockade of the H1 receptor is specifically responsible for the antihistamine effects of clomipramine and side effects like sedation and somnolence (sleepiness). Antagonism of the α1-adrenergic receptor is thought to cause orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. Inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is responsible for the anticholinergic side effects of clomipramine like dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive/memory impairment. In overdose, sodium channel blockade in the brain is believed to cause the coma and seizures associated with TCAs while blockade of sodium channels in the heart is considered to cause cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. On the other hand, sodium channel blockade is also thought to contribute to the analgesic effects of TCAs, for instance in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The exceptionally strong serotonin reuptake inhibition of clomipramine likely precludes the possibility of its antagonism of serotonin receptors (which it binds to with more than 100-fold lower affinity than the SERT) resulting in a net decrease in signaling by these receptors. In accordance, while serotonin receptor antagonists like cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine are effective as antidotes against serotonin syndrome, clomipramine is nonetheless capable of inducing this syndrome. In fact, while all TCAs are SRIs and serotonin receptor antagonists to varying extents, the only TCAs that are associated with serotonin syndrome are clomipramine and to a lesser extent its dechlorinated analogue imipramine, which are the two most potent SRIs of the TCAs (and in relation to this have the highest ratios of serotonin reuptake inhibition to serotonin receptor antagonism). As such, whereas other TCAs can be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (with caution due to the risk of hypertensive crisis from NET inhibition; sometimes done in treatment-resistant depressives), clomipramine cannot be due to the risk of serotonin syndrome and death. Unlike the case of its serotonin receptor antagonism, orthostatic hypotension is a common side effect of clomipramine, suggesting that its blockade of the α1-adrenergic receptor is strong enough to overcome the stimulatory effects on the α1-adrenergic receptor of its NET inhibition. ==== Serotonergic activity ==== Clomipramine is an extremely strong SRI by all accounts. Its affinity for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14 nM, which is considerably higher than that of other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, amitriptyline, and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4 nM, 4.3 nM, and 8.3 nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a terminal half-life that is around twice as long as that of amitriptyline and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200 mg/day). Some health authorities recommend daily dosage is in the range of 30 to 75 mg in single or divided doses. Initial dosage should be 10 mg/day with gradual increments to 30–150 mg/day in divided doses or as a single dose at bedtime. Health Canada recommends maximum dose for outpatients is preferred at 200 mg/day. Sustained-release 75 mg formulation may be preferable at doses above 150 mg/day (i.e. 200 mg to 250 mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and imipramine. For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is more potent as an SRI than any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); it is more potent than paroxetine, which is the strongest SSRI. A positron emission tomography study found that a single low dose of 10 mg clomipramine to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50 mg fluvoxamine. In the study, single doses of 5 to 50 mg clomipramine resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while single doses of 12.5 to 50 mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with clomipramine and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20 mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20 mg/day citalopram. These results indicate that very low doses of clomipramine are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that clomipramine achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, clomipramine may be able to achieve more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine. If the ratios of the 80% SERT occupancy dosage and the approved clinical dosage range are calculated and compared for SSRIs, SNRIs, and clomipramine, it can be deduced that clomipramine is by far the strongest SRI used medically. The lowest approved dosage of clomipramine can be estimated to be roughly comparable in SERT occupancy to the maximum approved dosages of the strongest SSRIs and SNRIs. Because their mechanism of action was originally not known and dose-ranging studies were never conducted, first-generation antipsychotics were dramatically overdosed in patients. It has been suggested that the same may have been true for clomipramine and other TCAs. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that many may, indeed, benefit from much higher doses. 250 mg/d, as mentioned elsewhere, is the typical maximum recommended dose but some people may need as much as 300 mg/d or more to benefit from all clomipramine has to offer beyond its potent SNRI capacity alone. ==== Obsessive–compulsive disorder ==== Clomipramine was the first drug that was investigated for and found to be effective in the treatment of OCD. In addition, it was the first drug to be approved by the FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration in the United States for the treatment of OCD. The effectiveness of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD is far greater than that of other TCAs, which are comparatively weak SRIs; a meta-analysis found pre- versus post-treatment effect sizes of 1.55 for clomipramine relative to a range of 0.67 for imipramine and 0.11 for desipramine. In contrast to other TCAs, studies have found that clomipramine and SSRIs, which are more selective SRIs, have similar effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. However, multiple meta-analyses have found that clomipramine nonetheless retains a significant effectiveness advantage relative to SSRIs; in the same meta-analysis mentioned previously, the effect sizes of SSRIs in the treatment of OCD ranged from 0.81 for fluoxetine to 1.36 for sertraline (relative to 1.55 for clomipramine). However, the effectiveness advantage for clomipramine has not been apparent in head-to-head comparisons of clomipramine versus SSRIs for OCD. The differences in effectiveness findings could be due to differences in methodologies across non-head-to-head studies. Relatively high doses of SSRIs are needed for effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. Studies have found that high dosages of SSRIs above the normally recommended maximums are significantly more effective in OCD treatment than lower dosages (e.g., 250 to 400 mg/day sertraline versus 200 mg/day sertraline). In addition, the combination of clomipramine and SSRIs has also been found to be significantly more effective in alleviating OCD symptoms, and clomipramine is commonly used to augment SSRIs for this reason. Studies have found that intravenous clomipramine, which is associated with very high circulating concentrations of the drug and a much higher ratio of clomipramine to its metabolite desmethylclomipramine, is more effective than oral clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. There is a case report of complete remission from OCD for approximately one month following a massive overdose of fluoxetine, an SSRI with a uniquely long duration of action. Taken together, stronger serotonin reuptake inhibition has consistently been associated with greater alleviation of OCD symptoms, and since clomipramine, at the clinical dosages in which it is employed, is effectively the strongest SRI used medically (see table above), this may underlie its unique effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. In addition to serotonin reuptake inhibition, clomipramine is also a mild but clinically significant antagonist of the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors at high concentrations. Addition of antipsychotics, which are potent dopamine receptor antagonists, to SSRIs, has been found to significantly augment their effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. As such, besides strong serotonin reuptake inhibition, clomipramine at high doses might also block dopamine receptors to treat OCD symptoms, and this could additionally or alternatively be involved in its possible effectiveness advantage over SSRIs. For this reason, it may also be that augmentation with neuroleptics (a common procedure in the occurrence of inadequate response to monotherapy with an SRI) is needed with less frequency with clomipramine relative to SSRIs, the latter of-which apparently lack significant activity as dopamine-receptor antagonists. Although clomipramine is probably more effective in the treatment of OCD compared to SSRIs, it is greatly inferior to them in terms of tolerability and safety due to its lack of selectivity for the SERT and promiscuous pharmacological activity. In addition, clomipramine has high toxicity in overdose and can potentially result in death, whereas death rarely, if ever, occurs with overdose of SSRIs. It is for these reasons that clomipramine, in spite of potentially superior effectiveness to SSRIs, is now rarely used as a first-line agent in the treatment of OCD, with SSRIs being used as first-line therapies instead and clomipramine generally being reserved for more severe cases and as a second-line agent. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of clomipramine is approximately 50%. Peak plasma concentrations occur around 2–6 hours (with an average of 4.7 hours) after taking clomipramine orally and are in the range of 56–154 ng/mL (178–489 nmol/L). Steady-state concentrations of clomipramine are around 134–532 ng/mL (426–1,690 nmol/L), with an average of 218 ng/mL (692 nmol/L), and are reached after 7 to 14 days of repeated dosing. Steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, are around 230–550 ng/mL (730–1,750 nmol/L). The volume of distribution (Vd) of clomipramine is approximately 17 L/kg. It binds approximately 97–98% to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. Clomipramine is metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP2D6. It has a terminal half-life of 32 hours, and its N-desmethyl metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, has a terminal half-life of approximately 69 hours. Clomipramine is mostly excreted in urine (60%) and feces (32%). Although the normal maximum-recommended total daily dosage of clomipramine is 250 milligrams, treatment-resistant cases of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder may require corresponding doses within the range of 255 to 300 milligrams. Indeed, doses of 375 milligrams per day, sometimes in combination with venlafaxine or aripiprazole, have not only been necessary but, remarkably, relatively well-tolerated. Caution, however, is generally prudent when doing this, as seizures, which are more likely to occur with clomipramine than every other tricyclic antidepressant besides maprotiline, become more and more of a risk beyond the normally-recommended upper-ceiling. At daily doses ≤ 250 m.g., the incidence of seizures may be reliably estimated to be around the order of 0.48%. (All tricyclic antidepressants technically lower the seizure-threshold but this is only significant with amoxapine, maprotiline and, indeed, clomipramine.) Dose-increases between 25 m.g. and 150 m.g., barring significant drug-drug interactions which may elevate clomipramine blood-levels, should be titrated in doses of 50 m.g. (25 m.g. in the case of panic disorder and 10 to 25 m.g. in the cases of premature ejaculation and narcoleptic cataplexy) and above 150 m.g. in 25 m.g. increments. Average optimal total daily doses for depression (whether mild or severe), premature ejaculation, cataplexy-narcolepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and trichotilomania respectively are (in milligrams) 150, 50, 25 - 75, 150 - 250, 50 - 150 and 150 - 200. Some consider the minimum optimally-therapeutic dose of clomipramine in obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often requires much higher levels of serotoninergic concentration than other indications for these drugs, to be 200, rather than 150, milligrams per day. For premature ejaculation, clomipramine can be taken prn 3 to 5 hours before attempted sexual intercourse. == Chemistry == Clomipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, and trimipramine. Clomipramine is a derivative of imipramine with a chlorine atom added to one of its rings and is also known as 3-chloroimipramine. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethylclomipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of clomipramine is 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H23ClN2 with a molecular weight of 314.857 g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 303-49-1 and of the hydrochloride is 17321–77–6. == History == Clomipramine was developed by Geigy as a chlorinated derivative of imipramine. It was first referenced in the literature in 1961 and was patented in 1963. The drug was first approved for medical use in Europe in the treatment of depression in 1970, and was the last of the major TCAs to be marketed. In fact, clomipramine was initially considered to be a ""me-too drug"" by the FDA, and in relation to this, was declined licensing for depression in the United States. As such, to this day, clomipramine remains the only TCA that is available in the United States that is not approved for the treatment of depression, in spite of the fact that it is a highly effective antidepressant. Clomipramine was eventually approved in the United States for the treatment of OCD in 1989 and became available in 1990. It was the first drug to be investigated and found effective in the treatment of OCD. The benefits in OCD were first reported by Juan José López-Ibor in 1967, and the first double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of clomipramine for OCD was conducted in 1976, with more rigorous clinical studies that solidified its effectiveness conducted in the 1980s. It remained the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of OCD for many years until the introduction of the SSRIs, which have since largely superseded it due to greatly improved tolerability and safety (although notably not effectiveness). Clomipramine is the only TCA that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD and that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of OCD; the other TCAs failed clinical trials for this indication, likely due to insufficient serotonergic activity. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Clomipramine is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while clomipramine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Clomipramina is its generic name in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, while clomipramin is its generic name in German and clomipraminum is its generic name in Latin. === Brand names === Clomipramine is marketed throughout the world mainly under the brand names Anafranil and Clomicalm for use in humans and animals, respectively. == Veterinary uses == In the US, clomipramine is only licensed to treat separation anxiety in dogs for which it is sold under the brand name Clomicalm. It has proven effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorders in cats and dogs. In dogs, it has also demonstrated similar efficacy to fluoxetine in treating tail chasing. In dogs some evidence suggests its efficacy in treating noise phobia. Clomipramine has also demonstrated efficacy in treating urine spraying in cats. Various studies have been done on the effects of clomipramine on cats to reduce urine spraying/marking behavior. It has been shown to be able to reduce this behavior by up to 75% in a trial period of four weeks. == References ==",Anafranil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.111314072157256e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005628670332953334)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/anafranil.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Anafranil Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/anafranil.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is also used to prevent worsening of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can be taken in various ways including by mouth, injection into a muscle, and inhalation. Common side effects with long-term use include osteoporosis, cataracts, thrush, and muscle weakness. Serious side effects may include psychosis, increased risk of infections, adrenal suppression, and bronchospasm. Use in pregnancy is generally safe. It works by decreasing inflammation and immune system activity. Triamcinolone was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1958. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 102nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Triamcinolone is used to treat various medical conditions, such as eczema, alopecia areata, lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, ulcerative colitis, lupus, sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, ocular inflammation, keloids, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, aphthous ulcers (usually as triamcinolone acetonide), central retinal vein occlusion, visualization during vitrectomy and the prevention of asthma attacks. The derivative triamcinolone acetonide is the active ingredient in various topical skin preparations (cream, lotion, ointment, aerosol spray) designed to treat such skin conditions as rash, inflammation, redness, or intense itching due to eczema and dermatitis. == Contraindications == Contraindications for systemic triamcinolone are similar to those of other corticoids. They include systemic mycoses (fungal infections) and parasitic diseases, as well as eight weeks before and two weeks after application of live vaccines. For long-term treatment, the drug is also contraindicated in people with peptic ulcers, severe osteoporosis, severe myopathy, certain viral infections, glaucoma, and metastasizing tumours. There are no contraindications for use in emergency medicine. == Side effects == The side effects of triamcinolone are similar to other corticosteroids. In short-term treatment of up to ten days, it has very few adverse effects; however, sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding is seen, as well as acute infections (mainly viral) and impaired glucose tolerance. Side effects of triamcinolone long-term treatment may include coughing (up to bronchospasms), sinusitis, metabolic syndrome–like symptoms such as high blood sugar and cholesterol, weight gain due to water retention, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as cataract, thrush, osteoporosis, reduced muscle mass, and psychosis. Triamcinolone injections can cause bruising and joint swelling. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itch, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing, and anaphylaxis. == Overdose == No acute overdosing of triamcinolone has been described. == Interactions == Drug interactions are mainly pharmacodynamic, that is, they result from other drugs either adding to triamcinolone's corticosteroid side effects or working against its desired effects. They include: Atropine and other anticholinergics can substantially increase pressure in the eyes. Antidiabetic drugs can become less effective because triamcinolone causes diabetes-like symptoms. Aspirin and other NSAIDs, as well as anticoagulants such as warfarin, add to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Diuretics that excrete potassium (such as loop diuretics and thiazides) can increase the risk of hypokalemia and thus lead to abnormal heart rhythm. Cardiac glycosides may have more adverse effects due to reduced potassium levels in the blood. The risk for blood count changes is increased when combining triamcinolone with ACE inhibitors. Triamcinolone and other drugs can also influence each other's concentrations in the body, amounting to pharmacokinetic interactions such as: Rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and other inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 speed up metabolization of triamcinolone and can therefore reduce its effectiveness. Conversely, CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, can increase its concentrations in the body and the risk for adverse effects. Blood concentrations of ciclosporin can be increased. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid that is about five times as potent as cortisol but has very few mineralocorticoid effects. === Pharmacokinetics === When taken by mouth, the drug's bioavailability is over 90%. It reaches its highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to two hours and is bound to plasma proteins to about 80%. The biological half-life from the plasma is 200 to 300 minutes; due to stable complexes of triamcinolone and its receptor in the intracellular fluid, the total half-life is significantly longer at about 36 hours. A small fraction of the substance is metabolized to 6-hydroxy- and 20-dihydro-triamcinolone; most of it probably undergoes glucuronidation, and a smaller part sulfation. Three-quarters are excreted via the urine, and the rest via the faeces. Due to corticoids' mechanism of action, the effects are delayed as compared to plasma concentrations. Depending on the route of administration and the treated condition, the onset of action can be from two hours up to one or two days after application; and the drug can act much longer than its elimination half-life would suggest. == Chemistry == Triamcinolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyhydrocortisone or 9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyprednisolone as well as 9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. The substance is a light-sensitive, white to off-white, crystalline powder, or has the form of colourless, matted crystals. It has no odour or is nearly odourless. Information on the melting point varies, partly due to the substance's polymorphism: 260 to 263 °C (500 to 505 °F), 264 to 268 °C (507 to 514 °F), or 269 to 271 °C (516 to 520 °F) can be found in the literature. Solubility is 1:500 in water and 1:240 in ethanol; it is slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in chloroform and diethylether, and practically insoluble in dichloromethane. The specific rotation is [ α ] D 20 {\displaystyle [\alpha ]_{D}^{20}} +65° to +72° cm3/dm·g (1% in dimethylformamide). == Society and culture == In 2010, Teva and Perrigo launched the first generic inhalable triamcinolone. According to Chang et al. (2014), ""Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is classified as an S9 glucocorticoid in the 2014 Prohibited List published by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which caused it to be prohibited in international athletic competition when administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly or rectally"". == References == == External links == ""Triamcinolone Topical"".

Structurally, sufentanil differs from fentanyl through the addition of a methoxymethyl group on the piperidine ring (which increases potency but is believed to reduce duration of action), and the replacement of the phenyl ring by thiophene. Sufentanil first was synthesized at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1974. == Medical uses == Sufentanil offers properties of sedation and can be used as analgesic component of anesthetic regimen during an operation. Because of its extremely high potency, it is often used in surgery and post-operative pain management for patients that are heavily opioid dependent/opioid tolerant because of long term opiate use for chronic pain or illicit opiate use. It is also used in surgery and post-operative pain control in people that are taking high dose buprenorphine for chronic pain because it has the potency and binding affinity strong enough to displace buprenorphine from the opioid receptors in the central nervous system and provide analgesia. In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dsuvia, a sublingual tablet form of the drug, that was developed in a collaboration between AcelRx Pharmaceuticals and the United States Department of Defense for use in battlefield settings where intravenous (IV) treatments may not be readily available. The decision to approve this new potent synthetic opioid came under criticism from politicians and from the chair of the FDA advisory committee, who fear that the tablets will be easily diverted to the illegal drug market. Dsuvia has since been withdrawn from the market due to ""unresolvable manufacturing constraints."" == Overdose == === Management === Because sufentanil is very potent, practitioners must be prepared to reverse the effects of the drug should the patient exhibit symptoms of overdose such as respiratory depression or respiratory arrest. As for all other opioid-based medications, naloxone (trade name Narcan) is the definitive antidote for overdose. Depending on the amount administered, it can reverse the respiratory depression and, if enough is administered, completely reverse the effects of sufentanil. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Sufentanil is marketed under various brand names including Dsuvia, Dzuveo, Sufenta, and Sufentil. == References ==",Zalviso,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.04926014691591263), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014299895614385605)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/zalviso?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=103, start_index=9, title='Zalviso | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/zalviso?utm_source=openai')])"
4137,"('Chlorhexidine', 'Rotersept', 'Fimeil', 'Hexadol', 'Soretol')",Medical,"Chlorhexidine is a disinfectant and antiseptic with the molecular formula C22H30Cl2N10, which is used for skin disinfection before surgery and to disinfect surgical instruments. It is also used for cleaning wounds, preventing dental plaque, treating yeast infections of the mouth, and to keep urinary catheters from blocking. It is used as a liquid or a powder. It is commonly used in salt form, either the gluconate or the acetate. Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although, apart from discoloration, the risk appears to be the same as that for povidone-iodine. Chlorhexidine rinse is also known to have a bitter metallic aftertaste. Rinsing with water is not recommended as it is known to increase the bitterness. It may cause eye problems if direct contact occurs. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Chlorhexidine may come mixed in alcohol, water, or surfactant solution. It is effective against a range of microorganisms, but does not inactivate spores. Chlorhexidine came into medical use in the 1950s and is available over the counter in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 230th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Uses == Chlorhexidine is used in disinfectants (disinfection of the skin and hands), cosmetics (additive to creams, toothpaste, deodorants, and antiperspirants), and pharmaceutical products (preservative in eye drops, active substance in wound dressings and antiseptic mouthwashes). In endodontics, chlorhexidine has been used for root canal irrigation and as an intracanal dressing. === Antiseptic === Chlorhexidine is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, and yeasts. It is particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria (in concentrations ≥ 1 μg/L). Significantly higher concentrations (10 to more than 73 μg/mL) are required for Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Chlorhexidine is ineffective against polioviruses and adenoviruses. The effectiveness against herpes viruses has not yet been established unequivocally. There is strong evidence that chlorhexidine is more effective than povidone-iodine for clean surgery. Evidence shows that it is an effective antiseptic for upper limb surgery. Meta-data spanning several decades shows that the efficacy of chlorhexidine (against organisms that cause surgical site infection) has not changed, dispelling concerns over emerging resistance. === Dental use === Use of a chlorhexidine-based mouthwash in combination with normal tooth care can help reduce the build-up of plaque and improve mild gingivitis. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect in moderate to severe gingivitis. Its use as a mouthwash has a number of adverse effects including damage to the mouth lining, tooth discoloration, tartar build-up, and impaired taste. Extrinsic tooth staining occurs when chlorhexidine rinse has been used for four weeks or longer. Mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine which stain teeth less than the classic solution have been developed, many of which contain chelated zinc. Chlorhexidine is a cation which interacts with anionic components of toothpaste, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium monofluorophosphate, and forms salts of low solubility and reduced antibacterial activity. Hence, to enhance the antiplaque effect of chlorhexidine, ""it seems best that the interval between toothbrushing and rinsing with CHX [chlorhexidine] be more than 30 minutes, cautiously close to two hours after brushing"". === Topical === Chlorhexidine gluconate is used as a skin cleanser for surgical scrubs, as a cleanser for skin wounds, for preoperative skin preparation, and for germicidal hand rinses. Chlorhexidine eye drops have been used as a treatment for eyes affected by Acanthamoeba keratitis. Chlorhexidine is a very effective antiseptic and its use is growing in the world for treating the umbilical cord. A 2015 Cochrane review has yielded high-quality evidence that within the community setting, chlorhexidine skin or cord care can reduce the incidence of omphalitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) by 50% and neonatal mortality by 12%. == Side effects == Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although apart from discoloration the risk appears to be the same as povidone-iodine. Chlorhexidine is ototoxic (toxic to the inner ear). If put into a ruptured ear canal it may lead to deafness. Chlorhexidine does not meet European specifications for a hand disinfectant. Under the test conditions of the European Standard EN 1499, no significant difference in the efficacy was found between a 4% solution of chlorhexidine digluconate and soap. In the US, between 2007 and 2009, Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center conducted a cluster-randomized trial and concluded that daily bathing of patients in intensive care units with washcloths saturated with chlorhexidine gluconate reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Whether prolonged exposure over many years may have carcinogenic potential is still not clear. The US Food and Drug Administration recommendation is to limit the use of a chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash to a maximum of six months. When ingested, chlorhexidine is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and can cause stomach irritation or nausea. If aspirated into the lungs at high enough concentration, as reported in one case, it can be fatal due to the high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. == Mechanism of action == At physiologic pH, chlorhexidine salts dissociate and release the positively charged chlorhexidine cation. The bactericidal effect is a result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls. At low concentrations of chlorhexidine, this results in a bacteriostatic effect; at high concentrations, membrane disruption results in cell death. == Chemistry == It is a cationic polybiguanide (bisbiguanide). == Deactivation == Chlorhexidine is deactivated by forming insoluble salts with anionic compounds, including the anionic surfactants commonly used as detergents in toothpastes and mouthwashes, anionic thickeners such as carbomer, and anionic emulsifiers such as acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, among many others. For this reason, chlorhexidine mouth rinses should be used at least 30 minutes after other dental products. == Synthesis == The structure is based on two molecules of proguanil, linked with a hexamethylenediamine spacer. == Society and culture == === Brands === Chlorhexidine topical is sold as Betasept, Biopatch, Calgon Vesta, ChloraPrep One-Step, Dyna-Hex, Hibiclens, Hibistat Towelette, Scrub Care Exidine, and Spectrum-4, among others. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash is sold as Dentohexin, Paroex, Peridex, PerioChip, Corsodyl and Periogard, among others. == Veterinary medicine == In animals, chlorhexidine is used for topical disinfection of wounds, and to manage skin infections. Chlorhexidine-based disinfectant products are used in the dairy farming industry. Post-surgical respiratory problems have been associated with the use of chlorhexidine products in cats. == References ==",Soretol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0019413690315559506)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.486383855342865), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.0041909487918019295), ('ĠPERSON', -0.009379606693983078), ('AL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.3589766240329482e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16069157421588898)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4138,"('Salmeterol xinafoate', 'Salmetedur', 'Arial', 'Gr 33343x xinafoate', 'Salmeterol 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate')",Medical,"Arial is a sans-serif typeface in the neo-grotesque style. Fonts from the Arial family are included with all versions of Microsoft Windows after Windows 3.1, as well as in other Microsoft programs, Apple's macOS, and many PostScript 3 printers. In Office 2007, Arial was replaced by Calibri as the default typeface in PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. The typeface was designed in 1982 by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders, for Monotype Typography. It is metrically compatible with Helvetica, enabling documents to use either typeface without affecting the visual layout. Because of their similar appearance, Arial and Helvetica are commonly mistaken for each other. == Etymology == The name Arial was derived from the word ""aerial"", introduced as a trademark by Monotype. == Design characteristics == Embedded in version 3.0 of the OpenType version of Arial is the following description of the typeface: A contemporary sans serif design, Arial contains more humanist characteristics than many of its predecessors and as such is more in tune with the mood of the last decades of the twentieth century. The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial style sans serif faces. Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance. Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions. In 2005, Robin Nicholas said, ""It was designed as a generic sans serif; almost a bland sans serif."" Arial is a neo-grotesque typeface: a design based on nineteenth-century sans-serifs, but regularized to be more suited to continuous body text and to form a cohesive font family. Apart from the need to match the character widths and approximate/general appearance of Helvetica, the letter shapes of Arial are also strongly influenced by Monotype's own Monotype Grotesque designs—released in the 1920s or earlier Venus in the mid-1900s with additional influence from ""New Grotesque""—an abortive redesign from 1956. The designs of the R, G and r also resemble Gill Sans. The changes cause the typeface to nearly match Linotype Helvetica in both proportion and weight (see figure), and perfectly match in width. Monotype executive Allan Haley observed, ""Arial was drawn more rounded than Helvetica, the curves softer and fuller and the counters more open. The ends of the strokes on letters such as c, e, g and s, rather than being cut off on the horizontal, are terminated at the more natural angle in relation to the stroke direction."" Matthew Carter, a consultant for IBM during its design process, described it as ""a Helvetica clone, based ostensibly on their Grots 215 and 216"". The styling of Arabic glyphs comes from Times New Roman, which have more varied stroke widths than the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic glyphs found in the font. Arial Unicode MS uses monotone stroke widths on Arabic glyphs, similar to Tahoma. The Cyrillic, Greek and Coptic Spacing Modifier Letters glyphs initially introduced in Arial Unicode MS, but later debuted in Arial version 5.00, have different appearances. == History == IBM debuted two printers for the in-office publishing market in 1982: the 240-DPI 3800-3 laserxerographic printer, and the 600-DPI 4250 electro-erosion laminate typesetter. Monotype was under contract to supply bitmap fonts for both printers. The fonts for the 4250, delivered to IBM in 1983, included Helvetica, which Monotype sub-licensed from Linotype. For the 3800–3, Monotype replaced Helvetica with Arial. The hand-drawn Arial artwork was completed in 1982 at Monotype by a 10-person team led by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders and was digitized by Monotype at 240 DPI expressly for the 3800–3. IBM named the font Sonoran Sans Serif due to licensing restrictions and the manufacturing facility's location (Tucson, Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert), and announced in early 1984 that the Sonoran Sans Serif family, ""a functional equivalent of Monotype Arial"", would be available for licensed use in the 3800-3 by the fourth quarter of 1984. There were initially 14 point sizes, ranging from 6 to 36, and four style/weight combinations (Roman medium, Roman bold, italic medium, and italic bold), for a total of 56 fonts in the family. Each contained 238 graphic characters, providing support for eleven national languages: Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Monotype and IBM later expanded the family to include 300-DPI bitmaps and characters for additional languages. In 1989, Monotype produced PostScript Type 1 outline versions of several Monotype fonts, but an official PostScript version of Arial was not available until 1991. In the meantime, a company called Birmy marketed a version of Arial in a Type 1-compatible format. In 1990, Robin Nicholas, Patricia Saunders and Steve Matteson developed a TrueType outline version of Arial which was licensed to Microsoft. In 1992, Microsoft chose Arial to be one of the four core TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1, announcing the font as an ""alternative to Helvetica"". Matthew Carter has noted that the deal was complex and included a bailout of Monotype, which was in financial difficulties, by Microsoft. Microsoft would later extensively fund the development of Arial as a font that supported many languages and scripts. Monotype employee Rod McDonald noted: As to the widespread notion that Microsoft did not want to pay licensing fees [for Helvetica], [Monotype director] Allan Haley has publicly stated, more than once, that the amount of money Microsoft paid over the years for the development of Arial could finance a small country. Arial ultimately became one of several clones of PostScript standard fonts created by Monotype in collaboration with or sold to Microsoft around this time, including Century Gothic (a clone of ITC Avant Garde), Book Antiqua (Palatino) and Bookman Old Style (ITC Bookman). == Distribution == TrueType editions of Arial have shipped as part of Microsoft Windows since the introduction of Windows 3.1 in 1992; Arial was the default font. From 1999 until 2016, Microsoft Office shipped with Arial Unicode MS, a version of Arial that includes many international characters from the Unicode standard. This version of the typeface was for a time the most widely distributed pan-Unicode font. The font was dropped from Microsoft Office 2016 and has been deprecated; continuing growth of the number of characters in Unicode and limitations on the number of characters in a font meant that Arial Unicode could no longer perform the job it was originally created for. Arial MT, a PostScript version of the Arial font family, was distributed with Acrobat Reader 4 and 5. PostScript does not require support for a specific set of fonts, but Arial and Helvetica are among the 40 or so typeface families that PostScript Level 3 devices typically support. Mac OS X (now known as macOS) was the first Mac OS version to include Arial; it was not included in classic Mac OS. The operating system ships with Arial, Arial Black, Arial Narrow, and Arial Rounded MT. However, the default macOS font for sans-serif/Swiss generic font family is Helvetica. The bundling of Arial with Windows and macOS has contributed to it being one of the most widely distributed and used typefaces in the world. In 1996, Microsoft launched the Core fonts for the Web project to make a standard pack of fonts for the Internet. Arial in TrueType format was included in this project. The project allowed anyone to download and install these fonts for their own use (on end user's computers) without any fee. The project was terminated by Microsoft in August 2002, allegedly due to frequent EULA violations. For MS Windows, the core fonts for the web were provided as self-extracting executables (.exe); each included an embedded cabinet file, which can be extracted with appropriate software. For the Macintosh, the files were provided as BinHexed StuffIt archives (.sit.hqx). The latest font version that was available from Core fonts for the Web was 2.82, published in 2000. Later versions (such as version 3 or version 5 which include many new characters) were not available from this project. A Microsoft spokesman declared in 2002 that members of the open-source community ""will have to find different sources for updated fonts. ... Although the EULA did not restrict the fonts to just Windows and Mac OS, they were only ever available as Windows .exe's and Mac archive files."" The chief technical officer of Opera Software cited the cancellation of the project as an example of Microsoft resisting interoperability. == Arial variants == The known variants of Arial include: Arial: Sometimes called Arial Regular to distinguish its width from Arial Narrow, it contains Arial (Roman text weight), Arial Italic, Arial Bold, Arial Bold Italic Arial Unicode MS Arial Black: Arial Black, Arial Black Italic. This weight is known for being particularly heavy. This is because the face was originally drawn as a bitmap, and to increase the weight, stroke widths for bold went from a single pixel width to two pixels in width. It only supports Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. Arial Narrow: Arial Narrow Regular, Arial Narrow Bold, Arial Narrow Italic, Arial Narrow Bold Italic. This family is a condensed version. Arial Rounded: Arial Rounded Light, Arial Rounded Regular, Arial Rounded Medium, Arial Rounded Bold, Arial Rounded Extra Bold. The regular versions of the rounded glyphs can be found in Gulim, Microsoft's Korean font set. Originally only available in bold form as Arial Rounded MT Bold, extra fonts appeared as retail products. In Linotype's retail version, only Arial Rounded Regular supports WGL character set. Arial Special: Arial Special G1, Arial Special G2. They are included with Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 99, Expedia Streets and Trips 2000, MapPoint 2000. Arial Light, Arial Medium, Arial Extra Bold, Arial Light Condensed, Arial Condensed, Arial Medium Condensed, Arial Bold Condensed: These fonts first appeared in the Linotype online stores. The condensed fonts do not have italic counterparts. Arial Monospaced: In this monospaced variant, letters such as @, I (uppercase i), i, j, l (lowercase L), M, W are redesigned. === Arial Alternative === Arial Alternative Regular and Arial Alternative Symbol are standard fonts in Windows ME, and can also be found on Windows 95 and Windows XP installation discs, and on Microsoft's site. Both fonts are Symbol-encoded. These fonts emulate the monospaced font used in Minitel/Prestel teletext systems, but vectorized with Arial styling. These fonts are used by HyperTerminal. Arial Alternative Regular contains only ASCII characters, while Arial Alternative Symbol contains only 2 × 3 semigraphics characters. === Code page variants === Arial Baltic, Arial CE, Arial Cyr, Arial Greek, Arial Tur are aliases created in the FontSubstitutes section of WIN.INI by Windows. These entries all point to the master font. When an alias font is specified, the font's character map contains different character set from the master font and the other alias fonts. In addition, Monotype also sells Arial in reduced character sets, such as Arial CE, Arial WGL, Arial Cyrillic, Arial Greek, Arial Hebrew, Arial Thai. Arial Unicode is a version supporting all characters assigned with Unicode 2.1 code points. === Arial Nova === Arial Nova's design is based on the 1982's Sonora Sans bitmapped fonts, which were in fact Arial renamed to avoid licensing issues. It was bundled with Windows 10 and up, and is offered free of charge on Microsoft Store. It contains Regular, Bold and Light weights, corresponding italics and corresponding Condensed widths. == Monotype/Linotype retail versions == === Arial === The TrueType core Arial fonts (Arial, Arial Bold, Arial Italic, Arial Bold Italic) support the same character sets as the version 2.76 fonts found in Internet Explorer 5/6, Windows 98/ME. Version sold by Linotype includes Arial Rounded, Arial Monospaced, Arial Condensed, Arial Central European, Arial Central European Narrow, Arial Cyrillic, Arial Cyrillic Narrow, Arial Dual Greek, Arial Dual Greek Narrow, Arial SF, Arial Turkish, Arial Turkish Narrow. In addition, Monotype also sells Arial in reduced character sets, such as Arial CE, Arial WGL, Arial Cyrillic, Arial Greek, Arial Hebrew, Arial Thai, Arial SF. === Arial WGL === It is a version that covers only the Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4) characters. They are only sold in TrueType format. The family includes Arial (regular, bold, italics), Arial Black, Arial Narrow (regular, bold, italics), Arial Rounded (regular, bold). === Ascender Corporation fonts === Ascender Corporation sells the font in Arial WGL family, as well as the Arial Unicode. == Arial in other font families == Arial glyphs are also used in fonts developed for non-Latin environments, including Arabic Transparent, BrowalliaUPC, Cordia New, CordiaUPC, Miriam, Miriam Transparent, Monotype Hei, and Simplified Arabic. == Free alternatives == Arial is a proprietary typeface to which Monotype Imaging owns all rights, including software copyright and trademark rights (under U.S. copyright law, Monotype cannot legally copyright the shapes of the actual glyphs themselves). Its licensing terms prohibit derivative works and free redistribution. There are some free software metric-compatible fonts used as free Arial alternatives or used for Arial font substitution: Liberation Sans is a metrically equivalent font to Arial developed by Ascender Corp. and published by Red Hat in 2007, initially under the GPL license with some exceptions. Versions 2.00.0 onwards are published under SIL Open Font License. It is used in some Linux distributions as default font replacement for Arial. Liberation Sans Narrow is a metrically equivalent font to Arial Narrow contributed to Liberation fonts by Oracle in 2010, but is not included in 2.00.0. Google commissioned a variation named Arimo for ChromeOS. URW++ produced a version of Helvetica called Nimbus Sans L in 1987, and it was eventually released under the GPL and AFPL (as Type 1 font for Ghostscript) in 1996. It is one of the Ghostscript fonts, free alternatives to 35 basic PostScript fonts (which include Helvetica). FreeSans, a free font descending from URW++ Nimbus Sans L, which in turn descends from Helvetica. It is one of free fonts developed in GNU FreeFont project, first published in 2002. It is used in some free software as Arial replacement or for Arial font substitution. TeX Gyre Heros, a free font descending from URW++ Nimbus Sans L, which in turn descends from Helvetica.

Targeting CSCs represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify selective inhibitors of breast CSCs (BCSCs). We carried out a cell-based phenotypic screening with cell viability as a primary endpoint, using a collection of 2,546 FDA-approved drugs and drug-like molecules in spheres formed by malignant human breast gland-derived cells (HMLER-shEcad cells, representing BCSCs) and control immortalized non-tumorigenic human mammary cells (HMLE cells, representing normal stem cells). 19 compounds were identified from screening. The chemically related molecules benztropine mesylate and deptropine citrate were selected for further validation and both potently inhibited sphere formation and self-renewal of BCSCs in vitro. Benztropine mesylate treatment decreased cell subpopulations with high ALDH activity and with a CD44+/CD24- phenotype. In vivo, benztropine mesylate inhibited tumor-initiating potential in a 4T1 mouse model. Functional studies indicated that benztropine mesylate inhibits functions of CSCs via the acetylcholine receptors, dopamine transporters/receptors, and/or histamine receptors. In summary, our findings identify benztropine mesylate as an inhibitor of BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. This study also provides a screening platform for identification of additional anti-CSC agents. In this case report, we describe a rather unique case of a 37-year-old male patient suffering from schizophrenia who presented with a fixed upwards gaze diagnosed as oculogyric crisis (OGC). This presentation was attributed to the effects of risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic, while concomitantly taking benztropine mesylate. The latter is a medication commonly used to prevent dystonia in this type of patient population. Interestingly, the dose of risperidone was minimal, and side effects were not expected, making this presentation rare and not often cited or represented in the medical literature, given that second-generation antipsychotics are known to have a safer side effect profile when compared to their counterparts. We also aim to provide a review of the literature on this topic and describe the approach to diagnosis and treatment of such. In this double-blind, four-week study, 28 chronic schizophrenic patients receiving neuroleptic medication plus the antiparkinsonian drug, benztropine mesylate, were either switched to placebo or maintained on benztropine. Patients withdrawn from benztropine reliably increased their overall scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale in comparison with the drug group. Sub-test scores suggest that deficits in attention and concentration were induced by treatment with benztropine. Psychotic decompensation appeared to develop simultaneously with extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in some patients, but only 14.2 per cent of the placebo group experienced extrapyramidal symptoms severe enough to require resumption of benztropine therapy. It is suggested that antiparkinsonian agents should be prescribed only if and when EPS occur.",Tropine benzohydryl ether mesylate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.20141880214214325), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007078214082866907), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04863978922367096)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugfuture.com/chemdata/benztropine-mesylate.html ', [])"

It is not available in the United States. Bromopride appears to be safe and effective for use in pregnancy. == Indications == Bromopride is indicated in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV); gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD/GORD); and as preparation for endoscopy and radiographic studies of the gastrointestinal tract. The manufacturer also claims it is valuable in, among other indications, hiccups and gastrointestinal adverse effects of radiation therapy. == Adverse effects == Bromopride is generally well tolerated; the most common adverse effects of its use are somnolence and fatigue. Bromopride may rarely cause extrapyramidal symptoms and, as with metoclopramide, may increase prolactin levels. == Chemistry == Bromopride is a substituted benzamide, closely related to metoclopramide.

4141,"('Milnacipran hcl', 'Milnacipran hydrochloride', 'Dalcipran', 'Savella', '(1r-cis)-milnacipran hydrochloride')",Medical,"Milnacipran (trade names Ixel, Savella, Dalcipran, Toledomin) is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) used in the clinical treatment of fibromyalgia. It is not approved for the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder in the US, but it is in other countries. == Medical uses == === Depression === In a pooled analysis of 7 comparative trials with imipramine, milnacipran and imipramine were shown to have comparable efficacy while milnacipran was significantly better tolerated. A pooled analysis of studies comparing milnacipran and SSRIs concluded a superior efficacy for milnacipran with similar tolerability for milnacipran and SSRIs. A more recent meta-analysis of 6 studies involving more than 1,000 patients showed no distinction between milnacipran and SSRIs in efficacy or discontinuation rates, including discontinuation for side effects or lack of efficacy. A meta-analysis of a total of 16 randomized controlled trials with more than 2200 patients concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant agents. However, compared with TCAs, significantly fewer patients taking milnacipran dropped out due to adverse events. As with other antidepressants, 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before significant antidepressant action becomes clinically evident. === Impulse Control === Milnacipran was found to improve impulse control in rats, which has been linked to its activation of D1-like receptors in the infralimbic cortex. However, high doses of milnacipran did not show this effect, likely because of increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Depression has been associated with increased impulsivity. === Fibromyalgia === During its development for fibromyalgia, milnacipran was evaluated utilizing a composite responder approach. To be considered as a responder for the composite ‘treatment of fibromyalgia’ endpoint, each patient had to show concurrent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, physical function, and global impression of disease status. A systematic review in 2015 showed moderate relief for a minority of people with fibromyalgia. Milnacipran was associated with increased adverse events when discontinuing use of the drug. === Social anxiety === There is some evidence that milnacipran may be effective for social anxiety. == Contraindications == Administration of milnacipran should be avoided in individuals with the following: Known hypersensitivity to milnacipran (absolute contraindication) Patients under 15 years of age (no sufficient clinical data) Concomitant treatment with irreversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. tranylcypromine (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil), >10 mg selegiline) or digitalis glycosides is an absolute contraindication. Administration of milnacipran should be done with caution in individuals with the following: Concomitant treatment with parenteral epinephrine, norepinephrine, with clonidine, reversible MAO-A Inhibitors (such as moclobemide, toloxatone) or 5-HT1D-agonists (e.g. triptan migraine drugs) Advanced renal disease (decreased dosage required) Hypertrophy of the prostate gland (possibly urination hesitancy induced), with hypertension and heart disease (tachycardia may be a problem) as well as with open angle glaucoma. Milnacipran should not be used during pregnancy because it may cross the placenta barrier and no clinical data exists on harmful effects in humans and animal studies. Milnacipran is contraindicated during lactation because it is excreted in the milk, and it is not known if it is harmful to the newborn. == Side effects == The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than placebo) were nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, hot flush, hyperhydrosis, vomiting, palpitations, heart rate increase, dry mouth, and hypertension [FDA Savella prescribing information]. Milnacipran can have a significant impact on sexual functions, including both a decrease in sexual desire and ability. Milnacipran can cause pain of the testicles in men. The incidence of cardiovascular and anticholinergic side effects was significantly lower compared to TCAs as a controlled study with over 3,300 patients revealed. Elevation of liver enzymes without signs of symptomatic liver disease has been infrequent. Mood swing to mania has also been seen and dictates termination of treatment. In psychotic patients emergence of delirium has been noticed. Milnacipran has a low incidence of sedation but improves sleep (both duration and quality) in depressed patients. In agitated patients or those with suicidal thoughts additive sedative/anxiolytic treatment is usually indicated. However, several studies found that there seems to be no ""activation syndrome"" and no increased risk of suicidality in milnacipran therapy; instead it is said to reduce suicidality along with depressive symptoms. == Interactions == MAOIs — hyperserotonergia (serotonin syndrome), potentially lethal hypertensive crisis 5-HT1 receptor agonists — coronary vasoconstriction with risk of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction Epinephrine, norepinephrine (also in local anesthesia) — hypertensive crisis and/or possible cardiac arrhythmia Clonidine — antihypertensive action of clonidine may be antagonized Digitalis — hemodynamic actions increased Triptans — there have been rare postmarketing reports of hyperserotonergia (serotonin syndrome). If concomitant treatment of milnacipran with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of patient is advised when starting or increasing dosages. Alcohol — no interactions known; however, because milnacipran can cause mild elevation of liver enzymes, caution is recommended; the FDA advises against the concomitant use of alcohol and milnacipran == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Milnacipran inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in an approximately 2:1 ratio, respectively. Milnacipran exerts no significant actions on H1, α1, D1, D2, and mACh receptors, nor on benzodiazepine and opioid binding sites. Recently, levomilnacipran, the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, has been found to act as an inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which is responsible for β-amyloid plaque formation, and hence may be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Other BACE-1 inhibitors, such as CTS-21166 (ASP1720), MK-8931, and AZD3293 were in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but in both cases clinical trials were halted due to a lack of positive evidence of a favorable benefit to risk ratio and both were considered unlikely to return satisfactory results. === Pharmacokinetics === Milnacipran is well absorbed after oral dosing and has a bioavailability of 85%. Meals do not have an influence on the rapidity and extent of absorption. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 2 hours after oral dosing. The elimination half-life of 8 hours is not increased by liver impairment and old age, but by significant renal disease. Milnacipran is conjugated to the inactive glucuronide and excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and conjugate. Only traces of active metabolites are found. == History == Milnacipran was first approved for the treatment of major depressive episodes in France in December 1996. It is currently marketed (as Ixel) for this indication in over 45 countries worldwide including several European countries such as Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Portugal, and Russia. It is also available in Japan (as Toledomin) and Mexico (as Dalcipran). Cypress Bioscience bought the exclusive rights for approval and marketing of the drug for any purpose in the United States and Canada in 2003 from the manufacturer Laboratoires Pierre Fabre. In January 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved milnacipran (under the brand name Savella) only for the treatment of fibromyalgia, making it the third medication approved for this purpose in the United States. In July and November 2009, the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorization for a milnacipran product (under the brand name Impulsor) for the treatment of fibromyalgia. == References == == External links == ""Milnacipran"".

4142,"('Clonidine hcl', 'N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1h-imidazol-2-amine hydrochloride', 'Kapvay', 'Catapresan', 'Clonidine (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Clonidine, sold under the brand name Catapres among others, is an α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist medication used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug withdrawal (e.g., alcohol, opioids, or nicotine), menopausal flushing, diarrhea, spasticity, and certain pain conditions. The drug is often prescribed off-label for tics. It is used orally (by mouth), by injection, or as a transdermal skin patch. Onset of action is typically within an hour with the effects on blood pressure lasting for up to eight hours. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, hypotension, and sleepiness. Severe side effects may include hallucinations, heart arrhythmias, and confusion. If rapidly stopped, withdrawal effects may occur, such as a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Clonidine lowers blood pressure by stimulating α2-adrenergic receptors in the brain, which results in relaxation of many arteries. Clonidine was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1966. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 71st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clonidine is used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); drug withdrawal, including from (alcohol, opioids, and/or nicotine);menopausal flushing, diarrhea, and certain pain conditions, in addition to It also sees some use off-label for episodic insomnia, tics (e.g. from Tourette Syndrome, restless legs syndrome, and anxiety, among others. === Resistant hypertension === Clonidine may be effective for lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension. Clonidine works by slowing the pulse rate and exerts a reduction of serum concentrations of renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Clonidine may improve symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in some people but causes many adverse effects and the beneficial effect is modest. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA. Clonidine, along with methylphenidate, has been studied for treatment of ADHD. While not as effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, clonidine does offer some benefit; it can also be useful in combination with stimulant medications. Some studies show clonidine to be more sedating than guanfacine, which may be better at bedtime along with an arousing stimulant in the morning. Clonidine has been used to reduce sleep disturbances in ADHD, including to help offset stimulant-associated insomnia. Unlike stimulant medications, clonidine is regarded as having no abuse potential, and may even be used to reduce abuse of drugs including nicotine and cocaine. In the US, only the extended-release form of clonidine is approved for ADHD treatment. === Drug withdrawal === Clonidine may be used to ease drug withdrawal symptoms associated with abruptly stopping the long-term use of opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, and nicotine. It can alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms by reducing the sympathetic nervous system response such as tachycardia and hypertension, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hot and cold flashes, and akathisia. It may also be helpful in aiding smokers to quit. The sedation effect can also be useful. Clonidine may also reduce severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome in infants born to mothers that are using certain drugs, particularly opioids. In infants with neonatal withdrawal syndrome, clonidine may improve the neonatal intensive care unit Network Neurobehavioral Score. Clonidine has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of dexmedetomidine withdrawal. === Spasticity === Clonidine has some role in the treatment of spasticity caused by spinal cord injury, acting principally by inhibiting excessive sensory transmission below the level of injury. Its use, however, is mainly as a second or third line agent, due to side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and drowsiness. Clonidine can be administered intrathecally, which confers various benefits, including a reduction or prevention of the blood pressure lowering effects and increased effectiveness against spasticity. The effectiveness of intrathecal clonidine is comparable to that of intrathecal baclofen for spasticity. === Clonidine suppression test === The reduction in circulating norepinephrine by clonidine was used in the past as an investigatory test for phaeochromocytoma, which is a catecholamine-synthesizing tumor, usually found in the adrenal medulla. In a clonidine suppression test, plasma catecholamine levels are measured before and 3 hours after a 0.3 mg oral test dose has been given to the patient. A positive test occurs if there is no decrease in plasma levels. === Other uses === Clonidine also has several off-label uses, and has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Clonidine is also a mild sedative, and can be used as premedication before surgery or procedures. It has also been studied as a way to calm acute manic episodes. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, and postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. Clonidine can be used in restless legs syndrome. It can also be used to treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine has also been used to treat refractory diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, diarrhea associated with opioid withdrawal, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors, and cholera. Clonidine can be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (specifically for tics). Clonidine has also had some success in clinical trials for helping to remove or ameliorate the symptoms of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). Injection of α2-adrenergic receptor agonists into the knee joint space, including clonidine, may reduce the severity of knee pain after arthroscopic knee surgery. Light-activated derivatives of clonidine (adrenoswitches) have been developed for research purposes and shown to control pupillary reflex with light in blind mice by topical application. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is classified by the TGA of Australia as pregnancy category B3, which means that it has shown some detrimental effects on fetal development in animal studies, although the relevance of this to human beings is unknown. Clonidine appears in high concentration in breast milk; a nursing infant's serum clonidine concentration is approximately 2/3 of the mother's. Caution is warranted in women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. == Adverse effects == The principal adverse effects of clonidine are sedation, dry mouth, and hypotension (low blood pressure). By frequency Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1–10% frequency): Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): Rare (<0.1% frequency): === Withdrawal === Because clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow, resulting in lower blood pressure, sudden discontinuation can result in acute hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic outflow. In extreme cases, this can result in a hypertensive crisis, which is a medical emergency. Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound effects from occurring. Treatment of clonidine withdrawal hypertension depends on the severity of the condition. Reintroduction of clonidine for mild cases, alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers should never be used alone to treat clonidine withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Clonidine crosses the blood–brain barrier. ==== High blood pressure ==== Clonidine treats high blood pressure by stimulating α2 receptors in the brainstem, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure. It has specificity towards the presynaptic α2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding has a sympatholytic effect, suppresses release of norepinephrine, ATP, renin, and neuropeptide Y which if released would increase vascular resistance.: 201–203 Clonidine also acts as an agonist at imidazoline-1 (I1) receptors in the brain, and it is hypothesized that this effect may contribute to reducing blood pressure by reducing signaling in the sympathetic nervous system; this effect acts upstream of the central α2 agonist effect of clonidine.: 201–203 Clonidine may also cause bradycardia, theoretically by increasing signaling through the vagus nerve. When given intravenously, clonidine can temporarily increase blood pressure by stimulating α1 receptors in smooth muscles in blood vessels. This hypertensive effect is not usual when clonidine is given orally or by the transdermal route.: 201–203 Plasma concentration of clonidine exceeding 2.0 ng/mL does not provide further blood pressure reduction. ==== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ==== In the setting of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clonidine's molecular mechanism of action occurs due to its agonism at the α2A adrenergic receptor, the subtype of the adrenergic receptor that is most principally found in the brain. Within the brain, the α2A adrenergic receptors are found within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), among other areas. The α2A adrenergic receptors are found on the presynaptic cleft of a given neuron, and, when activated by an agonist, the effect on downstream neurons is inhibitory. The inhibition is accomplished by preventing the secretion of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Thus, clonidine's agonism on α2A adrenergic receptors in the PFC inhibits the action of downstream neurons by preventing the secretion of norepinephrine. This mechanism is similar to the brain's physiological inhibition of PFC neurons by the locus ceruleus (LC), which secretes norepinephrine into the PFC. Although norepinephrine can also bind to target adrenergic receptors on the downstream neuron (otherwise inducing a stimulatory effect), norepinephrine also binds to α2A adrenergic receptors (akin to clonidine's mechanism of action), inhibiting the release of norepinephrine by that neuron and inducing an inhibitory effect. Because the PFC is required for working memory and attention, it is thought that clonidine's inhibition of PFC neurons helps to eliminate irrelevant attention (and subsequent behaviors), improving the person's focus and correcting deficits in attention. ==== Growth hormone test ==== Clonidine stimulates release of GHRH hormone from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone. This effect has been used as part of a ""growth hormone test,"" which can assist with diagnosing growth hormone deficiency in children. === Pharmacokinetics === After being ingested, clonidine is absorbed into the blood stream rapidly with an overall bioavailability around 70–80%. Peak concentrations in human plasma occur within 60–90 minutes for the ""immediate release"" (IR) version of the drug, which is shorter than the ""extended release"" (ER/XR) version. Clonidine is fairly lipid soluble with the logarithm of its partition coefficient (log P) equal to 1.6; to compare, the optimal log P to allow a drug that is active in the human central nervous system to penetrate the blood brain barrier is 2.0. Less than half of the absorbed portion of an orally administered dose will be metabolized by the liver into inactive metabolites, with roughly the other half being excreted unchanged by the kidneys. About one-fifth of an oral dose will not be absorbed, and is thus excreted in the feces. Work with liver microsomes shows in the liver clonidine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (66%), CYP1A2 (10–20%), and CYP3A (0–20%) with negligible contributions from the less abundant enzymes CYP3A5, CYP1A1, and CYP3A4. 4-hydroxyclonidine, the main metabolite of clonidine, is also an α2A agonist but is non lipophilic and is not believed to contribute to the effects of clonidine since it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Measurements of the half-life of clonidine vary widely, between 6 and 23 hours, with the half-life being greatly affected by and prolonged in the setting of poor kidney function. Variations in half-life may be partially attributable to CYP2D6 genetics. Some research has suggested the half-life of clonidine is dose dependent and approximately doubles upon chronic dosing, while other work contradicts this. Following a 0.3 mg oral dose, a small study of five patients by Dollery et al. (1976) found half-lives ranging between 6.3 and 23.4 hours (mean 12.7). A similar N=5 study by Davies et al. (1977) found a narrower range of half-lives, between 6.7 and 13 hours (mean 8.6), while an N=8 study by Keraäen et al. that included younger patients found a somewhat shorter mean half-life of 7.5 hours. == History == Clonidine was introduced in 1966.

4147,"('Clopidogrel bisulfate', 'Iscover', 'Clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate', 'Plavix', 'Clopidogrel hemisulfate')",Medical,"Clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix among others, is an antiplatelet medication used to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in those at high risk. It is also used together with aspirin in heart attacks and following the placement of a coronary artery stent (dual antiplatelet therapy). It is taken by mouth. Its effect starts about two hours after intake and lasts for five days. Common side effects include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and heartburn. More severe side effects include bleeding and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. While there is no evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has not been well studied. Clopidogrel is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelets. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12 on platelets. Clopidogrel was patented in 1982, and approved for medical use in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Clopidogrel is used to prevent heart attack and stroke in people who are at high risk of these events, including those with a history of myocardial infarction and other forms of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and those with peripheral artery disease. Treatment with clopidogrel or a related drug is recommended by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology for people who: Present for treatment with a myocardial infarction with ST-elevation including A loading dose given in advance of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a full year of treatment for those receiving a vascular stent A loading dose given in advance of fibrinolytic therapy, continued for at least 14 days Present for treatment of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina Including a loading dose and maintenance therapy in those receiving PCI and unable to tolerate aspirin therapy Maintenance therapy for up to 12 months in those at medium to high risk for which a noninvasive treatment strategy is chosen In those with stable ischemic heart disease, treatment with clopidogrel is described as a ""reasonable"" option for monotherapy in those who cannot tolerate aspirin, as is treatment with clopidogrel in combination with aspirin in certain high risk patients. It is also used, along with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), for the prevention of thrombosis after placement of a coronary stent or as an alternative antiplatelet drug for people intolerant to aspirin. It is available as a fixed-dose combination with aspirin. A meta-analysis found clopidogrel's benefit as an antiplatelet drug in reducing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke to be 25% benefit in smokers, with little (8%) benefit in non-smokers. Consensus-based therapeutic guidelines also recommend the use of clopidogrel rather than aspirin (ASA) for antiplatelet therapy in people with a history of gastric ulceration, as inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by ASA can exacerbate this condition. In people with healed ASA-induced ulcers, however, those receiving ASA plus the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole had a lower incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding than those receiving clopidogrel. However, prophylaxis with proton-pump inhibitors along with clopidogrel following acute coronary syndrome may increase adverse cardiac outcomes, possibly due to inhibition of CYP2C19, which is required for the conversion of clopidogrel to its active form. The European Medicines Agency has issued a public statement on a possible interaction between clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors. However, several cardiologists have voiced concern that the studies on which these warnings are based have many limitations and that it is not certain whether an interaction between clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors is real. == Adverse effects == Serious adverse drug reactions associated with clopidogrel therapy include: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (incidence: four per million patients treated) Hemorrhage – the annual incidence of hemorrhage may be increased by the coadministration of aspirin. In the CURE trial, people with acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation were treated with aspirin plus either clopidogrel or placebo and followed for up to one year. The following rates of major bleed were seen: Any major bleeding: clopidogrel 3.7%, placebo 2.7% Life-threatening bleeding: clopidogrel 2.2%, placebo 1.8% Hemorrhagic stroke: clopidogrel 0.1%, placebo 0.1% The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel monotherapy to aspirin monotherapy for 1.6 years in people who had recently experienced a stroke or heart attack. In this trial the following rates of bleeding were observed. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage: clopidogrel 2.0%, aspirin 2.7% Intracranial bleeding: clopidogrel 0.4%, aspirin 0.5% In CAPRIE, itching was the only adverse effect seen more frequently with clopidogrel than aspirin. In CURE, there was no difference in the rate of non-bleeding adverse events. Rashes and itching were uncommon in studies (between 0.1 and 1% of people); serious hypersensitivity reactions are rare. == Interactions == Clopidogrel generally has a low potential to interact with other pharmaceutical drugs. Combination with other drugs that affect blood clotting, such as aspirin, heparins and thrombolytics, showed no relevant interactions. Naproxen did increase the likelihood of occult gastrointestinal bleeding, as might be the case with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As clopidogrel is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C19, in cellular models it has been theorized that it might increase blood plasma levels of other drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme, such as phenytoin and tolbutamide. Clinical studies showed that this mechanism is irrelevant for practical purposes. In November 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that clopidogrel should be used with caution in people using the proton-pump inhibitors omeprazole or esomeprazole, but pantoprazole appears to be safe. The newer antiplatelet agent prasugrel has minimal interaction with (es)omeprazole, hence might be a better antiplatelet agent (if no other contraindications are present) in people who are on these proton-pump inhibitors. == Pharmacology == Clopidogrel is a prodrug which is metabolized by the liver into its active form. The active form specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. === Pharmacokinetics and metabolism === After repeated oral doses of 75 mg of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet-inhibiting effect, are very low and, in general, are below the quantification limit (0.258 μg/L) beyond two hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is a prodrug, which is activated in two steps, first by the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6, then by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP3A. The thiophene ring is converted to a thiolactone, which undergoes ring-opening. The active metabolite has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: Z configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original S configuration at C7, and, although the stereocentre at C4 cannot be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests the R-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y12 and platelet-inhibitory activity. The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 0.5 to 1.0 h, and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, about 50% was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing. Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite. Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75-milligram clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (about 3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring around one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is not saturable in vitro up to a concentration of 110 μg/mL. Metabolism and elimination: In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning, later updated, to Plavix, alerting that the drug can be less effective in people unable to metabolize the drug to convert it to its active form. === Pharmacogenetics === CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs, including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton-pump inhibitors, and antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning on clopidogrel in 2010 about CYP2C19-poor metabolizers. People with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. A published review showed that some mutations of CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 genes could affect the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment. For instance, patients carrying the mutations CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2B6*5 alleles may not respond to clopidogrel due to poor platelet inhibition efficacy revealed among them. === Mechanism of action === The active metabolite of clopidogrel specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so a loading dose of either 600 or 300 mg is administered when a rapid effect is needed. == Society and culture == === Economics === Plavix is marketed worldwide in nearly 110 countries, with sales of US$6.6 billion in 2009. It was the second-top-selling drug in the world in 2007 and was still growing by over 20% in 2007. US sales were US$3.8 billion in 2008. Before the expiry of its patent, clopidogrel was the second best-selling drug in the world. In 2010, it grossed over US$9 billion in global sales. In 2006, generic clopidogrel was briefly marketed by Apotex, a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company before a court order halted further production until resolution of a patent infringement case brought by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The court ruled that Bristol-Myers Squibb's patent was valid and provided protection until November 2011. The FDA extended the patent protection of clopidogrel by six months, giving exclusivity that would expire in May 2012. The FDA approved generic versions of clopidogrel in May 2012. === Names === Generic clopidogrel is marketed by many companies worldwide under many brand names. == Veterinary uses == Clopidogrel has been shown to be effective at decreasing platelet aggregation in cats, so its use in prevention of feline aortic thromboembolism has been advocated. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012).

As clopidogrel is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C19, in cellular models it has been theorized that it might increase blood plasma levels of other drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme, such as phenytoin and tolbutamide. Clinical studies showed that this mechanism is irrelevant for practical purposes. In November 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that clopidogrel should be used with caution in people using the proton-pump inhibitors omeprazole or esomeprazole, but pantoprazole appears to be safe. The newer antiplatelet agent prasugrel has minimal interaction with (es)omeprazole, hence might be a better antiplatelet agent (if no other contraindications are present) in people who are on these proton-pump inhibitors. == Pharmacology == Clopidogrel is a prodrug which is metabolized by the liver into its active form. The active form specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. === Pharmacokinetics and metabolism === After repeated oral doses of 75 mg of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet-inhibiting effect, are very low and, in general, are below the quantification limit (0.258 μg/L) beyond two hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is a prodrug, which is activated in two steps, first by the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6, then by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP3A. The thiophene ring is converted to a thiolactone, which undergoes ring-opening. The active metabolite has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: Z configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original S configuration at C7, and, although the stereocentre at C4 cannot be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests the R-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y12 and platelet-inhibitory activity. The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 0.5 to 1.0 h, and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, about 50% was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing. Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite. Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75-milligram clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (about 3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring around one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is not saturable in vitro up to a concentration of 110 μg/mL. Metabolism and elimination: In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning, later updated, to Plavix, alerting that the drug can be less effective in people unable to metabolize the drug to convert it to its active form. === Pharmacogenetics === CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs, including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton-pump inhibitors, and antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning on clopidogrel in 2010 about CYP2C19-poor metabolizers. People with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. A published review showed that some mutations of CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 genes could affect the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment. For instance, patients carrying the mutations CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2B6*5 alleles may not respond to clopidogrel due to poor platelet inhibition efficacy revealed among them. === Mechanism of action === The active metabolite of clopidogrel specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so a loading dose of either 600 or 300 mg is administered when a rapid effect is needed. == Society and culture == === Economics === Plavix is marketed worldwide in nearly 110 countries, with sales of US$6.6 billion in 2009. It was the second-top-selling drug in the world in 2007 and was still growing by over 20% in 2007. US sales were US$3.8 billion in 2008. Before the expiry of its patent, clopidogrel was the second best-selling drug in the world. In 2010, it grossed over US$9 billion in global sales. In 2006, generic clopidogrel was briefly marketed by Apotex, a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company before a court order halted further production until resolution of a patent infringement case brought by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The court ruled that Bristol-Myers Squibb's patent was valid and provided protection until November 2011. The FDA extended the patent protection of clopidogrel by six months, giving exclusivity that would expire in May 2012. The FDA approved generic versions of clopidogrel in May 2012. === Names === Generic clopidogrel is marketed by many companies worldwide under many brand names. == Veterinary uses == Clopidogrel has been shown to be effective at decreasing platelet aggregation in cats, so its use in prevention of feline aortic thromboembolism has been advocated. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012).

4149,"('Piperazine', 'Diethylenediamine', 'Piperazin', 'Hexahydropyrazine', 'Piperazidine')",Medical,"Piperazine () is an organic compound with the formula (CH2CH2NH)2. In term of its structure, it can be described as cyclohexane with the 1- and 4-CH2 groups replaced by NH. Piperazine exists as deliquescent solid with a saline taste. Piperazine is freely soluble in water and ethylene glycol, but poorly soluble in diethyl ether. Piperazine is commonly available industrially is as the hexahydrate, (CH2CH2NH)2·6H2O, which melts at 44 °C and boils at 125–130 °C. Substituted derivatives of piperazine are a broad class of chemical compounds. Many piperazines have useful pharmacological properties, prominent examples include viagra, ciprofloxacin, and ziprasidone. == Origin and naming == Piperazines were originally named because of their chemical similarity with piperidine, part of the structure of piperine in the black pepper plant (Piper nigrum). The -az- infix added to ""piperazine"" refers to the extra nitrogen atom, compared to piperidine. It is important to note, however, that piperazines are not derived from plants in the Piper genus. == Synthesis and structure == Piperazine is formed by the ammoniation of 1,2-dichloroethane or ethanolamine. This reaction is mainly used for production of ethylene diamine, but piperazine is a side product. The piperazine is separated from the product stream, which, in addition to ethylenediamine, also contains various derivatives containing CH2CH2NH subunits, e.g. diethylenetriamine, aminoethylpiperazine, and other related linear and cyclic chemicals of this type. Piperazine can also be synthesized by reduction of pyrazine with sodium in ethanol. As confirmed by X-ray crystallography, piperidine is a centrosymmetric molecule. The ring adopts a chair conformation and the two N-H groups are equatorial. == Reactions == Its basicity is that of a typical amine. Tthe pH of a 10% aqueous solution of piperazine is 10.8–11.8. The two pKb's are 5.35 and 9.73 at 25 °C. Piperazine readily absorbs water and carbon dioxide from the air. Carbon dioxide produce a series of carbamates. Some of the relevant equilibria are: HN(CH2CH2)2NH + CO2 ⇌ H2N+(CH2CH2)2NCO−2 2 HN(CH2CH2)2NH + CO2 ⇌ HN(CH2CH2)2NCO−2 + HN(CH2CH2)2NH+2 H2N+(CH2CH2)2NCO−2 + CO2 ⇌ HO2CN(CH2CH2)2NCO2H As a basic amine, piperazine forms a variety of coordination complexes, usually binding to metals as a unidentate ligand (bidentate binding would require the boat conformation). One example is the polymer [CoCl2(piperazine)]n, which features tetrahedral cobalt centers linked by bridging piperazine ligands. Piperazine is easily N-alkylated. Depending on conditions mono- or dialkyl derivatives are obtained. == Uses == === As an anthelmintic === Piperazine was marketed by Bayer as an anthelmintic in the early 20th century, and was featured in print ads alongside other popular Bayer products at the time, including heroin. In fact, a large number of piperazine compounds have an anthelmintic action. Their mode of action is generally by paralysing parasites, which allows the host body to easily expel the invasive organism. The neuromuscular effects are thought to be caused by blocking acetylcholine at the myoneural junction. This action is mediated by its agonist effects upon the inhibitory GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor. Its selectivity for helminths is because vertebrates use GABA only in the CNS, and the GABA receptor of helminths is of a different isoform from that of vertebrates. Piperazine hydrate, piperazine adipate and piperazine citrate (used to treat ascariasis and enterobiasis) are the most common anthelmintic piperazine compounds. These drugs are often referred to simply as ""piperazine"" which may cause confusion between the specific anthelmintic drugs, the entire class of piperazine-containing compounds, and the compound itself. Two common salts in the form of which piperazine is usually prepared for pharmaceutical or veterinary purposes are the citrate, 3C4H10N2·2C6H8O7 (i.e. containing 3 molecules of piperazine to 2 molecules of citric acid), and the adipate, C4H10N2·C6H10O4 (containing 1 molecule each of piperazine and adipic acid). === Piperazine derivatives as drugs === Many notable drugs contain a piperazine ring as part of their molecular structure. They may be used as antiparasitic drugs. Other examples include: Diethylcarbamazine, a derivative of piperazine, is used to treat some types of filariasis. Most of these agents can be classified as either phenylpiperazines, benzylpiperazines, diphenylmethylpiperazines (benzhydrylpiperazines), pyridinylpiperazines, pyrimidinylpiperazines, or tricyclics (with the piperazine ring attached to the heterocyclic moiety via a side chain). === Other uses === Piperazine is also a fluid used for CO2 and H2S scrubbing in association with methyl diethanolamine (MDEA). == Safety == Piperazines, such as BZP and TFMPP were common adulterants in the club and rave scene, often being passed off as MDMA, although they do not share many similarities in their effects. == See also == Amine gas treating Methyl diethanolamine Piperidine == References == == External links == ""PIPERAZINE CITRATE"".

4150,"('Mercaptopurine', 'Purinethol', 'Mercapurin', 'Leukerin', 'Leupurin')",Medical,"Mercaptopurine (6-MP), sold under the brand name Purinethol among others, is a medication used for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Specifically it is used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. For acute lymphocytic leukemia it is generally used with methotrexate. It is taken orally. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of future cancer and pancreatitis. Those with a genetic deficiency in thiopurine S-methyltransferase are at higher risk of side effects. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. Mercaptopurine is in the thiopurine and antimetabolite family of medications. Mercaptopurine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == It is used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. == Side effects == Some of the adverse reactions of taking mercaptopurine may include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, stomach/abdominal pain, weakness, skin rash, darkening of the skin, and hair loss. Serious adverse reactions include mouth sores, fever, sore throat, easy bruising or bleeding, pinpoint red spots on the skin, yellowing of eyes or skin, dark urine, and painful or difficult urination. Other more serious side effects include black or tarry stools (melena), bloody stools, and bloody urine. Treatment is discontinued in up to 30% of patients due these effects but therapeutic drug monitoring of the biologically active metabolites, i.e. thiopurine nucleotides can help to optimize the efficacy and safety. Clinically, most hospitals resort to on-exchange LC-MS (liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry) but the newly developed approach of porous graphitic carbon based chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry appears superior with respect to patient care in this respect. Symptoms of allergic reaction to mercaptopurine include rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing, and inflammation of the pancreas. In some cases, mercaptopurine may suppress the production of blood cells, both white blood cells and red blood cells. It may be toxic to bone marrow. Quarterly blood counts are necessary for people on mercaptopurine. People should stop taking the medication at least temporarily while considering alternate treatment if there is an unexplained, abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any other blood count. Toxicity of mercaptopurine can be linked to genetic polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15), and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA). People with specific allele variants will require dose adjustments, especially for those with homozygous variant genotypes. Large differences of TPMT and NUDT15 among ethnicities in terms of variant allele frequency should be taken into consideration in clinical practice. Caucasian people with a variant allele of the ITPA gene, experience higher rates of febrile neuropenia than people of other ethnic groups, due to differences in allelic frequencies among ethnicities. === Precautions === Mercaptopurine can lower the body's ability to fight off infection. Those taking it should get permission from a doctor to receive immunizations and vaccinations. It is also recommended that, while on the drug, one should avoid those having recently received oral polio vaccine. This drug was formerly not recommended during pregnancy and early evidence indicated pregnant women on the drug (or the related azathioprine) showed a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. There were also anecdotal reports linking mercaptopurine with spontaneous abortion, leading to the US FDA rating both AZA and mercaptopurine as category D drugs. However, Davis et al. 1999 found mercaptopurine, compared to methotrexate, was ineffective as a single-agent abortifacient; every woman in the mercaptopurine arm of the study had fetal cardiac activity at follow-up (two weeks later) and was given a suction abortion. A more recent, larger study, however, performed by the Cancers et Surrisque Associe aux Maladies inflamatoires intestinales En France (CESAME) indicated an overall rate of congenital malformations not significantly greater than the general population in France. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) concluded in a consensus paper in 2010 that while AZA and mercaptopurine have an FDA rating of D, new research in both animals and humans indicates that ""thiopurines are safe and well tolerated during pregnancy."" Mercaptopurine causes changes to chromosomes in animals and humans, though a study in 1990 found, ""while the carcinogenic potential of 6-MP cannot be precluded, it can be only very weak or marginal."" Another study in 1999 noted an increased risk of developing leukemia when taking large doses of 6-MP with other cytotoxic drugs. == Drug interactions == Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down mercaptopurine. Those taking allopurinol (often used to prevent gout) are at risk for mercaptopurine toxicity. The dose should be reduced or allopurinol should be discontinued. Several published studies have demonstrated that the use of allopurinol in combination with low dose 6-MP helps reduce 6-MP levels, which are toxic to liver tissue, whilst increasing the therapeutic levels of 6-MP for some inflammatory conditions. == Mechanisms of action == Official information from the package insert for purinethol: Mercaptopurine is an antimetabolite antineoplastic; as such it interferes with normal metabolic processes within cells, typically by combining with enzymes, to disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis (cell-cycle S phase-specific) leading to death of rapidly proliferating cells, especially malignant ones. Specifically, Mercaptopurine is a purine antimetabolite or purine antagonist and as such inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting the production of the purine containing nucleotides, adenine and guanine, thus halting DNA synthesis. Mercaptopurine also acts as an immunomodulator by inhibiting several pathways in nucleic acid biosynthesis preventing proliferation of cells involved in the determination and amplification of the immune response. Mercaptopurine (6-MP) competes with the purine derivatives hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme HGPRT and is itself converted to thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP). TIMP inhibits several chemical reactions involving inosinic acid (IMP), including the conversion of IMP to xanthylic acid (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to adenylic acid (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). In addition, 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) is formed by the methylation of TIMP. Both TIMP and MTIMP have been reported to inhibit glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Experiments indicate that radiolabeled mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. Some mercaptopurine is converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) by the sequential actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase, converting TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP). Animal tumors that are resistant to mercaptopurine often have lost the ability to convert mercaptopurine to TIMP. However, it is clear that resistance to mercaptopurine may be acquired by other means as well, particularly in human leukemias. It is not known exactly which of any one or more of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 6-MP ribonucleotide inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis and metabolism by inhibiting an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PRPP amidotransferase). Since this enzyme is the rate limiting factor for purine synthesis, this alters the synthesis and function of RNA and DNA. Mercaptopurine interferes with nucleotide interconversion and glycoprotein synthesis. === Pharmacogenetics === The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible, in part, for the inactivation of 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT catalyzes the methylation of 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine – this methylation prevents mercaptopurine from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and an increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving mercaptopurine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of people are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify people with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of mercaptopurine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for mercaptopurine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify people at risk for myelotoxicity. Testing for TPMT activity is an example of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. == History == 6-MP was discovered by Nobel Prize–winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings at Burroughs Wellcome in Tuckahoe, New York, and was clinically developed in collaboration with investigators at Memorial Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City). The collaboration was initiated by Cornelius P. Rhoads, who had run chemical weapons programs for the US Army and had been involved in the work that led to the discovery that nitrogen mustards could potentially be used as cancer drugs, and had become the director of Memorial in 1948. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012).

4151,"('Geraniol,(s)', 'Geraniol-[d6]', 'Kbiogr_000822', 'Kbio2_000881', 'Kbio2_003449')",Medical," This work presents a literature review on the biological activity of S-carvone, geraniol and derivatives of these compounds, which are formed in the process of isomerization (during the process of geraniol isomerization, oxidation products of this compound are also obtained). Moreover, this work presents preliminary microbiological tests of creams with the addition of these biologically active compounds: S-carvone, geraniol, carvacrol (an S-carvone isomerization product), nerol (a geraniol isomerization product), linalool (a geraniol isomerization product) and citral (a geraniol oxidation product). Because the post-reaction mixture obtained after the S-carvone isomerization has a relatively simple composition, it was also added to creams and tested without isolating pure compounds. This may be a cheaper alternative to creams prepared with the addition of pure compounds. The mixture obtained after the geraniol isomerization process has a very complex composition; therefore, only compounds with the lowest molecular weight and are easily commercially available were selected for studies. The content of the tested compounds in the creams ranged from 0.5 to 3 wet%. The following microorganisms were selected for microbiological tests: the Gram-negative bacterium  Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a neurodegenerative disease occupies 3/5-4/5 cases among patients with dementia, yet its pathogenetic mechanism remains unclear. Geraniol, on the other hand, is a well-known extract from essential oils of aromatic plants and has been proven that it has outstanding neuroprotective effects as well as ameliorating influence in memory impairment. Therefore, the present study aims to elucidate the potential of geraniol against AD by network pharmacology-based approach combined with molecular modeling study. Firstly, we evaluated the druggability of geraniol by ADME method. Then, we obtained the geraniol targets and AD-related targets from multiple open data sources. Afterward, we calculated the intersection through a Venn diagram to find common targets, and via Panther classification system to categorize them. In order to gain a macroscopic understanding of these common targets, we carried out GO terms and KEGG pathways enrichment analyses, according to which we constructed a compound-target-pathway-disease network. In addition, we built a preliminary PPI network which was further analyzed both functionally and topologically. Consequently, five hub targets were sorted out. Finally, we conducted molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation to validate our findings. In the present study, the pharmacological properties of geraniol were assessed according to ADME and Lipinski's rule, which demonstrate promising druggability. Then, from 10,972 AD-related targets and 33 geraniol targets, 29 common targets were identified, among which 38.1% of them are metabolite interconversion enzymes, 23.8% are protein modifying enzymes, 33.3% are transmembrane receptors, and the rest are transporters. Enrichment analyses hint that geraniol is involved in cholinergic synapse, serotonergic synapse, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. We also built a preliminary PPI network to investigate the interplay between these targets and their extensive interactions. Then, by functionally clustering the preliminary PPI network, we gained a cluster of proteins which formed a subnetwork with score of 8.476, and 22 nodes. Its results of GO terms and KEGG pathways enrichment analyses once again suggests that geraniol actively participates in cholinergic synapse, serotonergic synapse, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, which are believed to be strongly associated with AD pathogenesis. Besides, topological analyses of the preliminary PPI network helped find 5 hub targets (i.e., CHRM3, PRKCA, PRKCD, JAK1, JAK2). To verify their interaction with geraniol molecule, we conducted molecular docking, and found that CHRM3 possesses the highest affinity in binding, indicating that geraniol molecules are closely bound to each hub target, and CHRM3 may serve as a key target of geraniol against AD. It was then further confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation, the result of which supports our hypothesis. The present study shares a mechanistic insight of the potential of geraniol against AD, giving a reference to future experimental studies. Salmonellosis is a globally extensive food-borne disease, which threatens public health and results in huge economic losses in the world annually.

The honorary title Senke Jusshoku is given to the ten artisans that provide the utensils for the events held by the three primary iemoto Schools of Japanese tea known as the san-senke. Utensils used for sencha are different, using a usually five-piece set of small cups, a small pot and a small cup to pour hot water. These utensils are typically ceramic. == Boxes == In Japan, cherished items are customarily stored in purpose-made wooden boxes. Valuable items for tea ceremony are usually stored in such a box, and in some cases, if the item has a long and distinguished history, several layers of boxes: an inner storage box (uchibako), middle storage box (nakabako), and outer storage box (sotobako). The storage boxes for tea implements are not tea equipment in themselves, but still hold importance in the practice of chanoyu, as the boxes used for particularly old and distinguished objects often feature inscriptions which serve to validate their history and provenance. === Chabako === Chabako (茶箱, lit. 'tea box[es]') are special lidded boxes containing the tea bowl, tea caddy, tea scoop and other equipment. They constitute portable tea-making sets for travel and making tea outdoors, and are available in many styles. The ""rikyū model"", made of plain paulownia wood, comes in a large size and a small size. The interior dimensions of the large version are slightly smaller than 19 centimetres (7.5 in) in length, 13 centimetres (5.1 in) in width, and 11.5 centimetres (4.5 in) in height. Rikyū-model chabako also feature an internal shelf. Originally, there were no rules for the tea-making procedure (temae). However, the 11th-generation head of the Urasenke school of tea created certain types of procedures. For the procedures, the box is carried into the place where the tea is to be made, sometimes on a tray, and the ceremony proceeds with each item being removed from, and finally returned to, the box. Tea boxes are made of wood, and may be lacquered and decorated, or left untreated. There are similar portable tea-making sets called chakago (茶籠, lit. 'tea basket[s]'), in which case the box is formed through basket weaving. == Charcoal-related items == === Ash === Ash, known as hai (灰), appears most commonly in chanoyu in the portable brazier (furo), the sunken hearth (ro) which may be used in a tea room in the cold season, and the container for the lighter fire in the smoking set (hiire). In tea ceremony, ash serves as a protective bed for the charcoal fire. Great care is given to the quality and appearance of the ash, and there are different kinds of ash for different purposes. They include the following: Fujibai (藤灰, lit. 'wisteria ash') – used as ""sprinkling ash"" (蒔灰, makibai) to decorate the sculpted ash in a brazier. It is a beautiful, smooth white ash produced by burning wisteria bean pods. Fukusabai (ふくさ灰, lit. 'silky ash') – a dry ash specially prepared to have a smooth texture free from visible impurities. This is the main kind of ash used in portable braziers. Hishibai (菱灰, lit. 'caltrop ash') – produced by burning the shells of water caltrops. It is a smooth reddish-brown ash mainly used in the container for the lighter fire in the smoking set. Shimeshibai (湿灰, lit. 'moist ash') – the slightly damp ash used in the sunken hearth. Warabai (藁灰, lit. 'straw ash') – sticks of roasted straw. The black warabai is neatly arranged on top of the ash in the brazier. This is reserved for the final days of the brazier season and the use, at that time, of a worn-looking metal brazier (yatsureburo). Warabai is also used in hand warmers (teaburi) and hibachi. === Ash container === Haiki (灰器) is a shallow bowl used by the host to carry the ash into the tea room for the charcoal-laying procedure (sumidemae). It carries the ""sprinkling ash"" (makibai) for the procedure in the case of a portable brazier (furo), and the ""moist ash"" (shimeshibai) for the procedure in the case of a sunken hearth (ro). The styles for these are different. === Ash spoon === The haisaji (灰匙) is a spatula-like implement mainly used to shape the ash in the portable brazier (furo), or to sprinkle ash during the charcoal-laying procedure. === Charcoal === Sumi (炭) refers to the charcoal used in chanoyu. Sumi for the most part is made of chestnut-leaved oak (kunugi), carbonized by long hours of smoldering in a kiln. The long pieces of finished charcoal are cut into specific lengths for use; the lengths differing depending upon whether the charcoal will be used in a brazier or sunken hearth. In addition, a unique kind of charcoal called eda-zumi (枝炭, lit. 'branch charcoal') is used in chanoyu for its artistic effect. It is produced by charring twigs of azalea, camellia, or some variety of oak, and then coating them with a lime substance made of powdered seashells. === Charcoal container === The sumitori (炭斗/炭取) is the container in which the host places the charcoal and charcoal-laying implements for transporting them to and from the tea room for the charcoal-laying procedure. Many sumitori are made of basketry. === Charcoal carrier === Hakosumitori (箱炭斗) is a charcoal container used in the preparation room, and not considered a formal piece of equipment. It is brought into the tea room if the charcoal in the portable brazier or sunken hearth requires replenishing. It is box-shaped, has a handle, and is made of wood—usually mulberry wood. === Charcoal starter === === Feather brooms === Habōki (羽箒) is a feather broom with a number of styles. The kind composed of three layered feathers and referred to therefore as mitsubane (三つ羽) is used to dust off the portable brazier or sunken hearth during the charcoal-laying procedure. It is part of the set of equipment carried into the tea room with the charcoal container (sumitori). Other kinds of feather brooms are used for sweeping the tea room. === Hibashi === Hibashi (火箸, lit. 'fire chopsticks') are metal chopsticks used to handle charcoal. === Incense container === Kōgō (香合) is a small lidded container for the incense that is added to the charcoal fire during the charcoal-laying procedure. For the kneaded incense (nerikō) that is used in a sunken hearth (ro), the container is generally made of ceramic. For the chips of incense wood (kōboku) used in a portable brazier (furo), it is generally made of lacquer ware or plain wood. There are also incense containers made of clam shells. == Cloth items == === Chakin === A chakin (茶巾) is a small rectangular white linen or hemp cloth mainly used to wipe the tea bowl. There are two main sizes: large and small. Usually the plain term chakin is used in reference to the small size, which is approximately 30.3 centimetres (11.9 in) long and 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) wide. The raw edges on the lengthwise sides have a narrow rolled hem finished with overlock stitching. These two hems face opposite sides of the cloth. === Dashibukusa === A dashibukusa (出し帛紗) is, like a fukusa, a double layer patterned silk cloth approximately 30 centimetres (12 in) square, with a fold on one edge and the other three edges sewn together so the stitching is invisible. It is used by Omotesenke practitioners in the same way as the kobukusa: the host and the guests each carry one, which is kept in the breast of the kimono. It is sometimes used by guests to protect the tea implements whilst examining them, and the host will put one out with the tea bowl when serving thick tea. === Fukusa === A fukusa (帛紗) is a double layer silk cloth approximately 30 centimetres (12 in) square, with a fold on one edge and the other three edges sewn together so the stitching is invisible. It is used for the symbolic cleansing of the tea scoop and tea caddy, and (usually by women) to handle hot kettle or pot lids. The host and assistants at a tea gathering wear the fukusa tucked into the obi. By tradition, the host of a formal tea ceremony uses a new, previously unused fukusa. Fukusa are most often monochromatic and unpatterned, but variations exist. There are different colours for men (usually purple) and women (orange or red), for people of different ages or skill levels, for different ceremonies and for different schools. The size and way of making fukusa was purportedly established by Sen Sōon, Sen no Rikyū's second wife. === Fukusabasami === Fukusabasami are rectangular wallets in many cases shaped like a traditional envelope, with a flap that closes the wallet. They are used to carry personal items needed to participate in tea ceremony or tea practice, such as kaishi paper, a pick for cutting and eating sweets, a kobukusa, a fukusa, and a fan. There are two sizes of fukusabasami corresponding to the two sizes of kaishi paper: a smaller one for women, and a larger one for men. Men's fukusabasami are generally less ornate and brightly coloured than women's, but this is not always the case. === Kobukusa === A kobukusa (古帛紗) is a cloth approximately 15.15 centimetres (5.96 in) square, which, unlike a fukusa, is generally made of a rich, thick, brocade fabric with a woven pattern. Its construction is similar to that of a fukusa. In the Urasenke school, both the host and guests each carry one. If wearing kimono, it is kept in the breast of the kimono. Guests not wearing kimono might carry it in their fukusabasami. The kobukusa is sometimes used by guests to protect the tea implements whilst examining them. Depending on the circumstances, the host may put one out with the tea. === Shifuku === Shifuku (仕覆) refers to a variety of bags used for storing chaire and other tea implements. They are traditionally made from silk, and are often patterned or brocaded. Extremely precious implements were often held in bags made brocade. Shifuku are secured with a kumihimo silk cord, which is tied in prescribed ways. == Furniture == === Daisu === The daisu (台子) is the original portable shelf unit used in the Japanese tea ceremony. The most orthodox style is the formal shindaisu, finished in highly polished black lacquer. The lower board rests on the tatami, and there are four posts at the corners of this, supporting a shelf. The width of this unit, from side to side, is equal to the width of a kyōma (Kyoto-size) tatami. === Nagaita === A nagaita (長板) is a wooden board, usually lacquered, on which the main tea implements may be displayed in the tea room. The size derives from the size of the lower board of a daisu. === Shikiita === Shikiita (敷板) is the term for the various kinds of boards on which the portable brazier (furo) may be arranged in the tea room. They are classified by shape as large, half-size, small, or round. They are wooden, and may be finished with lacquer and/or decorated in various other manners. There are rules for what kind of board to use with what kind of brazier. === Tana === Tana (棚), literally ""shelf/shelves,"" is a generic term for various types of shelving used in the tea ceremonies and placed on the host's mat. Each type of tana has its own name. The three basic categories are built-in tana (shitsukedana), suspended tana (tsuridana), and portable shelves (okidana). The latter, okidana, are basically categorized as either large shelf units (ōdana) or small shelf units (kodana). Tana are made of various types of wood, the most formal style finished in highly polished black lacquer. Some tana include drawers or shelves enclosed by sliding doors. Tea utensils may be placed onto/into the tana before the start of a ceremony and/or at the end. Tana are used only tea rooms of 4.5 tatami mats or larger. == Hearths == === Binkake === Binkake (瓶掛) are relatively small portable braziers used to heat the kind of iron hot-water kettle called tetsubin, which has a spout and handle across the top. === Furo === Furo (風炉) are portable braziers used in the tea room to heat the hot water kettle (kama) to make the tea. They are commonly made of ceramic or metal, although there are rare examples of wooden furo as well. === Ro === Ro (炉) are fire pits built into the floor of tea rooms and used in the cold season, for heating the hot water kettle (kama) to make the tea. The frame that fits around it at the top is called robuchi (炉縁, ""ro frame""), and usually is of lacquered wood. In the season when the ro is not in use, the frame is removed and the ro is covered with one of the tatami mats that form the surface of the floor, and is not visible. === Okiro === An okiro is a portable ro that is set on the floor and is used in circumstances when the room does not have a ro that can be used. == Kaiseki-related items == === Choshi or kannabe === A choshi or kannabe is a kettle resembling a teapot used for warming and serving sake. They are made of iron, tin or pottery. == Kakemono == Kakemono (掛物) literally meaning ""hanging"", refers to a painting or calligraphic work mounted on paper or textile, for hanging in the tokonoma alcove. The kakemono is the centerpiece of the tea room. Zen calligraphic works are referred to as bokuseki (墨蹟, lit. 'ink traces'). In chanoyu, bokuseki are particularly highly esteemed for kakemono. == Karamono == Karamono (唐物, lit. 'Tang item') is a term used for refined quality tea implements, mainly ceramics, produced in China particularly in the Song dynasty, Yuan dynasty, and Ming dynasty, which when imported to Japan were selected for their excellence and have been highly valued in Japan ever since. See also Chawan, Chaki. == Kōraimono == Kōraimono (高麗物, lit. 'Goryeo item') is a term for tea utensils produced in the Korean Peninsula mainly during the Yi dynasty of Korea, occasionally compared with the above-mentioned karamono. See Chawan, Chaki. == Kuniyakimono == Kuniyakimono (国焼物, lit. 'country-fired things') are ceramics made in Japan. More specifically, the term means ""provincial ceramics,"" and does not include Kyoto-ware or Seto-ware ceramics. == Miscellaneous items == === Chakindarai === A chakindarai is a relatively small bowl, usually made of copper, used for rinsing and washing chakin. It is kept on the bamboo sink-covering in the mizuya. === Chasen kusenaoshi === A chasen kusenaoshi is a shaper for bamboo whisks. Kusenaoshi are made from wood or ceramic; a wet whisk is placed on the shaper and allowed to dry, restoring its shape. This item is used in the mizuya back room, and is not seen in the tea room. === Folding fan === Sensu (扇子, lit. 'small folding fan') (also known as ōgi (扇)) are carried by all participants in a chanoyu ceremony as a sign of respect. It is not opened and used for fanning. The fan, in its closed state, is placed in front of oneself when making formal statements or expressions of thanks, respect, apology, and such. During the main portions of a tea ceremony in which they are seated on the floor, guests place their fans on the floor directly behind themselves for instant use when required. For men, the standard length of sensu meant for tea ceremony is approximately 18 centimetres (7.1 in) (6 寸); for women, it is approximately 15 centimetres (5.9 in) (5 寸). If the circumstance involves being seated on the floor, the closed fan is placed on the floor in front of the knees, leaving enough space in between to place the hands for the attendant bow. If the circumstance involves being in a standing position, the closed fan is held in the right hand, against the front of the right thigh, paired with the left hand which is held against the front of the left thigh, for the standing bow. The fan is normally tucked in the obi, to be available for instant use when required. === Futaoki === Futaoki (蓋置, lit. 'lid rest[s]') are for resting the lid of the kettle on, and also for resting the water ladle (hishaku) on. They are made of bamboo, ceramic, or metal. There are many styles. There is a group of seven kinds of futaoki lid rests that are attributed to Sen no Rikyu (Rikyu no nanashu no futaoki). They are: Hoyakoro (censer) Gotoku (five virtues tripod) Ikkanjin (iddle person at well) Mitsuningyo (三人形, three dolls in Chinese style) Sazae (turban shell) Kani (crab) Mitsuba (tree leaves) === Gotoku === Gotoku (五徳) is a metal tripod on which the kettle is set. === Hanaire === Flowers, together with their containers, are an important element of the decorations for the tea ceremony. The flowers arranged in the simple ""thrown-in"" (nageire) manner suitable for tea ceremony are called chabana (茶花), and the containers for them are generically referred to as hanaire (花入). Hanaire may be of bronze or other metal, celadon and other types of ceramic, bamboo, or basketry. Bamboo hanaire (take-hanaire) came into being with the development of wabi-cha, as did hanaire of domestic Japanese ceramic ware such as Bizen ware and Shigaraki ware. Basketry hanaire (kago-hanaire) usually are reserved for use in the warm season, when the chabana will consist of an assortment of seasonal grassy flowers. The chabana may be hung on the back wall of the tokonoma, or on its main front pillar (tokobashira), in which cases the hanaire will have a ring attached to the back, or a small hole in the back, for the hook. Also, there are metal and bamboo hanaire designed to be hung by a chain from a hook in the ceiling of the tokonoma. These are generally referred to as tsuri-hanaire, and if they are boat-like, they are referred to as tsuribune (suspended boat). === Incense === === Kaishi === Kaishi (懐紙) is white paper used for miscellaneous purposes. It is usually in the form of a pad of paper folded in half. The name indicates that it is paper kept handy in the bosom overlap of the kimono. === Kamashiki === Kamashiki (釜敷) means ""kettle mat"". When the kettle is removed from the brazier or sunken hearth to conduct the charcoal-laying procedure (sumidemae), the kettle is placed on a kamashiki. Ones of woven material are called kumikamashiki (lit. 'woven kamashiki'). Ones consisting of a special thick pad of paper are called kamikamashiki (lit. 'paper kamashiki'). There are also ones of bamboo, called takekamashiki, which are for use in the preparation room. === Kamasue === === Kensui === Kensui (建水) is the term for the rinse-water receptacle used by the host in the tea room. Usually made of metal or ceramic, though there are some made of lacquered bentwood. Water that has been used to rinse the tea bowl is emptied into it. It is kept out of sight of the guests as much as possible, being the last item brought into the tea room, and the first item removed. While the kensui is a necessary item for the tea ceremony, and is among the implements the host specially selects for the occasion, it is not among the ""showpiece"" items the guests are expected to specially notice. === Kintō === Kintō (巾筒) is a tube or vessel used to store a chakin cloth. === Screens === Furosaki byōbu (風炉先屏風, lit. 'folding screen before the brazier') (sometimes shortened to furosaki). A relatively low folding screen of two panels, which is set in the corner at the head end of the tea-making tatami in cases when the tea-making is done in a room larger than 4.5 tatami in floor space. Kekkai (結界, lit. 'boundary marker'). A low fence-like device set at the head end of the tea-making tatami in cases when the tea-making is done in a room larger than 4.5 tatami in floor space or in an open area such as outdoors. == Pots == === Kama === Kama (釜) are pots, usually made of iron, in which the water used to make tea is heated. === Tetsubin === Tetsubin (鉄瓶) are iron pots having a pouring spout and handle that crosses over the top. They are used for heating and pouring the hot water during certain tea ceremonies. == Shimamono == Shimamono is a generic term for tea utensils produced outside Japan, Korea and China. Ruson (呂宋): items from the Philippines (Luzon) Annan (安南): items from Vietnam Nanban (南蛮): items from Southeast Asia Hannera (ハンネラ): a type of simple unglazed ware from Southeast Asia Kinma (蒟醤): a style of lacquer ware that entered Japan from Thailand Sahari (砂張): an alloy of copper, lead, and tin. Some sahari items entered Japan from Southeast Asia. == Smoking equipment == Tabakobon (煙草盆, lit. 'tobacco tray'), the tray or box for the smoking set that the host provides the guests in the waiting room, at the waiting arbor, and in the tea room at the time of the ""thin tea"" service (usucha temae). Hiire (火入, lit. 'fire container'), a container for the lit charcoal that serves as the lighter. Usually made of ceramic. The tabakobon holds this hiire. Haifuki (灰吹), a bamboo tube that serves as the ash receptacle. The tabakobon holds this haifuki. Kiseru (煙管), a long-stemmed smoking pipe. The host provides this with the tabakobon. == Sweet-related items == === Fuchidaka === Fuchidaka Omogashi (縁高五重/菓子器), the ""main sweet"", is served before koicha. They might be served in fuchidaka, stacked boxes of up to five with one lid, a sort of medium level of formality. How many are used would depend on the number of guests at the tea ceremony. === Yōji === A yōji (楊枝) or kashiyōji (菓子楊枝) is a utensil used for cutting and eating sweets. There are two common types: a shorter metal style, and a longer wooden style called kuromoji (黒文字) after the type of tree they are traditionally made from. == Tea bowls == Chawan (茶碗) are bowls used for making and drinking matcha tea. They can be classified by country of origin, by potter or kiln, by shape, or by the type of tea they are designed to hold. == Tea containers == Tea containers refers to the small lidded caddies that are used to hold the powdered green tea (matcha) for the tea-making procedure (temae) in chanoyu. The term chaki (茶器) literally translates as ""tea implement,"" but in the vocabulary of chanoyu it usually implies the small lidded caddies that are used to hold the matcha for the tea-making procedure for usucha (thin tea). All tea containers for usucha may be called usucha-ki. Usucha-ki usually are of lacquered or plain wood, although not necessarily so. Commonly they are of a variety of shape called natsume, and so all usucha-ki tend to be loosely referred to as natsume. Natsume and other forms of usucha-ki are classified by size or shape. The ceramic caddies usually used to hold the powdered green tea for the procedure to make koicha (thick tea) are basically referred to as chaire (茶入, lit. 'tea container'). They may also be referred to as koicha-ki. Chaire are classified according to country of origin: import (karamono), Japan (wamono), or ""island-make"" (shimamono). The wamono ones are classified by potter, region, or kiln. All are also classified according to shape. == Tea scoops == Chashaku (茶杓, lit. 'tea scoop[s]'); also called tea spoon(s), are used to transfer the powdered tea from the tea container (chaki) to the tea bowl (chawan). Typically, tea scoops are made of a narrow, thin piece of bamboo, although there are also those made of wood or ivory. They are generally about 18 centimetres (7.1 in) in length. The original ones imported to Japan from China were ivory. Tea masters in Japan have traditionally carved their own bamboo chashaku, providing them with a bamboo storage tube (tsutsu) as well as a poetic name (mei (銘)) that will often be inscribed on the storage tube. The selection of the chashaku for use at a chanoyu gathering will largely depend on its poetic name. == Trays == Various styles of trays are used in tea ceremony, including: Hakkebon (八卦盆), a round black-lacquered tray with mother-of-pearl inlay of the eight Chinese divination symbols. Yamamichibon (山道盆), a round tray having undulating rim like a mountain path (yamamichi). Yohōbon (四方盆, lit. 'square tray'). == Wamono == Wamono (和物) means ""Japanese item""; an article produced in Japan. In chanoyu, the term traditionally is used in contrast to karamono or shimamono. == Water containers == === Mizusashi === A mizusashi (水指) is a lidded container for fresh cold water used by the host in the tea room during ceremonies. The water is mainly used to replenish the water in the kama at the end of certain ceremonies. Mizusashi are generally made of ceramic, but wooden, glass and metal mizusashi are also used. If the mizusashi is ceramic and has a matching lid of the same ceramic, the lid is referred to as a tomobuta, or ""matching lid"". Often, a ceramic mizusashi will have a custom-made lid made of lacquered wood, especially if it is a container originally lacking a matching lid. The mizusashi is one of the main objects in the aesthetic scheme of the objects the host selects for the particular occasion. Mizusashi are classified by their shape, place of make, and other characteristics. === Mizutsugi === A mizutsugi (水次, lit. 'water pourer') is a lidded water pitcher used to replenish the vessel for fresh water (mizusashi) at the end of certain ceremonies. There are ones of metal, ones of ceramic, and ones of bentwood. There are two main kinds: katakuchi and yakan. The variety known as katakuchi is cylindrical, has a spout and handle, and matching lid. It may be made of bentwood, lacquered wood, or ceramic; the variety known as yakan is made of metal. == Water ladles == Hishaku (柄杓) is a long bamboo ladle with a nodule in the approximate center of the handle. It is used to pour hot water into the tea bowl from the iron pot (kama) and to transfer cold water from the fresh water container to the iron pot when required. A tetsubin does not require the use of a hishaku. Different styles are used for different ceremonies and in different seasons. A larger version that is made of cypress wood is used for the ritual rinsing of hands and mouth by guests before entering the tea room, or for use by the host in the back preparation area of the tea room (mizuya), in which case it distinguished as mizuya-bishaku. == Whisks == Chasen (茶筅) are bamboo whisks used to prepare matcha. They are hand-carved from a single piece of bamboo. There are differences in their style according to the type of bamboo they are made from, the shape of the tines, the number of tines, the thickness of the bamboo, the length of the bamboo, the color of the thread that is woven around the bottom of the tines, and so on. Different schools of chanoyu prefer different styles and employ different styles depending on the particular kind of tea or tea-preparation style for which it is to be used. For instance, there are specific styles for preparing thin tea (usucha), thick tea (koicha), tea offerings in tenmoku tea bowls, tea in tall cylindrical tea bowls, for including in a portable boxed tea set (chabako), for outdoor tea-making, for New Year's, and for other special auspicious occasions. There are also styles such as the ""Rikyū-gata"" (利休形, Sen no Rikyū model); the style attributed to Sen no Rikyū's son Dōan and referred to as the ""Dōan-gonomi"" (道安好) style, and other such ""favored"" (konomi (好)) styles of famous tea masters, so that the styles have continued to increase. Generally, the kind used for whisking thin tea (usucha) has 80, 100, or 120 fine tines, typically carved out of a flexible but robust bamboo such as Phyllostachys bambusoides (known as kashirodake or madake). == See also == History of tea in Japan Meibutsuki Japanese kitchen Kamado List of Traditional Crafts of Japan == References == Michiko, Suganuma.

4153,"('Ovinonic acid', 'Prostaglandin e1-[d4]')","Endogenous, Medical"," Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.",Ovinonic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0010080024367198348), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029953014105558395)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.medchemexpress.cn/8-iso-prostaglandin-e1.html ', [])"

Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker and has intrinsic sympathetic activity. It is commonly used in the treatment of angina. It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1973. == Medical uses == Hypertension Ventricular and atrial cardiac arrhythmia Acute myocardial infarction in high-risk patients Smith–Magenis syndrome == Contraindications == Stable or unstable angina (due to its partial agonist or ISA activity) == Side effects == The development of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) has been found in 10 to 30% of patients under treatment with acebutolol. A systemic disease with arthralgic pain and myalgias has been observed in 1%. A lupus erythematosus-like syndrome with skin rash and multiforme organ involvement is even less frequent. The incidence of both ANA and symptomatic disease under acebutolol is higher than under propranolol. Female patients are more likely to develop these symptoms than male patients. Some few cases of hepatotoxicity with increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST) have been seen. Altogether, 5 to 6% of all patients treated have to discontinue acebutolol due to intolerable side effects. When possible, the treatment should be discontinued gradually in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome with increased frequency of angina and even precipitation of myocardial infarction. == Pharmacology == Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker which also considered a partial agonist due to its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). This means it provides low-grade beta stimulation at rest but acting as typical beta-blockers when sympathetic activity is high. Among other drugs in the beta-blocker class, Acebutolol will provide beta-blockade effects to a lesser extent. Due to its cardioselectivity, Acebutolol is more suitable than non-cardioselective beta-blockers, in a patient with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who needs treatment with a beta-blocker. This cardio-specificity will minimize the anti-hypertensive effects as seen with non-specific beta blockers such as Propanalol and Nadolol. (For these reasons, it may be a beta-blocker of choice in inclusion in Polypill strategies). In doses lower than 800 mg daily its constricting effects on the bronchial system and smooth muscle vessels are only 10% to 30% of those observed under propranolol treatment, but there is experimental evidence that the cardioselective properties diminish at doses of 800 mg/day or more. The drug has lipophilic properties and therefore crosses the blood–brain barrier. Acebutolol has no negative impact on serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). No HDL decrease has been observed. In this regard, it is unlike many other beta-blockers which have this unfavourable property. The drug works in hypertensive patients with high, normal, or low renin plasma concentrations, although acebutolol may be more efficient in patients with high or normal renin plasma concentrations. In clinically relevant concentrations, a membrane-stabilizing effect does not appear to play an important role. == Pharmacokinetics == Acebutolol is well absorbed from the GI tract, but undergoes substantial first-pass-metabolization, leading to a bioavailability of only 35% to 50%. Peak plasma levels of acebutolol are reached within 2 to 2.5 hours after oral dosing. Peak levels of the main active metabolite, diacetolol, are reached after 4 hours. Acebutolol has a half-life of 3 to 4 hours, and diacetolol a half-life of 8 to 13 hours. Acebutolol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization resulting in the desbutyl amine acetolol which is readily converted into diacetolol. Diacetolol is as active as acebutolol (equipotency) and appears to have the same pharmacologic profile. Geriatric patients tend to have higher peak plasma levels of both acebutolol and diacetolol and a slightly prolonged excretion. Excretion is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment, and so a dose reduction may be needed. Liver cirrhosis does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent drug and metabolite. == References == == External links == AHFS Database",Prent,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00042524831951595843), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011990031925961375)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4156,"('Methoxy', 'Methoxy radical', 'Methoxyl', 'Methyloxidanyl', 'Methyloxy')","Medical, Industrial","In organic chemistry, a methoxy group is the functional group consisting of a methyl group bound to oxygen. This alkoxy group has the formula R−O−CH3. On a benzene ring, the Hammett equation classifies a methoxy substituent at the para position as an electron-donating group, but as an electron-withdrawing group if at the meta position. At the ortho position, steric effects are likely to cause a significant alteration in the Hammett equation prediction, which otherwise follows the same trend as that of the para position. == Occurrence == The simplest of methoxy compounds are methanol and dimethyl ether. Other methoxy ethers include anisole and vanillin. Many metal alkoxides contain methoxy groups, such as tetramethyl orthosilicate and titanium methoxide. Esters with a methoxy group can be referred to as methyl esters, and the —COOCH3 substituent is called a methoxycarbonyl. === Biosynthesis === In nature, methoxy groups are found on nucleosides subjected to 2′-O-methylation, for example, in variations of the 5′-cap structure known as cap-1 and cap-2. They are also common substituents in O-methylated flavonoids, whose formation is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases that act on phenols, such as catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). Many natural products in plants, such as lignins, are generated via catalysis by caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase. === Methoxylation === Organic methoxides are often produced by methylation of alkoxides. Some aryl methoxides can be synthesized by metal-catalyzed methylation of phenols, or by methoxylation of aryl halides. == References ==",Methyloxy,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.2664456789934775e-06)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.4741661846637726), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('RI', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3871541917324066)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0303006?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=6, title='Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for Methoxyl (HMDB0303006)', type='url_citation', url='https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0303006?utm_source=openai')])"
4157,"('(r)-ofloxacin', 'Ofloxacin', 'Levofloxacin', 'R-ofloxacin', 'Dr 3354')",Medical,"Levofloxacin, sold under the brand name Levaquin among others, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It is the left-handed isomer of the medication ofloxacin. It is used to treat a number of bacterial infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, H. pylori (in combination with other medications), urinary tract infections, Legionnaires' disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it may be used to treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. A warning concerning all fluoroquinolones was issued in 2016: ""An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system."" Other serious side effects may include tendon rupture, tendon inflammation, seizures, psychosis, and potentially permanent peripheral nerve damage. Tendon damage may appear months after treatment is completed. People may also sunburn more easily. In people with myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness and breathing problems may worsen. While use during pregnancy is not recommended, risk appears to be low. The use of other medications in this class appear to be safe while breastfeeding; however, the safety of levofloxacin is unclear. Levofloxacin was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 251st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Levofloxacin is used to treat infections including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form. As of 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that ""serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs generally outweigh the benefits for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who have other treatment options. For patients with these conditions, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who do not have alternative treatment options."" Levofloxacin is used for the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections. As of 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society recommended levofloxacin and other respiratory fluoroquinolines as first line treatment for community acquired pneumonia when co-morbidities such as heart, lung, or liver disease are present or when in-patient treatment is required. Levofloxacin also plays an important role in recommended treatment regimens for ventilator-associated and healthcare-associated pneumonia. As of 2010 it was recommended by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with rifampicin as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections. The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial prostatitis when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it was recommended to treat bacterial prostatitis by the NIH research network studying the condition. Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones have also been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections, indications for which major medical societies generally recommend the use of older, narrower spectrum drugs to avoid fluoroquinolone resistance development. Due to its widespread use, common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have developed resistance. In many countries as of 2013, resistance rates among healthcare-associated infections with these pathogens exceeded 20%. Levofloxacin is also used as antibiotic eye drops to prevent bacterial infection. Usage of levofloxacin eye drops, along with an antibiotic injection of cefuroxime or penicillin during cataract surgery, has been found to lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or injections alone. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === According to the FDA approved prescribing information, levofloxacin is pregnancy category C. This designation indicates that animal reproduction studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but the potential benefit to the mother may in some cases outweigh the risk to the fetus. Available data point to a low risk for the unborn child. Exposure to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. Levofloxacin does penetrate into breastmilk, though the concentration of levofloxacin in the breastfeeding infant is expected to be low. Due to potential risks to the baby, the manufacturer does not recommend that nursing mothers take levofloxacin. However, the risk appears to be very low, and levofloxacin can be used in breastfeeding mothers with proper monitoring of the infant, combined with delaying breastfeeding for 4–6 hours after taking levofloxacin. === Children === Levofloxacin is not approved in most countries for the treatment of children except in unique and life-threatening infections because it is associated with an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injury in this population, a property it shares with other fluoroquinolones. In the United States levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of anthrax and plague in children over six months of age. Levofloxacin is recommended by the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first-line treatment for pediatric pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and as a second-line agent for the treatment of penicillin-sensitive cases. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months post-treatment. At 12 months follow-up the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, approximately two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae. === Spectrum of activity === Levofloxacin and later generation fluoroquinolones are collectively referred to as ""respiratory quinolones"" to distinguish them from earlier fluoroquinolones which exhibited modest activity toward the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug exhibits enhanced activity against the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae relative to earlier fluoroquinolone derivatives like ciprofloxacin. For this reason, it is considered a ""respiratory fluoroquinolone"" along with more recently developed fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. It is less active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lacks the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. Levofloxacin has shown moderate activity against anaerobes, and is about twice as potent as ofloxacin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium avium complex. Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Gram positive (methicillin-sensitive but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes), and atypical bacterial pathogens (Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Compared to earlier antibiotics of the fluoroquinoline class such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin exhibits greater activity towards Gram-positive bacteria but lesser activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. === Resistance === Resistance to fluoroquinolones is common in staphylococcus and pseudomonas. Resistance occurs in multiple ways. One mechanism is by an alteration in topoisomerase IV enzyme. A double mutant form of S. pneumoniae Gyr A + Par C bearing Ser-81-->Phe and Ser-79-->Phe mutations were eight to sixteen times less responsive to ciprofloxacin. == Contraindications and interactions == Package inserts mention that levofloxacin is to be avoided in patients with a known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin or other quinolone drugs. Like all fluoroquinolines, levofloxacin is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders, and in patients who have a history of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Levofloxacin may prolong the QT interval in some people, especially the elderly, and levofloxacin should not be used for people with a family history of Long QT syndrome, or who have long QT, chronic low potassium, it should not be prescribed with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Unlike ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin does not appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with high dose fluoroquinolone therapy may lead to seizures. When levofloxacin is taken with anti-acids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts that are difficult to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is taken with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc. A 2011 review examining musculoskeletal complications of fluoroquinolones proposed guidelines with respect to administration to athletes, that called for avoiding all use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if possible, and if they are used: ensure there is informed consent about the musculoskeletal risks, and inform coaching staff; do not use any corticosteroids if fluoroquinolones are used; consider dietary supplements of magnesium and antioxidants during treatment; reduce training until the course of antibiotic is finished and then carefully increase back to normal; and monitor for six months after the course is finished, and stop all athletic activity if symptoms emerge. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are typically mild to moderate. However, severe, disabling, and potentially irreversible adverse effects sometimes occur, and for this reason it is recommended that use of fluoroquinolones be limited. Prominent among these are adverse effects that became the subject of a black box warning by the FDA in 2016. The FDA wrote: ""An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system."" Rarely, tendinitis or tendon rupture may occur due to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including levofloxacin. Such injuries, including tendon rupture, has been observed up to six months after cessation of treatment; higher doses of fluoroquinolones, being elderly, transplant patients, and those with a current or historical corticosteroid use are at elevated risk. The U.S. label for levofloxacin also contains a black box warning for the exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disease myasthenia gravis. Similarly, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommendations warn of rare but disabling and potentially irreversible adverse effects, and to recommend limiting use of these drugs. Increasing age and corticosteroid use appears to increase the risk of musculoskeletal complications. A wide variety of other uncommon but serious adverse events have been associated with fluoroquinolone use, with varying degrees of evidence supporting causation. These include anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, central nervous system effects including seizures and psychiatric effects, prolongation of the QT interval, blood glucose disturbances, and photosensitivity, among others. Levofloxacin may produce fewer of these rare serious adverse effects than other fluoroquinolones. There is some disagreement in the medical literature regarding whether and to what extent levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs. Concerning more usual adverse effects, in pooled results from 7537 patients exposed to levofloxacin in 29 clinical trials, 4.3% discontinued treatment due to adverse drug reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Overall, 7% of patients experienced nausea, 6% headache, 5% diarrhea, and 4% insomnia, along with other adverse reactions experienced at lower rates. Administration of levofloxacin or other broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridioides strain. More research is needed to determine the best dose and length of treatment. == Overdose == Overdosing experiments in animals showed loss of body control and drooping, difficulty breathing, tremors, and convulsions. Doses in excess of 1500 mg/kg orally and 250 mg/kg IV produced significant mortality in rodents. In the event of an acute overdosage, authorities recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases. Topoisomerase IV is necessary to separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, so that it will fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide. As of 2011, the mechanism of action for the drug's musculoskeletal complications were not clear. === Pharmacokinetics === Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with a plasma concentration profile over time that is essentially identical to that obtained from intravenous administration of the same amount over 60 minutes. As such, the intravenous and oral formulations of levofloxacin are considered interchangeable. Levofloxacin's ability to bind to proteins in the body ranges from 24 to 38%. The drug undergoes widespread distribution into body tissues. Peak levels in skin are achieved 3 hours after administration and exceed those in plasma by a factor of 2. Similarly, lung tissue concentrations range from two-fold to five-fold higher than plasma concentrations in the 24 hours after a single dose. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. Elimination occurs mainly via excretion of unmetabolized drug in the urine. Following oral administration, 87% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug within 2 days. Less than 5% was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, the only metabolites identified in humans. == Chemistry == Like all fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin is a fluorinated quinolone carboxylic acid. It is a chiral molecule and the pure (−)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug ofloxacin. This enantiomer binds more effectively to the DNA gyrase enzyme and to topoisomerase IV than its (+)-(R)-counterpart. Levofloxacin is referred to as a chiral switch: These are chiral drugs that have already been patent claimed, approved and marketed as racemates (or as mixtures of diastereomers but have since been redeveloped as pure enantiomers. Distinct functional groups on this molecules include a hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, and an aromatic ring. The substance is used as the hemihydrate, which has the empirical formula C18H20FN3O4 · 1⁄2 H2O and a molecular mass of 370.38 g/mol. Levofloxacin is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. A major issue in the synthesis of levofloxacin is identifying correct entries into the benzoxazine core in order to produce the correct chiral form. == History == Levofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone, being one of the isomers of ofloxacin, which was a broader-spectrum conformationally locked analog of norfloxacin; both ofloxacin and levofloxaxin were synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. The Daiichi scientists knew that ofloxacin was racemic, but tried unsuccessfully to separate the two isomers; in 1985 they succeeded in separately synthesizing the pure levo form and showed that it was less toxic and more potent than the other form. It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1993, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Cravit. Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson as it had with ofloxacin, obtained FDA approval in 1996 under the brand name Levaquin to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis. == Society and culture == === Economics === Levofloxacin had reached blockbuster status by this time; combined worldwide sales of levofloxacin and ofloxacin for J&J alone were US$1.6 billion in 2009. The term of the levofloxacin United States patent was extended by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 810 days under the provisions of the Hatch Waxman Amendment so that the patent would expire in 2010 instead of 2008. This extension was challenged by generic drug manufacturer Lupin Pharmaceuticals, which did not challenge the validity of the patent, but only the validity of the patent extension, arguing that the patent did not cover a ""product"" and so Hatch-Waxman was not available for extensions. The federal patent court ruled in favor of J&J and Daiichi, and generic versions of levofloxacin did not enter the U.S. market until 2009. === Availability === Levofloxacin is available in tablet form, injection,patches and oral solution. === Usage === The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that in 2011, over 23 million outpatient prescriptions for fluoroquinolones, of which levofloxacin made up 28%, were filled in the United States. === Litigation === As of 2012, Johnson and Johnson was facing around 3400 state and federal lawsuits filed by people who claimed tendon damage from levofloxacin; about 1900 pending in a class action at the United States District Court in Minnesota and about 1500 pending at a district court in New Jersey. In October 2012, J&J settled 845 cases in the Minnesota action, after Johnson and Johnson prevailed in three of the first four cases to go to trial. By May 2014, all but 363 cases had been settled or adjudicated. === Brand names === Levofloxacin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under a license agreement signed with Daiichi in 1993, under the brand name Tavanic. == References ==",Levofloxacin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.038458114839159e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007180972606875002)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Levofloxacin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levofloxacin?utm_source=openai')])"
4158,"('Trolamine', 'Sterolamide', 'Tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine', 'Daltogen', 'Nitrilotriethanol')","Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Triethanolamine, or TEOA, is an organic compound with the chemical formula N(CH2CH2OH)3. It is a colourless, viscous liquid. It is both a tertiary amine and a triol. A triol is a molecule with three alcohol groups. Approximately 150,000 tonnes were produced in 1999. It is a colourless compound although samples may appear yellow because of impurities. == Production == Triethanolamine is produced from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia, also produced are ethanolamine and diethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by changing the stoichiometry of the reactants. == Applications == Triethanolamine is used primarily in making surfactants, such as for emulsifier. It is a common ingredient in formulations used for both industrial and consumer products. The triethanolamine neutralizes fatty acids, adjusts and buffers the pH, and solubilizes oils and other ingredients that are not completely soluble in water. Triethanolammonium salts in some cases are more soluble than salts of alkali metals that might be used otherwise, and results in less alkaline products than would from using alkali metal hydroxides to form the salt. Some common products in which triethanolamine is found are sunscreen lotions, liquid laundry detergents, dishwashing liquids, general cleaners, hand sanitizers, polishes, metalworking fluids, paints, shaving cream and printing inks. === Cement production === Triethanolamine is also used as organic additive (0.1 wt%) in the grinding of cement clinker. It facilitates the grinding process by preventing agglomeration and coating of the powder at the surface of balls and mill wall. === Cosmetics and medicine === Various ear diseases and infections are treated with eardrops containing triethanolamine polypeptide oleate-condensate, such as Cerumenex in the United States. In pharmaceutics, triethanolamine is the active ingredient of some eardrops used to treat impacted earwax. It also serves as a pH balancer in many different cosmetic products, ranging from cleansing creams and milks, skin lotions, eye gels, moisturizers, shampoos, shaving foams, TEOA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10, whereas the pH of skin is less than pH 7, approximately 5.5−6.0. Cleansing milk–cream emulsions based on TEOA are particularly good at removing makeup. === Derivatives === Amustaline Trolnitrate Trimustine === In the laboratory and in amateur photography === Another common use of TEOA is as a complexing agent for aluminium ions in aqueous solutions. This reaction is often used to mask such ions before complexometric titrations with another chelating agent such as EDTA. TEOA has also been used in photographic (silver halide) processing. It has been promoted as a useful alkali by amateur photographers. === In holography === TEOA is used to provide a sensitivity boost to silver-halide-based holograms, and also as a swelling agent to color shift holograms. It is possible to get the sensitivity boost without color shift by rinsing out the TEOA before squeegee and drying. === In electroless plating === TEOA is now commonly and very effectively used as a complexing agent in electroless plating. === In ultrasonic testing === 2-3% in water TEOA is used as an corrosion inhibitor (anti-rust) agent in immersion ultrasonic testing. === In aluminium soldering === Triethanolamine, diethanolamine and aminoethylethanolamine are major components of common liquid organic fluxes for the soldering of aluminium alloys using tin-zinc and other tin or lead-based soft solders. == Safety and regulation == === Allergic reactions === A 1996 study found that triethanolamine (TEOA) occasionally causes contact allergy. A 2001 study found TEOA in a sunscreen caused an allergic contact dermatitis. A 2007 study found TEOA in ear drops caused a contact allergy. Systemic and respiratory tract (RT) toxicity was analyzed for 28 days in a nose specific inhalation 2008 study in Wistar rats; TEOA seems to be less potent in regard to systemic toxicity and RT irritancy than diethanolamine (DEA). Exposure to TEOA resulted in focal inflammation, starting in single male animals from 20 mg/m3 concentrations. A 2009 study stated that patch test reactions reveal a slight irritant potential instead of a true allergic response in several cases, and also indicated the risk of skin sensitization to TEOA seems to be very low. === Tumors === Reports indicated that TEOA causes an increased incidence of tumor growth in the liver in female B6C3F1 mice, but not in male mice or in Fischer 344 rats. A 2004 study concluded ""TEOA may cause liver tumors in mice via a choline-depletion mode of action and that this effect is likely caused by the inhibition of choline uptake by cells."" === Environmental toxicity === A 2009 study found that TEOA has potential acute, sub-chronic and chronic toxicity properties in respect to aquatic species. === Regulation === TEOA is listed under Schedule 3, part B of the Chemical Weapons Convention as it can be used in the manufacture of HN3 nitrogen mustard. == See also == Complexometric titration Ethanolamine Ethanol Triethanolamine salicylate == References ==",Tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IND', -0.012524965219199657), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.016119297593832016), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -5.848420551046729e-05), (' MED', -0.004620710853487253), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.0651211142539978), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.00018153927521780133), ('ĠPERSON', -0.002690150635316968), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.018164945766329765), ('ĠMED', -0.015431763604283333), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07895595580339432)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.6931471824645996), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([chembk.com](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Tris%282-hydroxyethyl%29amine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=121, start_index=27, title='Tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Tris%282-hydroxyethyl%29amine?utm_source=openai')])"
