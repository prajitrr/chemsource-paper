3072,"('Veralipride', '(¬±)-veralipride', 'Agreal', 'Agradil', 'Veralipride [inn]')",Medical,"Veralipride (Agreal, Agradil) is an atypical antipsychotic of the benzamide class. It is used for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. It is a D2 receptor antagonist and it induces prolactin secretion without any estrogenic or progestagenic effects. It was first authorised for use in 1979. However, Veralipride has never gained approval in the United States. The women who took it, in addition to extra-pyramidal effects, experienced an aggressive form of depression that resulted in death by suicide for some. The Sanofi laboratory, despite knowing its side effects, allowed women to continue taking it for a considerable amount of time. For this reason, its sale was banned in all countries except Mexico, which allowed its sale to continue for at least 15 years. In September 2006, veralipride was withdrawn from the Spanish market. As a result, the European Commission referred the matter to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In July 2007, the EMA recommended the withdrawal of marketing authorisations for veralipride. == See also == Atypical antipsychotic Benzamide Levosulpiride == References ==",Veralipride,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.07897207885980606)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0847986231965479e-05), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011062243953347206)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/european-medicines-agency-recommends-withdrawal-medicinal-products-containing-veralipride,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veralipride,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/referrals/agreal ', [])"

Therefore the pharmacokinetics of Bimosiamose disodium were studied in healthy male volunteers after single and multiple subcutaneous injections. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial was carried out. The subjects received subcutaneous injections of placebo or 100, 200 or 300 mg Bimosiamose disodium into the abdomen. Plasma and urine concentrations of Bimosiamose were determined. The maximum plasma concentration was 2.17+/-0.70 microg/ml and the AUC(0-infinity) 11.1+/-2.9 h microg/ml after the highest dose on day 1 (mean+/-SD). For the apparent clearance CL/f 28.7+/-7.3 l/h and the terminal half life t(1/2) 3.7+/-0.6 h were calculated. The mean residence time MRT(infinity) of 5.5 to 6.3 h for s.c. injection exceeded that after i.v. infusion due to an extended absorption time. For multiple dosing, constant pre-dose concentrations of about 20 ng/ml may be reached after two subsequent doses of 200 or 300 mg Bimosiamose disodium once daily. Almost 15% of the administered drug was excreted unchanged in urine. Moreover, Bimosiamose was well tolerated. The aim of these first-in-human studies was to investigate the tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of bimosiamose disodium (TBC1269Z) administered by inhalation. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I trials were performed in healthy males. In a single-dose escalating study 48 subjects received doses of 2-140 mg bimosiamose disodium by inhalation and in a multiple-dose study 32 subjects received 8-70 mg bimosiamose disodium twice daily. In both studies 4 ml of the drug solution was administered via nebulizer over 15 min. Adverse events, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory parameters and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) data were recorded and nasopharyngeal examinations were performed to address the safety and tolerability. Blood was collected for the determination of plasma concentrations of bimosiamose. All subjects completed the study. No deaths or severe adverse events occurred. Eleven mild adverse events occurred in the dose-escalation study and 34 in the multiple-dose study after inhalation of bimosiamose disodium. Adverse events were more frequent at the highest dose (140 mg) of the dose-escalation study. For placebo treatment one moderate adverse event was observed in the dose-escalation study after placebo treatment, eight mild and three moderate adverse events occurred in the multiple-dose study. Bimosiamose was detected in plasma (maximum concentration 64 ng ml(-1)) only at doses > or =50 mg given twice daily and 105 mg once daily. For the highest dose a median value of 5746 h ng ml(-1) was determined for the AUC over the entire period of treatment of the multiple-dose study. The results suggest that single and multiple inhalation of bimosiamose disodium up to 70 mg is well tolerated in healthy males. Systemic bioavailability after inhalation is low. Selectins, a family of cell adhesion molecules, are involved in leukocyte extravasation to sites of inflammation. We investigated the safety and efficacy of the inhaled pan-selectin antagonist Bimosiamose in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 77 COPD patients (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 57% pred.) were enrolled in a cross-over, double-blind, randomized, Placebo-controlled, multi-center trial. Bimosiamose (10 mg) or Placebo was inhaled twice daily via the breath actuated nebulizer Akita2 Apixneb™ for 28 days on top of standard bronchodilator therapy. Efficacy was assessed by measurement of inflammatory parameters in induced sputum (differential cell count, interleukin-8, matrix-metalloproteinase-9, myeloperoxidase) and lung function at day 28 of both treatment periods. The total adverse event ratio of Bimosiamose compared to Placebo treatment was balanced. Compared to Placebo, treatment with Bimosiamose led to a decrease of the interleukin-8 concentration (-9.49 ng/mL, 95%CI -18.8 to -2.7 ng/mL, p = 0.008), for the neutrophil count a difference of -0.368 × 10(6) cells/mL (95%CI -1.256 to 0.407 × 10(6)/mL, p = 0.313) was found.

This was a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of 106 patients were randomised to receive either 1 mg of vitamin K4 (menadiol diacetate) or placebo for 24 weeks. Ninety patients (n = 45 in each study group) were included in the final analysis. After 24 weeks, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (16.54 ± 7.81 vs. 29.09 ± 36.56, P = 0.027) and fasting serum insulin (FSI) (6.86 ± 3.45 vs. 11.13 ± 12.66 µU/ml, P = 0.032) were significantly lower in the vitamin K group compared to placebo. Additionally, triglycerides (TG) (144.94 ± 50.7 vs. 172.8 ± 101.5 mg/dl, P = 0.031) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) levels (28.9 ± 9.88 vs. 34.6 ± 20.30 mg/dl, P = 0.027) decreased significantly in the vitamin K group after 24 weeks compared to baseline. Moreover, more patients in the vitamin K group (35.6%) had their antidiabetic medication doses reduced after 24 weeks compared to placebo (13.3%, P = 0.029). Vitamin K4 supplementation for 24 weeks is capable of improving insulin resistance and TG levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the improvement in insulin resistance was reflected in the decrease in antidiabetic medication doses. However, it did not affect fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or glycated haemoglobin (HbA The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with ID: NCT04285450. Vitamin K (VK) is a group of fat‑soluble vitamins, which serve important roles in blood coagulation and bone metabolism. A recent study reported that several VK subtypes possess antitumor properties, however the antitumor effects of VK in osteosarcoma are unknown. The present study aimed to identify the antitumor effects of VK in osteosarcoma and the possible underlying mechanism of action. The effect of VK4 on cell viability was determined using a 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cellular and nuclear morphological changes were observed by phase contrast microscopy. Cell cycle analysis, apoptotic rate, mitochondrial membrane potential and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry. In vitro cancer cell migration activities were evaluated using a Wound healing assay and Transwell microplates. The results demonstrated that VK4 arrested the cells in S phase and induced apoptosis. Additional mechanistic studies indicated that the induction of apoptosis by VK4 was associated with the increased production of reactive oxygen species, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased Bcl‑2 family protein expression levels and activation of caspase‑3. In conclusion, the results suggest that the sensitivity of U2OS osteosarcoma cells to VK4 may be as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. As it is readily available for human consumption, VK4 may therefore present a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of patients with osteosarcoma. G1 and G2 fluorene dendrimers with naphthalene termini were synthesized as a fluorescence turn-on type chemical sensor for vitamin K4. The fluorene dendrimers were prepared by Williamson ether reaction between the fluorene core with dihydroxy groups and dendritic naphthalene segments with methylene chloride by a convergent method. We investigated the relationship between the dendrimer generation and vitamin K4 recognition of fluorene dendrimer with naphthalene termini in CHCl3. Addition of vitamin K4 enhanced the fluorescence intensity of the fluorene dendrimer. Especially, the G2 fluorene dendrimer was found to be an effective chemical sensor for vitamin K4 and better than the G1 fluorene dendrimer.",Vitamin k4,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.013498182408511639), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.029753267765045166), (' FOOD', -0.0007287554908543825)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0346263125538826), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.06198453530669212), ('ĠFOOD', -0.17950966954231262), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1269601732492447)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.03483590856194496), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011047814972698689), (' FOOD', -0.3868744373321533)])","('INFO; https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB2678939.htm,https://sielc.com/vitamin-k4,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/vitamin-k4-cas-573-20-6-cay33970-50,https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/573-20-6_161772.html,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8701896/,https://www.glpbio.com/vitamin-k4-acetomenaphthone.html ', [])"
3076,"('Potassium oxonate', 'Potassium azaorotate', 'Potassium otastat', 'Oxonic acid', 'Oteracil')",Medical," Current evidences suggest that hyperuricemia is closely related to the overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid (UA). Curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenol component extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has been reported to treat various symptoms such inflammation disease, seems to be efficacious in hyperuricemia. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of CUR on hyperuricemia and kidney inflammation in hyperuricemic mice. Administration with CUR (20 or 40 mg/kg) or allopurinol (ALL, 5 mg/kg) was given to mice orally one hour later after the injection of potassium oxonate (PO) (300 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 days. CUR administration decreased the levels of uric acid (UA), creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in serum. Meanwhile, treatment with CUR effectively inhibited serum and liver xanthine oxidase (XOD) levels, and further renewed normal antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD, GSH-Px), reduced MDA accumulation in serum. Further studies showed that CUR decreased inflammatory cytokines productions (IL-1β, IL-18) in serum, as well as inhibited PO-induced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in the kidney. In conclusion, the study revealed that CUR exhibited anti-hyperuricemic and anti-inflammatory effects through suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in kidney and provided the evidence for treating hyperuricemia and associated renal inflammation.

In this study, we employed the tree shrew as an animal model to study potassium oxonate-induced HUA. The effect of allopurinol (ALLO), a uric acid reducer, was also examined in this model. Potassium oxonate at doses of 5, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 1,000 mg/kg was given intraperitoneally to tree shrews. The results showed that potassium oxonate can effectively increase the levels of uric acid in tree shrews at doses ranging from 40 to 100 mg/kg. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH/XO) mRNA expression level was significantly higher in the liver tissue of tree shrews with high levels of uric acid. There were no changes in serum urea nitrogen, or serum creatinine values. ALLO can significantly decrease serum uric acid levels (P<0.01) and raise XDH/XO mRNA expression levels in the liver tissue of tree shrews with HUA. XDH/XO mRNA expression levels did not change in untreated tree shrews. Studies on acute toxicity in the tree shrew did not show any significantly abnormal signs. There were no adverse effects at the macroscopic level up to doses ≤100 mg/kg. Potassium oxonate induced acute HUA in tree shrews at lower doses compared with other animal models.

3078,"('Rofecoxib', 'Mk 966', 'Vioxx', 'Ceoxx', 'Mk 0966')",Medical,"Rofecoxib is a COX-2-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Rofecoxib was approved in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. Rofecoxib was available by prescription in both tablets and as an oral suspension. Rofecoxib gained widespread use among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx. In 2005, the FDA issued a memorandum concluding that risks for serious cardiovascular (CV) events seem to be as great for nonselective NSAIDs as for COX-2–selective agents such as rofecoxib, according to long-term, controlled clinical trials. Based on data up to 2015, the FDA reasserted the likelihood of an increased risk of serious adverse CV events from COX-2–selective and nonselective NSAIDs, dependent on dose and duration. In November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. == Mode of action == Cyclooxygenase (COX) has two well-studied isoforms, called COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for protection of the stomach lining, while COX-2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. By creating ""selective"" NSAIDs that inhibit COX-2, but not COX-1, the same pain relief as traditional NSAIDs is offered, but with greatly reduced risk of fatal or debilitating peptic ulcers. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or ""coxib"". Though the class of coxibs includes several agents, degrees of COX-2 selectivity vary among them, with celecoxib (Celebrex) being the least COX-2 selective, and rofecoxib (Vioxx), valdecoxib (Bextra), and etoricoxib (Arcoxia), being highly COX-2 selective. At the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib approved in the United States with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. === Pharmacokinetics === The therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%. Rofecoxib crossed the placenta and blood–brain barrier, and took 1–3 hours to reach peak plasma concentration with an effective half-life (based on steady-state levels) around 17 hours. The metabolic products are cis-dihydro and trans-dihydro derivatives of rofecoxib which are primarily excreted through urine. == Efficacy == Rofecoxib was approved by the FDA to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. When it was marketed, it gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. === Premenstrual acne === A 2003 placebo-controlled, small, short-term study in India of 80 women with premenstrual acne vulgaris, were given rofecoxib or placebo for two cycles of 10 days suggest that ""rofecoxib is effective in the management of premenstrual acne. === Fabricated efficacy studies === On March 11, 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., revealed that data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as celecoxib) had been fabricated, overstating the analgesic effects of the drugs. No evidence has been found that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company Pfizer (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States). The retracted studies were not submitted to either the FDA or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Drug manufacturer Merck had no comment on the disclosure. == Side effects == In addition to the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits no effect on bleeding time or platelet aggregation, even at supratherapeutic doses. Aside from these features, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse-effect profile to other NSAIDs. === Heart and blood vessels === ==== VIGOR study and publishing controversy ==== The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse-effect profiles of a supratherapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant four-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, relative risk 0.25) over a mean duration of 9 months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. No significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events was seen between the two groups, nor did any significant difference occur in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass). Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks ""is primarily due to"" this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer's alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the US FDA in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, ""Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four- to five-fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen)."" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). Months after the preliminary version of VIGOR was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2000, the journal editors learned that certain data reported to the FDA were not included in the NEJM article. Several years later, when they were shown a Merck memo during the depositions for the first federal Vioxx trial, they realized that these data had been available to the authors months before publication. The editors wrote an editorial accusing the authors of deliberately withholding the data. They released the editorial to the media on December 8, 2005, before giving the authors a chance to respond. NEJM editor Gregory Curfman explained that the quick release was due to the imminent presentation of his deposition testimony, which he feared would be misinterpreted in the media. He had earlier denied any relationship between the timing of the editorial and the trial. Although his testimony was not actually used in the December trial, Curfman had testified well before the publication of the editorial. The editors charged that ""more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article."" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the ""aspirin not indicated"" group) and the editors noted that the omission ""resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups."" The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (two-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the NEJM, though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication. The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection, thus were appropriately not included. (Using the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. They further noted that all of the data in the ""omitted"" table were printed in the text of the article. The authors stood by the original article. NEJM stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks). Some scientists have accused the NEJM editorial board of making unfounded accusations. Others have applauded the editorial. Renowned research cardiologist Eric Topol, a prominent Merck critic, accused Merck of ""manipulation of data"" and said ""I think now the scientific misconduct trial is really fully backed up"". Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association, welcomed the editorial, saying ""this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies"". On May 15, 2006, the Wall Street Journal reported that a late-night email, written by an outside public relations specialist and sent to Journal staffers hours before the Expression of Concern was released, predicted that ""the rebuke would divert attention to Merck and induce the media to ignore the New England Journal of Medicine's own role in aiding Vioxx sales."" ""Internal emails show the New England Journal's expression of concern was timed to divert attention from a deposition in which Executive Editor Gregory Curfman made potentially damaging admissions about the journal's handling of the Vioxx study. In the deposition, part of the Vioxx litigation, Dr. Curfman acknowledged that lax editing might have helped the authors make misleading claims in the article."" The Journal stated that NEJM's ""ambiguous"" language misled reporters into incorrectly believing that Merck had deleted data regarding the three additional heart attacks, rather than a blank table that contained no statistical information; ""the New England Journal says it didn't attempt to have these mistakes corrected."" Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President Edward Scolnick took much of the blame for the suppression of this information. The FDA reviewers were aware of the potential for cardiovascular risk in 1999and it was argued that Merck had manipulated their EKG tests one week after the external review board provided their consultation to specifically exclude high risk factors from the trial subjects to avoid finding effect then predated the changes to their trials to almost three months earlier. ==== Alzheimer's disease ==== In 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety. ==== APPROVe study ==== In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps. Celecoxib had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib, as well. An additional aim of the study was to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib. The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including heart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus placebo, the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. In summary, the APPROVe study suggested that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in nearly twice the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo. ==== Other studies ==== Preapproval phase III clinical trials, like the APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events for the first 18 months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others have pointed out that ""study 090"", a preapproval trial, showed a three-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a seven-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another NSAID), and an eight-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005). Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia. ==== Other COX-2 inhibitors ==== In 2005, the FDA issued a memo concluding that along with the other approved COX-2 selective NSAIDs available at the time (i.e., celecoxib, and valdecoxib), rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo. They also noted that the available data did not permit a rank ordering of these drugs with regard to cardiovascular risk. Only Celebrex (generic name is celecoxib) is still available for purchase in the United States. Regulatory authorities worldwide now require warnings about cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. For example, in 2005, EU regulators required the following changes to the product information and/or packaging of all COX-2 inhibitors: Contraindications stating that COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and also in patients with peripheral arterial disease Reinforced warnings to healthcare professionals to exercise caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors to patients with risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking Given the association between cardiovascular risk and exposure to COX-2 inhibitors, doctors are advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of treatment ==== Other NSAIDs ==== Since the withdrawal of Vioxx it has come to light that there may be negative cardiovascular effects with not only other COX-2 inhibitiors, but even the majority of other NSAIDs. It is only with the recent development of drugs like Vioxx that drug companies have carried out the kind of well executed trials that could establish such effects and these sort of trials have never been carried out in older ""trusted"" NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac and others. The possible exceptions may be aspirin and naproxen due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties. Analyses in 2011 and 2013 by McGettigan and the Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists (CNT) Collaborators, respectively, demonstrated that the risk of serious CV events was a dose dependent effect of COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, with the possible exception of naproxen, and high therapeutic doses of nonselective NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen 2400 mg/day, diclofenac 150 mg/day) carried similar CV risk when compared to a combined group of therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of COX-2 selective NSAIDs (such as rofecoxib). In 2014, Patrono and Baigent, summarizing all of the currently available data in a review article in Circulation, concluded that with the exception of GI toxicity, neither the efficacy nor the major cardiorenal complications of COX-2 selective NSAIDs appear to be influenced by their level of COX-2 selectivity. They concluded that the CV risk associated with NSAIDs was dependent on dose and duration. This conclusion was further reinforced by the 2016 results of the celecoxib PRECISION trial, which showed no difference in CV event rates between the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib and the non-selective NSAIDs ibuprofen and naproxen. == Withdrawal == Due to the findings of its own APPROVe study, Merck publicly announced its voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market worldwide on September 30, 2004. In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). One FDA analyst estimated that, based upon his mathematical model, Vioxx may have caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market. Senior FDA officials were quick to note, however, that this estimate was based solely on a mathematical model, and must be interpreted with caution. On November 5, 2004, the medical journal The Lancet published a meta-analysis of the available studies on the safety of rofecoxib (Jüni et al., 2004). The authors concluded that, owing to the known cardiovascular risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The Lancet published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall. Merck responded by issuing a rebuttal of the Jüni et al. meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk. === Merck-sponsored ""Martin Report"", 2006 === In 2005, Merck spent $21 million US to retain John S. Martin Jr., a former US District Judge for the Southern District of New York, and colleagues at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. The report, which Merck called the ""Martin Report"", was published in February 2006. The report found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. The report that was filed gave a timeline of the events surrounding Vioxx and stated that Merck intended to operate honestly throughout the process. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information were described as the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics. Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report it had commissioned, and promised to consider the recommendations. The report was criticised in the press as self-serving. Merck insisted that the report was independent and Merck ""had no effect at all on the findings and the conclusions"". Merck hoped that the report would improve public perception of Merck. == FDA position == In 2005, advisory panels in both the US and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that Rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be no worse than those from ibuprofen—though the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market. Following the 2005 FDA Advisory Committee, the FDA issued a memo concluding that data from large long-term controlled clinical trials do not clearly demonstrate that COX-2 selective agents (including rofecoxib) have a greater risk of serious cardiovascular events than non-selective NSAIDs. In 2015, the FDA reinforced this conclusion, stating that the available data support a dose and duration dependent class effect of an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events for COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAIDs. == Litigation == By March 2006, there were over 10,000 cases and 190 class actions filed against Merck over adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib and the adequacy of Merck's warnings. The first wrongful death trial, Rogers v. Merck, was scheduled in Alabama in the spring of 2005, but was postponed after Merck argued that the plaintiff had falsified evidence of rofecoxib use. On August 19, 2005, a jury in Texas voted 10–2 to hold Merck liable for the death of Robert Ernst, a 59-year-old man who allegedly died of a rofecoxib-induced heart attack. Merck argued that the death was due to cardiac arrhythmia, which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The jury awarded Carol Ernst, widow of Robert Ernst, $253.4 million in damages. This award was capped at no more than US$26.1 million because of punitive damages limits under Texas law. Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008. On November 3, 2005, Merck won the second case Humeston v. Merck, a personal injury case, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk. The first federal trial on rofecoxib, Plunkett v. Merck, began on November 29, 2005, in Houston. The trial ended on December 12, 2005, when Judge Eldon E. Fallon of U.S. District Court declared a mistrial because of a hung jury with an eight to one majority, favoring the defense. Upon retrial in February 2006 in New Orleans, where the Vioxx multidistrict litigation (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the NEJM editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study. On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The judge said that Boyd failed to prove the drug caused his stomach pain and internal bleeding. In January 2006, Garza v. Merck began trial in Rio Grande City, Texas. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 21, 2006 the jury awarded the plaintiff $7 million compensatory and $25 million punitive. The Texas Courts of Appeals in San Antonio later ruled Garza's fatal heart attack probably resulted from pre-existing health conditions unrelated to his taking of Vioxx, thus reversing the $32 million jury award. On April 5, 2006, a jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck's failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. After a hearing on April 11, 2006, the jury also awarded Mr. McDarby an additional $9 million in punitive damages. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona. In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the Trade Practices Act by selling a drug which was unfit for sale. By November 2007 Merck announced that it agreed on a mass tort settlement of $4.85 billion between Merck and the lawyers of 27,000 individual lawsuits with a try-every-case strategy as opposed to a class action lawsuit if ""85 percent of the plaintiffs sign up"". After the settlement, the lawyers for the case disputed the $315 million awarded in legal fees. Ultimately, the judge determined how the fees would be awarded to the plaintiff's attorneys. Judge Eldon E. Fallon of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana additionally ordered the plaintiff lawyers to cap their fees at 32% of the settlement amount. The above dispute over lawyer fees has caused scholars and observers to consider tort reform throughout the country. Articles on the subject include The Vioxx Litigation: A Critical Look at Trial Tactics, the Tort System, and the Roles of Lawyers in Mass Tort Litigation and 10 Years of Tort Reform in Texas Bring Fewer Suits, Lower Payouts. In November 2011, Merck announced a civil settlement with the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, and individually with 43 US states and the District of Columbia, to resolve civil claims relating to Vioxx. Under the terms of the settlement, Merck agreed to pay two-thirds of a previously recorded $950 million reserve charge in exchange for release from civil liability. Litigation with seven additional states remains outstanding. Under separate criminal proceedings, Merck pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor charge relating to the marketing of the drug across state lines, incurring a fine of $321.6 million. == Possible return to market == In November 2017, Massachusetts-based Tremeau Pharmaceuticals announced its plan to return rofecoxib (TRM-201) to market as a treatment for hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Tremeau announced that the FDA had granted an orphan designation for TRM-201 (rofecoxib) for the treatment of HA, and that they had received FDA feedback on their development plan. HA is a degenerative joint disease caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. In March 2019 Tremeau announced that they had hired as chief development officer a former Merck employee who had been a product development team leader and also was responsible for executive oversight for numerous clinical trials for the COX-2 inhibitor VIOXX (rofecoxib). Tremeau also announced an upcoming clinical trial for rofecoxib and were seeking investigators. On February 15, 2022, California-based BriOri Biotech announced that it had been issued a patent covering topical formulations of rofecoxib. == See also == COX-2 selective inhibitor Discovery and development of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors David Graham (epidemiologist) == Footnotes == == References == == External links == Court TV's full coverage of the Vioxx civil trials Merck website on Vioxx litigation David Michaels.

3080,"('Citicoline', 'Cytidine diphosphate-choline', ""Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine"", 'Citicholine', 'Cytidine diphosphate choline')","Endogenous, Medical","Citicoline (INN), also known as cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline) or cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine is an intermediate in the generation of phosphatidylcholine from choline, a common biochemical process in cell membranes. Citicoline is naturally occurring in the cells of human and animal tissue, in particular the organs. == Use as a dietary supplement == Citicoline is available as a supplement in over 70 countries under a variety of brand names: CereBleu, Cebroton, Ceraxon, Cidilin, Citifar, Cognizin, Difosfocin, Hipercol, NeurAxon, Nicholin, Sinkron, Somazina, Synapsine, Startonyl, Trausan, Xerenoos, etc. When taken as a supplement, citicoline is hydrolyzed into choline and cytidine in the intestine. Once these cross the blood–brain barrier it is reformed into citicoline by the rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. == Research == === Memory and cognition === Studies suggest, but have not confirmed, potential benefits of citicoline for cognitive impairments. === Ischemic stroke === Some preliminary research suggested that citicoline may reduce the rates of death and disability following an ischemic stroke. However, the largest citicoline clinical trial to date (a randomised, placebo-controlled, sequential trial of 2,298 patients with moderate-to-severe acute ischaemic stroke in Europe), found no benefit of administering citicoline on survival or recovery from stroke. A meta-analysis of seven trials reported no statistically significant benefit for long-term survival or recovery. === Vision === The effect of citicoline on visual function has been studied in patients with glaucoma, with possible positive effect for protecting vision. == Mechanism of action == === Neuroprotective effects === Citicoline may have neuroprotective effects due to its preservation of cardiolipin and sphingomyelin, preservation of arachidonic acid content of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, partial restoration of phosphatidylcholine levels, and stimulation of glutathione synthesis and glutathione reductase activity. Citicoline's effects may also be explained by the reduction of phospholipase A2 activity. Citicoline increases phosphatidylcholine synthesis. The mechanism for this may be: By converting 1, 2-diacylglycerol into phosphatidylcholine Stimulating the synthesis of SAMe, which aids in membrane stabilization and reduces levels of arachidonic acid. This is especially important after an ischemia when arachidonic acid levels are elevated. === Neuronal membrane === The brain preferentially uses choline to synthesize acetylcholine. This limits the amount of choline available to synthesize phosphatidylcholine. When the availability of choline is low or the need for acetylcholine increases, phospholipids containing choline can be catabolized from neuronal membranes. These phospholipids include sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine. Supplementation with citicoline can increase the amount of choline available for acetylcholine synthesis and aid in rebuilding membrane phospholipid stores after depletion. Citicoline decreases phospholipase stimulation. This can lower levels of hydroxyl radicals produced after an ischemia and prevent cardiolipin from being catabolized by phospholipase A2. It can also work to restore cardiolipin levels in the inner mitochondrial membrane. === Cell signalling === Citicoline may enhance cellular communication by increasing levels of neurotransmitters. The choline component of citicoline is used to create acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter in the human brain. Clinical trials have found that citicoline supplementation might improve focus and attention. === Glutamate transport === Citicoline lowers increased glutamate concentrations and raises decreased ATP concentrations induced by ischemia. Citicoline also increases glutamate uptake by increasing expression of EAAT2, a glutamate transporter, in vitro in rat astrocytes. It is suggested that the neuroprotective effects of citicoline after a stroke are due in part to citicoline's ability to decrease levels of glutamate in the brain. This is in part due to an indirect decrease in the extrasynaptic NMDA-TRMP4 death signaling pathway. It's important to also note it is only the extrasynaptic NMDA receptors responsible for excitotoxicity. == Pharmacokinetics == Citicoline is water-soluble, with more than 90% oral bioavailability. Plasma levels of citicholine peak one hour after oral ingestion, and a majority of the citicoline is excreted as CO2 in respiration with the remaining citicoline being excreted through urine. The pharmacokinetic profile of citicholine cannot be described by a single smooth exponential decrease over time. However, the elimination half-life for citicholine has been reported as approximately 50 hours for citicholine removed via respiration and approximately 70 hours for citicholine removed via urine. Plasma levels of choline peak about four hours after ingestion. === Side effects === Citicoline has a very low toxicity profile in animals and humans. Clinically, doses of 2000 mg per day have been observed and approved. Minor transient adverse effects are rare and most commonly include stomach pain and diarrhea. A 2020 study reported that concerns had emerged that chronic citicoline use may have adverse psychiatric effects, however, the study's meta-analysis of the relevant literature did not support this hypothesis. Citicoline may exacerbate psychotic episodes or interact with antipsychotic medication. == Synthesis == === In vivo === Phosphatidylcholine is a major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Close regulation of its biosynthesis, degradation, and distribution is essential to proper cell function. Phosphatidylcholine is synthesized in vivo by two pathways The Kennedy pathway, which includes the transformation of choline to citicoline, by way of phosphorylcholine, produces phosphatidylcholine when condensed with diacylglycerol. Phosphatidylcholine can also be produced by the methylation pathway, where phosphatidylethanolamine is sequentially methylated. == See also == == References ==",Cytidine diphosphate choline,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.512620210647583), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -7.517272024415433e-05), (' FOOD', -0.2030051052570343), (',', -0.10038091987371445), (' MED', -0.25347700715065), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.8174526691436768), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -1.9788545614574105e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.31332629919052124), (',', -0.01106483768671751), ('ĠMED', -0.0005746620590798557), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006730624008923769)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.041102971881628036), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' END', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicoline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=20, title='Citicoline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicoline?utm_source=openai')])"
3081,"('Adenine, 1-methyl-',)","Endogenous, Medical"," The effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), its metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium ion (MPP+, cyperquat) and a structurally-related compound paraquat on mitochondrial functions were investigated in isolated organelles from rat striatum, cortex and liver. MPTP (0.1-1.0 mM) had no significant effect on various parameters of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, MPP+ (0.5 mM) inhibited the oxidation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-linked substrates pyruvate and malate but not that of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD+)-linked substrate succinate. Paraquat (5.0 mM) significantly stimulated basal oxygen consumption (state 4) without influencing the oxygen utilization (state 3) associated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) phosphorylation. Thus, these structurally-related compounds have different effects on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, but the organelles from striatum, cortex and liver were affected in a similar manner by these compounds. Due to pralidoxime chloride's (2-PAM) positive charge, it's penetration through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and reactivation of organophosphate (OP) inhibited central nervous system (CNS) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is poor.

Pro-2-PAM (1-methyl-1,6-dihydropyridine-2-carbaldoxime), a pro-drug of 2-PAM, due to higher hydrophobicity, penetrates the BBB better but must be oxidized to 2-PAM, the active form of the oxime to reactivate CNS AChE in order to abrogate seizures. In this study, we characterize the in vivo mechanism of pro-2-PAM oxidation. A high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay was developed to quantify the conversion of pro-2-PAM to 2-PAM. NADPH oxidase activity was measured by a photo-luminescence assay using lucigenin substrate. Upon analysis, the rate of NADPH induced oxidation suggested that an alternate mechanism may be involved. Therefore, various enzyme co-factors of oxidation-reduction enzyme systems were evaluated, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), riboflavin 5'-phosphate (FMN), and riboflavin. Next, a spectrophotometric assay was developed to measure the conversion of pro-2-PAM to 2-PAM in the presence of riboflavin. In guinea pig brain homogenate, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a specific NADPH oxidase inhibitor, reduced pro-2-PAM to 2-PAM conversion to less than 25%. In contrast, riboflavin, FAD, and FMN rapidly oxidized all pro-2-PAM to 2-PAM in an in vitro assay. Riboflavin oxidized pro-2-PAM reactivated diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) inhibited AChE. The present study shows that pro-2-PAM was rapidly oxidized by riboflavin to 2-PAM, which reactivated organophosphate (OP)-inhibited AChE. Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to mice and nonhuman primates causes a parkinsonian disorder characterized by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra and corresponding motor deficits. MPTP has been proposed to exert its neurotoxic effects through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, displacement of dopamine from vesicular stores, and formation of reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial or cytosolic sources. However, the mechanism of MPTP-induced neurotoxicity is still a matter of debate. Recently, we reported that the yeast single-subunit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) dehydrogenase (NDI1) is resistant to rotenone, a complex I inhibitor that produces a parkinsonian syndrome in rats, and that overexpression of NDI1 in SK-N-MC cells prevents the toxicity of rotenone. In this study, we used viral-mediated overexpression of NDI1 in SK-N-MC cells and animals to determine the relative contribution of complex I inhibition in the toxicity of MPTP. In cell culture, NDI1 overexpression abolished the toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, the active metabolite of MPTP. Overexpression of NDI1 through stereotactic administration of a viral vector harboring the NDI1 gene into the substantia nigra protected mice from both the neurochemical and behavioral deficits elicited by MPTP. These data identify inhibition of complex I as a requirement for dopaminergic neurodegeneration and subsequent behavioral deficits produced by MPTP. Furthermore, combined with reports of a complex I defect in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the present study affirms the utility of MPTP in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.","Adenine, 1-methyl-",PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.3856492842023727e-06)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0022025867365300655), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005304547492414713)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3082,"('Phenothrin', 'Sumithrin', 'Phenoxythrin', 'Phenothrine', 'Pibutin')",Medical,"Phenothrin, also called sumithrin and d-phenothrin, is a synthetic pyrethroid that kills adult fleas and ticks. It has also been used to kill head lice in humans. d-Phenothrin is used as a component of aerosol insecticides for domestic use. It is often used with methoprene, an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's biological lifecycle by killing the eggs. == Effects == Phenothrin is primarily used to kill fleas and ticks. It is also used to kill head lice in humans, but studies conducted in Paris and the United Kingdom have shown widespread resistance to phenothrin. It is extremely toxic to bees. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study found that 0.07 micrograms were enough to kill honey bees. It is also extremely toxic to aquatic life with a study showing concentrations of 0.03 ppb killing mysid shrimp. It has increased risk of liver cancer in rats and mice in long-term exposure, with doses in the range of 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, or above. It is capable of killing mosquitoes, although remains poisonous to cats and dogs, with seizures and deaths being reported due to poisoning. Specific data on concentrations or exposure are lacking. Phenothrin has been found to possess antiandrogen properties, and was responsible for a small epidemic of gynecomastia via isolated environmental exposure. The EPA has not assessed its effect on cancer in humans. However, one study performed by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine linked sumithrin with breast cancer; the link made by its effect on increasing the expression of a gene responsible for mammary tissue proliferation. == EPA action == In 2005, the U.S. EPA cancelled permission to use phenothrin in several flea and tick products, at the request of the manufacturer, Hartz Mountain Industries. The products were linked to a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, tremors, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement called for new warning labels on the products. As of March 31, 2006, the sale and distribution of Hartz's phenothrin-containing flea and tick products for cats has been terminated. However, EPA's product cancellation order did not apply to Hartz flea and tick products for dogs, and Hartz continues to produce many of its flea and tick products for dogs. == See also == Permethrin Resmethrin Deltamethrin == References == == External links == d-Phenothrin general information – National Pesticide Information Center Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids Pesticide Information Profile – Extension Toxicology Network Phenothrin in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Pibutin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.04865356534719467), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO, INDUSTRIAL', [('INFO', -0.35220009088516235), (',', -0.623446524143219), ('ĠINDU', -0.9148601293563843), ('ST', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('RI', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10749311000108719)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.07888989895582199)])","('INFO; ', [])"

3084,"('Kanamycin (sulfate)', 'Kanamycin a monosulfate', 'Kanamycin', 'Kanamycin sulfate', 'Kanamycin base')",Medical,"Kanamycin A, often referred to simply as kanamycin, is an antibiotic used to treat severe bacterial infections and tuberculosis. It is not a first line treatment. It is used by mouth, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle. Kanamycin is recommended for short-term use only, usually from 7 to 10 days. Since antibiotics only show activity against bacteria, it is ineffective in viral infections. Common side effects include hearing and balance problems. Kidney problems may also occur. Kanamycin is not recommended during pregnancy as it may harm the baby. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. Kanamycin is in the aminoglycoside family of medications. It has the weakest antibacterial capabilities of all compounds in this family when used clinically, which is partially due to its increased toxicity in comparison to other aminoglycosides. It works by blocking the production of proteins that are required for bacterial survival. Kanamycin was first isolated in 1957 by Hamao Umezawa from the bacterium Streptomyces kanamyceticus. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. It is no longer marketed in the United States. == Medical uses == === Spectrum of activity === Kanamycin is indicated for short-term treatment of bacterial infections caused by one or more of the following pathogens: E. coli, Proteus species (both indole-positive and indole-negative), Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter species. In cases of serious infection when the causative organism is unknown, Kanamycin injection in conjunction with a penicillin- or cephalosporin-type drug may be given initially before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. Kanamycin does not treat viral infections. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Kanamycin is pregnancy category D in the United States. Kanamycin enters breast milk in small amounts. The manufacturer therefore advises that people should either stop breastfeeding or kanamycin. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers kanamycin okay in breastfeeding. === Children === Kanamycin should be used with caution in newborns due to the risk of increased drug concentration resulting from immature kidney function. == Side effects == Serious side effects include ringing in the ears or loss of hearing, toxicity to kidneys, and allergic reactions to the drug. Ototoxicity is a common quality among aminoglycosides, and its rate of incidence in kanamycin is around 3-10%. Other side effects include: Gastrointestinal effects Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea Musculoskeletal effects Myasthenia gravis Neurologic effects Headache Paresthesias Blurring of vision Neuromuscular blockade Metabolic effects Malabsorption syndrome == Mechanism == Kanamycin works by interfering with protein synthesis. It binds to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This results in incorrect alignment with the mRNA and eventually leads to a misread that causes the wrong amino acid to be placed into the peptide. This leads to nonfunctional peptide chains. == Bacterial Resistance == Bacterial resistance to kanamycin is a serious and increasing phenomenon, which is very concerning for its use in treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and other multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections. This is due in part to possible cross-resistance between kanamycin and other aminoglycosides, such as amikacin, capreomycin, and gentamicin. Resistance to these aminoglycosides is due to mutations in the 16S rRNA gene (rrs) within the 30S subunit that stops the antibacterial from binding tightly to the gene. These mutations are most commonly identified through a single-nucleotide variant at the position 1401. == Composition == Kanamycin is a mixture of three main components: kanamycin A, B, and C. Kanamycin A is the major component in kanamycin. The effects of these components do not appear to be widely studied as individual compounds when used against prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. == Biosynthesis == While the main product produced by Streptomyces kanamyceticus is kanamycin A, additional products are also produced, including kanamycin B, kanamycin C, kanamycin D and kanamycin X. The kanamycin biosynthetic pathway can be divided into two parts. The first part is common to several aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as butirosin and neomycin. In it a unique aminocyclitol, 2-deoxystreptamine, is biosynthesized from D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate in four steps. At this point the kanamycin pathway splits into two branches due to the promiscuity of the next enzyme, which can utilize two different glycosyl donors - UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine and UDP-α-D-glucose. One of the branches forms kanamycin C and kanamycin B, while the other branch forms kanamycin D and kanamycin X. However, both kanamycin B and kanamycin D can be converted to kanamycin A, so both branches of the pathway converge at kanamycin A. == Use in research == Kanamycin is used in molecular biology as a selective agent most commonly to isolate bacteria (e.g., E. coli) which have taken up genes (e.g., of plasmids) coupled to a gene coding for kanamycin resistance (primarily Neomycin phosphotransferase II [NPT II/Neo]). Bacteria that have been transformed with a plasmid containing the kanamycin resistance gene are plated on kanamycin (50-100 μg/mL) containing agar plates or are grown in media containing kanamycin (50-100 μg/mL). Only the bacteria that have successfully taken up the kanamycin resistance gene become resistant and will grow under these conditions. As a powder, kanamycin is white to off-white and is soluble in water (50 mg/mL). At least one such gene, Atwbc19 is native to a plant species, of comparatively large size and its coded protein acts in a manner which decreases the possibility of horizontal gene transfer from the plant to bacteria; it may be incapable of giving resistance to bacteria even if gene transfer occurs. === KanMX marker === The selection marker kanMX is a hybrid gene consisting of a bacterial aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (kanr from transposon Tn903) under control of the strong TEF promoter from Ashbya gossypii. Mammalian cells, yeast, and other eukaryotes acquire resistance to geneticin (= G418, an aminoglycoside antibiotic similar to kanamycin) when transformed with a kanMX marker. In yeast, the kanMX marker avoids the requirement of auxotrophic markers. In addition, the kanMX marker renders E. coli resistant to kanamycin. In shuttle vectors the KanMX cassette is used with an additional bacterial promoter. Several versions of the kanMX cassette are in use, e.g. kanMX1-kanMX6. They primarily differ by additional restriction sites and other small changes around the actual open reading frame. == Antibiotic Conjugated Nanoparticle Synthesis == Antibiotic resistance or development of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains is a key challenge for treating bacterial infections. With limited research being carried out to design and develop new antibiotics, novel approaches like functionalizing antibiotic to metal nanoparticles surface to treat resistant bacterial strains have been studied. Kanamycin functionalized gold-nanoparticles (Kan-GNPs) were synthesized and tested for its antibacterial activity against both gram positive and gram negative strains. A dose dependent antibacterial activity was noted for Kan-GNPs in comparison to free kanamycin. == References ==",Kanamycin sulfate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.4741702079772949), (' INDUSTR', -1.7432603272027336e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1324817933200393e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01105682086199522)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.advacarepharma.com/en/pharmaceuticals/kanamycin-sulfate-injection,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01172 ', [])"
3085,"('Ciclopirox', 'Loprox', 'Ciclopiroxum', 'Ciclopiroxum [inn-latin]', 'Penlac')",Medical,"Ciclopirox is a medication used for the treatment of moderate onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails, and for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. In 2022, it was the 247th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ciclopirox is indicated as topical treatment in immunocompetent people with mild to moderate onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails without lunula involvement, due to Trichophyton rubrum,; and for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. === Nail infections === In addition to other formulations, ciclopirox is used in lacquers for topical treatment of onychomycosis (fungal infections of the nails). A meta-analysis of the six trials of nail infections available in 2009 concluded that they provided evidence that topical ciclopirox had poor cure rates, and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective, but more research was required. ""Combining data from 2 trials of ciclopiroxolamine versus placebo found treatments failure rates of 61% and 64% for ciclopiroxolamine. These outcomes followed long treatment times (48 weeks) and this makes ciclopiroxolamine a poor choice for nail infections. Better results were observed with the use of amorolfine lacquer; 6% treatment failure rates were found after 1 month of treatment but these data were collected on a very small sample of people and these high rates of success might be unreliable."" Efinaconazole, an azole antifungal, led to cure rates two or three times better than the next-best topical treatment, ciclopirox. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === In contrast to the azoles and other antimycotic drugs, the mechanism of action of ciclopirox is poorly understood. However, loss of function of certain catalase and peroxidase enzymes has been implicated as the mechanism of action, as well as various other components of cellular metabolism. In a study conducted to further elucidate ciclopirox's mechanism, several Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants were screened and tested. Results from interpretation of the effects of both the drug treatment and mutation suggested that ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport. == Chemistry == Ciclopirox is a N-hydroxypyridone. Structurally, ciclopirox is the N-oxide of a 2-hydroxypyridine derivative and therefore can be termed a hydroxypyridine antifungal agent. Additionally, the structure as drawn above is the lactam tautomer and indicates the molecule being an N-hydroxy-2-pyridone. Hence the classification of ciclopirox as a 2-pyridone antifungal agent. == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is sold under many brand names worldwide. == Research == In 2007 it was investigated as an alternative treatment to ketoconazole for seborrhoeic dermatitis as it suppresses growth of the yeast Malassezia furfur.

It is a small molecule inhibitor of HER2. It was developed by Array BioPharma and licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics (formerly Oncothyreon, subsequently part of Seattle Genetics). Common side effects include diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (burning or tingling discomfort in the hands and feet), nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), vomiting, stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), decreased appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anemia and rash. Tucatinib may cause harm to a developing fetus or baby. Tucatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020, in Australia in August 2020, and in the European Union in February 2021. == Medical uses == Tucatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adults with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. In the European Union, it is indicated in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adults with HER2‑positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior anti‑HER2 treatment regimens. In January 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab for RAS wild-type HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. == Clinical trials == Two early stage clinical trials have reported encouraging results, both of which had options to enroll subjects with central nervous system (CNS) metastases. HER2CLIMB is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients with pretreated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. == History == In April 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tucatinib in combination with chemotherapy (trastuzumab and capecitabine) for the treatment of adults with advanced forms of HER2-positive breast cancer that can't be removed with surgery, or has spread to other parts of the body, including the brain, and who have received one or more prior treatments. The FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Health Canada, Health Sciences Authority (HSA, Singapore) and Swissmedic (SMC, Switzerland) on the review. This was the first Project Orbis partnership between the FDA, HSA and Swissmedic. As of 17 April 2020, the application is still under review at the other agencies. Tucatinib is a kinase inhibitor meaning it blocks a type of enzyme (kinase) and helps prevent the cancer cells from growing. Tucatinib is approved for treatment after adults have taken one or more anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. The FDA approved tucatinib based on the results of the HER2CLIMB trial (NCT02614794) enrolling 612 subjects who had HER2-positive advanced unresectable or metastatic breast cancer and had prior treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Subjects with previously treated and stable brain metastases, as well as those with previously treated and growing or untreated brain metastases, were eligible for the clinical trial, and 48% of enrolled subjects had brain metastases at the start of the trial. Subjects received either tucatinib 300 mg twice daily plus trastuzumab and capecitabine (tucatinib arm, n=410) or placebo plus trastuzumab and capecitabine (control arm, n=202). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time when there was no growth of the tumor, assessed by a blinded independent central review, evaluated in the initial 480 randomized patients. The median PFS in subjects who received tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was 7.8 months (95% CI: 7.5, 9.6) compared to 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.2, 7.1) in those subjects who received placebo, trastuzumab, and capecitabine (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.71; p<0.00001). Overall survival and PFS in subjects with brain metastases at baseline were key secondary endpoints. The median overall survival in subjects who received tucatinib, trastuzumab, and capecitabine was 21.9 months (95% CI: 18.3, 31.0) compared to 17.4 months (95% CI: 13.6, 19.9) in subjects who received placebo, trastuzumab, and capecitabine (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.87; p=0.00480). The median PFS in subjects with brain metastases at baseline who received tucatinib, trastuzumab and capecitabine was 7.6 months (95% CI: 6.2, 9.5) compared to 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1, 5.7) in subjects who received placebo, trastuzumab and capecitabine (HR: 0.48; 0.34, 0.69; p<0.00001). The FDA granted the application for tucatinib priority review, breakthrough therapy, fast track, and orphan drug designations.

3088,"('Gemcabene', ""Hexanoic acid, 6,6'-oxybis[2,2-dimethyl-"", 'Gemcabene [inn]', 'Pd 72953')",Medical," Statins are the most widely used drugs for reducing lipid and cholesterol levels in the blood. However, statins have shown some adverse effects and less acceptance among patients; hence, new drugs have been promoted in the market. Furthermore, gemcabenes were discovered in 1995 and are now in phase II and III clinical trials. Gemcabene acts by inhibiting incorporation of 14C-acetate into hepatocytes and stops the mechanism of fatty acids and cholesterol synthesis. In this review the six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were scrutinized from the two databases by using keywords ""Gemcabene"" AND ""Randomized Controlled Trial."" The trials were mainly on animal models, and two studies were found to be associated with human subjects. The study concluded that gemcabene was effective as an anti-inflammatory agent and reduced lipid levels and the progression of fibrosis. Hence, further controlled trials are needed to determine its efficacy and safety in human subjects, along with the identification of adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of model-based, quantitative decision making during the development of gemcabene, a novel lipid-altering agent. The decisions were driven by a model of the likely clinical profile of gemcabene in comparison with its competitors, such as 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, and their combination. Dose-response models were developed for the lipid effects (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol); adverse effects, such as persistent alanine aminotransferase elevation and myalgia; tolerability issues, such as headache; and risk reduction for coronary artery disease-related events for 5 statins, ezetimibe, gemcabene, and their combinations. The integrated model was based on the joint analysis of publicly available summary-level data and proprietary patient-level data and included information from almost 10,000 patients. The model was made available and accessible to the development team by using the Pharsight Drug Model Explorer model visualization technology. The modeling greatly enhanced the understanding of the clinical profile of gemcabene when given alone or in combination with a statin. The interaction between statins and gemcabene for the LDL-C lowering effect was found to be significantly different from the interaction between statins and ezetimibe. Ezetimibe was found to have a pharmacological-independent interaction resulting in additional LDL-C lowering over the entire statin dose range. The gemcabene interaction was found to be less than independent, resulting in almost no additional LDL-C lowering at high-statin doses, although the drug has a significant LDL-C effect when administered alone or in combination with a low dose of a statin. The quick availability of the model after completion of the first phase II trial in the target patient population and the ability of the team to explore the potential clinical efficacy and safety of gemcabene in comparison with alternative treatment options facilitated a quick decision to stop development. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can advance, if untreated, to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure and liver-related death. In the United States, NASH affects approximately 2-5% of the population and an additional 10-30% have NAFLD. The number of drugs in development for NASH is growing steadily, along with nonclinical models to support prediction of clinical success. Here we evaluate gemcabene, a first-in-class clinical candidate for dyslipidemia, for its potential utility, based on its combined lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory efficacy in clinical trials, in a preclinical model of NASH. Gemcabene was evaluated in the STAM™ murine model of NASH. Gemcabene intervention in mice made diabetic with streptozotocin and fed a high fat high-caloric diet was assessed for changes in plasma, and hepatic histological and mRNA markers of lipid metabolism and inflammation. Gemcabene significantly downregulated hepatic mRNA markers of inflammation (TNF-α, MCP-1, MIP-1β, CCR5, CCR2, NF-κB), lipogenesis and lipid modulation (ApoC-III, ACC1, ADH-4, Sulf-2), and fibrosis (TIMP-1 and MMP-2). These effects are important for the prevention of steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning (i.e., the components of the NAFLD Activity Score or NAS), and inhibition of fibrosis progression, and were observed following treatment with gemcabene. These non-clinical findings corroborate with existing clinical data to support the clinical evaluation of gemcabene as a potential new treatment for NASH.",Gemcabene,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009897815762087703), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038068726658821106)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([metaviatx.com](https://www.metaviatx.com/gemcabene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=78, start_index=6, title='Gemcabene | MetaVia Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://www.metaviatx.com/gemcabene?utm_source=openai')])"
3089,"('Azaphen (dihydrochloride monohydrate)', 'Azafen dihydrochloride monohydrate', 'Pipofezin dihydrochloride monohydrate', 'Pipofezine dihydrochloride monohydrate', 'Azaphenonxazine dihydrochloride monohydrate')",Medical," Developing effective treatments for chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has proven extremely difficult. ALS is universally fatal, characterized by progressive weakness due to the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, and leads eventually to respiratory failure which is the usual cause of death. Only a single treatment has been approved, the modestly effective nonspecific neuroprotectant Rilutek (riluzole; 2-amino-6-(trifluoromethoxy)benzothiazole). KNS-760704 [(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine dihydrochloride, RPPX], a synthetic amino-benzothiazole with demonstrated activity in maintaining mitochondrial function, is being developed as a treatment for ALS. It has proven to be effective in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays of neuroprotection, including the G93A-SOD1 mutant mouse model; however, its specific mechanism of action remains unknown. The potential of KNS-760604 as a treatment for ALS was first suggested by studies showing that its optical enantiomer, Mirapex[(6S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine; pramipexole dihydrochloride; PPX], a high-affinity agonist at dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors, exhibits important neuroprotective properties independent of its dopamine receptor agonism. In cell-based assays, both RPPX and PPX reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), attenuate the activation of apoptotic pathways, and increase cell survival in response to a variety of neurotoxins. However, PPX has limited utility as a clinical neuroprotective agent because the drug concentrations required for neuroprotection would likely produce unacceptable dopaminergic side effects. RPPX, on the other hand, while possessing the same neuroprotective potential as PPX, is a much lower-affinity dopamine receptor agonist and may therefore be more useful in the treatment of ALS. This review will examine the data supporting the hypothesis that the RPPX may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including ALS. In addition, we will briefly review recent preclinical data in support of RPPX, and discuss the current status of its clinical development. An efficient, selective, sensitive, and rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for the quantification of pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate and levodopa simultaneously in human plasma with the aid of diphenhydramine as an internal standard. A simple protein precipitation technique with HPLC grade acetonitrile was efficiently utilized for the cleanup of plasma. The analysis was performed using a Hypersil gold 50 mm × 2.1 mm (1.9 µm) column and a mobile phase of 0.2% formic acid and methanol (90: 10 v/v). The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source operated in the positive mode was set up in the selective reaction monitoring mode (SRM) to detect the ion transitions m/z 212.15 →153.01, m/z 198.10→ 135.16, and m/z 255.75 → 166.16 for pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate, levodopa, and diphenhydramine, respectively. The method was thoroughly validated according to FDA guidelines and proved to be linear, accurate, and precise over the range 100-4000 pg/mL for pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate and 60-4000 ng/mL for levodopa. The proposed method was effectively applied for monitoring both drugs in plasma samples of healthy volunteers. The pseudo first-order rate constants and thermodynamic parameters for the decomposition of cefepime in solid state in absence of humidity and at a relative humidity of 76.4% were calculated. The effect of humidity on the stability of cefepime dihydrochloride monohydrate in the humidity range 25.0%-76.4% at 358 K is described by the equation ln ki = (0.031 +/- 0.0043) x RH% - 10.08 +/- 0.22.",Azaphenonxazine dihydrochloride monohydrate,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.008617054671049118)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3875502347946167), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005693173035979271)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([xcessbio.com](https://www.xcessbio.com/products/m9553?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=9, title='Azaphen (dihydrochloride monohydrate) – Xcess Biosciences', type='url_citation', url='https://www.xcessbio.com/products/m9553?utm_source=openai')])"
3090,"('Silibinin', 'Silibinin a', 'Silymarin i', 'Silybin', 'Silybin a')",Medical,"Silibinin (INN), also known as silybin (both from Silybum, the generic name of the plant from which it is extracted), is the major active constituent of silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk thistle, containing a mixture of flavonolignans consisting of silibinin, isosilibinin, silychristin, silidianin, and others. Silibinin itself is a mixture of two diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B, in approximately equimolar ratio. Silibinin is used in pure forms as a medication, and more frequently as an active ingredient in milk thistle–derived herbal supplements. == Medical uses == For approved drug preparations and parenteral applications in the treatment of Amanita mushroom poisoning, the water-soluble silibinin-C-2',3-dihydrogensuccinate disodium salt is used. In 2011, the same compound also received Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for the prevention of recurrent hepatitis C in liver transplant recipients by the European Commission. Silibinin is available in many EU countries for treatment of toxic liver damage (e.g., as an intravenous formulation used in death cap poisoning) or as adjunctive therapy in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. There is limited evidence to support use of silibinin-containing products as a supplement in people with chronic liver disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that silymarin does not affect all-cause mortality in persons with cirrhosis, but it may help prevent liver-related mortality in those patients. There is mixed evidence for silibinin as an anti-inflammatory agent in alcohol-related liver disease or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and trials continue. There is little evidence to support a meaningful antiviral effect of milk thistle in chronic hepatitis C. == Potential medical uses == Silibinin is under investigation to see whether it may have a role in cancer treatment (e.g., due to its inhibition of STAT3 signalling). Silibinin has a number of potential mechanisms that could benefit the skin. These include chemoprotective effects from environmental toxins, anti-inflammatory effects, protection from UV-induced photocarcinogenesis, protection from sunburn, protection from UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia, and DNA repair for UV-induced DNA damage (double strand breaks). Studies on mice demonstrate a significant protection on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)–induced depressive-like behavior on mice and increased cognition in aged rats as a result of consuming silymarin. Due to its immunomodulatory, iron-chelating, and antioxidant properties, this herb has the potential to be used in beta-thalassemia patients who receive regular blood transfusions and suffer from iron overload. == Pharmacology == Poor water solubility and bioavailability of silymarin led to the development of enhanced formulations. Silipide (trade name Siliphos, not to be confused with the water treatment compound of the same name, a glass-like polyphosphate containing sodium, calcium magnesium and silicate, formulated for the treatment of water problems), a complex of silymarin and phosphatidylcholine (a phospholipid in lecithin), is about 10 times more bioavailable than silymarin. An earlier study had concluded Siliphos to have 4.6 fold higher bioavailability. It has been also reported that silymarin inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin is much more soluble than silymarin itself. There have also been prepared glycosides of silybin, which show better water solubility and even stronger hepatoprotective effect. Silymarin, like other flavonoids, has been shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated cellular efflux. The modulation of P-glycoprotein activity may result in altered absorption and bioavailability of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates. It has been reported that silymarin inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes and an interaction with drugs primarily cleared by P450s cannot be excluded. == Toxicity == Silibinin and all the other compounds found in silymarin, especially silychristin, blocked the MCT8 transporter according to one in vitro study. There is no published clinical information showing silymarin or silibinin cause any thyroid problems. In fact, one clinical trial found that silymarin actually helped prevent thyroid suppression that is often caused by the drug lithium. There is limited research on milk thistle and silymarin in pregnant humans. However, the one known clinical trial found only benefits, including but not limited to effectively treating intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Silymarin is also devoid of embryotoxic potential in animal models. A phase I clinical trial in humans with prostate cancer designed to study the effects of high dose silibinin found 13 grams daily to be well tolerated in patients with advanced prostate cancer with asymptomatic liver toxicity (hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase) being the most commonly seen adverse event. == Biotechnology == Silymarin can be produced in callus and cell suspensions of Silybum marianum and substituted pyrazinecarboxamides can be used as abiotic elicitors of flavolignan production. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of silibinin A and silibinin B is composed of two major parts, taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol. Coniferyl alcohol is synthesized in milk thistle seed coat. Starting with the transformation of phenylalanine into cinnamic acid mediated by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Cinnamic acid will then go through two rounds of oxidation by trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase and 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase to give caffeic acid. The meta position alcohol is methylated by caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase to produce ferulic acid. From ferulic acid, the production of coniferyl alcohol is carried out by 4-hydroxycinnamate CoA ligase, cinnamoyl CoA reductase, and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. For taxifolin, its genes for the biosynthesis can be overexpressed in flowers as the transcription is light dependent. The production of taxifolin utilizes a similar pathway as for synthesizing p-coumaric acid followed by three times of carbon chain elongation with malonyl-CoA and cyclization by chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase to yield naringenin. Through flavanone 3-hydroxylase and flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase, taxifolin is furnished. To merge taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol, taxifolin can be translocated from the flower to the seed coat through symplast pathway. Both taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol will be oxidized by ascorbate peroxidase 1 to enable the single electron reaction to couple two fragments generating silybin (silibinin A + silibinin B). == References == == Further reading == == External links == Silymarin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Silybin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.00226170988753438), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00033593899570405483), (' FOOD', -0.0132164740934968), (',', -0.6932930946350098), (' PERSONAL', -0.0020678257569670677), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0014509160537272692), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.04860231652855873), ('ĠFOOD', -0.004785987548530102), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014183899387717247)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.0009328982559964061), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.04858805239200592), (' MED', -2.2200749754119897e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=15, title='Silibinin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silibinin?utm_source=openai')])"
3091,"('Crocin', 'Gardenia yellow', 'Alpha-crocin', 'Crocin i', 'Crocine')",Medical,"Crocin is a carotenoid chemical compound that is found in the flowers of crocus and gardenia. Its oxygen content also chemically makes it a xanthene. Crocin is the chemical primarily responsible for the color of saffron. Chemically, crocin is the diester formed from the disaccharide gentiobiose and the dicarboxylic acid crocetin. When isolated as a pure chemical compound, it has a deep red color and forms crystals with a melting point of 186 °C. When dissolved in water, it forms an orange solution. The term crocins may also refer to members of a series of related hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. The crocin underlying saffron's aroma is α-crocin (a carotenoid pigment that may compose more than 10% of dry saffron's mass): trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid.: 20 The major active component of saffron is the yellow pigment crocin 2 (three other derivatives with different glycosylations are known) containing a gentiobiose (disaccharide) group at each end of the molecule. The five major biologically active components of saffron, namely the four crocins and crocetin, can be measured with HPLC-UV. == Research == === Absorption === Crocin ingested orally is hydrolised to crocetin in the gut which is absorbed across the intestinal barrier, and that crocetin can permeate the blood–brain barrier. === Antioxidant === Crocin has been shown to be an antioxidant, and neural protective agent. Crocin can reduce oxidative stress and ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) through enhancement of gene expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and anti-oxidant enzymes, such as CAT, GSH, and SOD. === Neuroprotective === Crocin and its derivative crocetin may counteract oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, which are closely linked to initiation and progression of major brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In an animal model of malathion-induced Parkinson's disease, crocin reduced the neurotoxic effect of malathion by its anti-apoptotic activity and it regulated the expression of proteins involved in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Crocins can suppress the active forms of GSK3β and ERK1/2 kinases, significantly reducing tau phosphorylation, thus suppressing key molecular pathways of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. === Mood === Crocin displays possible antidepressant properties in mice and humans. === Cancer === Crocin has also shown antiproliferative action against cancer cells in vitro. and in vivo . Crocin through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK, VEGF, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK-STAT suppression has antiproliferative properties. Also, the Nrf2 and p53 signaling pathway activation may be effective in the antiproliferative effect of crocin. === Behavior === Aphrodisiac properties of crocin in male rats has been observed at very high doses. === Retinal diseases === Emerging evidence highlights the cytoprotective, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory potential of crocin in retinal tissue, which positions it as a promising candidate for enhancing vision and eye health. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the majority of research has primarily focused on animal models, and there remains a shortage of robust clinical data to firmly establish the benefits of crocin in addressing eye health and related diseases. == References == == Bibliography == == External links == Media related to Crocin at Wikimedia Commons",Crocin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.07637839764356613), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.12693482637405396), (' MED', -0.1339680701494217), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.0651944950222969), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.1003153920173645), ('ĠMED', -0.7702744007110596), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06214844062924385)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocin,https://www.sativus.com/pages/components-of-saffron ', [])"

In our study, using mouse models of natural aging, we observed structural and functional decline in the aged retina, which was accompanied by the accumulation of senescent cells and senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. We further validated the senolytic and senomorphic properties of procyanidin C1 (PCC1) both in vitro and in vivo, the long-term treatment of which ameliorated age-related retinal impairment. Through high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we comprehensively characterized the retinal landscape after PCC1 administration and deciphered the molecular basis underlying the senescence burden increment and elimination. By exploring the scRNA-seq database of age-related retinal disorders, we revealed the role of cellular senescence and the therapeutic potential of PCC1 in these pathologies. Overall, these results indicate the therapeutic effects of PCC1 on the aged retina and its potential use for treating age-related retinal disorders. Pulmonary fibrosis is a formidable challenge in chronic and age-related lung diseases. Myofibroblasts secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix and induce pro-repair responses during normal wound healing. Successful tissue repair results in termination of myofibroblast activity via apoptosis; however, some myofibroblasts exhibit a senescent phenotype and escape apoptosis, causing over-repair that is characterized by pathological fibrotic scarring. Therefore, the removal of senescent myofibroblasts using senolytics is an important method for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Procyanidin C1 (PCC1) has recently been discovered as a senolytic compound with very low toxicity and few side effects. This study aimed to determine whether PCC1 could improve lung fibrosis by promoting apoptosis in senescent myofibroblasts and to investigate the mechanisms involved. The results showed that PCC1 attenuates bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In addition, we found that PCC1 inhibited extracellular matrix deposition and promoted the apoptosis of senescent myofibroblasts by increasing PUMA expression and activating the BAX signaling pathway. Our findings represent a new method of pulmonary fibrosis management and emphasize the potential of PCC1 as a senotherapeutic agent for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, providing hope for patients with pulmonary fibrosis worldwide. Our results advance our understanding of age-related diseases and highlight the importance of addressing cellular senescence in treatment. Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a common cause of low back pain. Procyanidin C1 (PCC1) has been demonstrated to exert a protective effect on nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, and therefore, plays a critical role in the prevention and therapy of IVDD. Clarifying the pathophysiological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of IVDD may be helpful in establishing novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to investigate the probable mechanisms underlying the protection against acidic pH stress induced human NP cell injury. In vitro, acidic pH stress induced degeneration, mitochondrial dynamics imbalance, mitophagy, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in NP cells, all of which were ameliorated by PCC1. Autophagy inhibition partially eliminated the protective effects of PCC1 on mitochondrial homeostasis in NP cells. Moreover, PCC1 activated the sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)/forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) signaling pathway, a pivotal signaling pathway involved in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis in NP cells. In vivo, PCC1 ameliorated IVDD in a rat model and preserved the extracellular matrix of NP cells. Consequently, the protective effects of PCC1 on NP cells may inhibit IVDD progression via regulation of the SIRT3/FOXO3 signaling pathway. Therefore, regulation of the SIRT3/FOXO3 signaling pathway may be a novel preventive and therapeutic strategy for IVDD.",Chromane c1,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.061988748610019684), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.20159225165843964), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1603638380765915)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chromane-6-carbonyl_-L-leucine,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chromane-4-carbonyl_glycine,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/116843316,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chromane-7-carbaldehyde,https://data.epo.org/gpi/EP3691639B1-CHROMANE-MONOBACTAM-COMPOUNDS-FOR-THE-TREATMENT-OF-BACTERIAL-INFECTIONS,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/7G73627R36 ', [])"

3098,"('Indole-3-acetic acid', 'Indoleacetic acid', 'Heteroauxin', 'Rhizopin', 'Indol-3-ylacetic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 3-IAA) is the most common naturally occurring plant hormone of the auxin class. It is the best known of the auxins, and has been the subject of extensive studies by plant physiologists. IAA is a derivative of indole, containing a carboxymethyl substituent. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in polar organic solvents. == Biosynthesis == IAA is predominantly produced in cells of the apex (bud) and very young leaves of a plant. Plants can synthesize IAA by several independent biosynthetic pathways. Four of them start from tryptophan, but there is also a biosynthetic pathway independent of tryptophan. Plants mainly produce IAA from tryptophan through indole-3-pyruvic acid. IAA is also produced from tryptophan through indole-3-acetaldoxime in Arabidopsis thaliana. In rats, IAA is a product of both endogenous and colonic microbial metabolism from dietary tryptophan along with tryptophol. This was first observed in rats infected by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. A 2015 experiment showed that a high-tryptophan diet can decrease serum levels of IAA in mice, but that in humans, protein consumption has no reliably predictable effect on plasma IAA levels. Human cells have been known to produce IAA in vitro since the 1950s, and the critical biosynthesis gene IL4I1 has been identified. == Biological effects == As all auxins, IAA has many different effects, such as inducing cell elongation and cell division with all subsequent results for plant growth and development. On a larger scale, IAA serves as signaling molecule necessary for development of plant organs and coordination of growth. === Plant gene regulation === IAA enters the plant cell nucleus and binds to a protein complex composed of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), resulting in ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins with increased speed. Aux/IAA proteins bind to auxin response factor (ARF) proteins, forming a heterodimer, suppressing ARF activity. In 1997 it was described how ARFs bind to auxin-response gene elements in promoters of auxin regulated genes, generally activating transcription of that gene when an Aux/IAA protein is not bound. IAA inhibits the photorespiratory-dependent cell death in photorespiratory catalase mutants. This suggests a role for auxin signalling in stress tolerance. === Bacterial physiology === IAA production is widespread among environmental bacteria that inhabit soils, waters, but also plant and animal hosts. Distribution and substrate specificity of the involved enzymes suggests these pathways play a role beyond plant-microbe interactions. Enterobacter cloacae can produce IAA, from aromatic and branched-chain amino acids. === Fungal symbiosis === Fungi can form a fungal mantle around roots of perennial plants called ectomycorrhiza. A fungus specific to spruce called Tricholoma vaccinum was shown to produce IAA from tryptophan and excrete it from its hyphae. This induced branching in cultures, and enhanced Hartig net formation. The fungus uses a multidrug and toxic extrusion (MATE) transporter Mte1. Research into IAA-producing fungi to promote plant growth and protection in sustainable agriculture is underway. === Skatole biosynthesis === Skatole, the odorant in feces, is produced from tryptophan via indoleacetic acid. Decarboxylation gives the methylindole. == Synthesis == Chemically, it can be synthesized by the reaction of indole with glycolic acid in the presence of base at 250 °C: Alternatively the compound has been synthesized by Fischer indole synthesis using glutamic acid and phenylhydrazine. Glutamic acid was converted to the necessary aldehyde via Strecker degradation. Many methods for its synthesis have been developed since its original synthesis from indole-3-acetonitrile. == History and synthetic analogs == William Gladstone Tempelman studied substances for growth promotion at Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. After 7 years of research he changed the direction of his study to try the same substances at high concentrations in order to stop plant growth. In 1940 he published his finding that IAA killed broadleaf plants within a cereal field. The search for an acid with a longer half life, i.e. a metabolically and environmentally more stable compound led to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), both phenoxy herbicides and analogs of IAA. Robert Pokorny an industrial chemist for the C.B. Dolge Company in Westport, Connecticut published their synthesis in 1941. When sprayed on broad-leaf dicot plants, they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth, eventually killing them. First introduced in 1946, these herbicides were in widespread use in agriculture by the middle of the 1950s. Other less expensive synthetic auxin analogs on the market for use in horticulture are indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). == Mammalian toxicity/health effects == Little research has been conducted on the effects of IAA on humans and toxicity data are limited. No data on human carcinogenic, teratogenic, or developmental effects have been created. IAA is listed in its MSDS as mutagenic to mammalian somatic cells, and possibly carcinogenic based on animal data. It may cause adverse reproductive effects (fetotoxicity) and birth defects based on animal data. No human data as of 2008. It is listed as a potential skin, eye, and respiratory irritant, and users are warned not to ingest it. Protocols for ingestion, inhalation, and skin/eye exposure are standard for moderately poisonous compounds and include thorough rinsing in the case of skin and eyes, fresh air in the case of inhalation, and immediately contacting a physician in all cases to determine the best course of action and not to induce vomiting when of ingested. The NFPA 704 health hazard rating for IAA is 2, which denotes a risk of temporary incapacitation with intense or prolonged, but not chronic exposure, and a possibility of residual injury. IAA is a direct ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and IAA treatment of mice indicate liver-protective effects in a model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Humans typically have relatively high levels of IAA in their serum (~1 μM), but this can be increased further in certain disease conditions and can be a poor prognostic marker for cardiovascular health. Whether this IAA originates from endogenous biosynthesis via IL4I1 or gut microbiota is unknown. A 2021 study found that normal mice had an average of 3.7 times as much IAA in their feces compared to germ-free mice, suggesting that the mammalian microbiome contributes significantly to the overall circulating amount. === Developmental toxicity === IAA produces microcephaly in rats during the early stage of cerebral cortex development. IAA treatment of pregnant rats, at a dose of 1 gram per kg of body weight per day, decreased the locomotor activities of rat embryos/fetuses; treatment with IAA and analog 1(methyl)-IAA resulted in apoptosis of neuroepithelial cell and significantly decreased brain sizes relative to body weight in embryonic rats. === Immunotoxin === IAA is an apoptosis-inducing ligand in mammals. As of 2010, the signal transduction pathways are as follows: IAA/HRP activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. It induces caspase-8 and caspase-9, which results in caspase-3 activation and poly(adp-ribose) polymerases cleavage. In 2002 it had been hypothesized that IAA coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could be used in targeted cancer therapy. Radical-IAA molecules would attach to cells marked by HRP and HRP reactive cells would be selectively killed. In 2010 in vitro experiments proved this concept of IAA as an immunotoxin when used in preclinical studies of targeted cancer therapy, as it induced apoptosis in bladder and in hematological malignancies. == References ==",Heteroauxin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.19277915358543396)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.13982266187667847), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0026227382477372885)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([wikigenes.org](https://www.wikigenes.org/e/chem/e/802.html?utm_source=openai), [science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.84.2167.46?utm_source=openai), [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/140026a0?utm_source=openai), [chemblink.com](https://www.chemblink.com/products/87-51-4.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='WikiGenes - auxin - 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethanoic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://www.wikigenes.org/e/chem/e/802.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='Plant Growth Effects of Heteroauxin Applied to Soil and Plants | Science', type='url_citation', url='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.84.2167.46?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='Effect of Hetero-auxin on the Growth of Broad Bean Plants in Water Culture | Nature', type='url_citation', url='https://www.nature.com/articles/140026a0?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=332, start_index=6, title='CAS # 87-51-4, Indole-3-acetic acid, 1H-Indole-3-acetic acid, Heteroauxin, 3-Indolylacetic acid - chemBlink', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemblink.com/products/87-51-4.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

It is used primarily for its sugar-like physical properties. It has little to no impact on blood sugar levels, and does not stimulate the release of insulin. It also does not promote tooth decay and is considered to be tooth-friendly. Its energy value is 2 kcal per gram, half that of sugars. It is less sweet than sugar, but can be blended with high-intensity sweeteners such as sucralose to create a mixture with the same sweetness as sucrose (‘sugar’). Like most sugar alcohols (including the chemically similar maltitol), isomalt carries a risk of intestinal distress when consumed in large quantities (above about 20–30 g (1 oz) per day). Isomalt may prove upsetting to the intestinal tract because it is incompletely absorbed in the small intestine, and when polyols pass into the large intestine, they can cause osmotically induced diarrhea and stimulate the gut flora, causing flatulence. As with dietary fibers, regular consumption of isomalt can lead to desensitization, decreasing the risk of intestinal upset. Isomalt has been approved for use in the United States since 1990. It is also permitted for use in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Iran, the European Union, and other countries. == Composition and structure == Isomalt is an equimolar mixture of two diastereomeric disaccharides: 1-O-α-D-glucopyranosido-D-mannitol (1,1-GPM) and 6-O-α-D-glucopyranosido-D-sorbitol (1,6-GPS). Each of these is composed of two sugars: glucose and mannitol in the case of 1,1-GPM and glucose and sorbitol (also known as glucitol) in the case of 1,6-GPS. Complete hydrolysis of isomalt yields glucose (50%), sorbitol (25%), and mannitol (25%). Isomalt is an odorless, white, crystalline substance containing about 5% water of crystallisation. Isomalt has a minimal cooling effect (positive heat of solution), lower than many other sugar alcohols, in particular, xylitol and erythritol. == Manufacture == Isomalt is manufactured in a two-stage process in which sucrose (typically derived from beet sugar) is first transformed into isomaltulose using the bacterial enzyme isomaltulose synthase. The isomaltulose is then hydrogenated using a Raney nickel catalyst, producing 1,1-GPM and 1,6-GPS. The product consists of a mixture of anhydrous and dihydrated 1,1-GPM and anhydrous 1,6-GPS. About 100,000 tons were produced in 2012. == Uses == Isomalt is widely used for the production of sugar-free candy, especially hard-boiled candy, because it resists crystallization much better than the standard combinations of sucrose and corn syrup. It is used in sugar sculpture for the same reason. Isomalt can also be used as a plasticizer for high methoxyl pectin films. It reduces the rigidity of the edible film by increasing free volume within the structure of the film. Additionally isomalt also reduces the water vapour permeability of the film, thus increasing the quality of the film as it reduces respiration rate, moisture migration, and loss of volatile compounds. In 2023 it was reported that isomalt, when mixed with cellulose or sawdust, can be used as a moldable, recyclable and biodegradable material that's stronger than PVC and PET. It dissolves upon contact with water but can be protected from water with a layer of shellac and cellulose acetate. == References == == Further reading == Sentko, Anke; Willibald-Ettle, Ingrid (2012).

As a medication it is used to treat scabies and lice. For scabies either permethrin or malathion is typically preferred. It is applied to the skin as a lotion. Typically two to three applications are needed. It is also present in Balsam of Peru, Tolu balsam, and in a number of flowers. Side effects may include irritation of the skin. It is not recommended in children. It is also used in other animals; however, it is considered toxic to cats. How it works is unclear. Benzyl benzoate was first studied medically in 1918. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Benzyl benzoate is sold under the brand name Scabanca among others and is available as a generic medication. It is not available for medical use in the United States. == Uses == === Medical === Benzyl benzoate is an effective and inexpensive topical treatment for human scabies. It has vasodilating and spasmolytic effects and is present in many asthma and whooping cough drugs. It is also used as an excipient in some testosterone-replacement medications (like Nebido) for treating hypogonadism. Benzyl benzoate is used as a topical acaricide, scabicide, and pediculicide in veterinary hospitals. === Non-medical === Benzyl benzoate is used as a repellent for chiggers, ticks, and mosquitoes. It is also used as a dye carrier, solvent for cellulose derivatives, plasticizer, and fixative in the perfume industry. == Side effects == Benzyl benzoate has low acute toxicity in laboratory animals. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol is subsequently metabolized to benzoic acid. The conjugates of benzoic acid (hippuric acid and the glucuronide of benzoic acid) are rapidly eliminated in urine. When given in large doses to laboratory animals, benzyl benzoate can cause hyperexcitation, loss of coordination, ataxia, convulsions, and respiratory paralysis. Benzyl benzoate can be a skin irritant when used as a topical scabicide. Overdose can result in blistering and hives or a rash can occur as an allergic reaction. As an excipient in some testosterone-replacement injectable medications, benzyl benzoate has been reported as a cause of anaphylaxis in a case in Australia. Bayer includes this report in information for health professionals and recommends that physicians ""should be aware of the potential for serious allergic reactions"" to preparations of this type. In Australia, reports to ADRAC, which evaluates reports of adverse drug reactions for the Therapeutic Goods Administration, show several reports of allergic issues since the anaphylaxis case from 2011. == Chemistry == It is an organic compound with the formula C6H5CH2O2CC6H5. It is the ester of benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid. It forms either a viscous liquid or solid flakes and has a weak, sweet-balsamic odor. It occurs in a number of blossoms (e. g. tuberose, hyacinth) and is a component of Balsam of Peru and Tolu balsam. == Production == Benzyl benzoate is produced industrially by the reaction of sodium benzoate with benzyl chloride in the presence of a base, or by transesterification of methyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol. It is a byproduct of benzoic acid synthesis by toluene oxidation. It can also be synthesized by the Tishchenko reaction, using benzaldehyde with sodium benzyloxide (generated from sodium and benzyl alcohol) as catalyst: == References ==",Benylate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0037773859221488237), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.7775096893310547), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.5213274309644476e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.22568567097187042), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.3870755136013031), (' FOOD', -0.003609458915889263)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00040046300273388624), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.002605022396892309), ('ĠINDU', -0.66875821352005), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -5.364403477869928e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.47412943840026855), ('ĠFOOD', -0.39148634672164917), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16041989624500275)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('Benylate, also known as benzyl benzoate, is classified as MEDICAL, FOOD, and PERSONAL CARE.

3104,"('Norepinephrine (hydrochloride)', 'Noradrenaline', 'Arterenol', 'Norepinephrine', 'Levarterenol;l-noradrenaline')","Endogenous, Medical","Norepinephrine (NE), also called noradrenaline (NA) or noradrenalin, is an organic chemical in the catecholamine family that functions in the brain and body as a hormone, neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. The name ""noradrenaline"" (from Latin ad, ""near"", and ren, ""kidney"") is more commonly used in the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, whereas ""norepinephrine"" (from Ancient Greek ἐπῐ́ (epí), ""upon"", and νεφρός (nephrós), ""kidney"") is usually preferred in the United States. ""Norepinephrine"" is also the international nonproprietary name given to the drug. Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as noradrenergic. The general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action. Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called fight-or-flight response. In the brain, norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety. In the rest of the body, norepinephrine increases heart rate and blood pressure, triggers the release of glucose from energy stores, increases blood flow to skeletal muscle, reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system, and inhibits voiding of the bladder and gastrointestinal motility. In the brain, noradrenaline is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the locus coeruleus, located in the pons. Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by sympathetic ganglia located near the spinal cord or in the abdomen, as well as Merkel cells located in the skin. It is also released directly into the bloodstream by the adrenal glands. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating adrenergic receptors located on the cell surface. A variety of medically important drugs work by altering the actions of noradrenaline systems. Noradrenaline itself is widely used as an injectable drug for the treatment of critically low blood pressure. Stimulants often increase, enhance, or otherwise act as agonists of norepinephrine. Drugs such as cocaine and methylphenidate act as reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine, as do some antidepressants, such as those in the SNRI class. One of the more notable drugs in the stimulant class is amphetamine, which acts as a dopamine and norepinephrine analog, reuptake inhibitor, as well as an agent that increases the amount of global catecholamine signaling throughout the nervous system by reversing transporters in the synapses. Beta blockers, which counter some of the effects of noradrenaline by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, are sometimes used to treat glaucoma, migraines and a range of cardiovascular diseases. β1Rs preferentially bind epinephrine, along with norepinephrine to a lesser extent and mediates some of their cellular effects in cardiac myocytes such as increased positive inotropy and lusitropy. β-blockers exert their cardioprotective effects through decreasing oxygen demand in cardiac myocytes; this is accomplished via decreasing the force of contraction during systole (negative inotropy) and decreasing the rate of relaxation during diastole (negative lusitropy), thus reducing myocardial energy demand which is useful in treating cardiovascular disorders accompanied by inadequate myocardial oxygen supply. Alpha blockers, which counter the effects of noradrenaline on alpha-adrenergic receptors, are occasionally used to treat hypertension and psychiatric conditions. Alpha-2 agonists often have a sedating and antihypertensive effect and are commonly used as anesthesia enhancers in surgery, as well as in treatment of drug or alcohol dependence. For reasons that are still unclear, some Alpha-2 agonists, such as guanfacine, have also been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders and ADHD. Many important psychiatric drugs exert strong effects on noradrenaline systems in the brain, resulting in effects that may be helpful or harmful. == Structure == Norepinephrine is a catecholamine and a phenethylamine. Its structure differs from that of epinephrine only in that epinephrine has a methyl group attached to its nitrogen, whereas the methyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom in norepinephrine. The prefix nor- is derived as an abbreviation of the word ""normal"", used to indicate a demethylated compound. Norepinephrine consists of a catechol moiety (a benzene ring with two adjoining hydroxyl groups in the meta-para position), and an ethylamine side chain consisting of a hydroxyl group bonded in the benzylic position. == Biochemical mechanisms == === Biosynthesis === Norepinephrine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine by a series of enzymatic steps in the adrenal medulla and postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, while the norepinephrine that functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain is produced in the locus coeruleus, located in the pons of the brainstem. While the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm, the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine by dopamine β-monooxygenase occurs predominantly inside neurotransmitter vesicles. The metabolic pathway is: Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine Thus the direct precursor of norepinephrine is dopamine, which is synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid phenylalanine or the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and, as such, are provided by ingestion of protein-containing food, with tyrosine being the most common. Phenylalanine is converted into tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, with molecular oxygen (O2) and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. Tyrosine is converted into L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, with tetrahydrobiopterin, O2, and probably ferrous iron (Fe2+) as cofactors. Conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA is inhibited by Metyrosine, a tyrosine analog. L-DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. Dopamine is then converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-monooxygenase (formerly known as dopamine β-hydroxylase), with O2 and ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine itself can further be converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as cofactor. === Degradation === In mammals, norepinephrine is rapidly degraded to various metabolites. The initial step in the breakdown can be catalyzed by either of the enzymes monoamine oxidase (mainly monoamine oxidase A) or COMT. From there, the breakdown can proceed by a variety of pathways. The principal end products are either Vanillylmandelic acid or a conjugated form of MHPG, both of which are thought to be biologically inactive and are excreted in the urine. == Functions == === Cellular effects === Like many other biologically active substances, norepinephrine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. Two broad families of norepinephrine receptors have been identified, known as alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha receptors are divided into subtypes α1 and α2; beta receptors into subtypes β1, β2, and β3. All of these function as G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system. Alpha-2 receptors usually have inhibitory effects, but many are located pre-synaptically (i.e., on the surface of the cells that release norepinephrine), so the net effect of alpha-2 activation is often a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine released. Alpha-1 receptors and all three types of beta receptors usually have excitatory effects. ==== Storage, release, and reuptake ==== Inside the brain norepinephrine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, norepinephrine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). VMAT can be inhibited by Reserpine causing a decrease in neurotransmitter stores. Norepinephrine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft, typically after an action potential causes the vesicles to release their contents directly into the synaptic cleft through a process called exocytosis. Once in the synapse, norepinephrine binds to and activates receptors. After an action potential, the norepinephrine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via reuptake mediated primarily by the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Once back in the cytosol, norepinephrine can either be broken down by monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT, making it available for future release. === Sympathetic nervous system === Norepinephrine is the main neurotransmitter used by the sympathetic nervous system, which consists of about two dozen sympathetic chain ganglia located next to the spinal cord, plus a set of prevertebral ganglia located in the chest and abdomen. These sympathetic ganglia are connected to numerous organs, including the eyes, salivary glands, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, stomach, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder, reproductive organs, muscles, skin, and adrenal glands. Sympathetic activation of the adrenal glands causes the part called the adrenal medulla to release norepinephrine (as well as epinephrine) into the bloodstream, from which, functioning as a hormone, it gains further access to a wide variety of tissues. Broadly speaking, the effect of norepinephrine on each target organ is to modify its state in a way that makes it more conducive to active body movement, often at a cost of increased energy use and increased wear and tear. This can be contrasted with the acetylcholine-mediated effects of the parasympathetic nervous system, which modifies most of the same organs into a state more conducive to rest, recovery, and digestion of food, and usually less costly in terms of energy expenditure. The sympathetic effects of norepinephrine include: In the eyes, an increase in the production of tears, making the eyes more moist, and pupil dilation through contraction of the iris dilator. In the heart, an increase in the amount of blood pumped. In brown adipose tissue, an increase in calories burned to generate body heat (thermogenesis). Multiple effects on the immune system. The sympathetic nervous system is the primary path of interaction between the immune system and the brain, and several components receive sympathetic inputs, including the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. However, the effects are complex, with some immune processes activated while others are inhibited. In the arteries, constriction of blood vessels causes an increase in blood pressure. In the kidneys, release of renin and retention of sodium in the bloodstream. In the liver, an increase in production of glucose, either by glycogenolysis after a meal or by gluconeogenesis when food has not recently been consumed. Glucose is the body's main energy source in most conditions. In the pancreas, increased release of glucagon, a hormone whose main effect is to increase the production of glucose by the liver. In skeletal muscles, an increase in glucose uptake. In adipose tissue (i.e., fat cells), an increase in lipolysis, that is, conversion of fat to substances that can be used directly as energy sources by muscles and other tissues. In the stomach and intestines, a reduction in digestive activity. This results from a generally inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the enteric nervous system, causing decreases in gastrointestinal mobility, blood flow, and secretion of digestive substances. Noradrenaline and ATP are sympathetic co-transmitters. It is found that the endocannabinoid anandamide and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 can modify the overall response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, which indicates that prejunctional CB1 receptors mediate the sympatho-inhibitory action. Thus cannabinoids can inhibit both the noradrenergic and purinergic components of sympathetic neurotransmission. === Central nervous system === The noradrenergic neurons in the brain form a neurotransmitter system, that, when activated, exerts effects on large areas of the brain. The effects are manifested in alertness, arousal, and readiness for action. Noradrenergic neurons (i.e., neurons whose primary neurotransmitter is norepinephrine) are comparatively few in number, and their cell bodies are confined to a few relatively small brain areas, but they send projections to many other brain areas and exert powerful effects on their targets. These noradrenergic cell groups were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlström and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter ""A"" (for ""aminergic""). In their scheme, areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (A8 through A14 contain dopamine). Noradrenergic cell group A1 is located in the caudal ventrolateral part of the medulla, and plays a role in the control of body fluid metabolism. Noradrenergic cell group A2 is located in a brainstem area called the solitary nucleus; these cells have been implicated in a variety of responses, including control of food intake and responses to stress. Cell groups A5 and A7 project mainly to the spinal cord. The most important source of norepinephrine in the brain is the locus coeruleus, which contains noradrenergic cell group A6 and adjoins cell group A4. The locus coeruleus is quite small in absolute terms—in primates, it is estimated to contain around 15,000 neurons, less than one-millionth of the neurons in the brain—but it sends projections to every major part of the brain and also to the spinal cord. The level of activity in the locus coeruleus correlates broadly with vigilance and speed of reaction. LC activity is low during sleep and drops to virtually nothing during the REM (dreaming) state. It runs at a baseline level during wakefulness, but increases temporarily when a person is presented with any sort of stimulus that draws attention. Unpleasant stimuli such as pain, difficulty breathing, bladder distension, heat or cold generate larger increases. Extremely unpleasant states such as intense fear or intense pain are associated with very high levels of LC activity. Norepinephrine released by the locus coeruleus affects brain function in several ways. It enhances processing of sensory inputs, enhances attention, enhances formation and retrieval of both long-term and working memory, and enhances the ability of the brain to respond to inputs by changing the activity pattern in the prefrontal cortex and other areas. The control of arousal level is strong enough that drug-induced suppression of the LC has a powerful sedating effect. There is a great similarity between situations that activate the locus coeruleus in the brain and situations that activate the sympathetic nervous system in the periphery: the LC essentially mobilizes the brain for action while the sympathetic system mobilizes the body. It has been argued that this similarity arises because both are to a large degree controlled by the same brain structures, particularly a part of the brainstem called the nucleus gigantocellularis. === Skin === Norepinephrine is also produced by Merkel cells which are part of the somatosensory system. It activates the afferent sensory neuron. == Pharmacology == A large number of important drugs exert their effects by interacting with norepinephrine systems in the brain or body. Their uses include treatment of cardiovascular problems, shock, and a variety of psychiatric conditions. These drugs are divided into: sympathomimetic drugs which mimic or enhance at least some of the effects of norepinephrine released by the sympathetic nervous system; sympatholytic drugs, in contrast, block at least some of the effects. Both of these are large groups with diverse uses, depending on exactly which effects are enhanced or blocked. Norepinephrine itself is classified as a sympathomimetic drug: its effects when given by intravenous injection of increasing heart rate and force and constricting blood vessels make it very useful for treating medical emergencies that involve critically low blood pressure. Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended norepinephrine as first line agent in treating septic shock which is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, supplemented by vasopressin and epinephrine. Dopamine usage is restricted only to highly selected patients. === Antagonists === ==== Beta blockers ==== These are sympatholytic drugs that block the effects of beta adrenergic receptors while having little or no effect on alpha receptors. They are sometimes used to treat high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, but recent reviews have concluded that other types of drugs are usually superior for those purposes. Beta blockers may be a viable choice for other cardiovascular conditions, though, including angina and Marfan syndrome. They are also widely used to treat glaucoma, most commonly in the form of eyedrops. Because of their effects in reducing anxiety symptoms and tremor, they have sometimes been used by entertainers, public speakers, and athletes to reduce performance anxiety, although they are not medically approved for that purpose and are banned by the International Olympic Committee. However, the usefulness of beta blockers is limited by a range of serious side effects, including slowing of heart rate, a drop in blood pressure, asthma, and reactive hypoglycemia. The negative effects can be particularly severe in people with diabetes. ==== Alpha blockers ==== These are sympatholytic drugs that block the effects of adrenergic alpha receptors while having little or no effect on beta receptors. Drugs belonging to this group can have very different effects, however, depending on whether they primarily block alpha-1 receptors, alpha-2 receptors, or both. Alpha-2 receptors, as described elsewhere in this article, are frequently located on norepinephrine-releasing neurons themselves and have inhibitory effects on them; consequently, blockage of alpha-2 receptors usually results in an increase in norepinephrine release. Alpha-1 receptors are usually located on target cells and have excitatory effects on them; consequently, blockage of alpha-1 receptors usually results in blocking some of the effects of norepinephrine. Drugs such as phentolamine that act on both types of receptors can produce a complex combination of both effects. In most cases when the term ""alpha blocker"" is used without qualification, it refers to a selective alpha-1 antagonist. Selective alpha-1 blockers have a variety of uses. Since one of their effects is to inhibit the contraction of the smooth muscle in the prostate, they are often used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Alpha-blockers also likely help people pass their kidney stones. Their effects on the central nervous system make them useful for treating generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. They may, however, have significant side effects, including a drop in blood pressure. Some antidepressants function partly as selective alpha-2 blockers, but the best-known drug in that class is yohimbine, which is extracted from the bark of the African yohimbe tree. Yohimbine acts as a male potency enhancer, but its usefulness for that purpose is limited by serious side-effects including anxiety and insomnia. Overdoses can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure. Yohimbine is banned in many countries, but in the United States, because it is extracted from a plant rather than chemically synthesized, it is sold over the counter as a nutritional supplement. === Alpha-2 agonists === These are sympathomimetic drugs that activate alpha-2 receptors or enhance their effects. Because alpha-2 receptors are inhibitory and many are located presynaptically on norepinephrine-releasing cells, the net effect of these drugs is usually to reduce the amount of norepinephrine released. Drugs in this group that are capable of entering the brain often have strong sedating effects, due to their inhibitory effects on the locus coeruleus. Clonidine and guanfacine, for example, are used for the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, and also as a sedative premedication for patients about to undergo surgery. Xylazine, another drug in this group, is also a powerful sedative and is often used in combination with ketamine as a general anaesthetic for veterinary surgery—in the United States it has not been approved for use in humans. === Stimulants and antidepressants === These are drugs whose primary effects are thought to be mediated by different neurotransmitter systems (dopamine for stimulants, serotonin for antidepressants), but many also increase levels of norepinephrine in the brain. Amphetamine, for example, is a stimulant that increases release of norepinephrine as well as dopamine. Monoamine oxidase A inhibitors (MAO-A) are antidepressants that inhibit the metabolic degradation of norepinephrine as well as serotonin and dopamine. In some cases it is difficult to distinguish the norepinephrine-mediated effects from the effects related to other neurotransmitters. == Diseases and disorders == A number of important medical problems involve dysfunction of the norepinephrine system in the brain or body. === Sympathetic hyperactivation === Hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system is not a recognized condition in itself, but it is a component of a number of conditions, as well as a possible consequence of taking sympathomimetic drugs. It causes a distinctive set of symptoms including aches and pains, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, headache, paleness, and a drop in blood glucose. If sympathetic activity is elevated for an extended time, it can cause weight loss and other stress-related body changes. The list of conditions that can cause sympathetic hyperactivation includes severe brain injury, spinal cord damage, heart failure, high blood pressure, kidney disease, and various types of stress. === Pheochromocytoma === A pheochromocytoma is a rarely occurring tumor of the adrenal medulla, caused either by genetic factors or certain types of cancer. The consequence is a massive increase in the amount of norepinephrine and epinephrine released into the bloodstream. The most obvious symptoms are those of sympathetic hyperactivation, including particularly a rise in blood pressure that can reach fatal levels. The most effective treatment is surgical removal of the tumor. === Stress === Stress, to a physiologist, means any situation that threatens the continued stability of the body and its functions. Stress affects a wide variety of body systems: the two most consistently activated are the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the norepinephrine system, including both the sympathetic nervous system and the locus coeruleus-centered system in the brain. Stressors of many types evoke increases in noradrenergic activity, which mobilizes the brain and body to meet the threat. Chronic stress, if continued for a long time, can damage many parts of the body. A significant part of the damage is due to the effects of sustained norepinephrine release, because of norepinephrine's general function of directing resources away from maintenance, regeneration, and reproduction, and toward systems that are required for active movement. The consequences can include slowing of growth (in children), sleeplessness, loss of libido, gastrointestinal problems, impaired disease resistance, slower rates of injury healing, depression, and increased vulnerability to addiction. === ADHD === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition involving problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. It is most commonly treated using stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), whose primary effect is to increase dopamine levels in the brain, but drugs in this group also generally increase brain levels of norepinephrine, and it has been difficult to determine whether these actions are involved in their clinical value. There is also substantial evidence that many people with ADHD show biomarkers involving altered norepinephrine processing. Several drugs whose primary effects are on norepinephrine, including guanfacine, clonidine, and atomoxetine, have been tried as treatments for ADHD, and found to have effects comparable to those of stimulants. === Autonomic failure === Several conditions, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and so-called pure autonomic failure, can cause a loss of norepinephrine-secreting neurons in the sympathetic nervous system. The symptoms are widespread, the most serious being a reduction in heart rate and an extreme drop in resting blood pressure, making it impossible for severely affected people to stand for more than a few seconds without fainting. Treatment can involve dietary changes or drugs. === REM sleep deprivation === Norepinephrine prevents REM sleep, and lack of REM sleep increases noradrenaline secretion as a result of the locus coeruleus not ceasing producing it. It causes neurodegeneration if its loss is sustained for several days. == Comparative biology and evolution == Norepinephrine has been reported to exist in a wide variety of animal species, including protozoa, placozoa and cnidaria (jellyfish and related species), but not in ctenophores (comb jellies), whose nervous systems differ greatly from those of other animals. It is generally present in deuterostomes (vertebrates, etc.), but in protostomes (arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, nematodes, annelids, etc.) it is replaced by octopamine, a closely related chemical with a closely related synthesis pathway. In insects, octopamine has alerting and activating functions that correspond (at least roughly) with the functions of norepinephrine in vertebrates. It has been argued that octopamine evolved to replace norepinephrine rather than vice versa; however, the nervous system of amphioxus (a primitive chordate) has been reported to contain octopamine but not norepinephrine, which presents difficulties for that hypothesis. == History == Early in the twentieth century Walter Cannon, who had popularized the idea of a sympathoadrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed a theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory), responsible for these actions. The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and U.S. pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be a sympathetic transmitter. In 1939, Hermann Blaschko and Peter Holtz independently identified the biosynthetic mechanism for norepinephrine in the vertebrate body. In 1945 Ulf von Euler published the first of a series of papers that established the role of norepinephrine as a neurotransmitter. He demonstrated the presence of norepinephrine in sympathetically innervated tissues and brain, and adduced evidence that it is the sympathin of Cannon and Rosenblueth. Stanley Peart was the first to demonstrate the release of noradrenaline after the stimulation of sympathetic nerves. == References == == External links == Media related to Norepinephrine at Wikimedia Commons",Norepinephrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.12727907299995422), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -8.518582762917504e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' MED', -9.388769103679806e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.6115444898605347), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -1.9073304429184645e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.00026806574896909297), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009521479951217771)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.47408199310302734), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_%28medication%29?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=205, start_index=20, title='Norepinephrine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=205, start_index=20, title='Norepinephrine (medication)', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_%28medication%29?utm_source=openai')])"

Alpha-2 agonists often have a sedating and antihypertensive effect and are commonly used as anesthesia enhancers in surgery, as well as in treatment of drug or alcohol dependence. For reasons that are still unclear, some Alpha-2 agonists, such as guanfacine, have also been shown to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders and ADHD. Many important psychiatric drugs exert strong effects on noradrenaline systems in the brain, resulting in effects that may be helpful or harmful. == Structure == Norepinephrine is a catecholamine and a phenethylamine. Its structure differs from that of epinephrine only in that epinephrine has a methyl group attached to its nitrogen, whereas the methyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom in norepinephrine. The prefix nor- is derived as an abbreviation of the word ""normal"", used to indicate a demethylated compound. Norepinephrine consists of a catechol moiety (a benzene ring with two adjoining hydroxyl groups in the meta-para position), and an ethylamine side chain consisting of a hydroxyl group bonded in the benzylic position. == Biochemical mechanisms == === Biosynthesis === Norepinephrine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine by a series of enzymatic steps in the adrenal medulla and postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, while the norepinephrine that functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain is produced in the locus coeruleus, located in the pons of the brainstem. While the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm, the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine by dopamine β-monooxygenase occurs predominantly inside neurotransmitter vesicles. The metabolic pathway is: Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine Thus the direct precursor of norepinephrine is dopamine, which is synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid phenylalanine or the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and, as such, are provided by ingestion of protein-containing food, with tyrosine being the most common. Phenylalanine is converted into tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, with molecular oxygen (O2) and tetrahydrobiopterin as cofactors. Tyrosine is converted into L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, with tetrahydrobiopterin, O2, and probably ferrous iron (Fe2+) as cofactors. Conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA is inhibited by Metyrosine, a tyrosine analog. L-DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor. Dopamine is then converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine β-monooxygenase (formerly known as dopamine β-hydroxylase), with O2 and ascorbic acid as cofactors. Norepinephrine itself can further be converted into epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as cofactor. === Degradation === In mammals, norepinephrine is rapidly degraded to various metabolites. The initial step in the breakdown can be catalyzed by either of the enzymes monoamine oxidase (mainly monoamine oxidase A) or COMT. From there, the breakdown can proceed by a variety of pathways. The principal end products are either Vanillylmandelic acid or a conjugated form of MHPG, both of which are thought to be biologically inactive and are excreted in the urine. == Functions == === Cellular effects === Like many other biologically active substances, norepinephrine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. Two broad families of norepinephrine receptors have been identified, known as alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha receptors are divided into subtypes α1 and α2; beta receptors into subtypes β1, β2, and β3. All of these function as G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system. Alpha-2 receptors usually have inhibitory effects, but many are located pre-synaptically (i.e., on the surface of the cells that release norepinephrine), so the net effect of alpha-2 activation is often a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine released. Alpha-1 receptors and all three types of beta receptors usually have excitatory effects. ==== Storage, release, and reuptake ==== Inside the brain norepinephrine functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, norepinephrine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT). VMAT can be inhibited by Reserpine causing a decrease in neurotransmitter stores. Norepinephrine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft, typically after an action potential causes the vesicles to release their contents directly into the synaptic cleft through a process called exocytosis. Once in the synapse, norepinephrine binds to and activates receptors. After an action potential, the norepinephrine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via reuptake mediated primarily by the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Once back in the cytosol, norepinephrine can either be broken down by monoamine oxidase or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT, making it available for future release. === Sympathetic nervous system === Norepinephrine is the main neurotransmitter used by the sympathetic nervous system, which consists of about two dozen sympathetic chain ganglia located next to the spinal cord, plus a set of prevertebral ganglia located in the chest and abdomen. These sympathetic ganglia are connected to numerous organs, including the eyes, salivary glands, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, stomach, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder, reproductive organs, muscles, skin, and adrenal glands. Sympathetic activation of the adrenal glands causes the part called the adrenal medulla to release norepinephrine (as well as epinephrine) into the bloodstream, from which, functioning as a hormone, it gains further access to a wide variety of tissues. Broadly speaking, the effect of norepinephrine on each target organ is to modify its state in a way that makes it more conducive to active body movement, often at a cost of increased energy use and increased wear and tear. This can be contrasted with the acetylcholine-mediated effects of the parasympathetic nervous system, which modifies most of the same organs into a state more conducive to rest, recovery, and digestion of food, and usually less costly in terms of energy expenditure. The sympathetic effects of norepinephrine include: In the eyes, an increase in the production of tears, making the eyes more moist, and pupil dilation through contraction of the iris dilator. In the heart, an increase in the amount of blood pumped. In brown adipose tissue, an increase in calories burned to generate body heat (thermogenesis). Multiple effects on the immune system. The sympathetic nervous system is the primary path of interaction between the immune system and the brain, and several components receive sympathetic inputs, including the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. However, the effects are complex, with some immune processes activated while others are inhibited. In the arteries, constriction of blood vessels causes an increase in blood pressure. In the kidneys, release of renin and retention of sodium in the bloodstream. In the liver, an increase in production of glucose, either by glycogenolysis after a meal or by gluconeogenesis when food has not recently been consumed. Glucose is the body's main energy source in most conditions. In the pancreas, increased release of glucagon, a hormone whose main effect is to increase the production of glucose by the liver. In skeletal muscles, an increase in glucose uptake. In adipose tissue (i.e., fat cells), an increase in lipolysis, that is, conversion of fat to substances that can be used directly as energy sources by muscles and other tissues. In the stomach and intestines, a reduction in digestive activity. This results from a generally inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the enteric nervous system, causing decreases in gastrointestinal mobility, blood flow, and secretion of digestive substances. Noradrenaline and ATP are sympathetic co-transmitters. It is found that the endocannabinoid anandamide and the cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 can modify the overall response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, which indicates that prejunctional CB1 receptors mediate the sympatho-inhibitory action. Thus cannabinoids can inhibit both the noradrenergic and purinergic components of sympathetic neurotransmission. === Central nervous system === The noradrenergic neurons in the brain form a neurotransmitter system, that, when activated, exerts effects on large areas of the brain. The effects are manifested in alertness, arousal, and readiness for action. Noradrenergic neurons (i.e., neurons whose primary neurotransmitter is norepinephrine) are comparatively few in number, and their cell bodies are confined to a few relatively small brain areas, but they send projections to many other brain areas and exert powerful effects on their targets. These noradrenergic cell groups were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlström and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter ""A"" (for ""aminergic""). In their scheme, areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (A8 through A14 contain dopamine). Noradrenergic cell group A1 is located in the caudal ventrolateral part of the medulla, and plays a role in the control of body fluid metabolism. Noradrenergic cell group A2 is located in a brainstem area called the solitary nucleus; these cells have been implicated in a variety of responses, including control of food intake and responses to stress. Cell groups A5 and A7 project mainly to the spinal cord. The most important source of norepinephrine in the brain is the locus coeruleus, which contains noradrenergic cell group A6 and adjoins cell group A4. The locus coeruleus is quite small in absolute terms—in primates, it is estimated to contain around 15,000 neurons, less than one-millionth of the neurons in the brain—but it sends projections to every major part of the brain and also to the spinal cord. The level of activity in the locus coeruleus correlates broadly with vigilance and speed of reaction. LC activity is low during sleep and drops to virtually nothing during the REM (dreaming) state. It runs at a baseline level during wakefulness, but increases temporarily when a person is presented with any sort of stimulus that draws attention. Unpleasant stimuli such as pain, difficulty breathing, bladder distension, heat or cold generate larger increases. Extremely unpleasant states such as intense fear or intense pain are associated with very high levels of LC activity. Norepinephrine released by the locus coeruleus affects brain function in several ways. It enhances processing of sensory inputs, enhances attention, enhances formation and retrieval of both long-term and working memory, and enhances the ability of the brain to respond to inputs by changing the activity pattern in the prefrontal cortex and other areas. The control of arousal level is strong enough that drug-induced suppression of the LC has a powerful sedating effect. There is a great similarity between situations that activate the locus coeruleus in the brain and situations that activate the sympathetic nervous system in the periphery: the LC essentially mobilizes the brain for action while the sympathetic system mobilizes the body. It has been argued that this similarity arises because both are to a large degree controlled by the same brain structures, particularly a part of the brainstem called the nucleus gigantocellularis. === Skin === Norepinephrine is also produced by Merkel cells which are part of the somatosensory system. It activates the afferent sensory neuron. == Pharmacology == A large number of important drugs exert their effects by interacting with norepinephrine systems in the brain or body. Their uses include treatment of cardiovascular problems, shock, and a variety of psychiatric conditions. These drugs are divided into: sympathomimetic drugs which mimic or enhance at least some of the effects of norepinephrine released by the sympathetic nervous system; sympatholytic drugs, in contrast, block at least some of the effects. Both of these are large groups with diverse uses, depending on exactly which effects are enhanced or blocked. Norepinephrine itself is classified as a sympathomimetic drug: its effects when given by intravenous injection of increasing heart rate and force and constricting blood vessels make it very useful for treating medical emergencies that involve critically low blood pressure. Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended norepinephrine as first line agent in treating septic shock which is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, supplemented by vasopressin and epinephrine. Dopamine usage is restricted only to highly selected patients. === Antagonists === ==== Beta blockers ==== These are sympatholytic drugs that block the effects of beta adrenergic receptors while having little or no effect on alpha receptors. They are sometimes used to treat high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, but recent reviews have concluded that other types of drugs are usually superior for those purposes. Beta blockers may be a viable choice for other cardiovascular conditions, though, including angina and Marfan syndrome. They are also widely used to treat glaucoma, most commonly in the form of eyedrops. Because of their effects in reducing anxiety symptoms and tremor, they have sometimes been used by entertainers, public speakers, and athletes to reduce performance anxiety, although they are not medically approved for that purpose and are banned by the International Olympic Committee. However, the usefulness of beta blockers is limited by a range of serious side effects, including slowing of heart rate, a drop in blood pressure, asthma, and reactive hypoglycemia. The negative effects can be particularly severe in people with diabetes. ==== Alpha blockers ==== These are sympatholytic drugs that block the effects of adrenergic alpha receptors while having little or no effect on beta receptors. Drugs belonging to this group can have very different effects, however, depending on whether they primarily block alpha-1 receptors, alpha-2 receptors, or both. Alpha-2 receptors, as described elsewhere in this article, are frequently located on norepinephrine-releasing neurons themselves and have inhibitory effects on them; consequently, blockage of alpha-2 receptors usually results in an increase in norepinephrine release. Alpha-1 receptors are usually located on target cells and have excitatory effects on them; consequently, blockage of alpha-1 receptors usually results in blocking some of the effects of norepinephrine. Drugs such as phentolamine that act on both types of receptors can produce a complex combination of both effects. In most cases when the term ""alpha blocker"" is used without qualification, it refers to a selective alpha-1 antagonist. Selective alpha-1 blockers have a variety of uses. Since one of their effects is to inhibit the contraction of the smooth muscle in the prostate, they are often used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Alpha-blockers also likely help people pass their kidney stones. Their effects on the central nervous system make them useful for treating generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. They may, however, have significant side effects, including a drop in blood pressure. Some antidepressants function partly as selective alpha-2 blockers, but the best-known drug in that class is yohimbine, which is extracted from the bark of the African yohimbe tree. Yohimbine acts as a male potency enhancer, but its usefulness for that purpose is limited by serious side-effects including anxiety and insomnia. Overdoses can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure. Yohimbine is banned in many countries, but in the United States, because it is extracted from a plant rather than chemically synthesized, it is sold over the counter as a nutritional supplement. === Alpha-2 agonists === These are sympathomimetic drugs that activate alpha-2 receptors or enhance their effects. Because alpha-2 receptors are inhibitory and many are located presynaptically on norepinephrine-releasing cells, the net effect of these drugs is usually to reduce the amount of norepinephrine released. Drugs in this group that are capable of entering the brain often have strong sedating effects, due to their inhibitory effects on the locus coeruleus. Clonidine and guanfacine, for example, are used for the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, and also as a sedative premedication for patients about to undergo surgery. Xylazine, another drug in this group, is also a powerful sedative and is often used in combination with ketamine as a general anaesthetic for veterinary surgery—in the United States it has not been approved for use in humans. === Stimulants and antidepressants === These are drugs whose primary effects are thought to be mediated by different neurotransmitter systems (dopamine for stimulants, serotonin for antidepressants), but many also increase levels of norepinephrine in the brain. Amphetamine, for example, is a stimulant that increases release of norepinephrine as well as dopamine. Monoamine oxidase A inhibitors (MAO-A) are antidepressants that inhibit the metabolic degradation of norepinephrine as well as serotonin and dopamine. In some cases it is difficult to distinguish the norepinephrine-mediated effects from the effects related to other neurotransmitters. == Diseases and disorders == A number of important medical problems involve dysfunction of the norepinephrine system in the brain or body. === Sympathetic hyperactivation === Hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system is not a recognized condition in itself, but it is a component of a number of conditions, as well as a possible consequence of taking sympathomimetic drugs. It causes a distinctive set of symptoms including aches and pains, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, headache, paleness, and a drop in blood glucose. If sympathetic activity is elevated for an extended time, it can cause weight loss and other stress-related body changes. The list of conditions that can cause sympathetic hyperactivation includes severe brain injury, spinal cord damage, heart failure, high blood pressure, kidney disease, and various types of stress. === Pheochromocytoma === A pheochromocytoma is a rarely occurring tumor of the adrenal medulla, caused either by genetic factors or certain types of cancer. The consequence is a massive increase in the amount of norepinephrine and epinephrine released into the bloodstream. The most obvious symptoms are those of sympathetic hyperactivation, including particularly a rise in blood pressure that can reach fatal levels. The most effective treatment is surgical removal of the tumor. === Stress === Stress, to a physiologist, means any situation that threatens the continued stability of the body and its functions. Stress affects a wide variety of body systems: the two most consistently activated are the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the norepinephrine system, including both the sympathetic nervous system and the locus coeruleus-centered system in the brain. Stressors of many types evoke increases in noradrenergic activity, which mobilizes the brain and body to meet the threat. Chronic stress, if continued for a long time, can damage many parts of the body. A significant part of the damage is due to the effects of sustained norepinephrine release, because of norepinephrine's general function of directing resources away from maintenance, regeneration, and reproduction, and toward systems that are required for active movement. The consequences can include slowing of growth (in children), sleeplessness, loss of libido, gastrointestinal problems, impaired disease resistance, slower rates of injury healing, depression, and increased vulnerability to addiction. === ADHD === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition involving problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. It is most commonly treated using stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), whose primary effect is to increase dopamine levels in the brain, but drugs in this group also generally increase brain levels of norepinephrine, and it has been difficult to determine whether these actions are involved in their clinical value. There is also substantial evidence that many people with ADHD show biomarkers involving altered norepinephrine processing. Several drugs whose primary effects are on norepinephrine, including guanfacine, clonidine, and atomoxetine, have been tried as treatments for ADHD, and found to have effects comparable to those of stimulants. === Autonomic failure === Several conditions, including Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and so-called pure autonomic failure, can cause a loss of norepinephrine-secreting neurons in the sympathetic nervous system. The symptoms are widespread, the most serious being a reduction in heart rate and an extreme drop in resting blood pressure, making it impossible for severely affected people to stand for more than a few seconds without fainting. Treatment can involve dietary changes or drugs. === REM sleep deprivation === Norepinephrine prevents REM sleep, and lack of REM sleep increases noradrenaline secretion as a result of the locus coeruleus not ceasing producing it. It causes neurodegeneration if its loss is sustained for several days. == Comparative biology and evolution == Norepinephrine has been reported to exist in a wide variety of animal species, including protozoa, placozoa and cnidaria (jellyfish and related species), but not in ctenophores (comb jellies), whose nervous systems differ greatly from those of other animals. It is generally present in deuterostomes (vertebrates, etc.), but in protostomes (arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, nematodes, annelids, etc.) it is replaced by octopamine, a closely related chemical with a closely related synthesis pathway. In insects, octopamine has alerting and activating functions that correspond (at least roughly) with the functions of norepinephrine in vertebrates. It has been argued that octopamine evolved to replace norepinephrine rather than vice versa; however, the nervous system of amphioxus (a primitive chordate) has been reported to contain octopamine but not norepinephrine, which presents difficulties for that hypothesis. == History == Early in the twentieth century Walter Cannon, who had popularized the idea of a sympathoadrenal system preparing the body for fight and flight, and his colleague Arturo Rosenblueth developed a theory of two sympathins, sympathin E (excitatory) and sympathin I (inhibitory), responsible for these actions. The Belgian pharmacologist Zénon Bacq as well as Canadian and U.S. pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be a sympathetic transmitter. In 1939, Hermann Blaschko and Peter Holtz independently identified the biosynthetic mechanism for norepinephrine in the vertebrate body. In 1945 Ulf von Euler published the first of a series of papers that established the role of norepinephrine as a neurotransmitter. He demonstrated the presence of norepinephrine in sympathetically innervated tissues and brain, and adduced evidence that it is the sympathin of Cannon and Rosenblueth. Stanley Peart was the first to demonstrate the release of noradrenaline after the stimulation of sympathetic nerves. == References == == External links == Media related to Norepinephrine at Wikimedia Commons",Arterenol,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.16065454483032227), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -5.848420551046729e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.318681188422488e-05), (' MED', -0.0001549089647596702), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.47577792406082153), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -7.760223525110632e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.0001433984871255234), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004563482361845672)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.01815064437687397), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -9.014684110297821e-06), (' END', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is taken by mouth and is used in combination with low-dose cytarabine. The recommended dose of glasdegib is 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 28 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of each 28-day cycle in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control. The most common adverse reactions are anemia, fatigue, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, mucositis, constipation, and rash. It is a small molecule inhibitor of sonic hedgehog, which is a protein overexpressed in many types of cancer. It inhibits the sonic hedgehog receptor smoothened (SMO), as do most drugs in its class. == History == Glasdegib was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2018. FDA approval was based on a multicenter, open-label, randomized study (BRIGHT AML 1003, NCT01546038) that included 115 subjects with newly-diagnosed AML who met at least one of the following criteria: a) age 75 years or older, b) severe cardiac disease, c) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2, or d) baseline serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive glasdegib, 100 mg daily, with LDAC 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of a 28-day cycle (N=77) or LDAC alone (N=38) in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial was conducted in United States, Canada and Europe. Efficacy was established based on an improvement in overall survival (date of randomization to death from any cause). With a median follow-up of 20 months, median survival was 8.3 months (95% CI: 4.4, 12.2) for the glasdegib + LDAC arm and 4.3 months (95% CI: 1.9, 5.7) for the LDAC alone arm and HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.71; p=0.0002). Glasdegib was granted priority review and orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was granted orphan drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2017.

3107,"('Vilazodone', 'Vilazodone [usan:inn]', 'Vilazodona', 'Vilazodonum', 'Vilazodone (usan/inn)')",Medical,"Vilazodone, sold under the brand name Viibryd among others, is a medication used to treat major depressive disorder. It is classified as a serotonin modulator and is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include increased suicidal thoughts or actions in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, pancreatitis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Vilazodone may cause less emotional blunting than typical selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). A withdrawal syndrome may occur if the dose is rapidly decreased. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not generally recommended. It is in the serotonin modulator class of medications and is believed to work both as an SSRI and activator of the 5-HT1A receptor. Vilazodone was approved for medical use in the United States in 2011 and in Canada in 2018. In 2019, it was the 334th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. The drug lost patent protection in June 2022 for adults and in July 2023 for pediatrics. Generic versions have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. == Medical uses == Seven controlled efficacy trials were conducted of vilazodone for treatment of major depressive disorder. Five of these trials showed no significant influence of vilazodone over placebo on depressive symptoms. In the remaining two trials, small but significant advantages of vilazodone over placebo were found. According to these two eight-week trials in adults, vilazodone has an antidepressant response after one week of treatment. After eight weeks it resulted in a 13% greater response than placebo. Remission rates, however, were not significantly different versus placebo. According to the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011, ""it is unknown whether vilazodone has any advantages compared to other drugs in the antidepressant class."" A 2019 review stated that ""present studies do not suggest the superiority of vilazodone compared with other antidepressants."" Development of vilazodone for generalized anxiety disorder has been stopped as of 2017. While there is tentative evidence of a small benefit in generalized anxiety disorder, there is a high rate of side effects. == Adverse effects == In September 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration required a new warning to be added to the prescription label related to a link between vilazodone and acute pancreatitis and sleep paralysis. The most common adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and insomnia. After a one-year, open-label study assessing the safety and tolerability of vilazodone in people with major depressive disorder, the most common adverse effects were diarrhea (35.7%), nausea (31.6%), and headache (20.0%); greater than 90% of these adverse effects were mild or moderate. In randomized controlled trials, meanwhile, these rates were 28%, 23.4% and 13.3%, respectively. In contrast to other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), initial trials showed that vilazodone did not cause decreased sexual desire/function, which often cause people to abandon their use. Additionally, vilazodone may cause less emotional blunting than typical SSRIs and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including vilazodone) is associated with shorter average duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). It is uncertain whether there is an increased rate of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Vilazodone acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 2.1 nM; Ki = 0.1 nM) and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (IC50 = 0.2 nM; IA = ~60–70%). It has negligible affinity for other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C, as well as the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (Ki = 56 nM for NET and 37 nM for DAT). A small clinical study found occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor with vilazodone, whereas occupancy of the SERT by vilazodone in humans does not seem to have been studied. === Pharmacokinetics === Vilazodone is best absorbed with food and has a bioavailability of 72% under fed conditions. The Cmax increased between 147 and 160% and the AUC increased between 64 and 85% of vilazodone when it was administered with either a fatty or light meal. == History == It was developed by Merck KGaA and licensed by Clinical Data, a biotech company purchased by Forest Laboratories in 2011. == References ==",Vilazodone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012575789878610522)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilazodone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Vilazodone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilazodone?utm_source=openai')])"

This compound is condensed with nitromethane in a Henry reaction, followed by nitration, reduction of the nitro groups, and hydrogenolysis of the benzyl protecting groups. == References ==",Dopamine lutine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.06197720766067505)])","('INFO, INFO', [('INFO', -0.05261067673563957), (',', -0.20895880460739136), ('ĠINFO', -0.6217989325523376), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004235820844769478)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Both release tenofovir, but tenofovir disoproxil fumarate releases tenofovir in the bloodstream whereas tenofovir alafenamide enters cells before releasing tenofovir. Most published experience is with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV therapy and prophylaxis. Exposure of the breastfed infant to tenofovir is trivial in HIV-positive mothers and in HIV-negative mothers treated for HIV prophylaxis or hepatitis B infection.[1,2] Some data indicate that tenofovir milk levels decrease with time after delivery. Among HIV-positive mothers who have breastfed during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy no infant adverse effects have occurred up to 2 years of age. Tenofovir alfenamide use results in even lower milk levels and infant dosages than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Achieving and maintaining viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy decreases breastfeeding transmission risk to less than 1%, but not zero. Individuals with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy with a sustained undetectable viral load and who choose to breastfeed should be supported in this decision. If a viral load is not suppressed, banked pasteurized donor milk or formula is recommended.[3,4] Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens containing tenofovir are acceptable for use in HIV-negative nursing mothers.[5] Maternal use of prophylactic vaginal tenofovir (investigational in the U.S.) also does not appear to present a risk to the breastfed infant.[6] In hepatitis B, expert reviews of available data and most professional guidelines state that there is no justification for contraindicating the use of tenofovir during breastfeeding.[2,7-11] No differences exist in infection rates between breastfed and formula-fed infants born to hepatitis B-infected women, as long as the infant receives hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine at birth. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 96 weeks of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) treatment in participants switching from dolutegravir (DTG)-based therapy. Studies 1489 (NCT02607930) and 1490 (NCT02607956) were phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, first-line therapy trials in people with HIV-1. After 144 weeks of DTG-based or B/F/TAF treatment, participants could enter a 96-week open-label extension (OLE) of B/F/TAF. A pooled analysis evaluated viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml) and changes in CD4 + cell count at OLE Weeks 48 and 96, treatment-emergent resistance, safety, and tolerability after switch from a DTG-based regimen to B/F/TAF. Outcomes by prior treatment were summarized using descriptive statistics and compared by two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. At OLE Week 96, participants who switched to B/F/TAF ( N  = 519) maintained high levels of virologic suppression (99.5 and 99.1% in those switching from DTG/abacavir/lamivudine and DTG+F/TAF, respectively) and CD4 + cell count, with no treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF. Twenty-one participants experienced drug-related adverse events after switching, with diarrhea, weight gain, and headache occurring most commonly. There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy, drug-related Grade 4 adverse events, or serious adverse events. Two participants discontinued B/F/TAF due to treatment-related adverse events. Participants who switched from DTG/abacavir/lamivudine experienced statistically significant greater weight gain than those who switched from DTG+F/TAF; however, median weight change from the blinded phase baseline to OLE Week 96 was numerically similar across treatment groups. This medium-term analysis demonstrates the safety and efficacy of switching to B/F/TAF from a DTG-containing regimen in people with HIV-1. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is important for both maternal health and prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens that are likely to be used by pregnant women are scarce. In this trial we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the USA, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged ≥18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14-28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals in the past were excluded (up to 14 days of ART during the current pregnancy was permitted), as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses, or those with known fetal anomaly or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was done using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14-18, 19-23, and 24-28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate 25 mg; once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg; or once-daily oral fixed-dose combination of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants with viral suppression, defined as an HIV-1 RNA concentration of less than 200 copies per mL, at or within 14 days of delivery, assessed in all participants with an HIV-1 RNA result available from the delivery visit, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of -10% in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups versus the efavirenz-containing group (superiority was tested in a pre-planned secondary analysis). Primary safety outcomes, compared pairwise among treatment groups, were the occurrence of a composite adverse pregnancy outcome (ie, either preterm delivery, the infant being born small for gestational age, stillbirth, or spontaneous abortion) in all participants with a pregnancy outcome, and the occurrence of grade 3 or higher maternal and infant adverse events in all randomised participants. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03048422. Between Jan 19, 2018, and Feb 8, 2019, we enrolled and randomly assigned 643 pregnant women: 217 to the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group, 215 to the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group, and 211 to the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group. At enrolment, median gestational age was 21·9 weeks (IQR 18·3-25·3), the median HIV-1 RNA concentration among participants was 902·5 copies per mL (152·0-5182·5; 181 [28%] of 643 participants had HIV-1 RNA concentrations of <200 copies per mL), and the median CD4 count was 466 cells per μL (308-624). HIV-1 RNA concentrations at delivery were available for 605 (94%) participants. Of these, 395 (98%) of 405 participants in the combined dolutegravir-containing groups had viral suppression at delivery compared with 182 (91%) of 200 participants in the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (estimated difference 6·5% [95% CI 2·0 to 10·7], p=0·0052; excluding the non-inferiority margin of -10%). Significantly fewer participants in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group (52 [24%] of 216) had a composite adverse pregnancy outcome than those in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (70 [33%] of 213; estimated difference -8·8% [95% CI -17·3 to -0·3], p=0·043) or the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (69 [33%] of 211; -8·6% [-17·1 to -0·1], p=0·047). The proportion of participants or infants with grade 3 or higher adverse events did not differ among the three groups. The proportion of participants who had a preterm delivery was significantly lower in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group (12 [6%] of 208) than in the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (25 [12%] of 207; -6·3% [-11·8 to -0·9], p=0·023). Neonatal mortality was significantly higher in the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (ten [5%] of 207 infants) than in the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate group (two [1%] of 208; p=0·019) or the dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group (three [2%] of 202; p=0·050). When started in pregnancy, dolutegravir-containing regimens had superior virological efficacy at delivery compared with the efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen. The dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate regimen had the lowest frequency of composite adverse pregnancy outcomes and of neonatal deaths.

3110,"('Tenofovir', '(r)-9-(2-phosphonomethoxypropyl)adenine', 'Truvada', '(r)-pmpa', 'Tenofovir (anhydrous)')",Medical,"Emtricitabine/tenofovir, sold under the brand name Truvada among others, is a fixed-dose combination antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. It contains the antiretroviral medications emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. For treatment, it must be used in combination with other antiretroviral medications. For prevention before exposure, in those who are at high risk, it is recommended along with safer sex practices. It does not cure HIV/AIDS. Emtricitabine/tenofovir is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, tiredness, trouble sleeping, abdominal pain, weight loss, and rash. Serious side effects may include high blood lactate levels and enlargement of the liver. Use of this medication during pregnancy does not appear to harm the fetus, but this has not been well studied. Emtricitabine/tenofovir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, emtricitabine/tenofovir was under patent by Gilead until 2020, but is now available as a generic worldwide. In 2020, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Emtricitabine/tenofovir is used both to treat and to prevent HIV/AIDS. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people with HIV/AIDS. === HIV prevention === The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of emtricitabine/tenofovir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for uninfected, HIV-1 negative individuals that may be at risk for HIV-1 infection. A Cochrane systematic review found a 51% relative risk reduction of contracting HIV with both tenofovir alone and the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination. A JAMA systematic review found a similar relative risk reduction of 54% on average and greater reduction with greater adherence. It was approved for PrEP against HIV infection in the United States in 2012. The CDC recommends PrEP be considered for the following high-risk groups: Individuals in an ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV-positive partner Gay or bisexual men who either have had anal sex without a condom or been diagnosed with an STD in the past six months Heterosexual men or women who do not regularly use condoms during sex with partners of unknown HIV status who are substantial risk Injection of drugs in the last six months with sharing of equipment Serodiscordant heterosexual and homosexual partners, where one partner is HIV-positive and the other HIV-negative The consideration of utilizing emtricitabine/tenofovir as a reduction strategy involves discussion with a health professional who can help the patient navigate the benefits and risks. Patients are advised to discuss any history of bone issues, kidney issues, or hepatitis B infection with their healthcare provider. Effectiveness of PrEP for prevention of infection is reliant on an individual's ability to take the medication consistently. Emtricitabine/tenofovir is also used for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis. People who start taking emtricitabine/tenofovir see HIV reduction benefits up to 72 hours after starting, but the medicine must be taken for thirty days after a high-risk sexual event to ensure HIV transmission levels are optimally reduced. Emtricitabine/tenofovir as PrEP should not be used for individuals who are positive for HIV-1. === HIV treatment === Emtricitabine/tenofovir has been approved in the United States as part of antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1. The combination therapy is suggested as one of the options for adults who have not received any prior treatment for HIV infection. === Hepatitis B === Both emtricitabine and tenofovir are indicated for the treatment of hepatitis B, with the added benefit that they can target HIV for those with co-infection. Emtricitabine/tenofovir may also be considered for some antiviral resistant hepatitis B infections. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === In the United States, it is recommended that all pregnant HIV-infected women start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as early in pregnancy as possible to reduce the risk of transmission. ART generally does not increase risk of birth defects with exception of dolutegravir, which is not recommended during first trimester of pregnancy only due to potential risk of neural tube defects. Emtricitabine/tenofovir is secreted in breast milk. In developed countries, HIV-infected mothers are generally recommended to not breastfeed due to slight risk of mother-to-children HIV transmission. In developing countries, where avoiding breastfeeding may not be an option, the World Health Organization recommends a triple drug regimen of tenofovir, efavirenz, and either lamivudine or emtricitabine. == Side effects == Emtricitabine/tenofovir is generally well tolerated. Some of its side effects include: Rare: lactic acidosis, liver dysfunction, worsening of hepatitis B infection Common: headache, abdominal pain, decreased weight, nausea, diarrhea, and decreased bone density Fat redistribution and accumulation (lipodystrophy) has been observed in people receiving antiretroviral therapy, including fat reductions in the face, limbs, and buttocks and increases in visceral fat of the abdomen and accumulations in the upper back. When used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) this effect may not be present. Weight changes have however been linked to the medication. == Drug interactions == Other drugs with adverse reactions include dabigatran etexilate, lamivudine, and vincristine. Dabigatran etexilate used with p-glycoprotein inducers requires monitoring of decreased levels and effects of dabigatran. Lamivudine may increase the adverse or toxic effect of emtricitabine. Vincristine used with P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 inducers can decrease the serum concentration of vincristine. == Society and culture == The patent for the drug combination is owned by Gilead Sciences in some regions. The European patent EP0915894B1 expired in July 2018, Gilead Sciences wished the patent to be extended, however ""four rival labs—Teva, Accord Healthcare, Lupin and Mylan—had sought to have that overturned in the courts in Britain"", the High Court of England and Wales invalidated Gilead's patent, however the company appealed and the UK referred the case to the European Court of Justice who refused to extend the patent. An Irish court rejected an injunction request to prevent the launch of generic Emtricitabine/tenofovir prior to the resolution of the case. Despite the expiration of the Gilead Sciences patent, as of 2021, there are still widespread challenges to the availability and uptake of generic PrEP throughout Europe. In 2019, Gilead Sciences challenged the validity of patents granted to the United States after 2015 for using the drug combination for HIV PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). In July 2024, The Biden administration appealed the jury finding that ruled in favor of Gilead Sciences verdict that the U.S. government's patents are invalid. In the United States, most healthcare plans are required to cover PrEP without any copay or other cost sharing. This is due to a United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that gave PrEP a grade A rating. Under the Affordable Care Act, this recommendation requires all non-grandfathered private health plans to cover PrEP without cost sharing. In the United Kingdom, PrEP is widely available to all at-risk groups following the Department for Health and Social Care's decision to make it available across England in 2020. Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland made it available in 2017 and 2018. == References ==",Truvada,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.152531907195225e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000164018536452204)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emtricitabine/tenofovir?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=102, start_index=9, title='Emtricitabine/tenofovir', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emtricitabine/tenofovir?utm_source=openai')])"

This drug has been discontinued in the U.S. == Medical uses == Amlexanox is the active ingredient in a common topical treatment for recurrent aphthous ulcers of the mouth (canker sores), reducing both healing time and pain. Amlexanox 5% paste is well tolerated, and is typically applied four times per day directly on the ulcers. A 2011 review found it to be the most effective treatment of the eight treatments investigated for recurrent canker sores. It is also used to treat ulcers associated with Behçet disease. In Japan, it is used to treat bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in those with known allergies to it. == Adverse effects == Amlexanox may cause a slightly painful stinging or burning sensation, nausea or diarrhea. == Mechanism of action == Its mechanism of action is not well-determined, but it might inhibit inflammation by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes. It has been shown to selectively inhibit TBK1 and IKK-ε, producing reversible weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation and attenuated hepatic steatosis without affecting food intake in obese mice. It produced a statistically significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin and fructosamine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease == Chemistry == The chemical itself is an odorless, white to yellowish-white powder. The 5% preparation for patient use is an adherent beige paste, and it is also available in some countries as a tablet that adheres to the ulcer in the mouth. == Pharmacokinetics == Amlexanox applied to an aphthous ulcer is largely absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract; an insignificant amount enters the bloodstream through the ulcer itself. After a single 100 mg dose, mean maximum serum concentration occurs 2.4 +/- 0.9 hours after application, with a half-life of elimination (through urine) of 3.5 +/- 1.1 hours. With multiple daily applications (four doses per day), steady state serum levels occur after one week, with no accumulation occurring after four weeks. == History == The patent for its use as a treatment for aphthous ulcers was issued in November 1994 to inventors Kakubhai R. Vora, Atul Khandwala and Charles G. Smith, and assigned to Chemex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. == Society and culture == === Economics === A 2011 review found a one-week supply of amlexanox 5% paste to cost $30. == Research == A review found that, as of July 2011, robust studies investigating its effectiveness alongside other canker sore treatments were still needed. Because it is an inhibitor of the protein kinases TBK1 and IKK-ε, which are implicated in the etiology of type II diabetes and obesity, amlexanox may be a candidate for human clinical trials testing in relation to these diseases. == Synthesis == == References ==",Amlenanox,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003672163875307888), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007264359155669808)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.47407862544059753), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3113,"('(r)-verapamil (hydrochloride)', 'Dexverapamil', 'Dexverapamilum', 'Dexverapamilo', '(r)-verapamil')",Medical," The aim of this project was to study the effect of stainless steel solid microneedles and microneedle rollers on percutaneous penetration of verapamil hydrochloride and amlodipine besylate. Verapamil, 2-(3,4-dimethooxyphenyl)-5-[2-(3,4 dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl-methyl-amino]-2-propan-2-yl-pentanenitrile is a calcium channel blocker agent that regulates high blood pressure by decreasing myocardial contractilty, heart rate and impulse conduction. Amlodipine, (R, S)-2-[(2-aminoethoxy) methyl]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-1, 4-dihydropyridine, is a calcium channel blocker that is used for the management of hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Passive penetration of verapamil and amlodipine across the skin is low. In vitro studies were performed with microneedle-treated porcine ear skin using vertical static Franz diffusion cells (PermeGear, Hellertown, PA, USA). The receiver chamber contained 5ml of PBS (pH7.4) and was constantly maintained at 37°C temperature with a water circulation jacket. The diffusion area of the skin was 1.77cm(2). The donor compartment was loaded with 1ml of the solution containing 2.5mg/ml of amlodipine besylate. The donor chamber was covered with parafilm to avoid evaporation. Passive diffusion across untreated porcine skin served as control. Aliquots were taken every 2h for 12h and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Transcutaneous flux of verapamil increased significantly from 8.75μg/cm(2)/h to 49.96μg/cm(2)/h across microneedle-roller treated porcine skin. Percutaneous flux of amlodipine besylate following the use of stainless steel microneedles was 22.39μg/cm(2)/h. Passive flux for the drug was 1.57μg/cm(2)/h. This enhancement of amlodipine flux was statistically significant. Transdermal flux of amlodipine with microneedle roller was 1.05μg/cm(2)/h in comparison with passive diffusion flux of 0.19μg/cm(2)/h. The difference in flux values was also statistically significant. Stainless steel solid microneedles and microneedle rollers increased percutaneous penetration of verapamil hydrochloride and amlodipine besylate. It may be feasible to develop transdermal microneedle patches for these drugs. The purpose of this investigation was to formulate and evaluate the interaction between cation exchange resins and verapamil hydrochloride. The uptake studies were conducted using the rotating bottle apparatus. The Langmuir-like equation was applied to the experimental data and the maximum drug loading was determined from the Langmuir-like parameters. The drug-resin complexes were evaluated using XRD, SEM, and particle size analysis. Release studies were performed using USP dissolution apparatus 2. The resin with the lowest percentage of cross-linking had the highest uptake capacity. The percent increase in particle size due to complexation was found to be associated with drug loading; the highest drug loading had the highest increase in particle size. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the resins and the drug-resin complexes showed that they were both amorphous. The maximum drug release was approximately 40% when conventional dissolution testing was used. Results showed that sink conditions could not be maintained using conventional dissolution methods. Maximum drug release increased dramatically by increasing the volume of samples withdrawn and fresh dissolution medium added. Excellent correlation was obtained between sample volume and drug release rate with an R-value of 0.988. Particle diffusion-controlled model and film diffusion-controlled model were both applied to the experimental data. The results indicated that the rate-limiting step is the diffusion of the exchanging cations through the liquid film. The modified release formulation was prepared successfully and correlated very well with the USP monograph for verapamil hydrochloride extended release capsules. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker has poor bioavailability (20-30%) owing to extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism. Hence, the major objective of this research was to improve the oral bioavailability of Verapamil by Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (V-SLNs) using high shear homogenization and ultrasonication technology.

It is in the non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker family of medications. Verapamil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Verapamil is available as a generic medication. Long acting formulations exist. In 2022, it was the 188th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Verapamil is used for controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and migraine headache prevention. Verapamil is also used for the treatment of angina (chronic stable, vasospastic or Prinzmetal variant), unstable angina (crescendo, preinfarction), and for the prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Verapamil is a class-IV antiarrhythmic and more effective than digoxin in controlling ventricular rate. Verapamil is not listed as a first line antihypertensive agent by the guidelines provided by JAMA in JNC-8. However, it may be used to treat hypertension if patient has co-morbid atrial fibrillation or other types of arrhythmia. Verapamil is used intra-arterially to treat cerebral vasospasm. It is also used to treat cluster headaches. Tentative evidence supports the use of verapamil topically to treat plantar fibromatosis. Use of verapamil in people with recent onset of type 1 diabetes may improve pancreatic beta cell function. In a 2023 meta-analysis involving data from two randomized controlled trials (113 patients with recent onset type-1 diabetes), it was demonstrated that the use of verapamil over one year was associated with significantly higher C-peptide area under the curve levels. Higher C-peptide levels means better pancreatic insulin production and beta cell function. Verapamil has been reported to be effective in both short-term and long-term treatment of mania and hypomania. Addition of magnesium oxide to the verapamil treatment protocol enhances the antimanic effect. == Contraindications == Use of verapamil is generally avoided in people with severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to verapamil. It is also contraindicated in people with atrial flutter or fibrillation and an existing accessory tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. == Side effects == The most common side effect of verapamil is constipation (7.3%). While the definite mechanism by which verapamil causes constipation has not been studied, studies have been conducted to rule out mechanisms of actions that might yield this adverse effect. A 1992 study found that verapamil causes a delay in colonic transit but does not affect upper gastrointestinal transit. Other side effects include dizziness (3.3%), nausea (2.7%), low blood pressure (2.5%), and headache 2.2%. Other side effects seen in less than 2% of the population include: edema, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, diarrhea, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, shortness of breath, low heart rate, atrioventricular block, rash and flushing. Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce gingival enlargement. === Overdose === Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, weakness, slow heart rate, dizziness, low blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500 μg/L in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1–4 mg/L in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5–10 mg/L in fatal poisonings. == Mechanism of action == Verapamil's mechanism in all cases is to block voltage-dependent calcium channels. In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV antiarrhythmic agents. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, these agents can be used to decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the ventricles from atrial tachyarrhythmias. Specific conditions that fall under the definition of atrial tachyarrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and so on. Verapamil is also a Kv voltage gated potassium channel blocker. Calcium channels are also present in the smooth muscle lining blood vessels. By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers dilate the blood vessels. This has led to their use in treating high blood pressure and angina pectoris. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil dilate the coronary blood vessels, which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. They also cause dilatation of systemic peripheral vessels as well, causing a reduction in the workload of the heart. Thereby reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. === Cluster headaches === Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs, as CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels. == Pharmacokinetic details == More than 90% of verapamil is absorbed when given orally, but due to high first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is much lower (10–35%). It is 90% bound to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution of 3–5 L/kg. It takes 1 to 2 hours to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver to at least 12 inactive metabolites (though one metabolite, norverapamil, retains 20% of the vasodilatory activity of the parent drug). As its metabolites, 70% is excreted in the urine and 16% in feces; 3–4% is excreted unchanged in urine. This is a nonlinear dependence between plasma concentration and dosage. Onset of action is 1 to 2 hours after oral dosage, and 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous bolus dosage. Biphasic or triphasic following IV administration; terminal elimination half-life is 2–8 hours. Plasma half-life of 2–8 or 4.5–12 hours after single oral dose or multiple oral doses, respectively. It is not cleared by hemodialysis. It is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered. == Veterinary use == Intra-abdominal adhesions are common in rabbits following surgery. Verapamil can be given postoperatively in rabbits which have suffered trauma to abdominal organs to prevent formation of these adhesions. Such effect was not documented in another study with ponies. == Uses in cell biology == Verapamil inhibits the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family of proteins found in stem cells and has been used to study cancer stem cells (CSC) within head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Verapamil is also used in cell biology as an inhibitor of drug efflux pump proteins such as P-glycoprotein and other ABC transporter proteins. This is useful, as many tumor cell lines overexpress drug efflux pumps, limiting the effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs or fluorescent tags. It is also used in fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content, as it blocks efflux of a variety of DNA-binding fluorophores such as Hoechst 33342. Radioactively labelled verapamil and positron emission tomography can be used with to measure P-glycoprotein function. == References ==",Verapamil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.033323527139146e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -6.758938252460212e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verapamil,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a684030.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/verapamil.html ', [])"

3116,"('Labetalol (hydrochloride)', 'Sch-15719w', 'Labetalol', 'Labetolol', 'Albetol')",Medical,"Labetalol is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and in long term management of angina. This includes essential hypertension, hypertensive emergencies, and hypertension of pregnancy. In essential hypertension it is generally less preferred than a number of other blood pressure medications. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include low blood pressure with standing, dizziness, feeling tired, and nausea. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, heart failure, and bronchospasm. Use appears safe in the latter part of pregnancy and it is not expected to cause problems during breastfeeding. It works by blocking the activation of β- and α-adrenergic receptors. Labetalol was patented in 1966 and came into medical use in 1977. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 215th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Labetalol is effective in the management of hypertensive emergencies, postoperative hypertension, pheochromocytoma-associated hypertension, and rebound hypertension from beta blocker withdrawal. It has a particular indication in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension which is commonly associated with pre-eclampsia. It is also used as an alternative in the treatment of severe hypertension. Labetalol is useful in the treatment of acute cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. in overdose) caused by sympathomimetics like amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine. Other beta blockers are also used. However, the controversial yet possible phenomenon of ""unopposed α-stimulation"" with administration of selective beta blockers to block non-selective sympathomimetics potentially makes dual alpha-1 and beta blockers like labetalol and carvedilol more favorable for such purposes. The rate of unopposed α-stimulation with selective beta blockers has been reported to be 0.4%, whereas no cases of unopposed α-stimulation have been reported with dual alpha and beta blockers like labetalol. === Special populations === Pregnancy: studies in lab animals showed no harm to the baby. However, a comparable well-controlled study has not been performed in pregnant women. Nursing: breast milk has been shown to contain small amounts of labetalol (0.004% original dose). Prescribers should be cautious in the use of labetalol for nursing mothers. Pediatric: no studies have established safety or usefulness in this population. Geriatric: the elderly are more likely to experience dizziness when taking labetalol. Labetalol should be dosed with caution in the elderly and counseled on this side effect. == Side effects == === Common === Neurologic: headache (2%), dizziness (11%) Gastrointestinal: nausea (6%), dyspepsia (3%) Cholinergic: nasal congestion (3%), ejaculation failure (2%) Respiratory: dyspnea (2%) Other: fatigue (5%), vertigo (2%), orthostatic hypotension Low blood pressure with standing is more severe and more common with IV formulation (58% vs 1%) and is often the reason larger doses of the oral formulation cannot be used. === Rare === Fever Muscle cramps Dry eyes Heart block Hyperkalemia Hepatotoxicity Drug eruption similar to lichen planus Hypersensitivity – which may result in a lethal respiratory distress == Contraindications == Labetalol is contraindicated in people with overt cardiac failure, greater-than-first-degree heart block, severe bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, severe hypotension, anyone with a history of obstructive airway disease including asthma, and those with hypersensitivity to the drug. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Labetalol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a non-selective antagonist of the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. Labetalol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It is also an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, and hence is additionally an alpha blocker. The antagonism of the adrenergic receptors by labetalol is competitive against other catecholamines and its actions on the receptors are potent and reversible. Labetalol acts by blocking α- and β-adrenergic receptors, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance without significant alteration of heart rate or cardiac output. Labetalol is about equipotent in blocking β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. The amount of α to β blockade depends on whether labetalol is administered orally or intravenously (IV). Orally, the ratio of α to β blockade is 1:3. Intravenously, α to β blockade ratio is 1:7. Thus, the labetalol can be thought to be a beta blocker with some α-blocking effects. By comparison, labetalol is a weaker β-adrenergic receptor blocker than propranolol, and has a weaker affinity for α-adrenergic receptors compared to phentolamine. Labetalol's dual α- and β-adrenergic antagonism has different physiological effects in short- and long-term situations. In short-term, acute situations, labetalol decreases blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance with little effect on stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. During long-term use, labetalol can reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output by an increase in stroke volume. Labetalol possesses significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). In particular, it is a partial agonist at β2-adrenergic receptors located in the vascular smooth muscle. Labetalol relaxes vascular smooth muscle by a combination of this partial β2-adrenergic receptor agonism and through α1-adrenergic receptor blockade. Overall, this vasodilatory effect can decrease blood pressure. It was originally reported to lack ISA, but a slight degree of activity was subsequently characterized. Similar to local anesthetics and sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmics, labetalol also has membrane stabilizing activity. By decreasing sodium entry, labetalol decreases action potential firing and thus has local anesthetic activity. ==== Physiological action ==== The physiological effects of labetalol when administered acutely (intravenously) are not predictable solely by their receptor blocking effect, i.e. blocking β1-adrenergic receptors should decrease heart rate, but labetalol does not. When labetalol is given in acute situations, it decreases the peripheral vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure while having little effect on the heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume, despite its α1-, β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor blocking mechanism. These effects are mainly seen when the person is in the upright position. Long term labetalol use also has different effects from other beta blockers. Other beta blockers, such as propranolol, persistently reduce cardiac output during exercise. The peripheral vascular resistance decreases when labetalol is first administered. Continuous labetalol use further decreases peripheral vascular resistance. However, during exercise, cardiac output remains the same due to a compensatory mechanism that increases stroke volume. Thus, labetalol is able to reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output by the increase in stroke volume. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Distribution ==== Labetalol is often classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier and blood–placenta barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. Paradoxically however, labetalol actually shows high lipophilicity. In any case, labetalol, in animals including rats, rabbits, and dogs, was found to cross into the brain in negligible amounts, probably for reasons other than low lipophilicity. On the other hand, the drug has been shown to cross the blood–placenta barrier in humans. == Chemistry == The minimum requirement for adrenergic agents is a primary or secondary amine separated from a substituted benzene ring by one or two carbons. This configuration results in strong agonist activity. As the size of the substituent attached to the amine becomes greater, particularly with respect to a t-butyl group, then the molecule typically is found to have receptor affinity without intrinsic activity, and is, therefore, an antagonist. Labetalol, with its 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl substituted amine, is greater in size relative to a t-butyl group and therefore acts predominantly as an antagonist. The overall structure of labetalol is very polar. This was created by substituting the isopropyl group in the standard beta blocker structure with an aralkyl group, including a carboxamide group on the meta position, and by adding a hydroxyl group on the para position. Labetalol has two chiral carbons and consequently exists as four stereoisomers. Two of these isomers, the (S,S)- and (R,S)- forms are inactive. The third, the (S,R)-isomer, is a powerful α1-adrenergic receptor blocker. The fourth isomer, the (R,R)-isomer which is also known as dilevalol, is a mixed non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker and selective α1 blocker. Labetalol is typically given as a racemic mixture to achieve both α- and β-adrenergic receptor blocking activity. It is chemically designated in International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature as 2-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino]ethyl]benzamide monohydrochloride. The experimental log P of labetalol is 2.7 to 3.1 and its predicted log P ranges from 1.73 to 3.1. Hence, it has relatively high lipophilicity. == History == Labetalol was the first drug created that combined both α- and β-adrenergic receptor blocking properties. It was created to potentially fix the compensatory reflex issue that occurred when blocking a single receptor subtype, i.e. vasoconstriction after blocking β-adrenergic receptors or tachycardia after blocking α-adrenergic receptors. Because the reflex from blocking the single receptor subtypes acted to prevent the lowering of blood pressure, it was postulated that weak blocking of both α- and β-adrenergic receptors could work together to decrease blood pressure. == References ==",Albetol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.500529267825186e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044979469384998083)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.005233882926404476)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/albetol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='ALBETOL - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/albetol?utm_source=openai')])"

3118,"('Retinoic acid', 'Vitamin a acid', 'All-trans-retinoic acid', 'Tretinoin', 'Trans-retinoic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Tretinoin, also known as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is a medication used for the treatment of acne and acute promyelocytic leukemia. For acne, it is applied to the skin as a cream, gel or ointment. For acute promyelocytic leukemia, it is effective only when the RARA-PML fusion mutation is present and is taken by mouth for up to three months. Topical tretinoin is also the most extensively investigated retinoid therapy for photoaging. Common side effects when used as a cream are limited to the skin and include skin redness, peeling, and sun sensitivity. When taken by mouth, side effects include hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, shortness of breath, headache, numbness, depression, skin dryness, itchiness, hair loss, vomiting, muscle pains, and vision changes. Other severe side effects include high white blood cell counts and blood clots. Use during pregnancy is contraindicated due to the risk of birth defects. It is in the retinoid family of medications. Tretinoin was patented in 1957 and approved for medical use in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tretinoin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 238th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Skin use === ==== Acne ==== Tretinoin is most commonly used to treat acne, both inflammatory and noninflammatory. Multiple studies support the efficacy of topical retinoids in the treatment of acne vulgaris. It is sometimes used in conjunction with other topical acne medications to enhance their penetration. In addition to treating active acne, retinoids accelerate the resolution of acne-induced postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. It is also useful as maintenance therapy for people who have responded well to their initial treatment, reducing the prolonged use of antibiotics for acne. ==== Photoaging ==== Photoaging is premature skin aging resulting from prolonged and repeated exposure to solar radiation. Features of photoaging include fine and coarse wrinkles, changes in skin pigmentation, and loss of elasticity. In human skin, topical retinoids increase collagen production, induce epidermal hyperplasia, and decrease keratinocyte and melanocyte atypia. Topical tretinoin is the most extensively investigated retinoid therapy for photoaging. Topical tretinoin can be used for mild to severe photoaging in people of all skin types. Several weeks or months of use are typically required before improvement is appreciated. Although it has only been studied for up to two years, it may be continued indefinitely. A long-term maintenance regimen with a lower concentration or less frequent application may be an alternative to continued use. === Leukemia === Tretinoin is used to induce remission in people with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who have a mutation (the t(15;17) translocation that gives rise to the PML::RARα fusion gene). It is not used for maintenance therapy. Tretinoin is not effective for the treatment of non-APL forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia or other forms of leukemia. Preclinical studies and clinical data analysis suggest that retinoic acid promotes the growth of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. == Side effects == === Dermatology === Topical tretinoin is for use only on the skin and should not be applied to eyes or mucosal tissues. Common side effects include skin irritation, redness, swelling, and blistering. If irritation is a problem, a decrease in the frequency of application to every other or every third night can be considered, and the frequency of application can be increased as tolerance improves. The fine skin flaking that is often seen can be gently exfoliated with a washcloth. A non-comedogenic facial moisturizer can also be applied if needed. Delaying the application of the retinoid for at least 20 minutes after washing and drying the face may also be helpful. Topical retinoids are not true photosensitizing drugs, but people using topical retinoids have described symptoms of increased sun sensitivity. This is thought to be due to the thinning of the stratum corneum leading to a decreased barrier against ultraviolet light exposure, as well as an enhanced sensitivity due to the presence of cutaneous irritation. === Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia === The oral form of the drug has boxed warnings concerning the risks of retinoic acid syndrome and leukocytosis. Other significant side effects include a risk of thrombosis, benign intracranial hypertension in children, high lipids (hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia), and liver damage. There are many significant side effects from this drug that include malaise (66%), shivering (63%), hemorrhage (60%), infections (58%), peripheral edema (52%), pain (37%), chest discomfort (32%), edema (29%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (26%), weight increase (23%), injection site reactions (17%), anorexia (17%), weight decrease (17%), and myalgia (14%). Respiratory side effects usually signify retinoic acid syndrome, and include upper respiratory tract disorders (63%), dyspnea (60%), respiratory insufficiency (26%), pleural effusion (20%), pneumonia (14%), rales (14%), and expiratory wheezing (14%), and many others at less than 10%. Around 23% of people taking the drug have reported earache or a feeling of fullness in their ears. Gastrointestinal disorders include bleeding (34%), abdominal pain (31%), diarrhea (23%), constipation (17%), dyspepsia (14%), and swollen belly (11%) and many others at less than 10%. Cardiovascular side effects include arrhythmias (23%), flushing (23%), hypotension (14%), hypertension (11%), phlebitis (11%), and cardiac failure (6%) and for 3% of patients: cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, enlarged heart, heart murmur, ischemia, stroke, myocarditis, pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, secondary cardiomyopathy. In the nervous system, side effects include dizziness (20%), paresthesias (17%), anxiety (17%), insomnia (14%), depression (14%), confusion (11%), and many others at less than 10% frequency. In the urinary system, side effects include chronic kidney disease (11%) and several others at less than 10% frequency. == Mechanism of action == For its use in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia, tretinoin causes the RARA:PML fusion oncogene to degrade, resulting in the loss of the key driver oncogene. This degradation allows the blasts to mature and results in dramatic responses. This response is typically short-lived as Cyp26 genes are rapidly upregulated to degrade tretinoin. The RARA:PML oncogene is not present in other cancer types, thus explaining why tretinoin and other retinoids have not been effective across hundreds of different trials. For its use in acne, tretinoin (along with other retinoids) are vitamin A derivatives that act by binding to two nuclear receptor families within keratinocytes: the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and the retinoid X receptors (RXR). These events contribute to the normalization of follicular keratinization and decreased cohesiveness of keratinocytes, resulting in reduced follicular occlusion and microcomedone formation. The retinoid-receptor complex competes for coactivator proteins of AP-1, a key transcription factor involved in inflammation. Retinoids also down-regulate expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, which has been implicated in the inflammatory response in acne. Moreover, tretinoin and retinoids may enhance the penetration of other topical acne medications. The combination of the 10% benzoyl peroxide and light results in more than 50% degradation of tretinoin in about 2 hours and 95% in 24 hours. This lack of stability in the presence of light and oxidizing agents has led to the development of novel formulations of the drug. When microencapsulated tretinoin is exposed to benzoyl peroxide and light only 1% degradation takes place in about 4 hours and only 13% after 24 hours. The biological mechanism behind triglyceride and cholesterol elevations remains under investigation. == Synthesis == All-trans retinoic acid is produced by the body from dietary factors including retinol, retinyl esters or beta-carotene. The beta-carotene is first cleaved by beta-carotene 15-15'-monooxygenase to retinol which is subsequently oxidized by RDH and ALDH enzymes to produce all-trans retinoic acid (see retinoic acid). Tretinoin is produced synthetically using standard industrial practices. == History == Tretinoin was co-developed for its use in acne by James Fulton and Albert Kligman when they were at University of Pennsylvania in the 1960s. Phase I trials, the first conducted on human subjects, were performed on inmates at Holmesburg Prison during a long-running regime of non-therapeutic testing on prison inmates at Holmesburg. The University of Pennsylvania held the patent for Retin-A, which it licensed to pharmaceutical companies. Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia was first introduced at Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai by Wang Zhenyi in a 1988 clinical trial. In 1997, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tretinoin microsphere gel, marketed as Retin-A Micro, for the treatment of acne. The formulation incorporates microsponge technology, which encapsulates tretinoin within an aqueous gel. == Etymology == The origin of the name tretinoin is uncertain, although several sources agree (one with probability, one with asserted certainty) that it probably comes from trans- + retinoic [acid] + -in, which is plausible given that tretinoin is the all-trans isomer of retinoic acid. The name isotretinoin is the same root tretinoin plus the prefix iso-. Regarding pronunciation, the following variants apply equally to both tretinoin and isotretinoin. Given that retinoic is pronounced , it is natural that is a commonly heard pronunciation. Dictionary transcriptions also include (tri-TIN-oh-in) and . == Hair loss == Tretinoin has been explored as a treatment for hair loss, potentially as a way to increase the ability of minoxidil (by acting as an enzyme and accelerating the production of minoxidil sulfate) to penetrate the scalp, but the evidence is weak and contradictory. == References == == External links == ""Tretinoin Topical"".

Typically, digoxigenin is introduced chemically (conjugation) into biomolecules (proteins, nucleic acids) to be detected in further assays. Kd of the digoxigenin-antibody interaction has been estimated at ~12 nM (compare to Kd~0.1pM for the biotin-streptavidin interaction). DIG-binding proteins Tinberg et al. designed artificial proteins that bind DIG. Their best binder, DIG10.3, was a 141 amino acid protein that bound DIG with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 541 (+/- 193) pM. Anti-digoxigenin antibodies with high affinities and specificity are used in a variety of biological immuno-assays (e.g. ELISA). The antibodies are labeled with dyes, enzymes or fluorescence, directly or secondarily, for visualization and detection. Digoxigenin is thus an all-purpose immuno-tag, and in particular a standard immunohistochemical marker for in situ hybridization. In this case it is conjugated to a single species of RNA nucleoside triphosphate (typically uridine), which is then incorporated into RNA (a ""riboprobe"") as it is synthesized by the cellular machinery. It allows to make : sensitive non-radioactive in situ hybridization probes to detect nucleic acids in plants, able to detect 1 μg of plasmid DNA. peptide-DIG conjugates, i.e. bradykinin assay by very sensitive chemiluminescence immunoassays. fluorescent and DIG-labeled tracers for competitive immunoassays, i.e. to limit detect digoxin, a drug used to cure cardiac arrhythmia, down to 0.2 ng mL−1.

Aramchol, a conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid, is a member of a synthetic fatty-acid/bile-acid conjugate (FABAC). FABACs are composed of endogenous compounds, orally administrated with potentially good safety and tolerability parameters. Aramchol affects liver fat metabolism and has been shown in a Phase IIa clinical study to significantly reduce liver fat content as well as improve metabolic parameters associated with fatty liver disease. Furthermore, it has been shown to be safe for use, and with no severe adverse effects. Aramchol was initially intended to combine a cholesterol solubilizing moiety (a saturated fatty acid) with a bile acid (cholic acid) acting as a vehicle to enable secretion into bile and entry into the enterohepatic circulation to solubilise bile stones. However, early in the development, it was observed that Aramchol reduced liver fat infiltration in animals fed a high fat, lithogenic diet. This effect was confirmed in other animal models and the development plan was modified according to these findings, as fatty liver is an unmet need. Aramchol has been shown to work by two parallel pathways, leading to synergistic effects == The SCD1 pathway == Aramchol inhibits the activity of stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) in the liver. This is likely a direct effect since the mRNA of this and other lipogenic genes or the activities of nuclear receptors are not affected. The physiologic effects of SCD1 inhibition are: decreased synthesis of fatty acids, resulting in a decrease in storage triglycerides and other esters of fatty acids. This reduces liver fat (including triglycerides and free fatty acids), and results in an improvement in insulin resistance. Aramchol’s mechanism of action, inhibition of the SCD1 enzyme, has been confirmed in human liver microsomes2 and in animal studies by showing a reduction of the SCD1 activity marker, the fatty acid ratio 16:1/16:0, following Aramchol treatment. These studies showed that the SCD1 inhibition effect of Aramchol is partial (can reach to 70 to 83%). Unlike other SCD1 inhibitors, it was shown that Aramchol’s effects are non-atherogenic. There are at present no known inhibitors of SCD1 with the established safety and efficacy profile of Aramachol. == Reverse cholesterol transport == Aramchol activates cholesterol efflux by stimulating (2 to 4-fold) the ABCA1 transporter, a universal cholesterol export pump present in all cells. In animal models, this led to a significant reduction of blood and body cholesterol and an increase in fecal sterol output, mostly neutral sterols. Aramchol is the first small molecule that was shown to induce ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux without affecting transcriptional control. == References ==",Aramchol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016766376211307943), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010406429646536708), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860186204314232)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramchol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Aramchol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramchol?utm_source=openai')])"

3124,"('Gestodene', 'Wl 70', 'Gestoden', 'Gestodenum [inn-latin]', 'Gestodeno [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Gestodene, sold under the brand names Femodene and Minulet among others, is a progestin medication which is used in birth control pills for women. It is also used in menopausal hormone therapy. The medication is available almost exclusively in combination with an estrogen. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of the combination of an estrogen and gestodene include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, and others. Gestodene is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic activity, weak antimineralocorticoid activity, and weak glucocorticoid activity. Gestodene was discovered in 1975 and was introduced for medical use, specifically in birth control pills, in 1987. It was subsequently introduced for use in menopausal hormone therapy as well. Gestodene is sometimes referred to as a ""third-generation"" progestin. It is marketed in birth control pills widely throughout the world, whereas it is available for use in menopausal hormone therapy only a few countries. Gestodene is not approved in the United States. == Medical uses == Gestodene is neutral in terms of androgenic activity, meaning that contraceptive pills containing gestodene do not exhibit the androgenic side effects (e.g., acne, hirsutism) sometimes associated with second-generation contraceptive pills such as those containing levonorgestrel. The estrogen dosage in third-generation contraceptive pills (including those containing gestodene) is lower than that in second-generation oral contraceptives, reducing the likelihood of weight gain, breast tenderness, and migraine. Third-generation oral contraceptives are also suitable for use in patients with diabetes or lipid disorders because they have minimal impact on blood glucose levels and the lipid profile. Gestodene is also available in combination with estradiol for use in menopausal hormone therapy. === Available forms === Contraceptive products containing gestodene include: Melodene-15, Mirelle, and Minesse which contain 15 μg of ethinylestradiol and 60 μg of gestodene; Meliane, Sunya, Femodette, and Millinette 20/75 which contain 20 μg of ethinylestradiol and 75 μg of gestodene; and Gynera, Minulet, Femoden, Femodene, Katya and Millinette 30/75 which contain 30 μg of ethinylestradiol and 75 μg of gestodene. == Contraindications == == Side effects == Women who take oral contraceptives containing gestodene are 5.6 times as likely to develop venous thromboembolism than women who do not take any contraceptive pill, and 1.6 times as likely to develop venous thromboembolism compared to women taking oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel. == Overdose == == Contraindications == == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Gestodene is a highly potent progestogen, and also possesses weak androgenic, antimineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid activity. Due to its progestogenic activity, it has antigonadotropic and functional antiestrogenic effects. The medication has little or no estrogenic and no antiandrogenic activity. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== Gestodene is a progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor. Based on the dosage necessary to inhibit ovulation in women, gestodene is the most potent of all of the currently used oral contraceptive progestogens. The oral dosage of gestodene required for ovulation inhibition is 30 or 40 μg per day. This is about 10,000 times lower than the oral dosage of progesterone required to inhibit ovulation (300 mg/day). A dosage of gestodene of 75 μg/day is used in contraceptives. ==== Androgenic activity ==== Gestodene has relatively high affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), with twice that of levonorgestrel (which is known to be one of the more androgenic 19-nortestosterone derivatives). However, the ratio of progestogenic to androgenic effects of gestodene is distinctly higher than that of levonorgestrel, and the increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels (a marker of androgenicity) produced by oral contraceptives containing gestodene is slightly less than that produced by oral contraceptives containing desogestrel (which is known to be one of the more weakly androgenic 19-nortestosterone derivatives). In addition, no difference in acne incidence has been observed with oral contraceptives containing gestodene and oral contraceptives containing desogestrel. Gestodene may also act to some extent as a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Taken together, like desogestrel, gestodene appears to have a low potential for androgenic effects. ==== Glucocorticoid activity ==== Gestodene has relatively high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, about 27% of that of the corticosteroid dexamethasone. It has weak glucocorticoid activity. ==== Antimineralocorticoid activity ==== Gestodene has very high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), but has only a relatively weak antimineralocorticoid effect that is comparable to that of progesterone. ==== Other activities ==== Although gestodene does not bind to the estrogen receptor itself, the drug may have some estrogenic activity, and this would appear to be mediated by its weakly estrogenic metabolites 3β,5α-tetrahydrogestodene and to a lesser extent 3α,5α-tetrahydrogestodene. Gestodene binds to SHBG with relatively high affinity; it is 75% bound to the protein in circulation. Gestodene shows some inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro, and has greater potency in this action compared to other progestins (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 5.0 μM). The medication also shows some inhibition of 5α-reductase in vitro (14.5% at 0.1 μM, 45.9% at 1.0 μM). Like with cytochrome P450 inhibition, gestodene was more potent in this action compared to other progestins, including desogestrel and levonorgestrel. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of gestodene has been found to range from 87 to 111%, with a mean of 96%. Unlike other third-generation progestins like desogestrel and norgestimate, gestodene is not a prodrug. Peak levels of gestodene occur within 1 to 4 hours after an oral dose, but usually within 1 to 2 hours. The plasma protein binding of gestodene is 98%. It is bound 64% to sex hormone-binding globulin and 34% to albumin, with 2% circulating freely. Gestodene is metabolized in the liver via reduction of the δ4-3-keto group to form 3,5-tetrahydrogenated metabolites (major pathway) and via hydroxylation at the C1, C6, and C11 positions (substantial). In spite of differing from it only by the presence of an additional double bond between the C15 and C16 positions, gestodene is not metabolized into levonorgestrel in the body. The biological half-life of gestodene is 12 to 15 hours. Gestodene is eliminated 50% in urine and 33% in feces. Of gestodene excreted in urine, 25% is in the form of glucuronide conjugates, 35% is as sulfate conjugates, and 25% is unconjugated. == Chemistry == Gestodene, also known as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ15-testosterone, as well as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestra-4,15-dien-17β-ol-3-one or 13β-ethyl-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,15-dien-20-yn-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is a member of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Gestodene is almost identical to levonorgestrel in terms of chemical structure, differing only in having an additional double bond between the C15 and C16 positions, and for this reason is also known as δ15-norgestrel or as 15-dehydronorgestrel. == History == Gestodene was first synthesized in 1975. It was introduced for medical use, specifically in combination with ethinylestradiol as a combined oral contraceptive, in 1987.

3125,"('Indole', 'Indol', 'Ketole', 'Benzopyrrole', 'Caswell no. 498b')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Indole is an organic compound with the formula C6H4CCNH3. Indole is classified as an aromatic heterocycle. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered pyrrole ring. Indoles are derivatives of indole where one or more of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituent groups. Indoles are widely distributed in nature, most notably as amino acid tryptophan and neurotransmitter serotonin. == General properties and occurrence == Indole is a solid at room temperature. It occurs naturally in human feces and has an intense fecal odor. At very low concentrations, however, it has a flowery smell, and is a constituent of many perfumes. It also occurs in coal tar. It has been identified in cannabis. It is the main volatile compound in stinky tofu. When indole is a substituent on a larger molecule, it is called an indolyl group by systematic nomenclature. Indole undergoes electrophilic substitution, mainly at position 3 (see diagram in right margin). Substituted indoles are structural elements of (and for some compounds, the synthetic precursors for) the tryptophan-derived tryptamine alkaloids, which includes the neurotransmitter serotonin and the hormone melatonin, as well as the naturally occurring psychedelic drugs dimethyltryptamine and psilocybin. Other indolic compounds include the plant hormone auxin (indolyl-3-acetic acid, IAA), tryptophol, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin, and the betablocker pindolol. The name indole is a portmanteau of the words indigo and oleum, since indole was first isolated by treatment of the indigo dye with oleum. == History == Indole chemistry began to develop with the study of the dye indigo. Indigo can be converted to isatin and then to oxindole. Then, in 1866, Adolf von Baeyer reduced oxindole to indole using zinc dust. In 1869, he proposed a formula for indole. Certain indole derivatives were important dyestuffs until the end of the 19th century. In the 1930s, interest in indole intensified when it became known that the indole substituent is present in many important alkaloids, known as indole alkaloids (e.g., tryptophan and auxins), and it remains an active area of research today. == Biosynthesis and function == Indole is biosynthesized in the shikimate pathway via anthranilate. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of tryptophan, where it stays inside the tryptophan synthase molecule between the removal of 3-phospho-glyceraldehyde and the condensation with serine. When indole is needed in the cell, it is usually produced from tryptophan by tryptophanase. As an intercellular signal molecule, indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and virulence. A number of indole derivatives have important cellular functions, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin. == Detection methods == Common classical methods applied for the detection of extracellular and environmental indoles, are Salkowski, Kovács, Ehrlich’s reagent assays and HPLC. For intracellular indole detection and measurement genetically encoded indole-responsive biosensor is applicable. == Medical applications == Indoles and their derivatives are promising against tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes, cancer, migraines, convulsions, hypertension, bacterial infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and even viruses. == Synthetic routes == Indole and its derivatives can also be synthesized by a variety of methods. The main industrial routes start from aniline via vapor-phase reaction with ethylene glycol in the presence of catalysts: In general, reactions are conducted between 200 and 500 °C. Yields can be as high as 60%. Other precursors to indole include formyltoluidine, 2-ethylaniline, and 2-(2-nitrophenyl)ethanol, all of which undergo cyclizations. === Leimgruber–Batcho indole synthesis === The Leimgruber–Batcho indole synthesis is an efficient method of synthesizing indole and substituted indoles. Originally disclosed in a patent in 1976, this method is high-yielding and can generate substituted indoles. This method is especially popular in the pharmaceutical industry, where many pharmaceutical drugs are made up of specifically substituted indoles. === Fischer indole synthesis === One of the oldest and most reliable methods for synthesizing substituted indoles is the Fischer indole synthesis, developed in 1883 by Emil Fischer. Although the synthesis of indole itself is problematic using the Fischer indole synthesis, it is often used to generate indoles substituted in the 2- and/or 3-positions. Indole can still be synthesized, however, using the Fischer indole synthesis by reacting phenylhydrazine with pyruvic acid followed by decarboxylation of the formed indole-2-carboxylic acid. This has also been accomplished in a one-pot synthesis using microwave irradiation. === Other indole-forming reactions === Bartoli indole synthesis Bischler–Möhlau indole synthesis Cadogan-Sundberg indole synthesis Fukuyama indole synthesis Gassman indole synthesis Hemetsberger indole synthesis Larock indole synthesis Madelung synthesis Nenitzescu indole synthesis Reissert indole synthesis Baeyer–Emmerling indole synthesis In the Diels–Reese reaction dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate reacts with 1,2-diphenylhydrazine to an adduct, which in xylene gives dimethyl indole-2,3-dicarboxylate and aniline. With other solvents, other products are formed: with glacial acetic acid a pyrazolone, and with pyridine a quinoline. == Chemical reactions of indole == === Basicity === Unlike most amines, indole is not basic: just like pyrrole, the aromatic character of the ring means that the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can, however, protonate indole. Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of the portion of the molecule located outside of the benzene ring. The protonated form has a pKa of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., tryptamines) under acidic conditions is caused by this protonation. === Electrophilic substitution === The most reactive position on indole for electrophilic aromatic substitution is C3, which is 1013 times more reactive than benzene. For example, it is alkylated by phosphorylated serine in the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of indole will take place at room temperature exclusively at C3. Since the pyrrolic ring is the most reactive portion of indole, electrophilic substitution of the carbocyclic (benzene) ring generally takes place only after N1, C2, and C3 are substituted. A noteworthy exception occurs when electrophilic substitution is carried out in conditions sufficiently acidic to exhaustively protonate C3. In this case, C5 is the most common site of electrophilic attack. Gramine, a useful synthetic intermediate, is produced via a Mannich reaction of indole with dimethylamine and formaldehyde. It is the precursor to indole-3-acetic acid and synthetic tryptophan. === N–H acidity and organometallic indole anion complexes === The N–H center has a pKa of 21 in DMSO, so that very strong bases such as sodium hydride or n-butyl lithium and water-free conditions are required for complete deprotonation. The resulting organometalic derivatives can react in two ways. The more ionic salts such as the sodium or potassium compounds tend to react with electrophiles at nitrogen-1, whereas the more covalent magnesium compounds (indole Grignard reagents) and (especially) zinc complexes tend to react at carbon 3 (see figure below). In analogous fashion, polar aprotic solvents such as DMF and DMSO tend to favour attack at the nitrogen, whereas nonpolar solvents such as toluene favour C3 attack. === Carbon acidity and C2 lithiation === After the N–H proton, the hydrogen at C2 is the next most acidic proton on indole. Reaction of N-protected indoles with butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide results in lithiation exclusively at the C2 position. This strong nucleophile can then be used as such with other electrophiles. Bergman and Venemalm developed a technique for lithiating the 2-position of unsubstituted indole, as did Katritzky. === Oxidation of indole === Due to the electron-rich nature of indole, it is easily oxidized. Simple oxidants such as N-bromosuccinimide will selectively oxidize indole 1 to oxindole (4 and 5). === Cycloadditions of indole === Only the C2–C3 pi bond of indole is capable of cycloaddition reactions. Intramolecular variants are often higher-yielding than intermolecular cycloadditions. For example, Padwa et al. have developed this Diels-Alder reaction to form advanced strychnine intermediates. In this case, the 2-aminofuran is the diene, whereas the indole is the dienophile. Indoles also undergo intramolecular [2+3] and [2+2] cycloadditions. Despite mediocre yields, intermolecular cycloadditions of indole derivatives have been well documented. One example is the Pictet-Spengler reaction between tryptophan derivatives and aldehydes, which produces a mixture of diastereomers, leading to reduced yield of the desired product. === Hydrogenation === Indoles are susceptible to hydrogenation of the imine subunit to give indolines. == See also == Indole-3-butyric acid Indole test Isoindole Isoindoline Skatole (3-methylindole) == References == === General references === Houlihan, W.

It is a derivative of pyridine with a carboxylic acid (COOH) substituent at the 2-position. It is an isomer of nicotinic acid and isonicotinic acid, which have the carboxyl side chain at the 3- and 4-positions, respectively. It is a white solid although impure samples can appear tan. The compound is soluble in water. == Production == On a commercial scale, picolinic acid is produced by ammoxidation of 2-picoline followed by hydrolysis of the resulting nitrile: NC5H4CH3 + 1.5 O2 + NH3 → NC5H4C≡N + 3 H2O NC5H4C≡N + 2 H2O → NC5H4CO2H + NH3 It is also produced by oxidation of picoline with nitric acid. In the laboratory, picolinic acid is formed from 2-methylpyridine by oxidation with potassium permanganate (KMnO4). == Reactions == Hydrogenation of picolinic acid gives piperidine-2-carboxylic acid, a precursor to the drug Mepivacaine. Picolinic acid is a bidentate chelating agent of elements such as chromium, zinc, manganese, copper, iron, and molybdenum in the human body. It is a substrate in the Mitsunobu reaction. In the Hammick reaction, picolinic acid reacts with ketones to give pyridine-2-carbonols: NC5H4CO2H + R2C=O → NC5H4CR2(OH) + CO2 == Biosynthesis == Picolinic acid is a catabolite of the amino acid tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway. Its function is unclear, but it has been implicated in a variety of neuroprotective, immunological, and anti-proliferative effects.

This compound is an odorless white solid, soluble in water. It has surfactant, antiseptic, and anti-infective properties and it is used as a topical antimicrobial agent in first aid antiseptics. It is also found in cosmetics and toiletries such as soap, mouthwashes, anti-itch ointments, and antibacterial moist towelettes. Benzethonium chloride is also used in the food industry as a hard surface disinfectant. == Uses == === Antimicrobial === Benzethonium chloride exhibits a broad spectrum of microbiocidal activity against bacteria, fungi, mold, and viruses. Independent testing shows that benzethonium chloride is highly effective against such pathogens as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Clostridioides difficile, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and norovirus. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifies that the safe and effective concentrations for benzethonium chloride are 0.1-0.2% in first aid products. Aqueous solutions of benzethonium chloride are not absorbed through the skin. It is not approved in the US and Europe for use as a food additive. Being a quaternary ammonium salt, it is more toxic than negatively charged surfactants. However, in a two-year study on rats, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity. It is available under trade names Salanine, BZT, Diapp, Quatrachlor, Polymine D, Phemithyn, Antiseptol, Disilyn, Phermerol, and others. It is also found in several grapefruit seed extract preparations and can be used as a preservative, as in the anaesthetics ketamine and alfaxalone. === Other uses === In addition to its highly effective antimicrobial activity, benzethonium chloride contains a positively charged nitrogen atom covalently bonded to four carbon atoms. This positive charge attracts it to the skin and hair. This contributes to a soft, powdery after-feel on the skin and hair, as well as long-lasting persistent activity against micro-organisms. Also, this positively charged hydrophilic part of the molecule makes it a cationic detergent. Benzethonium chloride is also used to titrate the quantity of sodium dodecyl sulfate in a mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, using dimidium bromide-sulphan blue as an indicator. It precipitates as turbidity with anionic polymers in aqueous solution, allowing it to be used to estimate the amount of such polymers present in a sample. This test is used in commercial and industrial water treatment, where polyacrylates, polymaleates, and sulfonated polymers are commonly employed as dispersants. === Methylbenzethonium chloride === A related compound (25155-18-4 ) is used to treat Leishmania major infections. == Regulation == Some data has suggested that long-term exposure to antibacterial ingredients could contribute to bacterial resistance or hormonal effects. Furthermore, there is little evidence that the use of such ingredients in consumer soaps is actually more effective than plain soap and water. In September 2016, the Food and Drug Administration issued a ban on nineteen consumer antiseptic wash ingredients. A ruling on benzethonium chloride, along with two other similar ingredients, was deferred for a year to allow for more data collection. == References ==",Benzethonium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.8927898406982422), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.04945319518446922), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -3.8889261304575484e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.00861930102109909), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.23368294537067413), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -7.652943895664066e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -0.004468930885195732), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -8.22540732769994e-06), (',', -0.0011745942756533623), ('ĠINDU', -0.06588625907897949), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('AL', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2522083818912506)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.019584359601140022), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -4.5491004129871726e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.10025207698345184), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzethonium_chloride,https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/benzethonium-chloride/,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11125 ', [])"

Visual inspection and biochemical examinations including TNF-α, interleukin 6, and C-reactive protein were performed to assess arthritis severity during the treatment. The adalimumab concentration in rats was determined to evaluate the PK interaction between delanzomib and adalimumab. Also, the levels of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and FcRn mRNA were measured to explore the role of FcRn in the PK interaction between delanzomib and adalimumab. As a result, delanzomib combined with adalimumab exhibited stronger anti-arthritis activity than a single drug because both drugs synergistically reduced TNF-α level ",Delanzomib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002036595979006961), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001234931987710297), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024882566649466753)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28140719/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='Phase I/II study of the novel proteasome inhibitor delanzomib (CEP-18770) for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28140719/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is found as an accessory pigment in the chloroplasts of brown algae and most other heterokonts, giving them a brown or olive-green color. Fucoxanthin absorbs light primarily in the blue-green to yellow-green part of the visible spectrum, peaking at around 510-525 nm by various estimates and absorbing significantly in the range of 450 to 540 nm. == Function == Carotenoids are pigments produced by plants and algae and play a role in light harvesting as part of the photosynthesis process. Xanthophylls are a subset of carotenoids, identified by the fact that they are oxygenated either as hydroxyl groups or as epoxide bridges. This makes them more water soluble than carotenes such as beta-carotene. Fucoxanthin is a xanthophyll that contributes more than 10% of the estimated total production of carotenoids in nature. It is an accessory pigment found in the chloroplasts of many brown macroalgae, such as Fucus spp., and the golden-brown unicellular microalgae, the diatoms. It absorbs blue and green light at bandwidth 450-540 nm, imparting a brownish-olive color to algae. Fucoxanthin has a highly unique structure that contains both an epoxide bond and hydroxyl groups along with an allenic bond (two adjacent carbon-carbon double bonds) and a conjugated carbonyl group (carbon-oxygen double bond) in the polyene chain. All of these features provide fucoxanthin with powerful antioxidant activity. In macroalgal plastids, fucoxanthin acts like an antenna for light harvesting and energy transfer in the photosystem light harvesting complexes. In diatoms like Phaeodactylum tricornutum, fucoxanthin is protein-bound along with chlorophyll to form a light harvesting protein complex. Fucoxanthin is the dominant carotenoid, responsible for up to 60% of the energy transfer to chlorophyll a in diatoms When bound to protein, the absorption spectrum of fucoxanthin expands from 450-540 nm to 390-580 nm, a range that is useful in aquatic environments. == Sources == Fucoxanthin is present in brown seaweeds and diatoms and was first isolated from Fucus, Dictyota, and Laminaria by Willstätter and Page in 1914. Seaweeds are commonly consumed in south-east Asia and certain countries in Europe, while diatoms are single-cell planktonic microalgae characterized by a golden-brown color, due to their high content of fucoxanthin. Generally, diatoms contain up to 4 times more fucoxanthin than seaweed, making diatoms a viable source for fucoxanthin industrially. Diatoms can be grown in controlled environments (such as photobioreactors). Brown seaweeds are mostly grown in the open sea, often exposed to metals and metalloids. == Bioavailability == Limited studies of fucoxanthin in humans indicate low bioavailability. == See also == Chlorophyll == References ==",Fucoxanthin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0036025596782565117), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INFO', [('FO', -0.018216101452708244), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.5761197209358215), ('ĠINFO', -0.4926849603652954), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005569098866544664)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucoxanthin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=6, title='Fucoxanthin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucoxanthin?utm_source=openai')])"

3133,"('Sulfacetamide', 'Sulphacetamide', 'Acetosulfamine', 'N-((4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl)acetamide', 'N-acetylsulfanilamide')",Medical,"Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the eyes and skin. It functions by inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria, which is essential for their growth and reproduction, thereby exerting a bacteriostatic effect. Available in various forms, including eye drops, topical solutions, and creams, sulfacetamide is often prescribed for conditions such as conjunctivitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and acne vulgaris. Its efficacy, coupled with a relatively low risk of side effects, makes it a widely utilized agent in both ophthalmic and dermatologic care. == Medical uses == Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic, that is used as a cream to treat skin infections and as eye drops to treat eye infections. On the skin it is used to treat acne and seborrheic dermatitis. In cream form it is used to treat bacterial infections on the skin. It can also be used orally to treat urinary tract infections. It kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for bacterial growth. It mainly inhibits the multiplication of bacteria as it acts in a competitive inhibitor. Sulfacetamide 10% topical lotion, sold under the brand name Klaron or Ovace, is approved for the treatment of acne and seborrheic dermatitis. When combined with sulfur, it is sold under the brand names Plexion, Clenia, Prascion, and Avar, which contain 10% sulfacetamide and 5% sulfur. === Available forms === Sulfacetamide as a medicine is available as solution, eye drops, lotion, and powder. It can also be found in the form of the sodium salt, sulfacetamide sodium. It is available in fixed-dose combinations with prednisolone. == Side effects == The most common side effects are irritation, stinging or burning of the skin. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tiredness and headache. There are however also severe side effects including severe allergic reactions, like (nettle) rash, itch, tightness in chest, difficult breathing and swelling in either the face, mouth, lips or tongue. Other severe side effects include bloody or severe diarrhea, fever, joint pain, red, blistered or swollen skin and stomach pain. In the eye, it can cause conjunctivitis. There are also life-threatening conditions which can be produced by the antibiotic, like Stevens Johnson syndrome and Erythema multiforme. Higher exposure can also cause unconsciousness. One case showed that sulfacetamide eyedrops can very rarely cause life-threatening skin condition toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These are however not all side effects. For more information the health care provider can be contacted. Sulfacetamide should not be used by individuals who have a sensitivity to sulfur or sulfa. === Toxicity === The acute oral toxicity (LD50) in a mouse is 16.5 g/kg. As this falls within Toxicity Category IV of the toxicity category rating for oral administration, it is practically non-toxic and also not an irritant when taken in orally. However, it is very hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), ingestion and inhalation. Research proved that it is more toxic in the presence of light than in the dark. Sulfacetamide is slightly irritant when UV-A light is present. In the presence of light sulfacetamide gets sensitized and degraded which might cause irritation which will lead to toxicity when it is used continuously. In the dark only slight irritation has been shown. Therefore it should be stored in the dark. There are no known carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. It has a moderate toxicity according to the Chemwatch hazard ratings. == Pharmacology == === Mechanisms of action === Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics, that are active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It blocks the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. It is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is required for bacterial synthesis of folic acid and it is an essential component for bacterial growth. The multiplication of bacteria is therefore inhibited by the action of sulfacetamide. Sulfonamides are generally effective against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. Specifically enteric bacteria and other eubacteria are affected by the antibiotic as it kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for their growth. However strains of bacteria can be resistant to the antibiotic. If a bacterium is resistant to a sulfonamide, it is resistant to all the forms. Furthermore, sulfacetamide is toxic to soil organisms. === Pharmacokinetics === Sulfacetamide is absorbed orally. The oral absorption of sulfacetamide is found to be 100% and the plasma protein binding is 80–85%. In the liver it is metabolized to inactive metabolites. Plasma half-life is 7 – 12.8 hours. Sulfonamides are usually metabolized by several oxidative pathways, acetylation, and conjugation with sulfate or glucuronic acid. However, there are some differences in biotransformation between certain species. Acetylation, which reduces the solubility of sulfonamides, is for example poor developed in dogs. The acetylated, hydroxylated, and conjugated forms have little antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the hydroxylated and conjugated forms are less likely to precipitate in urine. The hydrolysis takes place by the action of amidases. It is excreted primarily in the urine. Secretory routes of less significance are bile, feces, milk and sweat. Glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption are the main processes involved. == Chemistry == === Structure and chemical properties === These are organic compounds containing an benzenesulfonamide moiety with an amine group attached to the benzene ring. The molecular formula is C8H10N2O3S. Its scientific name is N-(4-aminophenyl)sulfonylacetamide. At room temperature, it appears as a white powder. === Degradation reactions and stability === Sulfacetamide is stable under normal temperatures and pressures. No dangerous reactions occur under known conditions of normal use. It is an important bacteriostatic agent that is commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. Therefore it can accumulate in the environment (mostly surface water). It has a long lifetime in the environment so different degradation reactions are researched: The photocatalytic degradation of sulfacetamide in water solutions during illumination of UV radiation with TiO2 was examined. It was found that sulfacetamide is resistant to biodegradation and that it is toxic to the green alga Chlorella vulgaris. It undergoes photocatalytic degradation and the toxicity of the intermediate products is significantly lower than the initial toxicity. The intermediates can be mineralized in contrast to sulfacetamide. Sulfonamide → organic intermediate products (degradation) (in presence of OH−). At higher temperatures sulfacetamide solutions degrade to its hydrolysed product, sulphanilamide with a first-order rate constant. Also oxidation of sulfacetamide by diperiodatocuperate(III) in an aqueous alkaline medium can occur. Copper(III) is used, as it is involved in many biological electron transfer reactions. The sulphanilamide can oxidise to a blue product with a first order reaction and it can form azo dye with a second order reaction. === Synthesis === Sulfacetamide is synthesized either by direct alkylation of acetamide with 4-aminobenzenesulfonyl chloride, or by reacting 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide with acetic anhydride and subsequent selective, reductive deacylation of the resultant acetamide using a system of zinc-sodium hydroxide. == Research == Sulfacetamide has been investigated for use in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor and rosacea. It also has anti-inflammatory properties when used to treat blepharitis or conjunctivitis (in eye-drop solution). It is believed to work by limiting the presence of folic acid which bacteria need to survive. It has been suggested that sulfacetamide may also serve as a treatment for mild forms of hidradenitis suppurativa. Sulfacetamide has antibacterial activity and is used to control acne. Products containing sulfacetamide and sulfur (a keratolytic) are commonly promoted for the treatment of acne rosacea (rosacea with papules, pustules, or both). There are several prescription topical products containing sulfacetamide, such as foams, shampoos, cream and washes. Some research indicates that sulfacetamide derivatives may act as antifungals by an CYP51A1-independent mechanism. == References ==",Acetosulfamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0046258182264864445)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004576565697789192), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004118889104574919)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

3138,"('Cyclopentolate (hydrochloride)', 'Cyclopentolate', 'Cyclopentylate', 'Ciclopentolato', 'Cyclopentolatum')",Medical,"Cyclopentolate is a muscarinic antagonist. It is commonly used as an eye drop during pediatric eye examinations to dilate the eye (mydriatic) and prevent the eye from focusing/accommodating (cycloplegic). Cyclopentolate or atropine can also be administered to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect cholinomimetic (anti-AChase) administration. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. After instillation of cyclopentolate, pupil dilation (mydriasis) typically lasts up to 24 hours, while paralysis of the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia) typically lasts 6-24 hours. During this time, patients may be more light sensitive than normal and may notice close objects blurred (and possibly distant objects blurred, depending on the patient's visual system). Cyclopentolate is often chosen as a milder, shorter-lasting, cycloplegic alternative to atropine, another cycloplegic agent which lasts much longer. Tropicamide is an even shorter-lasting cycloplegic than cyclopentolate, but is less reliable for finding latent hyperopia. Cyclopentolate drops act rapidly to dilate the pupil. The side and adverse effects of cyclopentolate are similar to the side and adverse effects of other anticholinergic medications. Because of that, extra caution should be taken when prescribing cyclopentolate to patients who are already taking other anticholinergic drugs. A possible ocular (eye-related) side effect is increase in pressure inside the eye, which is of particular concern when there is a predisposition toward or a presence of glaucoma. Other ocular side effects can include burning sensations, discomfort with bright light (photophobia), blurred vision, irritation, inflammation of the eye mucous membranes (conjunctivitis), inflammation of the cornea of the eye (keratitis), and other issues. Nonocular (not eye-related) side and adverse effects can include neuropsychiatric symptoms. like subtle concentration and memory problems, subtle decision-making problems, drowsiness, and more pronounced disorientation to time and place, confusion, disturbances of speech and movement, hyperactivity, restlessness, and seizures. Temporary psychosis can develop that includes hallucinations, particularly when higher doses are used in children or older adults on other anticholinergic medications. Patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type can experience worsening of their dementia symptoms. Additional side and adverse effects can include skin flushing, skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, increased heart beat (tachycardia), increased body temperature (hyperpyrexia), blood vessel dilation, urinary retention, dry mouth and reduced sweating, and reduced bronchial secretions. Severe poisoning with cyclopentolate may result in coma, paralysis of breathing, and death. Cyclopentolate derivatives can be used as an antidote for organophosphate poisoning. Lethality of cyclopentolate has been studied in rodents. The LD50 (the dose at which 50% of animals die from the drug) is approximately 4000 mg/kg in rats and 960 mg/kg in mice. Readily recognizable symptoms of overdose include tachycardia, dizziness, dry mouth, behavioral disturbances, uncoordination, and drowsiness. Cycloplegia is necessary in cases of suspected latent hyperopia (or ""over-focusing"") so that an ophthalmologist or optometrist can accurately measure how much a person has to flex their focusing muscle (accommodation) in order to see in the distance and up-close. Correction of latent hyperopia in children can often prevent, or sometimes correct, unwanted eye turns (strabismus), some forms of refractive amblyopia, and may alleviate eye strain or frontal headaches caused by prolonged near-work. Cycloplegia is also helpful in relieving accommodative spasm. == History == Cyclopentolate was first synthesized in 1952 as a chemical analogue of atropine.

3142,"('Casein kinase ii inhibitor', 'Ck2inhibitor', '(4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-n,n-dimethyl-1h-benzo[d]imidazol-2-amine)')",Medical," Casein kinase II (CK2) is involved in multiple tumor-relevant signaling pathways affecting proliferation and apoptosis. CK2 is frequently upregulated in acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and can be targeted by the ATP-competitive CK2 inhibitor CX-4945. While reduced proliferation of tumor entities including B-ALL after CX-4945 incubation has been shown in vitro and in vivo, the detailed way of action is unknown. Here, we investigated the influence on the PI3K/AKT and apoptosis cascades in vivo and in vitro for further clarification. A B-ALL xenograft model in NSG mice was used to perform in vivo longitudinal bioluminescence imaging during six day CX-4945 treatment. CX-4945 serum levels were determined at various time points. Flow cytometry of bone marrow and spleen cells was performed to analyze CX-4945-induced effects on tumor cell proliferation and distribution in B-ALL engrafted mice. ALL cells were enriched and characterized by targeted RNA sequencing. In vitro, B-ALL cell lines SEM, RS4;11 and NALM-6 were incubated with CX-4945 and gene expression of apoptosis regulators BCL6 and BACH2 was determined. In B-ALL-engrafted mice, overall tumor cell proliferation and distribution was not significantly influenced by CK2 inhibition. CX-4945 was detectable in serum during therapy and serum levels declined rapidly after cessation of CX-4945. While overall proliferation was not affected, early bone marrow and spleen blast frequencies seemed reduced after CK2 inhibition. Gene expression analyses revealed reduced expression of anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL6 in bone marrow blasts of CX-4945-treated animals. Further, BCL6 protein expression decreased in B-ALL cell lines exposed to CX-4945 in vitro. Surprisingly, levels of BCL6 opponent and tumor suppressor BACH2 also declined after prolonged incubation. Simultaneously, increased phosphorylation of direct CK2 target and tumor initiator AKT was detected at respective time points, even in initially pAKT-negative cell line NALM-6. The CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has limited clinical effects in an in vivo B-ALL xenograft model when applied as a single drug over a six day period. However, gene expression in B-ALL cells was altered and suggested effects on apoptosis via downregulation of BCL6. Unexpectedly, the BCL6 opponent BACH2 was also reduced. Interactions and regulation loops have to be further evaluated. Casein kinase II (CK2) inhibitors suppress cancer cell growth. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effects of a novel CK2 inhibitor, hematein, on tumor growth in a murine xenograft model. We found that in lung cancer cells, hematein inhibited cancer cell growth, Akt/PKB Ser129 phosphorylation, the Wnt/TCF pathway and increased apoptosis. In a murine xenograft model of lung cancer, hematein inhibited tumor growth without significant toxicity to the mice tested. Molecular docking showed that hematein binds to CK2α in durable binding sites. Collectively, our results suggest that hematein is an allosteric inhibitor of protein kinase CK2 and has antitumor activity to lung cancer. Genotype 2a JFH1 virus has substantially contributed to the progress of HCV biology by allowing entire viral life cycle of HCV in cell culture. Using this genotype 2a virus, casein kinase II (CKII) was previously identified as a crucial host factor in virus assembly by phosphorylating NS5A. Since most of the prior studies employed genotype 2a JFH1 or JFH1-based intragenotypic chimera, we used genotype 1a H77S to study virus assembly. CKII inhibition by chemical inhibitors enhanced H77S virus production in contrast to that of JFH1 virus, but genetic inhibition of CKII by siRNA did not change H77S virus titer significantly. The different outcomes from these two approaches of CKII inhibition suggested that nonspecific target kinase of CKII inhibitors plays a role in increasing H77S virus production and both viral and host factors were investigated in this study. Our results emphasize substantial differences among the HCV genotypes that should be considered in both basic research and clinical practices.",Casein kinase ii inhibitor,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019289902411401272), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03993247076869011), ('ICAL', -2.7418097943154862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133447766304016)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('INFO; ', [])"

A single oral dose of 75-mg generic RAH sustained-release capsule (test drug) or a commercial capsule (reference drug) was given to healthy volunteers under fasting (n = 36) and fed conditions (n = 36). Blood samples were collected at baseline and during the 24 hours after dosing. The concentrations of roxatidine acetate (ROX) and bioactive metabolite roxatidine in plasma were detected using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed with noncompartmental methods. As prodrug, RAH was dehydrochloric acid to ROX in body and further rapidly converted to roxatidine. Such a rapid metabolism resulted in ROX that was hardly detected in plasma. Active metabolism roxatidine was therefore used to evaluate the pharmacokinetic process.

It has 750-fold higher potency than the earlier drug liarozole as well as greater selectivity, with more than 300-fold selectivity for inhibition of CYP26A1 over other steroid-metabolizing enzymes like CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) and aromatase (CYP19A1). == References ==",Rambazole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002476135268807411), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0033877857495099306), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06201343983411789)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.25193390250205994)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talarozole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Talarozole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talarozole?utm_source=openai')])"

Verubulin is a potent tubulin polymerization inhibitor, binding to colchicine-binding sites. In the present work, a series of verubulin analogues containing a cyclohexane or cycloheptane ring 1,2-annulated with pyrimidine moiety and various substituents in positions 2 and 4 of pyrimidine were obtained and their cytotoxicity towards cancer and non-cancerous cell lines was estimated. The investigated compounds revealed activity against various cancer cell lines with IC Verubulin (MPC-6827) is a microtubule-destabilizing agent that achieves high concentrations in the brain. Verubulin disrupts newly formed blood vessels in xenografts. We determined the safety and tolerability of verubulin administered in combination with carboplatin in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Three pre-selected doses of verubulin were tested: 2.1, 2.7, and 3.3 mg/m(2) in a standard ""3+3"" design. Verubulin was given every second week of a 6-week cycle in the 2.1 mg/m(2) cohort or weekly for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle in subsequent cohorts. Carboplatin was administered intravenously at an area under the curve (AUC) dosage 4 every 2 weeks for the 2.1 mg/m(2) cohort or on day 1 of each 4-week cycle in subsequent cohorts. Nineteen patients with GBM in first or second relapse were enrolled. Four patients (21 %) experienced a grade 3 or greater verubulin- or carboplatin-related adverse event, including hypesthesia, cerebral ischemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The mean plasma half life of verubulin was 3.2 h (SD = 0.82). Two patients achieved at least a partial response by Macdonald criteria. One of these patients remains progression free and off treatment more than 24 months beyond his initiation of verubulin. Five patients had stable disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) across all patients was 8 weeks, and the 6-month PFS rate was 21 %. The combination of verubulin at the previously determined single-agent maximum tolerated dose of 3.3 mg/m(2) with carboplatin in patients with recurrent/refractory GBM is safe and well tolerated.

It is analogous to taurine, but with an extra carbon in its chain. It has GABAergic activity, apparently by mimicking GABA, which it resembles. Homotaurine was investigated in a Phase III clinical trial as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that did not show efficacy. However, post-hoc analyses have shown positive and significant effects of homotaurine on secondary endpoints and subgroups of patients, including a reduction in hippocampal volume loss and lower decline in memory function in the overall cohort, as well as a reduction in global cognitive decline in APOE4 allele carriers, suggesting a disease-modifying effect. A study in cognitive impairment done in 2018 did show positive benefits. Homotaurine is currently in a phase 3 study with expected FDA approval as the first disease modifying drug for AD. == Medical use == Acamprosate (N-acetyl homotaurine) was approved by the FDA in 2004 to treat alcohol dependence. == Biochemical properties == In preclinical studies it had been found to bind to soluble amyloid beta and inhibit the formation of neurotoxic aggregates. Homotaurine has also shown anticonvulsant activities, reduction in skeletal muscle tonus, and hypothermic activity. Homotaurine has been reported as a GABA antagonist, as well as a GABA agonist. In vitro studies have found that homotaurine is a GABAA partial agonist as well as a GABAB receptor partial agonist with low efficacy, becoming an antagonist and displacing the full agonists GABA and baclofen at this receptor. In a study in rats, homotaurine reversed the catatonia induced by baclofen (the prototypical GABAB agonist), and was able to produce analgesia via the GABAB receptor, an effect that was abolished when CGP-35348, a GABAB receptor antagonist was applied. In a human study homotaurine selectively and fully inhibits the formation of Aβ42 oligomers at the clinical dose, without evidence of vasogenic edema. One study in rats showed that homotaurine suppressed ethanol-stimulated dopamine release, as well as ethanol intake and preference in rats in a way similar to the N-acetyl derivative of homotaurine, acamprosate. == References ==",Alzhemed,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0015121236210688949), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.001930420519784093), (' END', -0.5759754776954651), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.03806639462709427), (' FOOD', -4.008129963040119e-06)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.03859233856201172), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), (',', -0.12707094848155975), ('ĠFOOD', -0.10182797908782959), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03056737780570984)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007099286303855479), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17908052/?utm_source=openai), [biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/neurochem-inc-s-tramiprosate-alzhemed-north-american-phase-iii-clinical-trial-inconclusive?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=245, start_index=6, title=""Alzhemed: a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease"", type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17908052/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=245, start_index=6, title=""Neurochem, Inc.'s Tramiprosate (ALZHEMED) North American Phase III Clinical Trial Inconclusive - BioSpace"", type='url_citation', url='https://www.biospace.com/neurochem-inc-s-tramiprosate-alzhemed-north-american-phase-iii-clinical-trial-inconclusive?utm_source=openai')])"

'daily offerings') is the ninth tractate in Kodashim, which is the fifth of the six orders of the Mishnah, Tosefta, and the Talmud. The main subject of Tamid is the morning and evening burnt offerings (Exodus 29:38–42; Numbers 28:3–8), but it also deals with other Temple ceremonies. The tractate includes information about the Temple Service from sages who had been present at the Temple and witnessed the service. This tractate contains few disagreements between the sages and few exegetical derivations. It is written as a historical description of the service. == Mishnah == The Mishnah on Tamid is divided into seven chapters (six in Lowe's edition of the Mishnah), containing 34 paragraphs in all: Chapter 1: The priests kept watch in three places in the Temple; where the young priests were on guard, and where the older ones slept who held the keys (§ 1); all who sought admission to remove the ashes from the altar were obliged to prepare themselves by a ritual bath before the officer appeared; when he appeared and when he called upon the priests to draw lots (§ 2); the mutual greetings of the priests (§ 3); how the one chosen by lot to remove the ashes from the altar performed his duties (§ 4). Chapter 2: How the other priests continued the task of cleansing the altar (§ 1); the piling of the ashes, in the center of the altar, into a hillock, which was considered an adornment (§ 2); the supply of fuel for the altar and the kind of wood used (§ 3); the arrangement of the wood and fire in layers (§§ 4-5). Chapter 3: The drawing of lots for various official duties, such as slaying the tamid, sprinkling its blood, and cleansing the altar and the candlestick (§ 1); the announcement of the time of slaying the morning sacrifice (§ 2); the bringing of the sacrificial lamb, which was given to drink from a golden cup before it was killed; who was charged with taking it to the place of sacrifice (§§ 3-5); the mode of cleansing the inner altar and the candlesticks, together with the statement, in conformity with Ezek. xliv. 2, that no man ever passed through the postern on the southern side of the large door; how the opening of this great portal was heard as far as Jericho, as was the sound of the trumpets and other music of the Temple (§§ 6-9). Chapter 4: The ritual for killing and dismembering the sacrificial lamb; how the parts of the sacrifice were brought to the altar. Chapter 5: The daily morning prayer in the Temple, which was supplemented on the Sabbath by a benediction on the division of priests who then completed their duties (§ 1); the drawing of lots for offering incense; the question as to whether one might make this offering twice, and the mode of burning the incense (§§ 2-5); the ""magrefah,"" a musical instrument used in the Temple ( see Organ), and the various priestly and Levitical meanings of the signals given on it (§ 6). Chapter 6: Additional details in regard to offering incense. Chapter 7: The ritual used in case the high priest himself performed the sacrifice; the mode in which he pronounced the benediction on the people; the divergency of this benediction from that bestowed by the priests outside the Temple, and the music which accompanied the high priest's performance of his functions (§§ 1-3); enumeration of the Psalms sung by the Levites in the Temple on the various days of the week (§ 4). == Talmud == The extant gemara on Tamid in the Babylonian Talmud covers only three chapters of the tractate (chapters 1, 2, and 4). It is the shortest tractate of gemara in the Babylonian Talmud consisting of only seven pages. There are approximately only 4,600 words in the tractate. It contains several sayings and ethical maxims of importance, as well as stories and legends of much interest. For example: ""The Pentateuch and the writings of the Prophets and the mishnaic sages contain specific exaggerated expressions which can not be taken literally, such as, 'The cities are great and walled up to heaven' (Deut 1:28)"". It also contains legends concerning Alexander the Great, his conversation with the sages of the South, his journey to Africa, and his adventures among the Amazons and at the gate of paradise. == Commentaries == === Rishonim === Almost none of the famous early commentators extended their work to Tamid.

3158,"('Phenylephrine', '(r)-phenylephrine', 'Metasympatol', 'Metasynephrine', 'Mezaton')",Medical,"Phenylephrine, sold under the brand names Neosynephrine and Sudafed PE among others, is a medication used as a decongestant for uncomplicated nasal congestion in the form of a nasal spray or oral tablet, to dilate the pupil, to increase blood pressure given intravenously in cases of low blood pressure, and to relieve hemorrhoids as a suppository. It can also be applied to the skin. Common side effects when taken by mouth or injected include nausea, vomiting, headache, and anxiety. Use on hemorrhoids is generally well tolerated. Severe side effects may include a slow heart rate, intestinal ischemia, chest pain, kidney failure, and tissue death at the site of injection. It is unclear whether its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. Phenylephrine is a selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist with minimal to no β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity or induction of norepinephrine release. It causes constriction of both arteries and veins. Phenylephrine was patented in 1933 and came into medical use in 1938. It is available as a generic medication. Unlike pseudoephedrine, abuse of phenylephrine is very uncommon. Its effectiveness as an oral nasal decongestant has been questioned. In 2023, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel concluded that the drug was ineffective as a nasal decongestant when taken orally, performing no better than placebo. In November 2024, the FDA proposed to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion. == Medical uses == === Decongestant === Phenylephrine is used as an alternative to pseudoephedrine as a decongestant, whose availability has been restricted in some countries due to a potential for use in the illicit synthesis of methamphetamine. Its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been questioned, with several independent studies finding that it provided no more relief to sinus congestion than a placebo. A 2007 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence for its effectiveness is insufficient, though another meta-analysis published shortly thereafter by researchers from GlaxoSmithKline found the standard 10-mg dose to be more effective than a placebo; however, the fact that GSK markets many products containing phenylephrine has raised some speculation regarding selective publishing and other controversial techniques. A 2007 study by Wyeth Consumer Healthcare notes that 7 studies available in 1976 support the efficacy of phenylephrine at a 10 mg dosage. The Food and Drug Administration withdrew the indication ""for the temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with sinusitis"" in 2007. Two studies published in 2009, examined the effects of phenylephrine on symptoms of allergic rhinitis by exposing people to pollen in a controlled, indoor environment. Neither study was able to distinguish between the effects of phenylephrine or a placebo. Pseudoephedrine and loratadine–montelukast therapy were found to be significantly more effective than both phenylephrine and placebo. Pseudoephedrine was previously much more commonly available in the United States. However, provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 placed restrictions on the sale in the United States of pseudoephedrine products to prevent the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine. Since 2004, phenylephrine has been increasingly marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine; some manufacturers have changed the active ingredients of products to avoid restrictions on sales. Phenylephrine has been off-patent for some time, and many generic brands are available. In September 2023, an independent advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unanimously agreed that there is insufficient evidence showing that ""orally administered phenylephrine is effective as a nasal decongestant"". The committee also unanimously believes that this does not need further study. The FDA responded to the committee, stating it would take its advice under advisement. In November 2024, the FDA proposed to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion. === Hemorrhoids === Hemorrhoids are caused by swollen veins in the rectal area. Phenylephrine can be used topically to prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids. Phenylephrine causes the constriction of vascular smooth muscle and is often used in the treatment of hemorrhoids to narrow the swollen veins and relieve the attendant pain. However, veins contain less vascular smooth muscle in their walls than arteries. Products for treatment may also include substances that will form a protective barrier over the inflamed area, resulting in less pain when feces are passed. Phenylephrine hydrochloride at 0.25% is used as a vasoconstrictor in suppository formulations for hemorrhoid treatment. === Pupil dilation === Phenylephrine is used as an eye drop to dilate the pupil to facilitate visualization of the retina. It is often used in combination with tropicamide as a synergist when tropicamide alone is not sufficient. Narrow-angle glaucoma is a contraindication to phenylephrine use. As a mydriatic, it is available in 2.5% and 10% eye drops. Phenylephrine eye drops are applied to the eye after a topical anesthetic is applied. === Intraocular bleeding === Phenylephrine has been used as an intracameral injection into the anterior chamber of the eye to arrest intraocular bleeding occurring during cataract and glaucoma surgery. === Low blood pressure === Phenylephrine is commonly used as a vasopressor to increase the blood pressure in unstable patients with hypotension (low blood pressure), especially resulting from septic shock. Such use is common in surgery and anesthesia or critical-care practices; it is especially useful in counteracting the hypotensive effect of epidural and spinal anesthesia, as well as the vasodilating effect of bacterial toxins and the inflammatory response in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Because of its vasoconstrictive effect, phenylephrine can cause severe necrosis if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Because of this, it should be given through a central line if at all possible. Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha-blocker phentolamine by subcutaneous injection. In clinical studies, phenylephrine, administered intravenously, increases blood pressure, decreases cardiac output, increases cerebral blood flow, and decreases cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. The decreases in cardiac output, increases in cerebral blood flow, and decreases in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation with phenylephrine are all related to the degree of blood pressure increase. The decrease in cardiac output is primarily due to a decrease in heart rate and a modest decrease in stroke volume. The decrease in heart rate is due to activation of the arterial baroreflex, which regulates heart rate in response to changes in blood pressure. Because of the decrease in cardiac output, phenylephrine is a negative inotropic agent. Its effects on cardiac output and cerebral oxygenation are unfavorable, and on account of this, the use of phenylephrine in the treatment of intraoperative hypotension is now being recommended against and moved away from in favor of other agents without these adverse effects like ephedrine and dopamine. When taken orally, phenylephrine has a threshold dose of about 50 mg to affect the cardiovascular system, a dose at which the drug decreases heart rate and slightly increases arterial blood pressure. Additionally, an over-the-counter dose of 60 mg produces a slight increase in heart rate with no detectable changes in blood pressure. However, other literature reports that doses over 15 mg affect the cardiovascular system, including increases in blood pressure and decreases in heart rate. Higher doses, like 150 mg, more robustly affect the cardiovascular system. === Other uses === Phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It has been found to improve vascular resistance, enhance circulatory support, and improve symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in people with the condition. It has been described as particularly effective in people with neuropathic POTS. However, phenylephrine has not been specifically approved for the treatment of POTS and data on this use are limited. This is also the case with other medications used in the treatment of POTS. Phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of priapism. === Available forms === Phenylephrine is available in the form of oral tablets and syrups for use as a nasal decongestant, as an intravenous solution to treat hypotension, as an ophthalmic solution, spray, or eye drop to cause pupil dilation, and as a cocoa butter suppository, among other forms. It was also previously available as a metered aerosol for inhalation, but this formulation was discontinued. Phenylephrine is available both alone and in combination with other drugs. These other drugs include antihistamines like chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, promethazine, and mepyramine (pyrilamine); analgesics like paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, ketorolac, and codeine; cough suppressants like dextromethorphan; expectorants like guiafenesin; anticholinergics like cyclopentolate and tropicamide; and β-adrenergic receptor agonists like isoprenaline (isoproterenol). It is used in combination with antihistamines and analgesics in cough and cold preparations, with anticholinergics in ophthalmic formulations, and with β-adrenergic receptor agonists in inhalational forms. Intravenous phenylephrine is always formulated by itself. == Contraindications == Phenylephrine is contraindicated in people with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and heart disease due to its vasoconstrictor effects. Relative contraindications include people with Raynaud's syndrome due to vasoconstriction, those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) due to inhibition of the metabolism of phenylephrine, and people with prostate problems due to potential exacerbation of urinary retention. == Side effects == Phenylephrine taken orally at indicated doses is usually well-tolerated. It may cause side effects such as headache, reflex bradycardia, excitability, restlessness, and cardiac arrhythmias. At higher than indicated doses, phenylephrine can increase blood pressure and decrease heart rate. A 45 mg dose of phenylephrine can increase systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg. Possible side effects of intravenous phenylephrine are dose-dependent and may include bradycardia and reactive hypertension. === Heart === The primary side effect of phenylephrine is high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are typically advised to avoid products containing it. Because this medication is a sympathomimetic amine without β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity, it does not increase contractility force and output of the cardiac muscle. It may increase blood pressure resulting in a slow heart rate through stimulation of vascular (likely carotid) baroreceptors. A common side effect during IV administration is reflex bradycardia. The low concentration eye drops do not cause blood pressure changes and the changes with the higher dose drops do not last long. The cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine may be potentiated in people with hypertension. Hypertensive crisis with phenylephrine eye drops has been reported in people with hypertension. In people with underlying cardiovascular disease, phenylephrine has been found to increase blood pressure and cause associated impairment in myocardial perfusion. Other reported side effects of phenylephrine have included increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction resulting in worsened orthostatic tolerance, atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass surgery, decreased cerebral oxygenation, bradycardia in people with spinal cord injury, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, and microvascular occlusion syndrome. Rarely, stroke has been reported with phenylephrine, including in the oral, topical, and intravenous forms. Due to the increased risk of side effects in people with hypertension, phenylephrine is not suggested for use in this population. === Others === Prostatic hyperplasia can also be worsened by use, and chronic use can lead to rebound hyperemia. People with a history of anxiety or panic disorders, or on anticonvulsant medication for epilepsy should not take this substance. The drug interaction might produce seizures. Some patients have been shown to have an upset stomach, severe abdominal cramping, and vomiting issues connected to taking this drug. Phenylephrine is pregnancy category C. Due to the lack of studies done in animals and in humans, it is not known whether there is harm to the fetus. Phenylephrine should only be given to pregnant women who have a clear need. Extended use may cause rhinitis medicamentosa, a condition of rebound nasal congestion. == Interactions == Phenylephrine is susceptible to metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Because of this, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can inhibit the metabolism of phenylephrine and increase exposure to the medication. Whereas a 45 mg oral dose of phenylephrine alone increases systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg, use of this dose in people on MAOIs increases systolic blood pressure by more than 60 mmHg. Phenylephrine can interact with other adrenergic drugs, such as beta blockers like propranolol, α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists like chlorpromazine, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists like clonidine, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like atomoxetine and amitriptyline, and MAOIs (which increase norepinephrine levels). It can also interact with corticosteroids like prednisone, which sensitize the vasculature to sympathomimetics and augment their vasoconstrictive effects, and with ergot alkaloids, which also have vasoconstrictor effects and can have additive or synergistic effects with phenylephrine. In addition, combination of phenylephrine with other sympathomimetic drugs can increase pressor effects and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Other drugs that may decrease the effects of phenylephrine may include calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and benzodiazepines. Patients taking these medications may need a higher dose of phenylephrine to achieve a comparable increase in blood pressure. Concomitant use of phenylephrine with the preceding agents may necessitate dose adjustments. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been found to increase exposure to oral phenylephrine. It more than doubles phenylephrine's bioavailability, reduces its absorption half-time by 50%, increases phenylephrine levels by approximately 2-fold, and increases peak phenylephrine levels by 4-fold, with substantial interindividual variability. Phenylephrine is widely formulated with acetaminophen in combination products. The combination may increase the cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine. The mechanism of the interaction between phenylephrine and acetaminophen is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be due to saturation of sulfation pathways by acetaminophen that also participate in phenylephrine metabolism. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Phenylephrine is a selective agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, one of the biological targets of the catecholamine hormones and neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is a full agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor in most assessed tissues. The drug has weak, minimal, or no agonist activity at the α2-adrenergic receptor or the β-adrenergic receptors. At the β-adrenergic receptors, it is a partial agonist. Phenylephrine also has relatively little or no activity as a norepinephrine releasing agent. As such, it has little activity as an indirectly acting sympathomimetic and non-selective activator of adrenergic receptors. This is in contrast to related sympathomimetics like pseudoephedrine. However, more recent research suggests that phenylephrine may actually be more potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent than has previously been thought. This might help to explain certain unexpected pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. Because of its α1-adrenergic receptor agonism, phenylephrine is a directly acting sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor and produces both venous and arterial vasoconstriction. The term sympathomimetic means that it mimics the actions of epinephrine or norepinephrine. Phenylephrine works as a nasal decongestant by causing local vasoconstriction in the nose. Whereas the related sympathomimetic decongestant pseudoephedrine causes both vasoconstriction and increase of mucociliary clearance through its non-specific adrenergic activity, phenylephrine's selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonism causes vasoconstriction alone, resulting in a difference in their methods of action. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Phenylephrine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally. However, its absorption is incomplete and erratic. Because of extensive first-pass metabolism, phenylephrine has an oral bioavailability of only about 38% relative to intravenous administration. However, another source has stated that the bioavailability of phenylephrine is poorly documented and may actually be as low as 0.003%. The time to peak concentrations is 1.0 to 1.3 hours. ==== Distribution ==== The steady-state volume of distribution of phenylephrine is 340 L. Phenylephrine does not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence is a peripherally selective drug with no central nervous system activity. Its lack of blood-brain barrier permeability is related to its hydroxyl groups and high hydrophilicity. The lack of central permeation with phenylephrine is in contrast to certain other related decongestant and sympathomimetic agents like pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. ==== Metabolism ==== Phenylephrine is metabolized in the intestines and liver prior to reaching the systemic circulation when taken orally. It is extensively metabolized during first-pass metabolism due to susceptibility to monoamine oxidases, similarly to epinephrine. Phenylephrine is metabolized via oxidative deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B. In contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine, phenylephrine is not a catecholamine, and is not metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). Besides monoamine oxidase, phenylephrine is also metabolized by sulfation and glucuronidation conjugation. Non-oral routes of phenylephrine, like intranasal, ophthalmic, and parenteral, do not undergo first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract. The major metabolite of phenylephrine is meta-hydroxymandelic acid, which is inactive. Lesser metabolites of phenylephrine include sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are also inactive. Unlike phenylephrine, related sympathomimetics with a methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., amphetamines), like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, methoxamine, and methoxyphenamine, are resistant to degradation by monoamine oxidase. ==== Elimination ==== Phenylephrine is primarily excreted in urine. It is recovered 86% in urine. The drug is excreted in urine 3 to 16% unchanged, 57% as meta-hydroxymandelic acid, and 8% as sulfate conjugates. Glucuronide conjugates constitute a smaller portion of phenylephrine. Phenylephrine has a relatively short elimination half-life of 2.0 to 3.0 hours regardless of route of administration. Its lack of metabolism by COMT is said to be responsible for its much longer duration of action than related agents like norepinephrine. == Chemistry == Phenylephrine is a substituted phenethylamine and can also be referred to structurally as (R)-β,3-dihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine. It is closely structurally related to epinephrine (adrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine), differing from it only in the absence of one hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring. It is a chiral compound and is used as the enantiopure (R)-stereoisomer. The racemic form has not been formally named or used. Phenylephrine is the N-methylated derivative of norfenefrine (3,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine). The racemic N-ethyl analogue is etilefrine (ethylphenephrine). Synephrine (p-synephrine, oxedrine; 4,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a positional isomer of phenylephrine. In contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine), phenylephrine is not a catecholamine since it does not have two hydroxyl groups on its phenyl ring. Besides the catecholamines, the chemical structure of phenylephrine somewhat resembles that of amphetamine (α-methylphenethylamine). However, phenylephrine does not have a methyl group at the α carbon and hence is not an amphetamine itself. Phenylephrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C9H13NO2 and a molecular weight of 167.205 g/mol. It is a highly hydrophilic compound, with an experimental log P of -0.3. Phenylephrine is used medically almost always as the hydrochloride salt. However, the free base form and the tannate salt have also been used pharmaceutically to a much lesser extent. Pivenfrine is the 3-pivalate ester of phenylephrine and has much greater lipophilicity in comparison. == History == Phenylephrine was first patented in 1927 and was first introduced for medical use in 1938. == Society and culture == === Names === Phenylephrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt are phenylephrine hydrochloride. Synonyms of phenylephrine include phenephrine, fenefrine, L-m-synephrine, metaoxedrine, neo-oxedrine, mesatonum, neosynephrine, and m-sympatol. Brand names of phenylephrine include Neosynephrine or Neo-Synephrine and Sudafed PE, among numerous others. === Availability === Phenylephrine is available worldwide as a prescription drug in many different formulations. == References ==",Mezaton,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005049622268415987), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014201529324054718)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([vitainfo.uz](https://vitainfo.uz/uz/dori/mezaton?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title=""Mezaton (Мезатон) Batafsil ma'lumot - VITAinfo.uz"", type='url_citation', url='https://vitainfo.uz/uz/dori/mezaton?utm_source=openai')])"

Additionally, mangafodipir has been proposed for cardiovascular imaging. The primary metabolites of mangafodipir, manganese dipyridoxyl ethyldiamine (MnPLED) and its constituent dipyridoxyl diphosphate (Dp-dp) also known as fodipir, are pharmacologically active. However, whether they affect oxysterol-induced cytotoxicity is currently unknown. In this study, we examine whether the mangafodipir metabolite affects 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OH)-induced cell death and identify the underlying mechanisms. U937 cells were pretreated or not with mangafodipir substrate (Ms; 200 µm), MnPLED (100 µmol/l) or Dp-dp (100 µmol/l) for 8 h and then exposed to 7β-OH (28 µmol/l) for 18 h. Our results revealed that pretreatment with MnPLED or Dp-dp protected against 7β-OH-induced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis, and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). MnPLED and Dp-dp, in par with Ms, confer protection against 7β-OH-induced cytotoxicity by reducing cellular ROS and stabilization of the lysosomal membrane. These results suggest that fodipir is the pharmacologically active part in the structure of mangafodipir, which prevents 7β-OH-induced cell death by attenuating cellular ROS and by preventing LMP. In addition, MnPLED, which is the dephosphorylated product of fodipir, exerts a similar protective effect against 7β-OH-induced cytotoxicity. This result indicates that dephosphorylation of fodipir does not affect its pharmacological actions. Altogether our result confirms the cytoprotective effect of mangafodipir and justifies its potential use as a cytoprotective adjuvant.

Although Ginkgo biloba extract has a protective effect on DN, the protective effect and mechanism of its active ingredient Ginkgolide B (GB) on DN remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether GB improves DN via alleviating oxidative stress and ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4 ubiquitination in PA-G-induced mouse podocytes and DN mice. The study in vitro showed that GB effectively reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride concentrations and lipid accumulation in PA-G-induced MPC5 cells. In addition, GB promoted the expression of ferroptosis markers GPX4 and FTH1, while inhibited the expression of TfR1, fibrosis markers α-SMA and Collagen α1, as well as intracellular iron content and ROS levels. Interference of GPX4 expression with siRNA counteracted the effect of GB. And GB inhibited GPX4 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo the experimental results showed that GB effectively reduced hyperglycemia, serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, reduced urinary albumin excretion and the number of renal lipid droplets, and improved changes in renal structure in DN mice. GB inhibited the expression of ferroptosis marker TfR1 and fibrosis markers α-SMA and Collagen α1, while promoted the expression of ferroptosis markers GPX4 and FTH1. In conclusion, the results suggested that GB may improve DN via protecting the kidney from ferroptosis and oxidative stress damage by inhibiting the ubiquitination of GPX4. These findings suggested that GB, a natural medicine, may be an effective therapeutic option for DN. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of neuronal damage and death. Ginkgolide B (GB) has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects in various brain injury models. The aim of study was to investigate the potential role of GB in protecting against cerebral I/R injury and explore the underlying mechanisms. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) followed by reperfusion in order to trigger cerebral I/R injury. The rats were treated with different doses of GB, vehicle control or positive drug. Neurological function, infarct volume, and levels of ferroptosis markers were evaluated. In vitro experiments were performed using OGD/R-induced PC12 cells to further investigate the effects of GB on ferroptosis and its mechanisms. In addition, molecular docking, and microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay were conducted to explore the combination of GB and NCOA4. Reduced infarct volume and enhanced neurological function were signs of dose-dependent protection from cerebral I/R injury by GB therapy. Additionally, GB treatment had an impact on the levels of oxidative stress and ferroptosis markers, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and Fe Our findings suggest that GB may protect against cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting ferroptosis through disrupting NCOA4-FTH1 interaction. GB has potential therapeutic applications for cerebral I/R injury, and further investigation of the underlying mechanisms and clinical trials are warranted. The progressive deterioration of tissue-tissue crosstalk with aging causes a striking impairment of tissue homeostasis and functionality, particularly in the musculoskeletal system. Rejuvenation of the systemic and local milieu via interventions such as heterochronic parabiosis and exercise has been reported to improve musculoskeletal homeostasis in aged organisms. We have shown that Ginkgolide B (GB), a small molecule from Ginkgo biloba, improves bone homeostasis in aged mice by restoring local and systemic communication, implying a potential for maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis and enhancing regeneration. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of GB on skeletal muscle regeneration in aged mice. Muscle injury models were established by barium chloride induction into the hind limb of 20-month-old mice (aged mice) and into C2C12-derived myotubes. Therapeutic efficacy of daily administrated GB (12 mg/kg body weight) and osteocalcin (50 μg/kg body weight) on muscle regeneration was assessed by histochemical staining, gene expression, flow cytometry, ex vivo muscle function test and rotarod test. RNA sequencing was used to explore the mechanism of GB on muscle regeneration, with subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments validating these findings. GB administration in aged mice improved muscle regeneration (muscle mass, P = 0.0374; myofiber number/field, P = 0.0001; centre nucleus, embryonic myosin heavy chain-positive myofiber area, P = 0.0144), facilitated the recovery of muscle contractile properties (tetanic force, P = 0.0002; twitch force, P = 0.0005) and exercise performance (rotarod performance, P = 0.002), and reduced muscular fibrosis (collagen deposition, P < 0.0001) and inflammation (macrophage infiltration, P = 0.03). GB reversed the aging-related decrease in the expression of osteocalcin (P < 0.0001), an osteoblast-specific hormone, to promote muscle regeneration. Exogenous osteocalcin supplementation was sufficient to improve muscle regeneration (muscle mass, P = 0.0029; myofiber number/field, P < 0.0001), functional recovery (tetanic force, P = 0.0059; twitch force, P = 0.07; rotarod performance, P < 0.0001) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, P = 0.0316) in aged mice, without an increased risk of heterotopic ossification. GB treatment restored the bone-to-muscle endocrine axis to reverse aging-related declines in muscle regeneration and thus represents an innovative and practicable approach to managing muscle injuries. Our results revealed the critical and novel role of osteocalcin-GPRC6A-mediated bone-to-muscle communication in muscle regeneration, which provides a promising therapeutic avenue in functional muscle regeneration.",Ginkgolide b,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.4751526713371277), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.16023996472358704), (' FOOD', -0.00041148843592964113)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.040059030055999756), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -0.3869198262691498), ('ĠFOOD', -0.17351789772510529), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018188944086432457)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10044302046298981)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgolide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Ginkgolide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgolide?utm_source=openai')])"
3167,"('Eperisone (hydrochloride)', '(¬±)-eperisone hydrochloride', 'Eperisone', 'Eperisone [inn]', 'Eperisone (inn)')",Medical,"Eperisone (formulated as the eperisone hydrochloride salt) is an antispasmodic drug. Eperisone acts by relaxing both skeletal muscles and vascular smooth muscles, and demonstrates a variety of effects such as reduction of myotonia, improvement of circulation, and suppression of the pain reflex. The drug inhibits the vicious circle of myotonia by decreasing pain, ischaemia, and hypertonia in skeletal muscles, thus alleviating stiffness and spasticity, and facilitating muscle movement Eperisone also improves dizziness and tinnitus associated with cerebrovascular disorders or cervical spondylosis. Eperisone has a relatively low incidence of sedation when compared with other antispasmodic drugs; this simplifies the clinical application of the drug and makes it an attractive choice for patients who require antispasmodic therapy without a reduction in alertness. Eperisone also facilitates voluntary movement of the upper and lower extremities without reducing muscle power; it is therefore useful during the initial stage of rehabilitation and as a supporting drug during subsequent rehabilitative therapy. == Indications == Spastic paralysis in conditions such as cerebrovascular disease Spastic spinal paralysis Cervical spondylosis Postoperative sequelae (including from cerebrospinal tumour) Sequelae to trauma (e.g. spinal trauma or head injury) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Cerebral palsy Spinocerebellar degeneration Spinal vascular diseases and other encephalomyelopathies Cervical syndrome, periarthritis of the shoulder, and lumbago. == Presentation == Eperisone hydrochloride is available as the brand name preparations Myonal and Epry as 50 mg sugar-coated tablets, or as 10% granules for oral administration. An experimental form of the drug, as a transdermal patch system, has shown promising results in laboratory tests on rodents; however, this product is not currently available for human use. == Dosage and administration == In adults, the usual dose of eperisone is 50–150 mg per day, in divided doses, after meals. However, the dosage is adjusted by the prescribing clinician depending on factors such as severity of symptoms, patient age and response. Eperisone has not been established as definitely safe for paediatric use, therefore its use in paediatrics cannot be recommended without further study. If elderly patients are treated with eperisone, a reduced dose is recommended, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of physiological hypofunction during treatment. == Safety during pregnancy and breast-feeding == Eperisone has not been established to be safe for use by pregnant women; therefore the drug should not be used in pregnant women, or women who may be pregnant, if the expected therapeutic benefits will outweigh the possible risks associated with treatment. The manufacturers of Myonal recommend the drug not be used during lactation (breast-feeding). If eperisone must be used, the patient is advised to stop breast-feeding for the duration of treatment. Eperisone has been reported to be excreted in breast milk in an animal study (in rats). == Pharmacology == Skeletal muscle relaxation Relaxation of hypertonic skeletal muscles Improves intramuscular blood flow Suppression of spinal reflex potentials Reduction of muscle spindle sensitivity via motor neurons Vasodilatation and augmentation of blood flow Analgesic action and inhibition of the pain reflex in the spinal cord == Contraindications == Eperisone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Side effects: 'very rare' excessive relaxation, stomachache, nausea, vertigo, anorexia, drowsiness, skin rashes, diarrhoea, vomiting, indigestion, GI disturbances, insomnia, headache, constipation etc. == Cautions == Eperisone should be administered with care in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any medication, or with disorders of liver function (it may aggravate hepatic dysfunction). Weakness, light-headedness, sleepiness or other symptoms may occur. In the event of such symptoms, the dosage should be reduced or treatment discontinued. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a car. == Side effects == Shock and anaphylactoid reactions: In the event of symptoms such as redness, itching, urticaria, oedema of the face and other parts of the body, dyspnoea, etc., treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken. Other side effects: anaemia, rash, pruritus, sleepiness, insomnia, headache, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, urinary retention or incontinence. == Drug interactions == There have been reports of disturbances in ocular accommodation occurring after the concomitant use of the related drug tolperisone hydrochloride and methocarbamol. == Safety in overdose == Seizures have been reported in an infant after accidental ingestion of eperisone. == Future developments == Eperisone suffers from a very low bioavailability when taken orally, as a result of high first pass intestinal metabolism; a transdermal patch containing eperisone is currently in development in South Korea. This has shown promise, with the antispasmodic effect lasting over 24 hours, compared to one to two hours following oral administration.

However, the involvement of AS in the differentiation and functions of osteoclasts and the effect of AS in treating patients with osteoporosis is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate if AS inhibits the differentiation of osteoclasts and resorption of the bones induced by M-CSF and RANKL. Next, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of AS on bone loss in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis mice models. We stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages with an osteoclast differentiation medium containing different AS concentrations for 6 days or 5μM AS at different times. Next, we performed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, bone resorption assay, F-actin ring fluorescence, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting (WB). Next, MC3T3-E1s (pre-osteoblast cells) were differentiated to osteoblast by stimulating the cells with varying AS concentrations. Next, we performed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, RT-qPCR, and WB on these cells. We established an OVX-induced osteoporosis mice model and treated the mice with 20mg/kg of AS. Finally, we extracted the femurs and performed micro-CT scanning, H&E, and TRAP staining. AS inhibits the formation of osteoclasts and resorption of bone triggered by RANKL by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Using the phoA gene and phoA fusions to monitor expression in these vectors, we show that the ratio of induction/repression can be 1,200-fold, compared with 50-fold for PTAC-based vectors. phoA expression can be modulated over a wide range of inducer (arabinose) concentrations and reduced to extremely low levels by the presence of glucose, which represses expression. Also, the kinetics of induction and repression are very rapid and significantly affected by the ara allele in the host strain. Thus, the use of this system which can be efficiently and rapidly turned on and off allows the study of important aspects of bacterial physiology in a very simple manner and without changes of temperature. We have exploited the tight regulation of the PBAD promoter to study the phenotypes of null mutations of essential genes and explored the use of pBAD vectors as an expression system. CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1), a pivotal synaptonuclear messenger, regulates synaptic plasticity and transmission to prevent depression. Despite exhaustive investigations into CRTC1 mRNA reductions in the depressed mice, the regulatory mechanisms governing its transcription remain elusive. Consequently, exploring rapid but non-toxic CRTC1 inducers at the transcriptional level is important for resisting depression. Here, we demonstrate the potential of D-arabinose, a unique monosaccharide prevalent in edible-medicinal plants, to rapidly enter the brain and induce CRTC1 expression, thereby eliciting rapid-acting and persistent antidepressant responses in chronic restrain stress (CRS)-induced depressed mice. Mechanistically, D-arabinose induces the expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and transcription factor EB (TFEB), thereby activating CRTC1 transcription. Notably, we elucidate the pivotal role of the acetyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2) as an obligatory mediator for PPARγ and TFEB to potentiate CRTC1 transcription. Furthermore, D-arabinose augments ACSS2-dependent CRTC1 transcription by activating AMPK through lysosomal AXIN-LKB1 pathway. Correspondingly, the hippocampal down-regulations of ACSS2, PPARγ or TFEB alone failed to reverse CRTC1 reductions in CRS-exposure mice, ultimately abolishing the anti-depressant efficacy of D-arabinose. In summary, our study unveils a previously unexplored role of D-arabinose in activating the ACSS2-PPARγ/TFEB-CRTC1 axis, presenting it as a promising avenue for the prevention and treatment of depression.
