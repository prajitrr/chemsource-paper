993,"('Atorvastatin', 'Cardyl', 'Lipitor', 'Torvast', 'Rel-atorvastatin')",Medical,"Atorvastatin, sold under the brand name Lipitor among others, is a statin medication used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and to treat abnormal lipid levels. For the prevention of cardiovascular disease, statins are a first-line treatment in reducing cholesterol. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include joint pain, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, atorvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol. Atorvastatin was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 109 million prescriptions filled for over 27 million people. In Australia, it was one of the top ten most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == The primary uses of atorvastatin are for the treatment of dyslipidemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. === Dyslipidemia === Hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb) to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, apo-B, triglycerides levels, and CRP as well as increase HDL levels. Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in children Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia Hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson Type IV) Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) Combined hyperlipidemia === Cardiovascular disease === Primary prevention of heart attack, stroke, and need for revascularization procedures in people who have risk factors such as age, smoking, high blood pressure, low HDL-C, and a family history of early heart disease, but have not yet developed evidence of coronary artery disease. Secondary prevention of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major coronary events, ischaemic heart disease and revascularization in people with established coronary artery disease. The effect is dose dependent and is amplified at higher doses. Close monitoring of liver function tests is required when high doses is used. Myocardial infarction and stroke prevention in people with type 2 diabetes A 2014 meta-analysis showed high-dose statin therapy was significantly superior compared to moderate or low-intensity statin therapy in reducing plaque volume in people with acute coronary syndrome. The SATURN trial, which compared the effects of high-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, also confirmed these findings. === Kidney disease === There is evidence from systematic review and meta-analyses that statins, particularly atorvastatin, reduce both decline in kidney function (eGFR) and the severity of protein excretion in urine, with higher doses having greater effect. Data are conflicting for whether statins reduce risk of kidney failure. Statins, including atorvastatin, before heart surgery do not prevent acute kidney injury. Prior to contrast medium (CM) administration, pre-treatment with atorvastatin therapy can reduce the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in people with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m2) who undergo interventional procedures such as cardiac catheterisation, coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A meta-analysis of 21 RCTs confirmed that high dose (80 mg) atorvastatin therapy is more effective than regular dose or low dose statin therapy at preventing CI-AKI. Atorvastatin therapy can also help to prevent in-hospital dialysis post CM administration, however there is no evidence that it reduces all-cause mortality associated with CI-AKI. Overall, the evidence concludes that statin therapy, irrespective of the dose, is still more effective than no treatment or placebo at reducing the risk of CI-AKI. === Administration === Statins (predominantly simvastatin) have been evaluated in clinical trials in combination with fibrates to manage dyslipidemia in people who also have type 2 diabetes, and a high cardiovascular disease risk; however, there is limited clinical benefit noted for most cardiovascular outcomes. Statins with shorter half-lives are more effective when taken in the evening, so their peak effect occurs when the body's natural cholesterol production is at its highest. A recent meta-analysis suggested that statins with longer half-lives, including atorvastatin, may also be more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol if taken in the evening. However, the only study included in the meta-analysis of atorvastatin in people with heart disease did not specifically investigate if morning or evening dosing was more effective for reducing LDL cholesterol. The trial did confirm that, irrespective of dosing time, atorvastatin is very effective at reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Hence, atorvastatin should be taken at the same time each day, at a time that is most convenient for the patient, so it does not compromise compliance. === Specific populations === Geriatric: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in healthy elderly subjects are higher than those in young adults. However, clinical data suggests there is a similar reduction of LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events at any dose in this population and adults younger than 65 years of age. Pediatric: Pharmacokinetic data is not available for this population. Gender: Plasma concentrations are generally higher in women than in men, but there is no clinically significant difference in the extent of LDL reduction between men and women. Kidney impairment: Kidney disease has no statistically significant influence on plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and dose adjustment considerations should only be made in context of the patient's overall health. Hemodialysis: Although there has been moderate-to-high quality of evidence to show the lack of clear and significant clinical benefits of statins (including atorvastatin at a dose of 20mg) minimizing non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality in adults on hemodialysis (including those with diabetes and/or pre-existing cardiovascular diseases) despite the clinically relevant reduction in total/LDL cholesterol levels, there is evidence that people undergoing hemodialysis who received moderate intensity statin therapy had a lower risk of all-cause mortality. However, data (post hoc analysis) on atorvastatin has revealed that it may still be beneficial in reducing combined cardiac events, cardiac and all-cause mortality in those with a higher baseline LDL cholesterol >3.75 mmol/L. While the SHARP study suggested that LDL cholesterol-lowering treatments (e.g. statin/ezetimibe combination) are effective in reducing the risks of major atherosclerotic events in people with CKD including those on dialysis, the subgroup analysis of the people undergoing hemodialysis had revealed no significant benefits. Whether or not hemodialysis has any impact on the statin levels was not specifically addressed in these major trials. Liver impairment: Increased drug levels can be seen in people with advanced cirrhosis. Despite these concerns, a 2017 systematic review and analysis of available evidence has shown that statins, such as atorvastatin, are relatively safe to use in stable, asymptomatic cirrhosis and may even reduce the risk of liver disease progression and death. == Contraindications == Active liver disease: cholestasis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatitis, and jaundice Pregnancy: Atorvastatin is unlikely to cause fetal anomalies but may be associated with low birth weight and preterm labor. Breastfeeding: Small amounts of other statin medications have been found to pass into breast milk, although atorvastatin has not been studied specifically. Due to risk of disrupting a breastfeeding infant's metabolism of lipids, atorvastatin is not regarded as compatible with breastfeeding. Markedly elevated CPK levels or if a myopathy is suspected or diagnosed after dosing of atorvastatin has begun. Very rarely, atorvastatin may cause rhabdomyolysis, and it may be very serious leading to acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria. When rhabdomyolysis is suspected or diagnosed, atorvastatin therapy is discontinued immediately. The likelihood of developing a myopathy is increased by the co-administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, and azole antifungals. == Side effects == === Major === Type 2 diabetes is observed in a small number of people, and is an uncommon class effect of all statins. It appears it may be more likely in people who were already at a higher risk of developing diabetes before starting a statin due to multiple risk factors, for example raised fasting glucose levels. However, the benefits of statin therapy in preventing fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal coronary heart disease, and non-fatal myocardial infarction are significant. For most people the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of developing diabetes. A 2010 meta-analysis demonstrated that every 255 people treated with a statin for four years produced a reduction of 5.4 major coronary events and induced only one new case of diabetes. In some case and clinical studies mild muscle pain or weakness have been reported (around 3%), compared to a placebo. However, this increase was not related to statin therapy in 90% of cases in a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. In patients taking higher statin doses, a similarly low increase in muscle pain and weakness was present (5%) with no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship. Duration of treatment with atorvastatin is unlikely to increase the risk of muscle-related side effects as most occur within the first year of treatment, after which the risk is not increased further. The known cardiovascular benefits of atorvastatin over time outweigh the low risk of muscle-related side effects. Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is rare, occurring in less than 0.1% of people who take statins. Statin induced rhabdomyolysis, as with other statin associated muscle symptoms, occurs most commonly in the first year of treatment but can occur at any time during treatment. Risk factors for statin induced rhabdomyolysis include older age, renal impairment, high dose statins and use of medications that reduce the breakdown of statins (such as CYP3A4 inhibitors) or fibrates. Persistent liver enzyme abnormalities (usually elevated in hepatic transaminases) have been documented. Elevations threefold greater than normal were recorded in 0.5% of people treated with atorvastatin 10 mg-80 mg rather than placebo. Usage instructions in package inserts for this statin define the requirement that hepatic function be assessed with laboratory tests before beginning atorvastatin treatment and repeated periodically as clinically indicated - usually a clinicians' judgement. Package inserts for this statin recommend actions should liver abnormalities be detected. Ultimately, this is the judgment of the prescribing physician. === Common === The following have been shown to occur in 1–10% of people taking atorvastatin in clinical trials: Joint pain Loose stools Indigestion Muscle pain Nausea === Other === muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness lack of energy or extreme tiredness and weakness fever chest pain unusual bleeding or bruising loss of appetite pain in the upper right part of the stomach flu-like symptoms dark colored urine yellowing of the skin or eyes rash hives itching difficulty breathing or swallowing swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs hoarseness ==== Increased fasting blood glucose ==== Atorvastatin has been associated with a small increase in fasting blood glucose levels over a 2-year period, particularly in patients with Type 2 Diabetes, however evidence is conflicting and clinical significance of this increase has not been determined. Regular blood glucose monitoring may be advised in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. ==== Cognitive ==== There have been rare reports of reversible memory loss and confusion with all statins, including atorvastatin; however, there has not been enough evidence to associate statin use with cognitive impairment, and the risks for cognition are likely outweighed by the beneficial effects of adherence to statin therapy on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. ==== Pancreatitis ==== A 2012 meta-analysis found that statin therapy might reduce the risk of pancreatitis in people with normal or mildly elevated blood triglyceride levels. ==== Erectile dysfunction ==== Statins seem to have a positive effect on erectile dysfunction. === Interactions === Fibrates are a class of drugs that can be used for severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidaemia in combination with statins or as monotherapy. While studies have suggested that the combined use of statins and the fibrate drug class (such as gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, there is insufficient evidence to firmly establish this association with atorvastatin. Co-administration of atorvastatin with one of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely to happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin. Antacids can rarely decrease the plasma concentrations of statin medications, but do not affect the LDL-C-lowering efficacy. Niacin also is proved to increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Some statins may also alter the concentrations of other medications, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. The increase in digoxin levels due to atorvastatin is a 1.2 fold elevation in the area under the curve (AUC), resulting in a minor drug-drug interaction. The American Heart Association states that the combination of digoxin and atorvastatin is reasonable. In contrast to some other statins, atorvastatin does not interact with warfarin concentrations in a clinically meaningful way (similar to pitavastatin). Vitamin D supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations, yet synergistically reduces LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. Grapefruit juice components are known inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4. Drinking grapefruit juice with atorvastatin may cause an increase in Cmax and area under the curve (AUC). This finding initially gave rise to concerns of toxicity, and in 2000, it was recommended that people taking atorvastatin should not consume grapefruit juice ""in an unsupervised manner."" Small studies (using mostly young participants) examining the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on mainly lower doses of atorvastatin have shown that grapefruit juice increases blood levels of atorvastatin, which could increase the risk of adverse effects. No studies assessing the impact of grapefruit juice consumption have included participants taking the highest dose of atorvastatin (80 mg daily), which is often prescribed for people with a history of cardiovascular disease (such as heart attack or ischaemic stroke) or in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. People taking atorvastatin should consult with their doctor or pharmacist before consuming grapefruit juice, as the effects of grapefruit juice consumption on atorvastatin will vary according to factors such as the amount and frequency of juice consumption in addition to differences in juice components, quality and method of juice preparation between different batches or brands. A few cases of myopathy have been reported when atorvastatin is given with colchicine. == Mechanism of action == As with other statins, atorvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Unlike most others, however, it is a completely synthetic compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, which is the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases de novo cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL receptors) on hepatocytes. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of triglycerides and slightly increases levels of HDL-cholesterol. In people with acute coronary syndrome, high-dose atorvastatin treatment may play a plaque-stabilizing role. At high doses, statins have anti-inflammatory effects, incite reduction of the necrotic plaque core, and improve endothelial function, leading to plaque stabilization and, sometimes, plaque regression. There is a similar thought process with using high-dose atorvastatin as a form of secondary thrombotic stroke recurrence prevention. === Pharmacodynamics === The liver is the primary site of action of atorvastatin, as this is the principal site of both cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. It is the dosage of atorvastatin, rather than systemic medication concentration, which correlates with extent of LDL-C reduction. In a Cochrane systematic review the dose-related magnitude of atorvastatin on blood lipids was determined. Over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/day total cholesterol was reduced by 27.0% to 37.9%, LDL cholesterol by 37.1% to 51.7% and triglycerides by 18.0% to 28.3%. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Atorvastatin undergoes rapid absorption when taken orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1–2 h. The absolute bioavailability of the medication is about 14%, but the systemic availability for HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and first-pass metabolism, which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in Cmax (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in AUC (extent of absorption), although food does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the Cmax and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. === Distribution === The mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 L. It is highly protein bound (≥98%), and studies have shown it is likely secreted in human breastmilk. === Metabolism === Atorvastatin metabolism is primarily through cytochrome P450 3A4 hydroxylation to form active ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites, as well as various beta-oxidation metabolites. The ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites are responsible for 70% of systemic HMG-CoA reductase activity. The ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further metabolism via glucuronidation. As a substrate for the CYP3A4 isozyme, it has shown susceptibility to inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to produce increased or decreased plasma concentrations, respectively. This interaction was tested in vitro with concurrent administration of erythromycin, a known CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitor, which resulted in increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. It is also an inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4. === Excretion === Atorvastatin is primarily eliminated via hepatic biliary excretion, with less than 2% recovered in the urine. Bile elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There does not appear to be any entero-hepatic recirculation. Atorvastatin has an approximate elimination half-life of 14 hours. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 hours, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. Atorvastatin is also a substrate of the intestinal P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, which pumps the medication back into the intestinal lumen during medication absorption. In hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are significantly affected by concurrent liver disease. People with Child-Pugh Stage A liver disease show a four-fold increase in both Cmax and AUC. People with Child Pugh stage B liver disease show a 16-fold increase in Cmax and an 11-fold increase in AUC. Geriatric people (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin compared to young adults, with mean AUC and Cmax values that are 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly people show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses. == Pharmacogenetics == Several genetic polymorphisms may be linked to an increase in statin-related side effects with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLCO1B1 gene showing a 45 fold higher incidence of statin related myopathy than people without the polymorphism. There are several studies showing genetic variants and variable response to atorvastatin. The polymorphisms that showed genome wide significance in Caucasian population were the SNPs in the apoE region; rs445925, rs7412, rs429358 and rs4420638 which showed variable LDL-c response depending on the genotype when treated with atorvastatin. Another genetic variant that showed genome wide significance in Caucasians was the SNP rs10455872 in the LPA gene that lead to higher Lp(a) levels which cause an apparent lower LDL-c response to atorvastatin. These studies were in Caucasian population, more research with a large cohort need to be conducted in different ethnicities to identify more polymorphisms that can affect atorvastatin pharmacokinetics and treatment response. == Chemical synthesis == The first synthesis of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis that occurred during drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry of the first of the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product. The atorvastatin calcium complex involves two atorvastatin ions, one calcium ion and three water molecules. == History == Bruce Roth, who was hired by Warner-Lambert as a chemist in 1982, had synthesized an ""experimental compound"" codenamed CI 981 – later called atorvastatin. It was first made in August 1985. Warner-Lambert management was concerned that atorvastatin was a me-too version of rival Merck & Co.'s orphan drug lovastatin (brand name Mevacor). Mevacor, which was first marketed in 1987, was the industry's first statin and Merck's synthetic version – simvastatin – was in the advanced stages of development. Nevertheless, Bruce Roth and his bosses, Roger Newton and Ronald Cresswell, in 1985, convinced company executives to move the compound into expensive clinical trials. Early results comparing atorvastatin to simvastatin demonstrated that atorvastatin appeared more potent and with fewer side effects. In 1994, the findings of a Merck-funded study were published in The Lancet concluding the efficacy of statins in lowering cholesterol proving for the first time not only that a ""statin reduced 'bad' LDL cholesterol but also that it led to a sharp drop in fatal heart attacks among people with heart disease."" In 1996, Warner-Lambert entered into a co-marketing agreement with Pfizer to sell Lipitor, and in 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $90.2 billion. Lipitor was on the market by 1996. By 2003, Lipitor had become the best selling pharmaceutical in the United States. From 1996 to 2012, under the trade name Lipitor, atorvastatin became the world's best-selling medication of all time, with more than $125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years. and $13 billion a year at its peak, Lipitor alone ""provided up to a quarter of Pfizer Inc.'s annual revenue for years."" Pfizer's patent on atorvastatin expired in November 2011. == Society and culture == === Economics === Atorvastatin is relatively inexpensive. Under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, health plans may cover the costs of atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg for adults aged 40–75 years based on United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Some plans only cover other statins. === Brand names === Atorvastatin calcium tablets are sold under the brand name Lipitor. Pfizer also packages the medication in combination with other medications, such as atorvastatin/amlodipine. Pfizer's U.S. patent on Lipitor expired on 30 November 2011. Initially, generic atorvastatin was manufactured only by Watson Pharmaceuticals and India's Ranbaxy Laboratories. Prices for the generic version did not drop to the level of other generics—$10 or less for a month's supply—until other manufacturers began to supply the medication in May 2012. In other countries, atorvastatin calcium is made in tablet form by generic medication makers under various brand names including Atoris, Atorlip, Atorva, Atorvastatin Teva, Atorvastatina Parke-Davis, Avas, Cardyl, Liprimar, Litorva, Mactor, Orbeos, Prevencor, Sortis, Stator, Tahor, Torid, Torvacard, Torvast, Totalip, Tulip, Xarator, and Zarator. Pfizer also makes its own generic version under the name Zarator. In the US, Lipitor is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Medication recalls === On 9 November 2012, Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. voluntarily recalled 10-, 20- and 40-mg doses of its generic version of atorvastatin in the United States. The lots of atorvastatin, packaged in bottles of 90 and 500 tablets, were recalled due to possible contamination with very small glass particles similar to the size of a grain of sand (less than 1 mm in size). The FDA received no reports of injury from the contamination. Ranbaxy also issued recalls of bottles of 10-milligram tablets in August 2012 and March 2014, due to concerns that the bottles might contain larger, 20-milligram tablets and thus cause potential dosing errors. == References == == Further reading ==",Torvast,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00033206192892976105), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00200820853933692)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16022422909736633), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([trademarkelite.com](https://www.trademarkelite.com/europe/trademark/trademark-detail/002955169/TORVAST?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=133, start_index=9, title='TORVAST Trademark of Upjohn Manufacturing Ireland Unlimited Company.

994,"('Blonanserin', 'Lonasen', 'Ad 5423', 'Blonanserin (lonasen)', 'Blonanserin [inn]')",Medical,"Blonanserin, sold under the brand name Lonasen, is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic (approved by PMDA in January 2008) commercialized by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in Japan and Korea for the treatment of schizophrenia. Relative to many other antipsychotics, blonanserin has an improved tolerability profile, lacking side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, excessive sedation, or hypotension. As with many second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics it is significantly more efficacious in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics such as haloperidol. == Medical uses == Blonanserin is used to treat schizophrenia in Japan and South Korea but not in the US. == Adverse effects == As with many of the atypical antipsychotics, blonanserin can elicit cardio metabolic risks. While the side effects of blonanserin – such as weight gain, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, glucose levels and other blood lipid levels – do not differ greatly from other atypical antipsychotics, the specificity of blonanserin appears to elicit milder side effects, with less weight gain in particular. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Blonanserin acts as a mixed 5-HT2A (Ki = 0.812 nM) and D2 receptor (Ki = 0.142 nM) antagonist and also exerts some blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 26.7 nM). Blonanserin also shows significant affinity for the D3 receptor (Ki = 0.494 nM). It lacks significant affinity for numerous other sites including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3, D1, α2-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, H1, and mACh receptors and the monoamine transporters, though it does possess low affinity for the sigma receptor (IC50 = 286 nM). Blonanserin has a relatively high affinity towards the 5-HT6 receptor perhaps underpinning its recently unveiled efficacy in treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The efficacy of blonanserin can in part be attributed to its chemical structure, which is unique from those of other atypical antipsychotics. Specifically, the addition of hydroxyl groups to blonanserin's unique eight membered ring results in the (R) stereoisomer of the compound demonstrating increased affinity for the indicated targets. * Towards human receptors unless otherwise specified. ==== Action at the Dopamine-D3 receptor ==== Blonanserin has antagonistic action at dopamine-D3 receptors that potentiates phosphorylation levels of Protein kinase A (PKA) and counteracts decreased activity at the dopamine-D1 and/or NMDA receptors, thus potentiating GABA induced Cl- currents. Olanzapine does not appear to affect PKA activity. Many antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone and olanzapine primarily antagonize serotonin 5-HT2A and dopamine-D2 receptors and lack known action at dopamine-D2/3 receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Blonanserin is administered 4 mg orally twice a day or 8 mg once a day, for an adult male with a body mass index between 19–24 kg/m2 and a body weight equal to or greater than 50 kg. The drug is absorbed by a two compartment (central and peripheral) model with first-order absorption and elimination. The half-life of blonanserin is dependent on the dose. A single dose of 4 mg has a half-life of 7.7 ± 4.63 h and a single dose of 8 mg has a half-life of 11.9 ± 4.3 h. The increase of half-life with dose is possibly attributed to there being more individual concentration per time points below the lower limit necessary for quantification in the lower single dose. Blonanserin is not a charged compound and exhibits very little chemical polarity. The polar surface area of Blonanserin is 19.7 Å It is commonly accepted that a compound needs to have polar surface area less than 90 Å to cross the blood brain barrier so blonanserin is expected to be quite permeable as is demonstrated by a high brain/ plasma ratio of 3.88. Due to the good permeability of blonanserin, the volume of distribution in the central nervous system is greater than that in the periphery (Vd central = 9500 L, Vd periphery = 8650 L) although it is slower to absorb into the central compartment. Blonanserin does not meet the criteria in Lipinski's rule of five. ==== Effects of food intake ==== Food intake slows the absorption of blonanserin and increases the bioavailability peripherally relative to centrally. Single fasting doses are safe and the effects of feeding intake are possibly explained by an interaction between blonanserin and cytochrome P450 3A4 in the gut. == See also == Dopamine receptor D3 Lipinski's rule of five == References ==",Lonasen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4543427823809907e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002640137099660933)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In animal studies, siramesine has been shown to produce anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. It was developed by the pharmaceutical company H Lundbeck for the treatment of anxiety, although development was discontinued after clinical trials showed a lack of efficacy in humans.

997,"('Nilutamide', 'Nilandron', 'Ru 23908', 'Anandron', 'Nilutamida')",Medical,"Nilutamide, sold under the brand names Nilandron and Anandron, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer. It has also been studied as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women and to treat acne and seborrhea in women. It is taken by mouth. Side effects in men include breast tenderness and enlargement, feminization, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes. Nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, alcohol intolerance, elevated liver enzymes, and lung disease can occur in both sexes. Rarely, nilutamide can cause respiratory failure and liver damage. These unfavorable side effects, along with a number of associated cases of death, have limited the use of nilutamide. Nilutamide acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), preventing the effects of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body. Because most prostate cancer cells rely on these hormones for growth and survival, nilutamide can slow the progression of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease. Nilutamide was discovered in 1977 and was first introduced for medical use in 1987. It became available in the United States in 1996. The drug has largely been replaced by newer and improved NSAAs, namely bicalutamide and enzalutamide, due to their better efficacy, tolerability, and safety, and is now rarely used. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Prostate cancer === Nilutamide is used in prostate cancer in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue at a dosage of 300 mg/day (150 mg twice daily) for the first 4 weeks of treatment, and 150 mg/day thereafter. It is not indicated as a monotherapy in prostate cancer. Only one small non-comparative study has assessed nilutamide as a monotherapy in prostate cancer. Nilutamide has been used to prevent the effects of the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. === Transgender hormone therapy === Nilutamide has been studied for use as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It has been assessed in at least five small clinical studies for this purpose in treatment-naive subjects. In these studies, nilutamide monotherapy at a dosage of 300 mg/day, induced observable signs of clinical feminization in young transgender women (age range 19–33 years) within 8 weeks, including breast development, decreased body hair (though not facial hair), decreased morning erections and sex drive, and positive psychological and emotional changes. Signs of breast development occurred in all subjects within 6 weeks and were associated with increased nipple sensitivity, and along with decreased hair growth, were the earliest sign of feminization. Nilutamide did not change the size of the prostate gland (which is the same as with high-dosage cyproterone acetate and ethinylestradiol treatment for as long as 18 months), but was found to alter its histology, including increased stromal tissue with a significant reduction in acini and atrophic epithelial cells, indicating glandular atrophy. In addition, readily apparent histological changes were observed in the testes, including a reduction in tubular and interstitial cells. Nilutamide was found to more than double luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels and to triple estradiol levels. In contrast, follicle-stimulating hormone levels remained unchanged. A slight but significant increase in prolactin levels was observed, and levels of sex hormone-binding globulin increased as well. The addition of ethinylestradiol to nilutamide therapy after 8 weeks abolished the increase in LH, testosterone, and estradiol levels and dramatically suppressed testosterone levels, into the castrate range. Both nilutamide alone and the combination of nilutamide and estrogen were regarded as resulting in effective and favorable antiandrogen action and feminization in transgender women. === Skin conditions === Nilutamide has been assessed in the treatment of acne and seborrhea in women in at least one small clinical study. The dosage used was 200 mg/day, and in the study, ""seborrhea and acne decreased markedly within the first month and practically disappeared after 2 months of [nilutamide] treatment."" === Available forms === Nilutamide is available in the form of 50 and 150 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == General side effects of NSAAs, including nilutamide, include gynecomastia, breast pain/tenderness, hot flashes (67%), depression, fatigue, sexual dysfunction (including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction), decreased muscle mass, and decreased bone mass with an associated increase in fractures. Also, nausea (24–27%), vomiting, constipation (20%), and insomnia (16%) may occur with nilutamide. Nilutamide monotherapy is known to eventually induce gynecomastia in 40 to 80% of men treated with it for prostate cancer, usually within 6 to 9 months of treatment initiation. Relative to other NSAAs, nilutamide has been uniquely associated with mild and reversible visual disturbances (31–58%) including delayed ocular adaptation to darkness and impaired color vision, a disulfiram-like alcohol intolerance (19%), interstitial pneumonitis (0.77–2.4%) (which can result in dyspnea (1%) as a secondary effect and can progress to pulmonary fibrosis), and hepatitis (1%), and has a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting compared to other NSAAs. The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with nilutamide has been found to be much higher in Japanese patients (12.6%), warranting particular caution in Asian individuals. There is a case report of simultaneous liver and lung toxicity in a nilutamide-treated patient. There is also a risk of hepatotoxicity with nilutamide, though occurrence is very rare and the risk is significantly less than with flutamide. The incidence of abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated liver enzymes) has been variously reported as 2 to 33% with nilutamide. For comparison, the risk of elevated liver enzymes has been reported as 4 to 62% in the case of flutamide. The risk of hepatotoxicity with nilutamide has been described as far less than with flutamide. Fulminant hepatic failure has been reported for nilutamide, with fatal outcome. Between 1986 and 2003, the numbers of published cases of hepatotoxicity for antiandrogens totaled 46 for flutamide, 21 for cyproterone acetate, 4 for nilutamide, and 1 for bicalutamide. Similarly to flutamide, nilutamide exhibits mitochondrial toxicity in hepatocytes by inhibiting respiratory complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) (though not respiratory complexes II, III, or IV) in the electron transport chain, resulting in reduced ATP and glutathione production and thus decreased hepatocyte survival. The nitro group of nilutamide has been theorized to be involved in both its hepatotoxicity and its pulmonary toxicity. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Nilutamide acts as a selective competitive silent antagonist of the AR (IC50 = 412 nM), which prevents androgens like testosterone and DHT from activating the receptor. The affinity of nilutamide for the AR is about 1 to 4% of that of testosterone and is similar to that of bicalutamide and 2-hydroxyflutamide. Similarly to 2-hydroxyflutamide, but unlike bicalutamide, nilutamide is able to weakly activate the AR at high concentrations. It does not inhibit 5α-reductase. Like other NSAAs such as flutamide and bicalutamide, nilutamide, without concomitant GnRH analogue therapy, increases serum androgen (by two-fold in the case of testosterone), estrogen, and prolactin levels due to inhibition of AR-mediated suppression of steroidogenesis via negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. As such, though nilutamide is still effective as an antiandrogen as a monotherapy, it is given in combination with a GnRH analogue such as leuprorelin in prostate cancer to suppress androgen concentrations to castrate levels in order to attain maximal androgen blockade (MAB). Like flutamide and bicalutamide, nilutamide is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and has central antiandrogen actions. ==== Cytochrome P450 inhibition ==== Nilutamide is known to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, and can result in increased levels of medications that are metabolized by these enzymes. It has also been found to inhibit the enzyme CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) in vitro and thus the biosynthesis of androgens. However, nilutamide monotherapy significantly increases testosterone levels in vivo, so the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. === Pharmacokinetics === Nilutamide has an elimination half-life of 23 to 87 hours, with a mean of 56 hours, or about two days; this allows for once-daily administration. Steady state (plateau) levels of the drug are attained after two weeks of administration with a dosage of 150 mg twice daily (300 mg/day total). It is metabolized by CYP2C19, with at least five metabolites. Virtually all of the antiandrogenic activity of nilutamide comes from the parent drug (as opposed to metabolites). == Chemistry == Nilutamide is structurally related to the first-generation NSAAs flutamide and bicalutamide as well as to the second-generation NSAAs enzalutamide and apalutamide. == History == Nilutamide was developed by Roussel and was first described in 1977. It was first introduced for medical use in 1987 in France and was the second NSAA to be marketed, with flutamide preceding it and bicalutamide following it in 1995. It was not introduced until 1996 in the United States. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nilutamide is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. === Brand names === Nilutamide is marketed under the brand name Nilandron in the United States and under the brand name Anandron elsewhere in the world such as in Australia, Canada, Europe, and Latin America. === Availability === Nilutamide is or has been available in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Latin America, Egypt, and Lebanon. In Europe, it is or has been available in Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. in Latin America, it is or has been available in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. == Research == The combination of an estrogen and nilutamide as a form of combined androgen blockade for the treatment of prostate cancer has been studied in animals.

1001,"('Hydroxychloroquine sulfate', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Plaquenil', 'Oxichloroquine', 'Hidroxicloroquina')",Medical,"Hydroxychloroquine, sold under the brand name Plaquenil among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat malaria in areas where malaria remains sensitive to chloroquine. Other uses include treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and porphyria cutanea tarda. It is taken by mouth, often in the form of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Common side effects may include vomiting, headache, blurred vision, and muscle weakness. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, retinopathy, and irregular heart rate. Although all risk cannot be excluded, it remains a treatment for rheumatic disease during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine is in the antimalarial and 4-aminoquinoline families of medication. Hydroxychloroquine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 112th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. Hydroxychloroquine has been studied for an ability to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but clinical trials found it ineffective for this purpose and a possible risk of dangerous side effects. Among studies that deemed hydroxychloroquine intake to cause harmful side effects, a publication by The Lancet was retracted due to data flaws. The speculative use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 threatens its availability for people with established indications. == Medical uses == Hydroxychloroquine treats rheumatic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and porphyria cutanea tarda, and certain infections such as Q fever and certain types of malaria. It is considered the first-line treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Certain types of malaria, resistant strains, and complicated cases require different or additional medication. It is widely used to treat primary Sjögren syndrome but does not appear to be effective. Hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of post-Lyme arthritis. It may have both an anti-spirochete activity and an anti-inflammatory activity, similar to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. == Contraindications == The US FDA drug label advises that hydroxychloroquine should not be prescribed to individuals with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. There are several other contraindications, and caution is required if the person considered for treatment has certain heart conditions, diabetes, or psoriasis. == Adverse effects == Hydroxychloroquine has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning there is little difference between toxic and therapeutic doses. The most common adverse effects are nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea. Other common adverse effects include itching and headache. The most serious adverse effects affect the eye, with dose-related retinopathy as a concern even after hydroxychloroquine use is discontinued. Serious reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine use include agitation, mania, difficulty sleeping, hallucinations, psychosis, catatonia, paranoia, depression, and suicidal thoughts. In rare situations, hydroxychloroquine has been implicated in cases of serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Reported blood abnormalities with its use include lymphopenia, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis. For short-term treatment of acute malaria, adverse effects can include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heart problems, reduced appetite, headache, nausea and vomiting. Other adverse effects noted with short-term use of Hydroxychloroquine include low blood sugar and QT interval prolongation. Idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. For prolonged treatment of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, adverse effects include the acute symptoms, plus altered eye pigmentation, acne, anemia, bleaching of hair, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, cardiomyopathy, convulsions, vision difficulties, diminished reflexes, emotional changes, excessive coloring of the skin, hearing loss, hives, itching, liver problems or liver failure, loss of hair, muscle paralysis, weakness or atrophy, nightmares, psoriasis, reading difficulties, tinnitus, skin inflammation and scaling, skin rash, vertigo, weight loss, and occasionally urinary incontinence. Hydroxychloroquine can worsen existing cases of both psoriasis and porphyria. Children may be especially vulnerable to developing adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine overdoses. === Eyes === One of the most serious side effects is retinopathy (generally with chronic use). People taking 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine or less per day generally have a negligible risk of macular toxicity, whereas the risk begins to increase when a person takes the medication over five years or has a cumulative dose of more than 1000 grams. The daily safe maximum dose for eye toxicity can be estimated from a person's height and weight. Macular toxicity is related to the total cumulative dose rather than the daily dose. Regular eye screening, even in the absence of visual symptoms, is recommended to begin when either of these risk factors occurs. Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine may be seen in two distinct areas of the eye: the cornea and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous cornea verticillata or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of hydroxychloroquine. The macular changes are potentially serious. Advanced retinopathy is characterized by reduction of visual acuity and a ""bull's eye"" macular lesion which is absent in early involvement. == Overdose == Overdoses of hydroxychloroquine are extremely rare, but extremely toxic. Eight people are known to have overdosed since the drug's introduction in the mid-1950s, of which three have died. Chloroquine has a risk of death in overdose in adults of about 20%, while hydroxychloroquine is estimated to be two or threefold less toxic. Serious signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within an hour of ingestion. These may include sleepiness, vision changes, seizures, coma, stopping of breathing, and heart problems such as ventricular fibrillation and low blood pressure. Loss of vision may be permanent. Low blood potassium, to levels of 1 to 2 mmol/L, may also occur. Cardiovascular abnormalities such as QRS complex widening and QT interval prolongation may also occur. Treatment recommendations include early mechanical ventilation, heart monitoring, and activated charcoal. Supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required with epinephrine being the vasopressor of choice. Stomach pumping may also be used. Sodium bicarbonate and hypertonic saline may be used in cases of severe QRS complex widening. Seizures may be treated with benzodiazepines. Intravenous potassium chloride may be required, however this may result in high blood potassium later in the course of the disease. Dialysis does not appear to be useful. === Detection === Hydroxychloroquine may be quantified in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of sudden or unexpected death. Plasma or serum concentrations are usually in a range of 0.1-1.6 mg/L during therapy and 6–20 mg/L in cases of clinical intoxication, while blood levels of 20–100 mg/L have been observed in deaths due to acute overdosage. == Interactions == The drug transfers into breast milk. There is no evidence that its use during pregnancy is harmful to the developing fetus and its use is not contraindicated in pregnancy. The concurrent use of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin appears to increase the risk for certain serious side effects with short-term use, such as an increased risk of chest pain, congestive heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular causes. Care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as aurothioglucose (Solganal), cimetidine (Tagamet) or digoxin (Lanoxin). Hydroxychloroquine can increase plasma concentrations of penicillamine which may contribute to the development of severe side effects. It enhances hypoglycemic effects of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound hypoglycemia. Antacids may decrease the absorption of hydroxychloroquine. Both neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of hydroxychloroquine. While there may be a link between hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, this risk may be low in those of African descent. Specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) drug label for hydroxychloroquine lists the following drug interactions: Digoxin (wherein it may result in increased serum digoxin levels) Insulin or anti-diabetic medication (wherein it may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment) Drugs that prolong the QT interval such as methadone, and other arrhythmogenic drugs, as hydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and may increase the risk of inducing serious abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular arrhythmias) if used concurrently. Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the seizure threshold (co-administration with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold may increase risk of convulsions) Antiepileptics (concurrent use may impair the antiepileptic activity) Methotrexate (combined use is unstudied and may increase the frequency of side effects) Cyclosporin (wherein an increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when used together). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Hydroxychloroquine has similar pharmacokinetics to chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption, large distribution volume, and elimination by the kidneys; Tmax is 2–4.5 hours. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, 2C8, 3A4 and 3A5) metabolize hydroxychloroquine to N-desethylhydroxychloroquine. Both agents also inhibit CYP2D6 activity and may interact with other medications that depend on this enzyme. === Pharmacodynamics === Antimalarials are lipophilic weak bases and easily pass plasma membranes. The free base form accumulates in lysosomes (acidic cytoplasmic vesicles) and is then protonated, resulting in concentrations within lysosomes up to 1,000 times higher than in culture media. This increases the pH of the lysosome from four to six. Alteration in pH causes inhibition of lysosomal acidic proteases causing a diminished proteolysis effect. Higher pH within lysosomes causes decreased intracellular processing, glycosylation and secretion of proteins with many immunologic and nonimmunologic consequences. These effects are believed to be the cause of a decreased immune cell functioning such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and superoxide production by neutrophils. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak diprotic base that can pass through the lipid cell membrane and preferentially concentrate in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles. The higher pH of these vesicles in macrophages or other antigen-presenting cells limits the association of autoantigenic (any) peptides with class II MHC molecules in the compartment for peptide loading and/or the subsequent processing and transport of the peptide-MHC complex to the cell membrane. === Mechanism of action === Hydroxychloroquine increases lysosomal pH in antigen-presenting cells by two mechanisms: As a weak base, it is a proton acceptor and via this chemical interaction, its accumulation in lysozymes raises the intralysosomal pH, but this mechanism does not fully account for the effect of hydroxychloroquine on pH. Additionally, in parasites that are susceptible to hydroxychloroquine, it interferes with the endocytosis and proteolysis of hemoglobin and inhibits the activity of lysosomal enzymes, thereby raising the lysosomal pH by more than two orders of magnitude over the weak base effect alone. In 2003, a novel mechanism was described wherein hydroxychloroquine inhibits stimulation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the innate immune system. As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the antimalarial mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved. The most accepted model is based on hydrochloroquinine and involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing death. Hydroxychloroquine increases the risk of low blood sugar through several mechanisms. These include decreased clearance of the hormone insulin from the blood, increased insulin sensitivity, and increased release of insulin from the pancreas. == History == After World War I, the German government sought alternatives to quinine as an anti-malarial. Chloroquine, a synthetic analogue with the same mechanism of action was discovered in 1934, by Hans Andersag and coworkers at the Bayer laboratories.: 130–131 This was introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria. Researchers subsequently attempted to discover structural analogs with superior properties and one of these was hydroxychloroquine. === Chemical synthesis === The first synthesis of hydroxychloroquine was disclosed in a patent filed by Sterling Drug in 1949.

Double-masked, 100-week, multicenter, active-controlled, randomized trials. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to brolucizumab 3 mg/6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg in KESTREL (n = 566) or 1:1 to brolucizumab 6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg in KITE (n = 360). Brolucizumab groups received 5 loading doses every 6 weeks (q6w) followed by 12-week (q12w) dosing, with optional adjustment to every 8 weeks (q8w) if disease activity was identified at predefined assessment visits; aflibercept groups received 5 doses every 4 weeks (q4w) followed by fixed q8w dosing. The primary endpoint was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) change from baseline at Week 52; secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects maintained on q12w dosing, change in Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale score, and anatomical and safety outcomes. At Week 52, brolucizumab 6 mg was noninferior (NI margin 4 letters) to aflibercept in mean change in BCVA from baseline (KESTREL: +9.2 letters vs +10.5 letters; KITE: +10.6 letters vs +9.4 letters; P < .001), more subjects achieved central subfield thickness (CSFT) <280 µm, and fewer had persisting subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid vs aflibercept, with more than half of brolucizumab 6 mg subjects maintained on q12w dosing after loading. In KITE, brolucizumab 6 mg showed superior improvements in change of CSFT from baseline over Week 40 to Week 52 vs aflibercept (P = .001). The incidence of ocular serious adverse events was 3.7% (brolucizumab 3 mg), 1.1% (brolucizumab 6 mg), and 2.1% (aflibercept) in KESTREL; and 2.2% (brolucizumab 6 mg) and 1.7% (aflibercept) in KITE. Brolucizumab 6 mg showed robust visual gains and anatomical improvements with an overall favorable benefit/risk profile in patients with DME. Real-world studies on fremanezumab, an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody for migraine prevention, are few and with limited follow-up. We aimed to evaluate the long-term (up to 52 weeks) effectiveness and tolerability of fremanezumab in high-frequency episodic migraine and chronic migraine. This s an independent, prospective, multicenter cohort study enrolling outpatients in 17 Italian Headache Centers with high-frequency episodic migraine or chronic migraine and multiple preventive treatment failures. Patients were treated with fremanezumab 225 mg monthly. The primary outcomes included changes from baseline (1 month before treatment) in monthly headache days, response rates (reduction in monthly headache days from baseline), and persistence in medication overuse at months 3, 6, and 12 (all outcome timeframes refer to the stated month). Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in acute medication intake and disability questionnaires scores at the same timepoints. A last observation carried forward analysis was also performed. A total of 90 patients who received at least one dose of fremanezumab and with a potential 12-month follow-up were included. Among them, 15 (18.0%) patients discontinued treatment for the entire population, a reduction in monthly headache days compared with baseline was reported at month 3, with a significant median [interquartile range] reduction in monthly headache days (- 9.0 [11.5], p < 0.001). A statistically different reduction was also reported at month 6 compared with baseline (- 10.0 [12.0]; p < 0.001) and at 12 months of treatment (- 10.0 [14.0]; p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with medication overuse was significantly reduced compared with baseline from 68.7% (57/83) to 29.6% (24/81), 25.3% (19/75), and 14.7% (10/68) at 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment, respectively (p < 0.001). Acute medication use (days and total number) and disability scores were also significantly reduced (p < 0.001). A ≥ 50% response rate was achieved for 51.9, 67.9, and 76.5% of all patients at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Last observation carried forward analyses confirmed these findings. Fremanezumab was well tolerated, with just one patient discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. This study provides evidence for the real-world effectiveness of fremanezumab in treating both high-frequency episodic migraine and chronic migraine, with meaningful and sustained improvements in multiple migraine-related variables. No new safety issue was identified. Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with risk of dementia, yet intervention of LLD provides an opportunity to attenuate subsequent cognitive decline. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplement is a potential intervention due to their beneficial effect in depressive symptoms and cognitive function. To explore the underlying neural mechanism, we used resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) before and after omega-3 PUFAs supplement in older adults with LLD. A 52-week double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. We used multi-scale sample entropy to analyze rs-fMRI data. Comprehensive cognitive tests and inflammatory markers were collected to correlate with brain entropy changes. A total of 20 patients completed the trial with 11 under omega-3 PUFAs and nine under placebo. While no significant global cognitive improvement was observed, a marginal enhancement in processing speed was noted in the omega-3 PUFAs group. Importantly, participants receiving omega-3 PUFAs exhibited decreased brain entropy in left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), multiple visual areas, the orbital part of the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left Rolandic operculum. The brain entropy changes of the PCG in the omega-3 PUFAs group correlated with improvement of language function and attenuation of interleukin-6 levels. Sample size is small with only marginal clinical effect. These findings suggest that omega-3 PUFAs supplement may mitigate cognitive decline in LLD through anti-inflammatory mechanisms and modulation of brain entropy. Larger clinical trials are warranted to validate the potential therapeutic implications of omega-3 PUFAs for deterring cognitive decline in patients with late-life depression.",Ng 52,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010950337309623137), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06390984356403351), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47461843490600586)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([ambeed.cn](https://www.ambeed.cn/products/ng-52.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=6, title='NG 52 | Compound 52 | Cdc28p/Pho85p/PGK1 Inhibitor | AmBeed-信号通路专用抑制剂', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ambeed.cn/products/ng-52.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Orthotopic MDA-MB-435 tumor-bearing mice were treated with ZD4190 (100 mg/kg orally per day for three consecutive days). Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurement. During the therapeutic period, longitudinal PET scans were acquired using (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FPPRGD2 as imaging tracers to evaluate tumor glucose metabolism, tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, respectively. Imaging metrics were validated by immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67, GLUT-1, F4/80, CD31, murine integrin β3, and human integrin αvβ3. Three consecutive daily oral administrations of 100 mg/kg of ZD4190 were effective in delaying MDA-MB-435 tumor growth. A significant difference in tumor volume was observed on day 7 between the treatment group and the control group (p < 0.01). After the final treatment, tumor growth resumed after a short delay. In the control tumors, (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake was stable between days 0 and 7. In ZD4190-treated tumors, (18)F-FPPRGD2 uptake had decreased significantly relative to baseline by 26.74 ± 8.12% (p < 0.05) on day 1 and by 41.19 ± 6.63% (p < 0.01) on day 3, then had returned to baseline on day 7. Tumor uptake of (18)F-FLT had also decreased on both day 1 and day 3 after initiation of ZD4190 treatment. No significant change in (18)F-FDG uptake in ZD4190-treated tumors was observed, however, compared with the control group. All of the imaging findings were supported by ex vivo analysis of related biomarkers. The longitudinal imaging results demonstrated the usefulness of quantitative (18)F-FLT and (18)F-FPPRGD2 PET imaging in evaluating the early antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects of ZD4190. The quantification data from the PET imaging were consistent with the pattern of initial growth inhibition with treatment, followed by tumor relapse after treatment cessation. There is evidence that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to solid tumor growth through the promotion of both angiogenesis and tumor vascular permeability. To abrogate VEGF signaling, we developed a small molecular weight inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity that was compatible with chronic oral administration. ZD4190, a substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline, is a potent inhibitor of KDR and Flt-1 RTK activity, and VEGF stimulated HUVEC proliferation in vitro. Chronic once-daily oral dosing of ZD4190 to young rats produced a dose-dependent increase in the femoral epiphyseal growth plate area, which may be attributed to the inhibition of VEGF signaling in vivo because vascular invasion of cartilage is a prerequisite to the process of ossification. Once-daily oral dosing of ZD4190 to mice bearing established (approximately 0.5 cm3) human tumor xenografts (breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian) elicited significant antitumor activity and at doses that would not be expected to have any direct antiproliferative effect on tumor cells. Prolonged tumor cytostasis was further demonstrated in a PC-3 xenograft model with 10 weeks of ZD4190 dosing, and upon withdrawal of therapy, tumor growth resumed after a short delay. These observations are entirely consistent with the proposed mode of action. ZD4190 is one of a series of VEGF RTK inhibitors that may have utility in the treatment of a range of histologically diverse solid tumor types.",Zd 4190;zd4190,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017958412354346365), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.027240071445703506), ('ICAL', -1.0609570381348021e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1002286896109581)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Liver fibroblasts close to the tumor, activated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and expressing high levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), become cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are deputed to produce and secrete ECM components and crosstalk with cancer cells favoring tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Overexpression of Notch signaling is implicated in CCA development and growth. The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the Notch inhibitor, Crenigacestat, on the surrounding microenvironment of iCCA. We investigated Crenigacestat's effectiveness in a PDX model of iCCA and human primary culture of CAFs isolated from patients with iCCA. In silico analysis of transcriptomic profiling from PDX iCCA tissues treated with Crenigacestat highlighted ""liver fibrosis"" as one of the most modulated pathways. In the iCCA PDX model, Crenigacestat treatment significantly (p < 0.001) reduced peritumoral liver fibrosis. Similar results were obtained in a hydrodynamic model of iCCA. Bioinformatic prediction of the upstream regulators related to liver fibrosis in the iCCA PDX treated with Crenigacestat revealed the involvement of the TGF-β1 pathway as a master regulator gene showing a robust connection between TGF-β1 and Notch pathways. Consistently, drug treatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced TGF-β1 mRNA and protein levels in tumoral tissue. In PDX tissues, Crenigacestat remarkably inhibited TGF-β signaling and extracellular matrix protein gene expression and reduced α-SMA expression. Furthermore, Crenigacestat synergistically increased Gemcitabine effectiveness in the iCCA PDX model. In 31 iCCA patients, TGF-β1 and α-SMA were upregulated in the tumoral compared with peritumoral tissues. In freshly isolated CAFs from patients with iCCA, Crenigacestat significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited Notch signaling, TGF-β1 secretion, and Smad-2 activation. Consequently, Crenigacestat also inactivated CAFs reducing (p < 0.001) α-SMA expression. Finally, CAFs treated with Crenigacestat produced less (p < 005) ECM components such as fibronectin, collagen 1A1, and collagen 1A2. Notch signaling inhibition reduces the peritumoral desmoplastic reaction in iCCA, blocking the TGF-β1 canonical pathway. Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is one of the dangerous forms of vascular calcification. CAVD leads to calcification of the aortic valve and disturbance of blood flow. Despite high mortality, there is no targeted therapy against CAVD or vascular calcification. Osteogenic differentiation of valve interstitial cells (VICs) is one of the key factors of CAVD progression and inhibition of this process seems a fruitful target for potential therapy. By our previous study we assumed that inhibitors of Notch pathway might be effective to suppress aortic valve leaflet calcification. We tested CB-103 and crenigacestat (LY3039478), two selective inhibitors of Notch-signaling, for suppression of osteogenic differentiation of VICs isolated from patients with CAVD  Notch signaling plays an integral role in development and tissue homeostasis. Inhibition of Notch signaling has been identified as a reasonable target for oncotherapy. Crenigacestat (LY3039478) is a potent Notch inhibitor that decreases Notch signaling and its downstream biologic effects. I6F-MC-JJCD was a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, phase 1b study with 5 separate, parallel dose escalations in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer from a variety of solid tumors followed by a dose-confirmation phase in pre-specified tumor types. This manuscript reports on 2 of 5 groups. The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of crenigacestat combined with other anticancer agents (gemcitabine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/carboplatin). Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. Patients (N = 31) received treatment between November 2016 and July 2019. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in 6 patients. The recommended phase 2 dose for crenigacestat was 50 mg TIW in Part 1 (combined with gemcitabine/cisplatin) and not established in Part 2 (combined with gemcitabine/carboplatin) due to poor tolerability.

It entered into clinical development as a drug candidate for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but was abandoned in 2007 because animal testing showed that the drug caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs. In 2007, research was published showing that high doses of GW501516 given to mice dramatically improved their physical performance; the work was widely discussed in popular media, and led to a black market for the drug candidate and to its abuse by athletes as a doping agent. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) developed a test for GW501516 and other related chemicals and added them to the prohibited list in 2009; it has issued additional warnings to athletes that GW501516 is not safe. == History == GW501516 was initially discovered during a research collaboration between GSK and Ligand Pharmaceuticals that began in 1992. The discovery of the compound was published in a 2001 issue of PNAS. Oliver et al. reported that they used ""combinatorial chemistry and structure-based drug design"" to develop it. One of the authors was the son of Leo Sternbach who discovered benzodiazepines in the 1960s. R & D Focus Drug News reported that GSK began phase I trials of the compound for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in 2000 followed by phase I/II in 2002. In 2003, Ligand Pharmaceuticals earned a $1 million payment as a result of GSK continuing phase I development. By 2007, GW501516 had completed two phase II clinical studies and other studies relating to obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, but GSK abandoned further development of the drug in 2007 for reasons which were not disclosed at the time. It later emerged that the drug was discontinued because animal testing showed that the drug caused cancer to develop rapidly in several organs, at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day in both mice and rats. Ronald M. Evans's laboratory purchased a sample of GW501516 and gave mice a much higher dose than had been used in GSK's experiments; they found that the compound dramatically increased the physical performance of the mice. The work was published in 2007 in Cell and was widely reported in the popular press including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Another human study (comparing cardarine with the PPARα agonist GW590735 and placebo) was published in 2021. === Performance-enhancing drug === Concerns were raised prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics that GW501516 could be used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug that was not currently controlled by regulations or detected by standard tests. One of the main researchers from the study on enhanced endurance consequently developed a urine test to detect the drug, and made it available to the International Olympic Committee. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) developed a test for GW501516 and other related PPARδ modulators, and added such drugs to the prohibited list in 2009. GW501516 has been promoted on bodybuilding and athletics websites and by 2011 had already been available for some time on the black market. In 2011, it was reported to cost $1,000 for 10 g. In 2012, WADA recategorised GW501516 from a gene doping compound to a ""hormone and metabolic modulator"". In 2013, WADA took the rare step of warning potential users of the compound of the possible health risks, stating that ""clinical approval has not, and will not be given for this substance""; the New Scientist attributed the warning to the risks of the drug causing cancer. A number of athletes have tested positive for GW501516. At the Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica in December 2012, four Costa Rican riders tested positive for GW501516. Three of them received two-year suspensions, while the fourth received 12 years as it was his second doping violation. In April 2013, Russian cyclist Valery Kaykov was suspended by cycling's governing body UCI after having tested positive for GW501516. Kaykov's team RusVelo dismissed him immediately and in May 2013, Venezuelan Miguel Ubeto was provisionally suspended by the Lampre team. In February 2014, Russian race walker Elena Lashmanova tested positive for GW501516. In April 2019, American heavyweight boxer Jarrell Miller tested positive for GW501516 which caused his challenge for Anthony Joshua's World Heavyweight titles to be cancelled. In December 2020, Miller was suspended for 2 years for repeated violations. In July 2022, the 2012 800 m Olympic silver medalist from Botswana, Nijel Amos tested positive for GW501516 and was provisionally suspended just days before the 2022 World Athletics Championships. Surinam's Issam Asinga, who set the under-20 world track record in the men's 100 meters, was informed on Aug. 9, 2023 by the Athletics Integrity Unit that his July 18 drug test the prior month detected trace amounts of GW501516. Asinga has alleged in a suit filed in the Southern District of New York that Gatorade provided him with Gatorade Recovery Gummies at their awards ceremony one week earlier in Los Angeles tainted with GW501516. == Mode of action == GW501516 is a selective agonist (activator) of the PPARδ receptor. It displays high affinity (Ki = 1 nM) and potency (EC50 = 1 nM) for PPARδ with greater than 1,000-fold selectivity over PPARα and PPARγ. In rats, binding of GW501516 to PPARδ recruits the coactivator PGC-1α. The PPARδ/coactivator complex in turn upregulates the expression of proteins involved in energy expenditure. Furthermore, in rats treated with GW501516, increased fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle and protection against diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes was observed. In obese rhesus monkeys, GW501516 increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lowered very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Activation of PPARδ is also believed to be the mechanism responsible for cancer induction. A 2018 study in finds that GW501516 enhances the growth of colitis-associated colorectal cancer by increasing inflammation and the expression of GLUT1 and SLC1A5.

Like other members of the class, it is a COX inhibitor and prevents formation of prostaglandins. It is used in the UK as a treatment for migraine. It is generally not available in the US. It is available in some Asian, Latin American and European countries as a generic drug for humans and for animals. == Medical uses == Tolfenamic acid finds utility in the prevention and treatment of conditions associated with pain and inflammation. However, despite its efficacy when administered intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or orally, TFA-based drugs have not yet gained approval in the United States and some other countries due to the significant number of reported side effects. == Chemistry == Tolfenamic acid, belonging to the pharmacological group of fenamates, possesses a chemical structure typical of anthranilic acid derivatives. In this structure, one of the hydrogen atoms of the nitro group is substituted by a benzene ring featuring a methyl group and a chlorine atom at the ortho- and meta- positions, respectively. Nine forms of tolfenamic acid have been identified, some of which are determined by conformational states. These polymorphic forms exhibit variations in the spatial arrangement within the unit cell and in the values of the C-N(H)-C-C angle. This diversity in solid forms makes TFA an attractive candidate for modification and utilization in medical applications. == History == It was discovered by scientists at Medica Pharmaceutical Company in Finland. == Research == Tolfenamic acid demonstrates the ability to inhibit the growth of cancer cells in the pancreas, sigmoid colon, and rectum. == References == == External links == Tolfenamic acid information (Diseases Database)",Tolfedine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007210186216980219), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014300835318863392)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1010,"('Dicloxacillin (sodium hydrate)', 'Dicloxacillin sodium salt monohydrate', 'Dicloxacillin', 'Dicloxacilina', 'Dicloxacilline')",Medical,"Dicloxacillin is a narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. It is used to treat infections caused by susceptible (non-resistant) Gram-positive bacteria. It is active against beta-lactamase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, which would otherwise be resistant to most penicillins. Dicloxacillin is available under a variety of trade names including Diclocil (BMS). It was patented in 1961 and approved for medical use in 1968. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Dicloxacillin is used to treat mild-to-moderate staphylococcal infections. To decrease the development of resistance, dicloxacillin is recommended to treat infections that are suspected or proven to be caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Dicloxacillin is similar in pharmacokinetics, antibacterial activity, and indications to flucloxacillin, and the two agents are considered interchangeable. It is believed to have lower incidence of severe hepatic adverse effects than flucloxacillin, but a higher incidence of renal adverse effects. Dicloxacillin is used for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Specific approved indications include: Staphylococcal skin infections and cellulitis – including impetigo, otitis externa, folliculitis, boils, carbuncles, and mastitis Pneumonia (adjunct) Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, throat infections, streptococcus Septicaemia Empirical treatment for endocarditis Surgical prophylaxis === Available forms === Dicloxacillin is commercially available as the sodium salt, dicloxacillin sodium, in capsules and as a powder for reconstitution. == Contraindications == Dicloxacillin is contraindicated in those with a previous history of allergy (hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction) to any penicillins. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of dicloxacillin include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. On rare occasions, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with dicloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is 1 in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people over 55 years old, females, and those with treatment longer than 2 weeks. It should be used with caution and monitored in the elderly, particularly with intravenous administration, due to a risk of thrombophlebitis. Dicloxacillin can also lower the effectiveness of birth control pills and pass into breast milk. === Interactions === Dicloxacillin has potential interactions with following drugs: Warfarin Methotrexate Tetracyclines == Resistance == Despite dicloxacillin being insensitive to beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance to other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin. Such organisms include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). == Mechanism of action == Like other β-lactam antibiotics, dicloxacillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. == Medicinal chemistry == Dicloxacillin is insensitive to beta-lactamase (also known as penicillinase) enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The presence of the isoxazolyl group on the side chain of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase resistance, since they are relatively intolerant of side-chain steric hindrance. Thus, it is able to bind to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamase == See also == Beta-lactam antibiotic Flucloxacillin == References ==",Dicloxacillin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3351351299206726e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016175392374861985)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicloxacillin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Dicloxacillin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicloxacillin?utm_source=openai')])"
1011,"('Ibiglustat', 'Venglustat', 'Genz-682452', 'Gz/sar402671', 'Genz-682452-aa')",Medical," Gaucher disease type 3 is a chronic neuronopathic disorder with wide-ranging effects, including hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, skeletal disease and diverse neurological manifestations. Biallelic mutations in GBA1 reduce lysosomal acid β-glucosidase activity, and its substrates, glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, accumulate. Enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy ameliorate systemic features of Gaucher disease, but no therapies are approved for neurological manifestations. Venglustat is an investigational, brain-penetrant, glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor with potential to improve the disease by rebalancing influx of glucosylceramide with impaired lysosomal recycling. The Phase 2, open-label LEAP trial (NCT02843035) evaluated orally administered venglustat 15 mg once-daily in combination with maintenance dose of imiglucerase enzyme replacement therapy during 1 year of treatment in 11 adults with Gaucher disease type 3. Primary endpoints were venglustat safety and tolerability and change in concentration of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in CSF from baseline to Weeks 26 and 52. Secondary endpoints included change in plasma concentrations of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, venglustat pharmacokinetics in plasma and CSF, neurologic function, infiltrative lung disease and systemic disease parameters. Exploratory endpoints included changes in brain volume assessed with volumetric MRI using tensor-based morphometry, and resting functional MRI analysis of regional brain activity and connectivity between resting state networks. Mean (SD) plasma venglustat AUC0-24 on Day 1 was 851 (282) ng•h/ml; Cmax of 58.1 (26.4) ng/ml was achieved at a median tmax 2.00 h. After once-daily venglustat, plasma concentrations (4 h post-dose) were higher compared with Day 1, indicating ∼2-fold accumulation. One participant (Patient 9) had low-to-undetectable venglustat exposure at Weeks 26 and 52. Based on mean plasma and CSF venglustat concentrations (excluding Patient 9), steady state appeared to be reached on or before Week 4. Mean (SD) venglustat concentration at Week 52 was 114 (65.8) ng/ml in plasma and 6.14 (3.44) ng/ml in CSF. After 1 year of treatment, median (inter-quartile range) glucosylceramide decreased 78% (72, 84) in plasma and 81% (77, 83) in CSF; median (inter-quartile range) glucosylsphingosine decreased 56% (41, 60) in plasma and 70% (46, 76) in CSF. Ataxia improved slightly in nine patients: mean (SD, range) total modified Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score decreased from 2.68 [1.54 (0.0 to 5.5)] at baseline to 1.55 [1.88 (0.0 to 5.0)] at Week 52 [mean change: -1.14 (95% CI: -2.06 to -0.21)]. Whole brain volume increased slightly in patients with venglustat exposure and biomarker reduction in CSF (306.7 ± 4253.3 mm3) and declined markedly in Patient 9 (-13894.8 mm3). Functional MRI indicated stronger connectivity at Weeks 26 and 52 relative to baseline between a broadly distributed set of brain regions in patients with venglustat exposure and biomarker reduction but not Patient 9, although neurocognition, assessed by Vineland II, deteriorated in all domains over time, which illustrates disease progression despite the intervention. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations. In adults with Gaucher disease type 3 receiving imiglucerase, addition of once-daily venglustat showed acceptable safety and tolerability and preliminary evidence of clinical stability with intriguing but intrinsically inconsistent signals in selected biomarkers, which need to be validated and confirmed in future research. Variants in the GBA1 gene, which encodes lysosomal acid glucocerebrosidase, are among the most common genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease and are associated with faster disease progression. The mechanisms involved are unresolved but might include accumulation of glucosylceramide. Venglustat is a brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor that, in previous studies, reduced amounts of the glycosphingolipid. We aimed to assess the safety, efficacy, and target engagement of venglustat in people with early-stage Parkinson's disease carrying pathogenic GBA1 variants. MOVES-PD part 2 was a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2 study done at 52 centres (academic sites, specialty clinics, and general neurology centres) in 16 countries. Eligible adults aged 18-80 years with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage ≤2) and one or more GBA1 variants were randomly assigned using an interactive voice-response system (1:1) to 52 weeks of treatment with oral venglustat (15 mg/day) or matching placebo. Investigators, site personnel, participants, and their caregivers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to 52 weeks in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) parts II and III combined score (a higher score indicates greater impairment), and it was analysed in a modified intention-to-treat population (ie, all randomly assigned participants with a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement during the treatment period). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02906020) and is closed to recruitment. Between Dec 15, 2016, and May 27, 2021, 221 participants were randomly assigned to venglustat (n=110) or placebo (n=111). The least squares mean change in MDS-UPDRS parts II and III combined score was 7·29 (SE 1·36) for venglustat (n=96) and 4·71 (SE 1·27) for placebo (n=105); the absolute difference between groups was 2·58 (95% CI -1·10 to 6·27; p=0·17). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were constipation and nausea (both were reported by 23 [21%] of 110 participants in the venglustat group and eight [7%] of 111 participants in the placebo group). Serious TEAEs were reported for 12 (11%) participants in each group. There was one death in the venglustat group owing to an unrelated cardiopulmonary arrest and there were no deaths in the placebo group. In people with GBA1-associated Parkinson's disease in our study, venglustat had a satisfactory safety profile but showed no beneficial treatment effect compared with placebo. These findings indicate that glucosylceramide synthase inhibition with venglustat might not be a viable therapeutic approach for GBA1-associated Parkinson's disease.

To solve the above problems, we identified that Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor Navoximod promoted herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication and HSV-1-mediated oncolysis in tumor cells, making it a promising combination modality with HSV-1-based virotherapy. Thus, we loaded HSV-1 and Navoximod together in an injectable and biocompatible hydrogel (V-Navo@gel) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) virotherapy. The hydrogel formed a local delivery reservoir to maximize the viral replication and distribution at the tumor site with a single-dose injection. Notably, V-Navo@gel improved the disease-free survival time of HCC- bearing mice and protects the mice against tumor recurrence. What's more, V-Navo@gel also showed an effective therapeutic efficacy in the rabbit orthotopic liver cancer model. Mechanistically, we further discovered that our combination strategy entirely reprogramed the TME through single-cell RNA sequencing. All these results collectively indicated that the combination of Navoximod with HSV-1 could boost the viral replication and reshape TME for tumor eradication through the hydrogel reservoir.

1014,"('Moclobemide', 'Ro111163', 'Aurorix', 'Moclobemid', 'Manerix')",Medical,"Moclobemide, sold under the brand names Amira, Aurorix, Clobemix, Depnil and Manerix among others, is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) drug primarily used to treat depression and social anxiety. It is not approved for use in the United States, but is approved in other Western countries such as Canada, the UK and Australia. It is produced by affiliates of the Hoffmann–La Roche pharmaceutical company. Initially, Aurorix was also marketed by Roche in South Africa, but was withdrawn after its patent rights expired and Cipla Medpro's Depnil and Pharma Dynamic's Clorix became available at half the cost. No significant rise in blood pressure occurs when moclobemide is combined with amines such as tyramine-containing foods or pressor amine drugs, unlike with the older irreversible and non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which cause a severe rise in blood pressure with such combination. Due to the lack of anticholinergic, cardiovascular, cognitive and psychomotor impairments moclobemide is advantageous in the elderly as well as those with cardiovascular disease. Moclobemide was first introduced for medical use in 1989. == Medical uses == Reversible selective MAOIs such as moclobemide are underprescribed due to the misconception that the side effect profiles are analogous to that of the irreversible and non-selective MAOIs. MAOIs such as moclobemide are reported to have a relatively fast onset of action compared to other antidepressant drug classes, and have good long-term tolerability in terms of side effects. Tolerance does not seem to occur; research has found that moclobemide retains its beneficial therapeutic properties in depression for at least a year. Unipolar depression – Moclobemide has demonstrated effectiveness and efficacy in the treatment and management of major depressive disorder, with both endogenous and non-endogenous depression responding; in addition moclobemide has a fast onset of action compared to other antidepressants and is significantly more tolerable than the tricyclic antidepressants. Due to a good safety profile and low incidence of side effects moclobemide is likely to have a high level of acceptability by individuals suffering from depression. Higher doses (>450 mg/day) may be more effective in severe depression, while patients treated with a lower dose tend to respond less well than those treated with tricyclic antidepressants. Psychotic depression, unipolar endogenous depression, melancholic depression, retarded depression, agitated depression and neurotic depression all respond to moclobemide, as does atypical depression. Unipolar endogenous depression is reported to have the best response to moclobemide therapy. Individuals suffering from depression who are given moclobemide are twice as likely to improve on moclobemide than on placebo. A concern of antidepressant adverse effects is sexual dysfunction; however, moclobemide has been found to actually increase libido and improve impaired erection, ejaculation and orgasm. Cardiovascular toxicity is a concern with antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants as well as the irreversible MAOIs; when cardiovascular toxicity is a concern, SSRIs or the reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide are an option as they lack or have a significantly reduced level of cardiovascular toxicity in terms of adverse effect as well as in overdose. The effectiveness of moclobemide in agitated depression is equivalent to that of imipramine and sedative antidepressants such as amitriptyline, mianserin and maprotiline. The therapeutic response in agitated depressive individuals is similar to that seen in non-agitated depression; however, a past history of use of antidepressants reduces the chance of successful therapeutic response. The addition of a benzodiazepine to moclobemide therapy has not been found to be of benefit in this population group. Moclobemide has better tolerability compared to TCAs. Dysthymia – moclobemide has been found to be effective in the treatment and management of this depressive disorder. Social phobia – Moclobemide has been found to be effective for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in both short and long-term placebo controlled clinical trials. Moclobemide is effective but not as effective as the irreversible MAOIs in the treatment of social phobia. Maximal benefits can take 8–12 weeks to manifest. There is a high risk of treatment failure if there is co-morbid alcohol use disorder, however. The Australian Medicines Handbook lists social phobia as an accepted but not a licensed indication. The use of moclobemide in the treatment of social anxiety disorder has given mixed results with a tendency of response at higher doses (>300 mg/d) compared with placebo. Smoking cessation – Moclobemide has been tested in heavy dependent smokers against placebo based on the theory that tobacco smoking could be a form of self-medicating of major depression, and moclobemide could therefore help increase abstinence rates due to moclobemide mimicking the MAO-A inhibiting effects of tobacco smoke. A 2023 Cochrane review found only one 1995 trial studying the effects of moclobemide on smoking cessation, it was administered for 3 months and then stopped; at 6 months follow-up it was found those who had taken moclobemide for 3 months had a much higher successful quit rate than those in the placebo group. However, at 12-month follow-up the difference between the placebo group and the moclobemide group was no longer significant. Panic disorder – moclobemide is useful in the treatment and management of panic disorder. Panic disorder is mentioned as an accepted but unlicensed indication in the Australian Medicines Handbook. ADHD – Two small studies assessing the benefit of moclobemide in people with attention deficit disorder found that moclobemide produced favourable results. Fibromyalgia – moclobemide has been found to improve pain and functioning in this group of people. Similar to other MAOIs, reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide may also be effective in a range of other psychiatric disorders. Menopausal flushing may also respond to moclobemide. In efficacy studies for the treatment of major depressive disorder, moclobemide has been found to be significantly more effective than placebo, as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and somewhat less effective than the older, irreversible MAOIs phenelzine and tranylcypromine. In terms of tolerability, however, moclobemide was found to be comparable to the SSRIs and better tolerated than the TCAs and older MAOIs. There is some evidence that moclobemide on its own or in combination with other antidepressants such as SSRIs is also effective for treatment resistant depression and that the combination can be administered without the development of serotonin syndrome; however, further research is needed before such a combination can be recommended. Follow-up studies show that ongoing use of antidepressants leads to continuing improvement in depression over time; and also have demonstrated that moclobemide retains its therapeutic efficacy as an antidepressant for at least a year. This long-term efficacy is equivalent to that seen with other antidepressant classes. People on irreversible MAOIs have to discontinue these antidepressants two weeks before general anesthesia, however, the use of moclobemide, due to its reversible nature, would allow such patients to possibly continue antidepressant therapy. A dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and plasma and urine methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) test can be used to estimate who is likely to respond to moclobemide antidepressant therapy. === Pregnancy and lactation === The doses of moclobemide in breast milk are very low (0.06% of moclobemide being recovered in breast milk) and therefore it has been concluded that moclobemide is unlikely to have any adverse effect on a suckling baby. === Children === Use in children is not recommended as there is insufficient data to assess safety and efficacy in these patients. === Elderly === Reversible MAOIs such as moclobemide may have advantages in the treatment of depression associated with Alzheimer's disease due to its effect on noradrenaline. Cognitive impairments have been found to improve in people with dementia when depression is treated with moclobemide. Due to its superior safety profile, moclobemide has been recommended as a first line agent for the treatment of depression in the elderly. Due to the side effect profile of moclobemide, it may be a better option for this sub group of people than other antidepressants. Research has found evidence that moclobemide may be able to counter anti-cholinergic (Scopolamine) induced cognitive impairments thus making moclobemide a good choice in the depression in the elderly and those with dementia. == Adverse effects == The incidence of adverse events is not correlated with age; however, adverse events occur more often in females than in males. Moclobemide is regarded as a generally safe antidepressant and due to its favorable side effect profile, it can be considered a first-line therapeutic antidepressant. The rate of incidence of side effects of moclobemide is low, with insomnia, headache and dizziness being the most commonly reported side effects in the initial stages of therapy with moclobemide. Moclobemide, even at high doses of 600 mg, does not impair the ability to drive a motor vehicle. The tolerability of moclobemide is similar in women and men and it is also well tolerated in the elderly. Moclobemide has been found to be superior to tricyclic and irreversible MAOI antidepressants in terms of side effects, as it does not cause anticholinergic, sedative or cardiovascular adverse effects. Unlike the irreversible MAOIs there is no evidence of liver toxicity with moclobemide. Moclobemide has a similar efficacy profile compared to other antidepressants while being superior to the classic MAOIs and the tricyclics in terms of tolerance and safety profile. Moclobemide has little effect on psychomotor functions. Other side effects include nausea, insomnia, tremor and lightheadedness; orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing) is uncommon even among the elderly. Behavioural toxicity or other impairments relating to everyday living does not occur with moclobemide, except that in doses of 400 mg or higher peripheral reaction time may be impaired. Peripheral oedema has been associated with moclobemide. Some of the side effects are transient and disappear within 2 weeks of treatment. Serious fatigue, headache, restlessness, nervousness and sleep disturbances have been described as side effects from moclobemide therapy. A paradoxical worsening of depression has been reported in some individuals in several studies, and reports of suicide or suicidal ideation have been reported as a rare adverse effect of moclobemide. Overall, antidepressants decrease the risk of suicide. Moclobemide is believed to have only small proconvulsant effects; however, rarely seizures may occur. Hypertension has been reported to occur very rarely with moclobemide therapy. Moclobemide is relatively well tolerated. The following are the potential adverse effects and their respective incidences: Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects Nausea Dry mouth Constipation Diarrhea Insomnia Dizziness Anxiety Restlessness Uncommon/Rare (<1%) adverse effects === Contraindications === Avoid use in: Confusional states Phaeochromocytoma and caution is recommended in: Agitated/excited patients Thyrotoxicosis === Drug Interactions === Moclobemide has fewer interactions than irreversible MAOIs. Cimetidine however, causes a significant rise in moclobemide levels and therefore if the combination is used, lower doses of moclobemide have been recommended. There is little increase in the effects of alcohol when combined with moclobemide and, in fact, moclobemide causes a reduction in alcohol-related impairments. Moclobemide also interacts with pethidine/meperidine, and dextropropoxyphene. Ephedrine in combination with moclobemide increases the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects. Moclobemide is also likely to interact with warfarin. The combination of moclobemide with prescription or over the counter sympathomimetic drugs is not recommended due to the potential of significant drug interactions. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when moclobemide has been taken in combination with other serotonin enhancing drugs; however, due to moclobemide's reversible MAO inhibition, serotonin syndrome is significantly less likely to occur with moclobemide than with older irreversible MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when trazodone was abruptly replaced with moclobemide. Taking at the same time or starting moclobemide too soon after discontinuing clomipramine or serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as SSRIs may result in the development of a serotonin syndrome. SNRIs such as venlafaxine in combination with moclobemide have also been associated with serotonin syndrome. Cimetidine causes a doubling of the blood plasma levels of moclobemide. Blood plasma levels of trimipramine and maprotiline and possibly other tricyclic antidepressants increase when used in combination with moclobemide and may require dosage adjustments if the combination is used for treatment resistant depression. The elimination of zolmitriptan is reduced by moclobemide and if the combination is used, a dosage reduction of zolmitriptan is recommended. Moclobemide reduces the metabolism of dextromethorphan. Moclobemide may decrease metabolism of diazepam, omeprazole, proguanil, propranolol and others due to inhibition of CYP2C19. Dietary Irreversible MAOIs can cause unpleasant and occasionally dangerous side effects such as a hypertensive crises after intake of food or drink containing indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines such as tyramine. This is sometimes referred to as the 'cheese effect'. These side effects are due to irreversible inhibition of MAO in the gut and vasomotor neurones. However, the reversible MAOI antidepressants such as moclobemide have a very different side effect profile in this regard. The reversible binding to MAO-A by moclobemide allows amines such as tyramine to displace moclobemide from MAO-A allowing its metabolism and removing the risk of a hypertensive crisis that occurs with irreversible MAO inhibition. Of 2300 people in multiple clinical trials who were treated with moclobemide in doses up to 600 mg with no dietary restrictions, none experienced a tyramine-mediated hypertensive reaction. As the pressor effect of moclobemide is so low, dietary restrictions are not necessary in people eating a normal diet, in contrast to irreversible MAOIs. However, some rare cheeses that have a high tyramine level may possibly cause a pressor effect and require caution. The potentiation of the pressor effect of tyramine by moclobemide is only one seventh to one tenth of that of irreversible MAOIs. In order to minimize this potentiation, postprandial administration (taken after meals) of moclobemide is recommended. The combined use of moclobemide and selegiline requires dietary restrictions as the combination can lead to increased sensitivity to the pressor effect of foods containing tyramine. While moclobemide or the irreversible MAO-B selective inhibitor selegiline taken alone has very little pressor effect, and requires no dietary restriction, the combination of selegiline with moclobemide leads to a significant enhancement of the pressor effect and such a combination requires dietary restriction of foods containing high amounts of tyramine. The combination of moclobemide and a reversible MAO-B inhibitor requires tyramine dietary restrictions. === Overdose === Moclobemide is considered to be less toxic in overdose compared to older antidepressants, such as the tricyclic antidepressants and the irreversible and non-selective MAOIs, making it a safer antidepressant in the elderly or people with physical disorders. Of 18 people who overdosed on moclobemide during clinical trials, all recovered fully and moclobemide was judged to be safe for inpatient as well as outpatient use. Intoxications with moclobemide as single agent are usually mild; however, when combined with tricyclic or SSRI antidepressants the overdose is much more toxic and potentially fatal. Moclobemide, is preferred by doctors for patients who are at risk of suicide, due to moclobemide's low toxicity in overdose. Patients with mixed intoxications (e.g. with other CNS active drugs) may show severe or life-threatening symptoms and should be hospitalized. Treatment is largely symptomatic and should be aimed at maintenance of the vital functions. === Withdrawal and tolerance === Withdrawal symptoms appear to be very rare with moclobemide compared to other antidepressants; a single report of relatively mild flu-like symptoms persisting for 7 days after rapid reduction of high dose moclobemide therapy has been reported in one patient. Withdrawal of moclobemide causes a rebound in REM sleep. Moclobemide does not seem to prevent withdrawal symptoms from serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Discontinuation of moclobemide is recommended to be done gradually to minimise side effects (e.g. rapid return of condition being treated and/or the appearance of withdrawal symptoms). Tolerance to the therapeutic effects has been reported in a small number of users of MAOIs including moclobemide. == Pharmacology == Moclobemide is a benzamide, derivative of morpholine, which acts pharmacologically as a selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (RIMA), a type of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and increases levels of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), dopamine, and especially serotonin in neuronal cells as well as in synaptic vesicles; extracellular levels also increase which results in increased monoamine receptor stimulation and suppression of REM sleep, down regulation of beta-3 adrenergic receptors. Moclobemide's primary action is to disable MAO-A enzymes from decomposing norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine which results in a rising level of these neurotransmitters. Although it has been estimated that a single 300 mg dose of moclobemide inhibits 80% of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and 20-30% of MAO-B, studies evaluating brain occupancy of MAO-A enzymes have shown dosages of 600 mg to only inhibit 74% of MAO-A enzymes and dosages in the 900–1200 mg range to inhibit slightly less MAO-A than phenelzine (Nardil) at 45–60 mg; subsequently, it is highly plausible that reports of lower efficacy could be largely or entirely the consequence of conservative dosage guidelines rather than the pharmacological properties of the drug. Previously, it was widely reported that both MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes were responsible for the metabolism of dopamine; however, new research suggests that MAO-B enzymes are involved in the generation of GABA and not the degradation of dopamine. There is also some evidence of moclobemide possessing neuroprotective properties in rodent models. There is no cumulative effect of moclobemide centrally when taken long-term. With long-term use of moclobemide, there is a significant down-regulation of B-adrenoceptors. Single or repeated dosing with 100–300 mg of moclobemide leads to a reduction in deaminated metabolites of amines such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylglycol as well as 5-HIAA. Excretion of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid via urine is also reduced. There is also a temporary increase in prolactin during initial intake of 100–300 mg of moclobemide. L-dihydroxyphenylalanine is also reduced. Inhibition of the serotonin metabolite is less pronounced than the norepinephrine metabolite which suggests there are other major metabolic pathways for serotonin other than MAO-A. It has been described as a 'slow binding inhibitor', whereby conformational changes to either moclobemide or the enzyme to MAO-A slowly form a more tightly bound complex, resulting in the non-competitive MAO inhibition by moclobemide. With three times daily dosing the inhibition on MAO-A was relatively constant with moclobemide. The MAO inhibition of moclobemide lasts about 8–10 hours and wears off completely by 24 hours after dosing. The inhibition of MAO-A by moclobemide is 10 times more potent than the irreversible MAOI phenelzine and approximately equivalent to tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid. Moclobemide increases levels of extracellular monoamines and decreases levels of their metabolites in rat brains; tolerance to these effects does not seem to occur with chronic use of moclobemide. Moclobemide lacks anticholinergic effects and cognitive impairments can be improved by moclobemide. Moclobemide suppresses the unstimulated release of certain proinflammatory cytokines which are believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and stimulates the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Long-term treatment with moclobemide leads to an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binding to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Moclobemide is chemically unrelated to irreversible MAOI antidepressants and only has a very weak pressor effect of orally administered tyramine. In humans, the n-oxide metabolites of moclobemide and moclobemide itself are the compounds that produce most of the inhibition of MAO-A; other metabolites are significantly less potent than the parent compound. In healthy people moclobemide has a relatively small suppressing effect on REM sleep; in contrast, depressed people who have been treated with moclobemide, progressively show improved sleep over a 4-week period, with an increase in stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. There have been conflicting findings with regard to moclobemide altering cortisol levels and whether moclobemide increases growth hormone levels. Testosterone levels increase significantly with long-term use of moclobemide in depressed males. Moclobemide also has neuroprotective properties in its demonstrated anti-hypoxia or anti-ischemia effects; there is a possibility that moclobemide may possess similar neuro-rescuing properties, similar to selegiline, however, research is required to determine this. Moclobemide has also been demonstrated in a single dose research study to possess antinociceptive properties. Platelet MAO is of the MAO-B and this is inhibited only to a small degree in humans; the inhibition is due to low levels of metabolites of moclobemide that have MAO-B inhibiting properties. Moclobemide has been reported to be a mixed MAO-A/MAO-B inhibitor in rats but in man, it has been reported to be a pure MAO-A inhibitor, blocking the decomposition of norepinephrine, serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. No reuptake inhibition of any of the neurotransmitters occurs. The pharmacodynamic action encompasses activation, elevation of mood, and improvement of symptoms like dysphoria, fatigue, and difficulties in concentration. The duration and quality of sleep may be improved. In the treatment of depression the antidepressant effect often becomes evident in the first week of therapy (earlier than typically noted with TCAs/SSRIs). MAO activity returns completely back to normal after 24 hours of the last dose, which allows for a quick switch to another antidepressant after the 24 hours. == Pharmacokinetics == In humans moclobemide is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and totally metabolised via the liver. Peak plasma levels occur 0.3 to 2 hours after oral administration. The bioavailability increases during the first week of therapy from 60% to 80% and more. The elimination half-life is around 2 hours. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. However, the short disposition half life somewhat increases after repeated dosing; moclobemide has an intermediate elimination half life for systemic clearance and an intermediate volume of distribution. Despite its short half-life the pharmacodynamic action of a single dose persists for approximately 16 hours. The drug is almost completely metabolized in the liver; it is a substrate of CYP2C19 and an inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Less than 1 percent of the drug is excreted unchanged; 92 percent of the metabolised drug is excreted within the first 12 hours. The main metabolites are the N-oxide Ro 12-5637 formed via morpholine N-oxidation and lactam derivative Ro 12-8095 formed via morpholine C-oxidation; active metabolites are found only in trace amounts. The unchanged drug (less than 1%) as well as the metabolites are excreted renally (in urine). The main degradation pathway of moclobemide is oxidation. About 44 percent of the drug is lost due to the first pass effect through the liver. Age and renal function do not affect the pharmacokinetics of moclobemide. However, patients with significantly reduced liver function require dose reductions due to the significant slowing of metabolism of moclobemide. Food slows the absorption but does not affect the bioavailability of moclobemide. Steady state concentrations are established after one week. It has been suggested that changes in dose should not be made with a gap of less than a week. Moclobemide has good penetration across the blood brain barrier with peak plasma levels within the central nervous system occurring 2 hours after administration. == Animal toxicology == Acute toxicity: The oral LD50 values in mouse and rat are quite high, indicating a wide therapeutic index. LD50 for mice is 730 mg/kg and for rats 1,300 mg/kg. In dogs doses in excess of 300 mg/kg led to vomiting, salivation, ataxia, and drowsiness. Chronic toxicity: In an 18-months-study in rats with 10 mg/kg no signs of chronic toxicity were noted, with 50 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg only a slight loss of weight, and with 250 mg/kg mildly elevated Alkaline phosphatase and Gamma-GT. Studies in dogs revealed no toxicity relevant for humans. No evidence for a possible hepatic or cardiovascular toxicity was found. == History == Irreversible MAOI antidepressants were discovered accidentally in the 1950s but their popularity declined as their toxicity especially their dangerous food interactions became apparent and rival tricyclic antidepressants were discovered. Reversible MAOIs were developed in the hope that they would exert efficacy in depressive disorders but with less of the toxicity of the older irreversible compounds; moclobemide's discovery and marketing brought the renewed interest in MAOIs due to an absence of dangerous tyramine food interactions and potent antidepressant effects. In 1992 moclobemide was launched onto the world markets. Moclobemide was the first reversible MAO-A inhibitor to be widely marketed. Moclobemide as well as other newer antidepressants such as the SSRIs led to changes in prescribing patterns and broadened the treatment options for the management of depressive disorders. When moclobemide was discovered in 1972 in Switzerland, it was first hypothesized as being an antilipaemic or antibiotic, but the screenings were negative. The search for its antidepressant qualities, based on anticholinergic tests, also proved negative and moclobemide was then suspected of being an antipsychotic before its specific and reversible MAO-A inhibition qualities were detected. After the establishment of its lack of relevant interference with tyramine pressure response, clinical trials were launched in 1977 and further trials confirmed the broad antidepressant activity of RIMAs. It was first approved in Sweden in 1989 and then the United Kingdom and Europe as the first reversible and selective inhibitor of MAO-A and is now approved in over 50 countries worldwide. Subsequent research found that moclobemide is well tolerated in elderly patients and far superior to tricyclic antidepressants in terms of side effects, tolerability and overdose. With regard to effectiveness in the treatment of depression, moclobemide was determined to be as effective as all major antidepressant drug classes. There is no need for dietary restrictions in contrast to people on irreversible MAOIs and apart from an important interaction with other serotonergic enhancing agents such as SSRIs and pethidine, there are few serious drug interactions and because of these benefits, moclobemide became regarded as a beneficial addition to medical 'prescribing arsenal'. Additionally moclobemide was found, unlike most other antidepressants on the market, to actually improve all aspects of sexual function. It is the only reversible MAOI in use in clinical practice. The fact that moclobemide's pharmacokinetic properties are unaltered by age, that cognition is improved in the elderly, and moclobemide has low potential for food and drug interactions opened up a new avenue for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Due to a lack of financial incentive, such as the costs of conducting the necessary trials to gain approval, moclobemide is unavailable in the USA pharmaceutical market. In 2016 moclobemide was discontinued in Brazil for commercial reasons. == Society and culture == The Australian TGA approved moclobemide in December 2000. === Brands === It is sold under many trade names worldwide. == See also == Brofaromine == References == == Further reading == Scientific Information on Aurorix (German) PubChem Substance Summary: Moclobemide National Center for Biotechnology Information.",Manerix,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00019214690837543458), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002506331307813525)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicines.org.uk](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6661/smpc?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='Manerix 300 mg Film-coated Tablets - Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) - (emc)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/6661/smpc?utm_source=openai')])"

We evaluated the safety and antifibrotic effect of selonsertib, a selective inhibitor of ASK1, in patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH. We conducted 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trials of selonsertib in patients with NASH and bridging fibrosis (F3, STELLAR-3) or compensated cirrhosis (F4, STELLAR-4). Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive selonsertib 18 mg, selonsertib 6 mg, or placebo once daily for 48 weeks. Liver biopsies were performed at screening and week 48 and non-invasive tests of fibrosis (NITs) were evaluated. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with ≥1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH at week 48. Additional endpoints included changes in NITs, progression to cirrhosis (in STELLAR-3), and liver-related clinical events. Neither trial met the primary efficacy endpoint. In STELLAR-3, fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH was observed in 10% (31/322, p = 0.49 vs. placebo), 12% (39/321, p = 0.93 vs. placebo), and 13% (21/159) of patients in the selonsertib 18 mg, selonsertib 6 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In STELLAR-4, the primary endpoint was achieved in 14% (51/354; p = 0.56), 13% (45/351; p = 0.93), and 13% (22/172) of patients, respectively. Although selonsertib led to dose-dependent reductions in hepatic phospho-p38 expression indicative of pharmacodynamic activity, it had no significant effect on liver biochemistry, NITs, progression to cirrhosis, or adjudicated clinical events. The rates and types of adverse events were similar among selonsertib and placebo groups. Forty-eight weeks of selonsertib monotherapy had no antifibrotic effect in patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can develop scarring of the liver (fibrosis), including cirrhosis, which increases the risks of liver failure and liver cancer. We tested whether 48 weeks of treatment with selonsertib reduced fibrosis in patients with NASH and advanced liver scarring. We did not find that selonsertib reduced fibrosis in these patients. Clinicaltrials.gov numbers NCT03053050 and NCT03053063. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study, we compared the effects of selonsertib with placebo on eGFR decline in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Patients taking selonsertib had slower eGFR decline but were more likely to reach a composite kidney outcome and report AKI. A larger trial with longer-term follow-up would more precisely assess the relative benefits and risks of selonsertib in this setting. Selonsertib is an apoptosis signal–regulating kinase 1 inhibitor that reduces inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. The MOSAIC study evaluated whether selonsertib attenuated kidney function decline in patients with diabetic kidney disease.

Data obtained in human lung tissue and preclinical models suggest that oxidative stress and increased apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activity might have a prominent role in the pathobiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib compared with placebo in patients with PAH. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial at 46 centres located in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Participants were aged 18-75 years and had an established diagnosis of idiopathic or hereditary PAH, or PAH associated with connective tissue disease, drugs or toxins, human immunodeficiency virus, or repaired congenital heart defects. Patients were stratified by PAH aetiology and background therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) using an interactive voice-response or web-response system to placebo or selonsertib 2 mg, 6 mg, or 18 mg administered orally once daily. Both placebo and selonsertib were in tablet form. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in pulmonary vascular resistance, measured by right heart catheterisation, from baseline to week 24 in the full analysis set. Pair-wise comparisons between each of the selonsertib groups and the placebo group were made with a stratified Wilcoxon (van Elteren) rank sum test for participants without major protocol deviations who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02234141. Between Dec 3, 2014, and Nov 13, 2015, 151 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned. Of 150 participants who received selonsertib or placebo, 134 (89%) completed 24 weeks of the randomly assigned treatment; all were on background PAH therapy (138 [92%] on combination therapy). 90 (60%) patients were in functional class II and 60 (40%) in functional class III. Mean baseline pulmonary vascular resistance was 772 (SD 334) dyn·s/cm Selonsertib once daily for 24 weeks did not lead to a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance or to clinical improvement in patients with PAH, but appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Although these data do not support the clinical use of selonsertib in PAH, further study of the potential of targeting the ASK1-p38 pathway in PAH is warranted.

It was patented in 1969, and came into medical use in 1975. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 88th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fenofibrate is mainly used for primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Fenofibrate may slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy and the need for invasive treatment such as laser therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with pre-existing retinopathy. It was initially indicated for diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in Australia. The large scale, international FIELD and ACCORD-Eye trials found that fenofibrate therapy reduced required laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy by 1.5% over 5 years, as well as reducing progression by 3.7% over 4 years. Further studies looking at the role of fenofibrate in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as the primary outcome is warranted to understand its role in this condition. Although no statistically significant cardiovascular risk benefits were identified in these trials, benefits may accrue to add on therapy to patients with high triglyceride dyslipidaemia currently taking statin medications. Fenofibrate appears to reduce the risk of below ankle amputations in patients with Type 2 diabetes without microvascular disease. The FIELD study reported that fenofibrate at doses of 200 mg daily, reduced the risk for any amputation by 37% independent of glycaemic control, presence or absence of dyslipidaemia and its lipid-lowering mechanism of action. However, the cohort of participants who underwent amputations were more likely to have had previous cardiovascular disease (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction), longer duration of diabetes and had baseline neuropathy. Fenofibrate has an off-label use as an added therapy of high blood uric acid levels in people who have gout. It is used in addition to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. === Severe hypertriglyceridemia type IV or V === It is used in tandem with diet for treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetics showing fasting chylomicronemia usually reduces the need for pharmacologic intervention. Statins remain the first line for treatment of blood cholesterol. AHA guidelines from 2013 did not find evidence for routine use of additional medications. Additionally, in 2016, the FDA filed ""Withdrawal of Approval of Indications Related to the Coadministration With Statins in Applications for Niacin Extended-Release Tablets and Fenofibric Acid Delayed Release Capsules"" noting ""the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. Consistent with this conclusion, FDA has determined that the benefits of niacin ER tablets and fenofibric acid DR capsules for coadministration with statins no longer outweigh the risks, and the approvals for this indication should be withdrawn."" == Contraindications == Fenofibrate is contraindicated in: Patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis (2.7-fold increase in exposure, and increased accumulation during chronic dosing in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min) Patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function test abnormalities Patients with preexisting gallbladder disease Nursing mothers Hypothyroidism Patients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or fenofibric acid == Adverse effects == The most common adverse events (>3% of patients with coadministered statins) are === Precautions === When fenofibrate and a statin are given as combination therapy, it is recommended that fenofibrate be given in the morning and the statin at night, so that the peak dosages do not overlap. Musculoskeletal Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; increased risk when coadminstered with a statin, particularly in the elderly and patients with diabetes, kidney failure, hypothyroidism Hepatotoxicity Can increase serum transaminases; liver tests should be monitored periodically Nephrotoxicity Can increase serum creatinine levels; renal function should be monitored periodically in patients with chronic kidney disease Biliary Can increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to risk of cholelithiasis; if suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. See ""Interaction"" section under Bile acid sequestrant Coagulation/Bleeding Exercise caution in concomitant treatment with oral Coumadin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). Adjust the dosage of Coumadin to maintain the prothrombin time/INR at desired level to prevent bleeding complications. == Overdose == ""There is no specific treatment for overdose with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. General supportive care is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status"". Additionally, hemodialysis should not be considered as an overdose treatment option because fenofibrate heavily binds to plasma proteins and does not dialyze well. == Interactions == These drug interactions with fenofibrate are considered major and may need therapy modifications: Bile acid sequestrants (e.g. cholestyramine, colestipol, etc.): If taken together, bile acid resins may bind to fenofibrate, resulting in a decrease in fenofibrate absorption. To maximize absorption, patients need to separate administration by at least 1 h before or 4 h to 6 h after taking the bile acid sequestrant. Immunosuppressants (e.g. ciclosporin or tacrolimus): An increased risk of renal dysfunction exists with concomitant use of immunosuppressants and fenofibrate. Approach with caution when coadministering additional medications that decrease renal function. Vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin): As previously mentioned, fenofibrate interacts with coumadin anticoagulants to increase the risk of bleeding. Dosage adjustment of vitamin K antagonist may be necessary. Statins: Combination of statins and fenofibrate may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy. == Mechanism of action == ""In summary, enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles and reduced secretion of VLDL underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effect of fibrates, whereas their effect on HDL metabolism is associated with changes in HDL apolipoprotein expression."" Fenofibrate is a fibrate derivative, a prodrug comprising fenofibric acid linked to an isopropyl ester. It lowers lipid levels by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). PPARα activates lipoprotein lipase and reduces apoprotein CIII, which increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma. PPARα also increases apoproteins AI and AII, reduces VLDL- and LDL-containing apoprotein B, and increases HDL-containing apoprotein AI and AII. == Formulations == Fenofibrate is available in several formulations and is sold under several brand names, including: Tricor by AbbVie Lipofen by Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc Lofibra by Teva Lipanthyl, Lipidil, Lipantil micro and Supralip by Abbott Laboratories Fenocor-67 by Ordain Health Care Fenogal by SMB Laboratories Antara by Oscient Pharmaceuticals Tricheck by Zydus (CND) Atorva TG by Zydus Medica Golip by GolgiUSA Stanlip by Sun Pharma (India) The formulations may differ in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, particularly bioavailability; some must be taken with meals, whereas others may be taken without regard to food. The choline salt of fenofibrate is available in the United States, sold as Trilipix, and may be taken without regard to meals. == Environmental presence == Fenofibric acid was one of the 12 compounds identified in sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California that were associated with estrogenic activity in in vitro. == History == Fenofibrate was first synthesized in 1974, as a derivative of clofibrate, and was initially offered in France. It was initially known as procetofen, and was later renamed fenofibrate to comply with World Health Organization International Nonproprietary Name guidelines. Fenofibrate was developed by Groupe Fournier SA of France. == Society and culture == In the United States, Tricor was reformulated in 2005. This reformulation was controversial, seen as an attempt to stifle competition from generic equivalents, and was the subject of antitrust litigation by Teva. == References ==",Lipanthyl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006399490521289408), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005322334356606007)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mims.com](https://www.mims.com/Thailand/drug/info/Lipanthyl/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Lipanthyl Dosage & Drug Information | MIMS Thailand', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mims.com/Thailand/drug/info/Lipanthyl/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is also injected into lesions to treat inflammation in some parts of the body, particularly the skin. In nasal spray form, it is used to treat allergic rhinitis. It is used for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. It is a more potent derivative of triamcinolone, and is about eight times as potent as prednisone. Most forms of triamcinolone acetonide are prescription drugs. In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made triamcinolone acetonide an over-the-counter drug in the United States in nasal spray form under the brand name Nasacort. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Triamcinolone acetonide as an intra-articular injectable has been used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. When applied to the skin as a topical ointment, it is used to mitigate blistering from poison ivy, oak, and sumac. When combined with nystatin, it is used to treat skin infections with discomfort from fungus, though it should not be used on the eyes. It provides relatively immediate relief and is used before using oral prednisone. Oral and dental paste preparations are used for treating aphthous ulcers. As an intravitreal injection, triamcinolone acetonide has been used to treat various eye diseases and has been found useful in reducing macular edema. Drug trials have found it to be as efficient as anti-VEGF drugs in eyes with artificial lenses over a two-year period. A systematic review did not find any evidence of any benefit in preventing vision loss in eyes treated with triamcinolone acetonide over placebo, for patients with age-related macular degeneration. Triamcinolone acetonide is also administered via intralesional injection in the treatment of hypertrophic and keloid scars. == Contraindications == Evidence suggests that usage of triamcinolone acetonide or other steroids to treat macular edema increases the risk of increasing intraocular pressure in patients. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Triamcinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid. It is specifically a glucocorticoid, or an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, that is about five times as potent as cortisol. It has very little mineralocorticoid effects. The affinities of triamcinolone acetonide for the androgen and estrogen receptors are both <0.1% (relative to testosterone and estradiol). However, triamcinolone acetonide has 15% of the affinity of progesterone for the progesterone receptor. In relation to this, triamcinolone acetonide can produce endocrine side effects like ovulation inhibition and menstrual irregularities. == Chemistry == Triamcinolone acetonide, also known as 9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyprednisolone 16α,17α-acetonide or as 9α-fluoro-11β,16α-17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with acetone, is a synthetic halogenated cyclic ketal pregnane corticosteroid. It is the C16α,17α acetonide of triamcinolone. == Veterinary use == Triamcinolone acetonide is also used in veterinary medicine as an ingredient in topical ointments and in topical sprays for control of pruritus in dogs. A series of injections with triamcinolone acetonide or another corticosteroid may reduce keloid size and irritation. It is used as a preinductor and/or inductor of birth in cows. It was also used in the horse racing industry, but it is now a banned substance if found in a horse's system on race day. == References == == External links == ""Triamcinolone"". MedlinePlus.

1020,"('Clemastine (fumarate)', 'Meclastine (fumarate)', 'Clemastine', 'Meclastin', 'Mecloprodin')",Medical,"Clemastine, also known as meclastin, is a first-generation H1 histamine antagonist (antihistamine) with anticholinergic properties (drying) and sedative side effects. Like all first-generation antihistamines, it is sedating. Patented in 1960, it came into medical use in 1967. == Medical uses == Clemastine is used to relieve hay fever and allergy symptoms, including sneezing; runny nose; and red, itchy, tearing eyes. Prescription strength clemastine is also used to relieve the itching and swelling of hives. == Side effects == Overdosage symptoms are paradoxical, ranging from CNS depression to stimulation. Stimulation is most common in children, and is usually followed by excitement, hallucinations, ataxia, loss of coordination, muscle twitching, athetosis, hyperthermia, cyanosis, convulsions, tremors, and hyperreflexia. This may be followed by postictal depression and cardiovascular/respiratory arrest. Other common overdose symptoms include dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing of the face, and pyrexia. In adults, overdose usually leads to CNS depression, ranging from drowsiness to coma. Continuous and/or cumulative use of anticholinergic medications, including first-generation antihistamines, is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people. == Pharmacology == Clemastine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic and sedative effects. Antihistamines competitively bind to histamine receptor sites, thus reducing the neurotransmitter's effects. Effects of histamine (which are countered by antihistamines) include: Increased capillary permeability Increased capillary dilatation Edema (i.e., swelling) Pruritus (Itch) Gastrointestinal/respiratory smooth muscle constriction Clemastine inhibits both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, the drug can produce paradoxical effects, including CNS stimulation or depression. Most antihistamines exhibit some type of anticholinergic activity. Antihistamines act by competitively binding to H1-receptor sites, thus blocking the binding of endogenous histamine. Antihistamines do not chemically inactivate or prevent the normal release of histamine. Clemastine does also act as FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase). Clemastine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak plasma concentrations are attained in 2–4 hours. Antihistamines are thought to be metabolized in the liver, mostly by mono-/didemethylation and glucuronide conjugation. It is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 and may interfere with other drugs metabolized by this isozyme. == Mechanism of action == Clemastine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist. It binds to the histamine H1 receptor, thus blocking the action of endogenous histamine, which leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms caused by histamine. == Society and culture == Clemastine is an OTC drug, and is available under many names and dosage forms worldwide. Most common brand name is Tavegyl. == Research == Clemastine has been studied for its potential to treat several psychiatric and neurological disorders, including possibly promoting remyelination and myelin repair in conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS). Early phase II clinical trials showed promise for promoting remyelination in patients with MS, with clemastine improving nerve conduction velocity in the optic nerve. However, a clinical trial (TRAP-MS) was halted in early 2024 after researchers found the disability progression was occurring at a significantly faster rate than anticipated in three participants with MS receiving clemastine. == References == == External links == NIH Medline Plus listing on Clemastine The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of clemastine and phenylpropanolamine in single-component and combination formulations",Mecloprodin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002481246367096901), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02397347055375576), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06254079192876816)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -6.704273118884885e-07)])","('MEDICAL; ([decs.bvsalud.org](https://decs.bvsalud.org/en/ths/resource/?id=2999&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='DeCS', type='url_citation', url='https://decs.bvsalud.org/en/ths/resource/?id=2999&utm_source=openai')])"

1022,"('Mosapride (citrate)', 'Mosapride', 'Mosapride [inn]', 'Mosapride (inn)', 'Mosart')",Medical,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791) was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition and proficiency from an early age resulted in more than 800 works representing virtually every Western classical genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoires. Mozart is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its ""melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture"". Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. At age five, he was already competent on keyboard and violin, had begun to compose, and performed before European royalty. His father took him on a grand tour of Europe and then three trips to Italy. At 17, he was a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. Mozart's search for employment led to positions in Paris, Mannheim, Munich, and again in Salzburg, during which he wrote his five violin concertos, Sinfonia Concertante, and Concerto for Flute and Harp, as well as sacred pieces and masses, the motet Exsultate Jubilate, and the opera Idomeneo, among other works. While visiting Vienna in 1781, Mozart was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He stayed in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During Mozart's early years in Vienna, he produced several notable works, such as the opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail, the Great Mass in C minor, the ""Haydn"" Quartets and a number of symphonies. Throughout his Vienna years, Mozart composed over a dozen piano concertos, many considered some of his greatest achievements. In the final years of his life, Mozart wrote many of his best-known works, including his last three symphonies, culminating in the Jupiter Symphony, the serenade Eine kleine Nachtmusik, his Clarinet Concerto, the operas The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, Così fan tutte and The Magic Flute and his Requiem. The Requiem was largely unfinished at the time of his death at age 35, the circumstances of which are uncertain and much mythologised. == Life and career == === Early life === ==== Family and childhood ==== Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to Leopold Mozart and Anna Maria, née Pertl, at Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg. Salzburg was the capital of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, an ecclesiastic principality in the Holy Roman Empire (today in Austria). He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was Maria Anna Mozart, nicknamed ""Nannerl"". Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in Latinised form, as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. He generally called himself ""Wolfgang Amadè Mozart"" as an adult, but his name had many variants. Leopold Mozart, a native of Augsburg, then an Imperial Free City in the Holy Roman Empire, was a minor composer and an experienced teacher. In 1743, he was appointed as the fourth violinist in the musical establishment of Count Leopold Anton von Firmian, the ruling Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. Four years later, he married Anna Maria in Salzburg. Leopold became the orchestra's deputy Kapellmeister in 1763. During the year of his son's birth, Leopold published a violin textbook, Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule, which achieved success. When Nannerl was seven, she began keyboard lessons with her father, while her three-year-old brother looked on. Years later, after her brother's death, she reminisced: He often spent much time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good. ... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier. ... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time. ... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down. These early pieces, K. 1–5, were recorded in the Nannerl Notenbuch. There is some scholarly debate about whether Mozart was four or five years old when he created his first musical compositions, though there is little doubt that Mozart composed his first three pieces of music within a few weeks of each other: K. 1a, 1b, and 1c. In his early years, Wolfgang's father was his only teacher. Along with music, he taught his children languages and academic subjects. Biographer Solomon notes that, while Leopold was a devoted teacher to his children, there is evidence that Mozart was keen to progress beyond what he was taught. His first ink-spattered composition and his precocious efforts with the violin were of his initiative and came as a surprise to Leopold, who eventually gave up composing when his son's musical talents became evident. ==== 1762–73: Travel ==== While Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as child prodigies. These began with an exhibition in 1762 at the court of Prince-elector Maximilian III of Bavaria in Munich, and at the Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague. A long concert tour followed, spanning three and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich, Mannheim, Paris, London, Dover, The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen and again to Paris, and back home via Zürich, Donaueschingen, and Munich. During this trip, Wolfgang met many musicians and acquainted himself with the works of other composers. A particularly significant influence was Johann Christian Bach, whom he visited in London in 1764 and 1765. When he was eight years old, Mozart wrote his first symphony, most of which was probably transcribed by his father. The family trips were often challenging, and travel conditions were primitive. They had to wait for invitations and reimbursement from the nobility, and they endured long, near-fatal illnesses far from home: first Leopold (London, summer 1764), then both children (The Hague, autumn 1765). The family again went to Vienna in late 1767 and remained there until December 1768. After one year in Salzburg, Leopold and Wolfgang set off for Italy, leaving Anna Maria and Nannerl at home. This tour lasted from December 1769 to March 1771. As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son's abilities as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer. Wolfgang met Josef Mysliveček and Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna and was accepted as a member of the famous Accademia Filarmonica. There exists a myth, according to which, while in Rome, he heard Gregorio Allegri's Miserere twice in performance in the Sistine Chapel. Allegedly, he subsequently wrote it out from memory, thus producing the ""first unauthorised copy of this closely guarded property of the Vatican"". However, both the origin and plausibility of this account are disputed. In Milan, Mozart wrote the opera Mitridate, re di Ponto (1770), which was performed with success. This led to further opera commissions. He returned with his father twice to Milan (August–December 1771; October 1772 – March 1773) for the composition and premieres of Ascanio in Alba (1771) and Lucio Silla (1772). Leopold hoped these visits would result in a professional appointment for his son, and indeed ruling Archduke Ferdinand contemplated hiring Mozart, but owing to his mother Empress Maria Theresa's reluctance to employ ""useless people"", the matter was dropped and Leopold's hopes were never realised. Toward the end of the journey, Mozart wrote the solo motet Exsultate, jubilate, K.165. === 1773–77: Employment at the Salzburg court === After finally returning with his father from Italy on 13 March 1773, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg, Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. The composer had many friends and admirers in Salzburg and had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, masses, serenades, and a few minor operas. Between April and December 1775, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication. The last three—K. 216, K. 218, K. 219—are now staples of the repertoire. In 1776, he turned his efforts to piano concertos, culminating in the E♭ concerto K. 271 of early 1777, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work. Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year; Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in 1775 when the court theatre was closed, especially since the other theatre in Salzburg was primarily reserved for visiting troupes. Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay. Mozart and his father visited Vienna from 14 July to 26 September 1773, and Munich from 6 December 1774 to March 1775. Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera La finta giardiniera. === 1777–78: Journey to Paris === In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich. Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing, and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778 to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at Versailles, but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment. He fell into debt and took to pawning valuables. The nadir of the visit occurred when Mozart's mother was taken ill and died on 3 July 1778. There had been delays in calling a doctor—probably, according to Halliwell, because of a lack of funds. Mozart stayed with Melchior Grimm at Marquise d'Épinay's residence, 5 rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin. While Mozart was in Paris, his father was pursuing opportunities of employment for him in Salzburg. With the support of the local nobility, Mozart was offered a post as court organist and concertmaster. The annual salary was 450 florins, but he was reluctant to accept. By that time, relations between Grimm and Mozart had cooled, and Mozart moved out. After leaving Paris in September 1778 for Strasbourg, he lingered in Mannheim and Munich, still hoping to obtain an appointment outside Salzburg. In Munich, he again encountered Aloysia, now a very successful singer, but she was no longer interested in him. Mozart finally returned to Salzburg on 15 January 1779 and took up his new appointment, but his discontent with Salzburg remained undiminished. Among the better-known works which Mozart wrote on the Paris journey are the A minor piano sonata, K. 310/300d, the ""Paris"" Symphony (No. 31), which were performed in Paris on 12 and 18 June 1778; and the Concerto for Flute and Harp in C major, K. 299/297c. === Vienna === ==== 1781: Departure ==== In January 1781, Mozart's opera Idomeneo premiered with ""considerable success"" in Munich. The following March, Mozart was summoned to Vienna, where his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, was attending the celebrations for the accession of Joseph II to the Austrian throne. For Colloredo, this was simply a matter of wanting his musical servant to be at hand (Mozart indeed was required to dine in Colloredo's establishment with the valets and cooks). He planned a bigger career as he continued in the archbishop's service; for example, he wrote to his father: My main goal right now is to meet the emperor in some agreeable fashion, I am absolutely determined he should get to know me. I would be so happy if I could whip through my opera for him and then play a fugue or two, for that's what he likes. Mozart did indeed soon meet the Emperor, who eventually was to support his career substantially with commissions and a part-time position. In the same letter to his father just quoted, Mozart outlined his plans to participate as a soloist in the concerts of the Tonkünstler-Societät, a prominent benefit concert series; this plan as well came to pass after the local nobility prevailed on Colloredo to drop his opposition. Colloredo's wish to prevent Mozart from performing outside his establishment was in other cases carried through, raising the composer's anger; one example was a chance to perform before the Emperor at Countess Thun's for a fee equal to half of his yearly Salzburg salary. The quarrel with the archbishop came to a head in May: Mozart attempted to resign and was refused. The following month, permission was granted, but in a grossly insulting way: the composer was dismissed literally ""with a kick in the arse"", administered by the archbishop's steward, Count Arco. Mozart decided to settle in Vienna as a freelance performer and composer. The quarrel with Colloredo was more difficult for Mozart because his father sided against him. Hoping fervently that he would obediently follow Colloredo back to Salzburg, Mozart's father exchanged intense letters with his son, urging him to be reconciled with their employer. Mozart passionately defended his intention to pursue an independent career in Vienna. The debate ended when Mozart was dismissed by the archbishop, freeing himself both of his employer and of his father's demands to return. Solomon characterizes Mozart's resignation as a ""revolutionary step"" that significantly altered the course of his life. ==== Early years ==== Mozart's new career in Vienna began well. He often performed as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with Muzio Clementi on 24 December 1781, and he soon ""had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna"". He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail (""The Abduction from the Seraglio""), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved considerable success. The work was soon being performed ""throughout German-speaking Europe"", and thoroughly established Mozart's reputation as a composer. Near the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from Mannheim. The family's father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet. ==== Marriage and children ==== After failing to win the hand of Aloysia Weber, who was now married to the actor and artist Joseph Lange, Mozart's interest shifted to the third daughter of the family, Constanze. The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly broke up in April 1782, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her calves in a parlour game). Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his father, Leopold. The marriage took place in an atmosphere of crisis. Daniel Heartz suggests that eventually, Constanze moved in with Mozart, which would have placed her in disgrace by the mores of the time. Mozart wrote to Leopold on 31 July 1782, ""All the good and well-intentioned advice you have sent fails to address the case of a man who has already gone so far with a maiden. Further postponement is out of the question."" Heartz relates, ""Constanze's sister Sophie had tearfully declared that her mother would send the police after Constanze if she did not return home [presumably from Mozart's apartment]."" On 4 August, Mozart wrote to Baroness von Waldstätten, asking: ""Can the police here enter anyone's house in this way? Perhaps it is only a ruse of Madame Weber to get her daughter back. If not, I know no better remedy than to marry Constanze tomorrow morning or if possible today."" The couple were finally married on 4 August 1782 in St. Stephen's Cathedral, the day before his father's consenting letter arrived in the mail. In the marriage contract, Constanze ""assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which ... the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden"", with the total ""to pass to the survivor"". Further, all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both. The couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy: Raimund Leopold (17 June – 19 August 1783) Karl Thomas Mozart (21 September 1784 – 31 October 1858) Johann Thomas Leopold (18 October – 15 November 1786) Theresia Constanzia Adelheid Friedericke Maria Anna (27 December 1787 – 29 June 1788) Anna Maria (died soon after birth, 16 November 1789) Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (26 July 1791 – 29 July 1844) === 1782–87 === In 1782 and 1783, Mozart became intimately acquainted with the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel as a result of the influence of Gottfried van Swieten, who owned many manuscripts of the Baroque masters. Mozart's study of these scores inspired compositions in the Baroque style and later influenced his musical language, for example in fugal passages in Die Zauberflöte (""The Magic Flute"") and the finale of Symphony No. 41. In 1783, Mozart and his wife visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially polite to Constanze, but the visit prompted the composition of one of Mozart's great liturgical pieces, the Mass in C minor. Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part. Mozart met Joseph Haydn in Vienna around 1784, and the two composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they sometimes played together in an impromptu string quartet. Mozart's six quartets dedicated to Haydn (K. 387, K. 421, K. 428, K. 458, K. 464, and K. 465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn's Opus 33 set from 1781. Haydn wrote, ""posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"" and in 1785 told Mozart's father: ""I tell you before God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition."" From 1782 to 1785 Mozart mounted concerts with himself as a soloist, presenting three or four new piano concertos in each season. Since space in the theatres was scarce, he booked unconventional venues: a large room in the Trattnerhof apartment building, and the ballroom of the Mehlgrube restaurant. The concerts were very popular, and his concertos premiered there are still firm fixtures in the repertoire. Solomon writes that during this period, Mozart created ""a harmonious connection between an eager composer-performer and a delighted audience, which was given the opportunity of witnessing the transformation and perfection of a major musical genre"". With substantial returns from his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart and his wife adopted a more luxurious lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins. Mozart bought a fine fortepiano from Anton Walter for about 900 florins, and a billiard table for about 300. The Mozarts sent their son Karl Thomas to an expensive boarding school and kept servants. During this period Mozart saved little of his income. On 14 December 1784, Mozart became a Freemason, admitted to the lodge Zur Wohltätigkeit (""Beneficence""). Freemasonry played an essential role in the remainder of Mozart's life: he attended meetings, a number of his friends were Masons, and on various occasions, he composed Masonic music, e.g. the Maurerische Trauermusik. ==== 1786–87: Return to opera ==== Despite the great success of Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Mozart did little operatic writing for the next four years, producing only two unfinished works and the one-act Der Schauspieldirektor. He focused instead on his career as a piano soloist and writer of concertos. Around the end of 1785, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing and began his famous operatic collaboration with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte. The year 1786 saw the successful premiere of Le nozze di Figaro in Vienna. Its reception in Prague later in the year was even warmer, and this led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte: the opera Don Giovanni, which premiered in October 1787 to acclaim in Prague, but less success in Vienna during 1788. The two are among Mozart's most famous works and are mainstays of operatic repertoire today, though at their premieres their musical complexity caused difficulty both for listeners and for performers. These developments were not witnessed by Mozart's father, who had died on 28 May 1787. In December 1787, Mozart finally obtained a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed him as his ""chamber composer"", a post that had fallen vacant the previous month on the death of Gluck. It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the Redoutensaal (see Mozart and dance). This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. Court records show that Joseph aimed to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects. In 1787, the young Ludwig van Beethoven spent several weeks in Vienna, hoping to study with Mozart. No reliable records survive to indicate whether the two composers ever met. === Later years === ==== 1788–90 ==== Toward the end of the decade, Mozart's circumstances worsened. Around 1786, he ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank. This was a difficult time for musicians in Vienna because of the Austro-Turkish War: both the general level of prosperity and the ability of the aristocracy to support music had declined. According to Solomon, in 1788, Mozart saw a 66% decline in his income compared to his best years in 1781. By mid-1788, Mozart and his family had moved from central Vienna to the suburb of Alsergrund. Although it has been suggested that Mozart aimed to reduce his rental expenses by moving to a suburb, as he wrote in his letter to Michael von Puchberg, Mozart had not reduced his expenses but merely increased the housing space at his disposal. Mozart began to borrow money, most often from his friend and fellow mason Puchberg; ""a pitiful sequence of letters pleading for loans"" survives. Maynard Solomon and others have suggested that Mozart was suffering from depression, and it seems his musical output slowed. Major works of the period include the last three symphonies (Nos. 39, 40, and 41, all from 1788), and the last of the three Da Ponte operas, Così fan tutte, premiered in 1790. Around this time, Mozart made some long journeys hoping to improve his fortunes, visiting Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin in the spring of 1789, and Frankfurt, Mannheim, and other German cities in 1790. ==== 1791 ==== Mozart's last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity—and by some accounts, one of personal recovery. He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera The Magic Flute; the final piano concerto (K. 595 in B♭); the Clarinet Concerto K. 622; the last in his series of string quintets (K. 614 in E♭); the motet Ave verum corpus K. 618; and the unfinished Requiem K. 626. Mozart's financial situation, a source of anxiety in 1790, finally began to improve. Although the evidence is inconclusive, it appears that wealthy patrons in Hungary and Amsterdam pledged annuities to Mozart in return for the occasional composition. He is thought to have benefited from the sale of dance music written in his role as Imperial chamber composer. Mozart no longer borrowed large sums from Puchberg and began to pay off his debts. He experienced great satisfaction in the public success of some of his works, notably The Magic Flute (which was performed several times in the short period between its premiere and Mozart's death) and the Little Masonic Cantata K. 623, premiered on 17 November 1791. ==== Final illness and death ==== Mozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on 6 September 1791, of his opera La clemenza di Tito, which was written in that same year on commission for Emperor Leopold II's coronation festivities. He continued his professional functions for some time and conducted the premiere of The Magic Flute on 30 September. His health deteriorated on 20 November, at which point he became bedridden, suffering from swelling, pain, and vomiting. Mozart was nursed in his final days by his wife and her youngest sister and was attended by the family doctor, Thomas Franz Closset. He was mentally occupied with the task of finishing his Requiem, but the evidence that he dictated passages to his student Franz Xaver Süssmayr is minimal. Mozart died in his home on 5 December 1791(1791-12-05) (aged 35) at 12:55 am. The New Grove describes his funeral: Mozart was interred in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the St. Marx Cemetery outside the city on 7 December. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later Otto Jahn (1856) wrote that Salieri, Süssmayr, van Swieten and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day was calm and mild. The expression ""common grave"" refers to neither a communal grave nor a pauper's grave, but an individual grave for a member of the common people (i.e., not the aristocracy). Common graves were subject to excavation after ten years; the graves of aristocrats were not. The cause of Mozart's death is not known with certainty. The official record of hitziges Frieselfieber (""severe miliary fever"", referring to a rash that looks like millet seeds) is more a symptomatic description than a diagnosis. Researchers have suggested more than a hundred causes of death, including acute rheumatic fever, streptococcal infection, trichinosis, influenza, mercury poisoning, and a rare kidney ailment. Mozart's modest funeral did not reflect his standing with the public as a composer; memorial services and concerts in Vienna and Prague were well attended. Indeed, in the period immediately after his death, his reputation rose substantially. Solomon describes an ""unprecedented wave of enthusiasm"" for his work; biographies were written first by Schlichtegroll, Niemetschek, and Nissen, and publishers vied to produce complete editions of his works. == Appearance and character == Mozart's physical appearance was described by tenor Michael Kelly in his Reminiscences: ""a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain"". His early biographer Niemetschek wrote, ""there was nothing special about [his] physique. ... He was small and his countenance, except for his large intense eyes, gave no signs of his genius."" His facial complexion was pitted, a reminder of his childhood case of smallpox. Of his voice, his wife later wrote that it ""was a tenor, rather soft in speaking and delicate in singing, but when anything excited him, or it became necessary to exert it, it was both powerful and energetic."" He loved elegant clothing. Kelly remembered him at a rehearsal: ""[He] was on the stage with his crimson pelisse and gold-laced cocked hat, giving the time of the music to the orchestra."" Based on paintings that researchers were able to find of Mozart, he seemed to wear a white wig for most of his formal occasions—researchers of the Salzburg Mozarteum declared that only one of his fourteen portraits they had found showed him without his wig. Mozart usually worked long and hard, finishing compositions at a tremendous pace as deadlines approached. He often made sketches and drafts; unlike Beethoven's, these are mostly not preserved, as his wife sought to destroy them after his death. Mozart lived at the centre of the Viennese musical world and knew a significant number and variety of people: fellow musicians, theatrical performers, fellow Salzburgers, and aristocrats, including some acquaintance with Emperor Joseph II. Solomon considers his three closest friends to have been Gottfried von Jacquin, Count August Hatzfeld, and Sigmund Barisani; others included his elder colleague Joseph Haydn, singers Franz Xaver Gerl and Benedikt Schack, and the horn player Joseph Leutgeb. Leutgeb and Mozart carried on a kind of friendly mockery, often with Leutgeb as the butt of Mozart's practical jokes. He enjoyed billiards, dancing, and kept pets, including a canary, a starling, a dog, and a horse for recreational riding. He had a startling fondness for scatological humour, which is preserved in his surviving letters, notably those written to his cousin Maria Anna Thekla Mozart around 1777–1778, and in his correspondence with his sister and parents. Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of canons that he sang with his friends. He had an ear for languages, and having travelled all over Europe as a boy, was fluent in Latin, Italian, and French in addition to his native Salzburg dialect of German. He possibly also understood and spoke some English, having jokingly written ""You are an ass"" after his 19-year-old student Thomas Attwood made a thoughtless mistake on his exercise papers. Mozart was raised a Catholic and remained a devout member of the Church throughout his life. He embraced the teachings of Freemasonry in 1784. == Works, musical style, and innovations == === Style === Mozart's music, like Haydn's, stands as an archetype of the Classical style. At the time he began composing, European music was dominated by the style galant, a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the Baroque. Progressively, and in large part at the hands of Mozart himself, the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new forms, and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu. Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularised the Classical piano concerto. He wrote a great deal of religious music, including large-scale masses, as well as dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment. The central traits of the Classical style are all present in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491; the Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550; and the opera Don Giovanni. Charles Rosen makes the point forcefully: It is only through recognising the violence and sensuality at the centre of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterisation of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous. During his last decade, Mozart frequently exploited chromatic harmony. A notable instance is his String Quartet in C major, K. 465 (1785), whose introduction abounds in chromatic suspensions, giving rise to the work's nickname, the ""Dissonance"" quartet. Mozart had a gift for absorbing and adapting the valuable features of others' music. His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language. In London as a child, he met J. C. Bach and heard his music. In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, as well as the avant-garde capabilities of the Mannheim orchestra. In Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which deeply affected the evolution of his practice. In London and Italy, the galant style was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for cadencing; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements. Some of Mozart's early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are homotonal (all three movements having the same key signature, with the slow middle movement being in the relative minor). Others mimic the works of J. C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms turned out by Viennese composers. As Mozart matured, he progressively incorporated more features adapted from the Baroque. For example, the Symphony No. 29 in A major K. 201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published Opus 20 set. The influence of the Sturm und Drang (""Storm and Stress"") period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era, is evident in the music of both composers at that time. Mozart's Symphony No. 25 in G minor K. 183 is another excellent example. Mozart would sometimes switch his focus between operas and instrumental music. He produced operas in each of the prevailing styles: opera buffa, such as Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte; opera seria, such as Idomeneo; and Singspiel, of which Die Zauberflöte is the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he employed subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestral texture, and tone colour, for emotional depth and to mark dramatic shifts. Here, his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted: his increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concertos influenced his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was in turn reflected in his later non-operatic compositions. === Köchel catalogue === For unambiguous identification of works by Mozart, a Köchel catalogue number is used. This is a unique number assigned, in regular chronological order, to every one of his known works. A work is referenced by the abbreviation ""K."" or ""KV"" followed by this number. The first edition of the catalogue was completed in 1862 by Ludwig von Köchel. It has since been repeatedly updated, as scholarly research improves knowledge of the dates and authenticity of individual works. === Instruments === Although some of Mozart's early pieces were written for harpsichord, he also became acquainted in his early years with fortepianos made by Regensburg builder Franz Jakob Späth. Later when Mozart was visiting Augsburg, he was impressed by Stein fortepianos and shared this in a letter to his father. On 22 October 1777, Mozart had premiered his triple-piano concerto, K. 242, on instruments provided by Stein. The Augsburg Cathedral organist Demmler was playing the first, Mozart the second and Stein the third part. In 1783, when living in Vienna he purchased an instrument by Walter. Leopold Mozart confirmed the attachment which Mozart had with his Walter fortepiano: ""It is impossible to describe the hustle and bustle. Your brother's pianoforte has been moved at least twelve times from his house to the theatre or to someone else's house."" == Influence == His most famous pupil was Johann Nepomuk Hummel, a transitional figure between the Classical and Romantic eras whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home for two years as a child. More important is the influence Mozart had on composers of later generations. Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of a classical musician's training. Ludwig van Beethoven, Mozart's junior by fifteen years, was deeply influenced by his work, with which he was acquainted as a teenager. He is thought to have performed Mozart's operas while playing in the court orchestra at Bonn and travelled to Vienna in 1787 hoping to study with the older composer. Some of Beethoven's works have direct models in comparable works by Mozart, and he wrote cadenzas (WoO 58) to Mozart's D minor piano concerto K. 466. Composers have paid homage to Mozart by writing sets of variations on his themes. Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op. 66, WoO 28, WoO 40, WoO 46). Others include Fernando Sor's Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart (1821), Mikhail Glinka's Variations on a Theme from Mozart's Opera The Magic Flute (1822), Frédéric Chopin's Variations on ""Là ci darem la mano"" from Don Giovanni (1827), and Max Reger's Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart (1914), based on the variation theme in the piano sonata K. 331. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who revered Mozart, wrote his Orchestral Suite No. 4 in G, Mozartiana (1887), as a tribute to him. == References == === Notes === === Citations === === Sources === == Further reading == See Buch 2017 for an extensive bibliography == External links == Homepage for the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation ""Discovering Mozart"".

This phase 1 study aimed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of LY3295668 erbumine, an AurA inhibitor, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Methods Patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and disease progression after one to four prior treatment regimens were enrolled. Primary objective was to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary objectives included evaluation of the tolerability and safety profile and pharmacokinetics of LY3295668. All patients received twice-daily (BID) oral LY3295668 in 21-day cycles in an ascending-dose schedule. Results Twelve patients were enrolled in phase 1 (25 mg, n = 8; 50 mg, n = 2; 75 mg, n = 2) and one patient was enrolled after. Overall, four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the first cycle (75 mg: Grade 3 diarrhea [one patient], Grade 4 mucositis and Grade 3 corneal deposits [one patient]; 50 mg: mucositis and diarrhea [both Grade 3, one patient]; 25 mg: Grade 3 mucositis [one patient]). Patients exhibiting DLTs had the highest model-predicted exposures at steady state. Mucositis was the most common adverse event (67%), followed by diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, anorexia, constipation, and nausea. Nine patients had best response of stable disease; the disease control rate was 69%. Conclusions MTD of LY3295668 was 25 mg BID. LY3295668 had a manageable toxicity profile and demonstrated activity in some patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03092934.

Although Aurora A, B, and C kinases share high sequence similarity, especially within the kinase domain, they function distinctly in cell-cycle progression. Aurora A depletion primarily leads to mitotic spindle formation defects and consequently prometaphase arrest, whereas Aurora B/C inactivation primarily induces polyploidy from cytokinesis failure. Aurora B/C inactivation phenotypes are also epistatic to those of Aurora A, such that the concomitant inactivation of Aurora A and B, or all Aurora isoforms by nonisoform-selective Aurora inhibitors, demonstrates the Aurora B/C-dominant cytokinesis failure and polyploidy phenotypes. Several Aurora inhibitors are in clinical trials for T/B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, lung, and breast cancers. Here, we describe an Aurora A-selective inhibitor, LY3295668, which potently inhibits Aurora autophosphorylation and its kinase activity  Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an often-lethal skin cancer with increasing incidence and limited treatment options. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have become the standard of care in advanced MCC, 50% of all MCC patients are ineligible for ICIs, and amongst those treated, many patients develop resistance. There is no therapeutic alternative for these patients, highlighting the urgent clinical need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Using patient-derived genetic insights and data generated in our lab, we identified aurora kinase as a promising therapeutic target for MCC. In this study, we examined the efficacy of the recently developed and highly selective AURKA inhibitor, AK-01 (LY3295668), in six patient-derived MCC cell lines and two MCC cell-line-derived xenograft mouse models. We found that AK-01 potently suppresses MCC survival through apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, particularly in MCPyV-negative MCC cells without RB expression. Despite the challenge posed by its short in vivo durability upon discontinuation, the swift and substantial tumor suppression with low toxicity makes AK-01 a strong potential candidate for MCC management, particularly in combination with existing regimens.",Aurora a kinase inhibitor ly3295668,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001662831346038729), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003183418419212103)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33479856/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Aurora kinase A inhibitor, LY3295668 erbumine: a phase 1 monotherapy safety study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33479856/?utm_source=openai')])"
1024,"('Melflufen (hydrochloride)', 'Melphalan flufenamide (hydrochloride)', 'Melphalan flufenamide', 'Melflufen', 'Prodrug j 1')",Medical,"Melphalan flufenamide, sold under the brand names Pepaxto and Pepaxti, is an anticancer medication used to treat multiple myeloma. The most common adverse reactions include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, elevated body temperature and respiratory tract infections. Melphalan flufenamide was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2021, and in the European Union in August 2022. == Medical uses == In the United States before market withdrawal, melphalan flufenamide was indicated in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy and whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one CD-38 directed monoclonal antibody. In the European Union, melphalan flufenamide is indicated, in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapies, whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. == Metabolism == Melphalan flufenamide is metabolized by aminopeptidase hydrolysis and by spontaneous hydrolysis on N-mustard. == Origin and development == Melphalan flufenamide is a peptidase enhanced cytotoxic (PEnC) with a targeted delivery within tumor cells of melphalan, a widely used classical chemotherapeutic belonging to a group of alkylating agents developed more than 50 years ago. Substantial clinical experience has been accumulated about melphalan since then. Numerous derivatives of melphalan, designed to increase the activity or selectivity, have been developed and investigated in vitro or in animal models. Melphalan flufenamide was synthesized, partly due to previous experience of an alkylating peptide cocktail named Peptichemio == Pharmacology == Compared to melphalan, melphalan flufenamide exhibits significantly higher in vitro and in vivo activity in several models of human cancer. A preclinical study, performed at Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, demonstrated that melphalan flufenamide induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cell lines, even those resistant to conventional treatment (including melphalan). In vivo effects in xenografted animals were also observed, and the results confirmed by M Chesi and co-workers – in a unique genetically engineered mouse model of multiple myeloma – are believed to be predictive of clinical efficacy. == Structure == Chemically, the drug is best described as the ethyl ester of a dipeptide consisting of melphalan and the amino acid 4-fluoro-L-phenylalanine. == Pharmacokinetics == Pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma samples showed a rapid formation of melphalan; concentrations generally exceeded those of melphalan flufenamide during ongoing infusion. Melphalan flufenamide rapidly disappeared from plasma after infusion, while melphalan typically peaked a few minutes after the end of infusion. This suggests that melphalan flufenamide is rapidly and widely distributed to extravasal tissues, in which melphalan is formed and thereafter redistributed to plasma. This rapid disappearance from plasma is likely due to hydrolytic enzymes. The Zn(2+) dependent ectopeptidase (also known as alanine aminopeptidase), degrades proteins and peptides with a N-terminal neutral amino acid. Aminopeptidase N is frequently overexpressed in tumors and has been associated with the growth of different human cancers suggesting it as a suitable target for anti-cancerous therapy. == Adverse effects == In a human Phase 1 trial, no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at lower doses. At doses above 50 mg, reversible neutropenias and thrombocytopenias were observed, and particularly evident in heavily pretreated patients. These side-effects are shared by most chemotherapies, including alkylating agents in general. == Drug interactions == No drug interaction studies have been reported. Several in vitro studies indicate that melphalan flufenamide may be successfully combined with standard chemotherapy or targeted agents. == Therapeutic efficacy == In a Phase 1/2 trial, in solid tumor patients refractory to standard therapy, response evaluation showed disease stabilization in a majority of patients. In relapsed and refractory multiple-myeloma (RRMM) patients, promising activity was seen in heavily pre-treated RRMM patients where conventional therapies had failed; the median Progression-Free Survival was 9.4 months and the Duration of Response was 9.6 months. == History == Efficacy was evaluated in HORIZON (NCT02963493), a multicenter, single-arm trial. Eligible patients were required to have relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Patients received melphalan flufenamide 40 mg intravenously on day 1 and dexamethasone 40 mg orally (20 mg for patients ≥75 years of age) on day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was evaluated in a subpopulation of 97 patients who received four or more prior lines of therapy and were refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and a CD38-directed antibody. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved melphalan flufenamide based on evidence from a clinical trial of 157 adults with multiple myeloma. The trial was conducted at 17 sites in four countries in Spain, France, Italy and the US. The FDA granted the application for melphalan flufenamide under the priority review and orphan drug programs. In October 2021, Oncopeptides AB announced the withdrawal of Pepaxto from the US market after the OCEAN trial's data showed no improvement in terms of overall survival versus pomalidomide in the ITT group (19.8 months in the melphalan flufenamide group versus 25.0 months in the pomalidomide group, HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.85–1.44, p = 0,47). == Society and culture == === Legal status === In June 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Pepaxti, intended for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include low blood cell counts, fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, cough, and rash. Other severe side effects include allergic reactions and increased risk of infection. Use in pregnancy is known to harm the baby. Bendamustine is in the alkylating agents family of medication. It works by interfering with the function of DNA and RNA. Bendamustine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2008. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from nitrogen mustard. == Medical uses == One combination for stage III/IV relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), with or without prior rituximab-containing chemoimmunotherapy treatment, is bendamustine with mitoxantrone and rituximab. In Germany in 2012 it has become the first line treatment of choice for indolent lymphoma. Trial results released in June 2012 showed that it more than doubled disease progression-free survival when given along with rituximab. The combination also left patients with fewer side effects than the older R-CHOP treatment. == Adverse effects == Common adverse reactions are typical for the class of nitrogen mustards, and include nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, constipation, loss of appetite, cough, headache, unintentional weight loss, difficulty breathing, rashes, and stomatitis, as well as immunosuppression, anemia, and low platelet counts. Notably, this drug has a low incidence of hair loss (alopecia) unlike most other chemotherapy drugs. == Pharmacology == Bendamustine is a white, water-soluble microcrystalline powder with amphoteric properties. It acts as an alkylating agent causing intra-strand and inter-strand cross-links between DNA bases. After intravenous infusion it is extensively metabolised in the liver by cytochrome p450. More than 95% of the drug is bound to protein – primarily albumin. Only free bendamustine is active. Elimination is biphasic with a half-life of 6–10 minutes and a terminal half-life of approximately 30 minutes. It is eliminated primarily through the kidneys. == History == Bendamustine was first made in 1963 by Ozegowski and Krebs in East Germany (the former German Democratic Republic). Until 1990 it was available only in East Germany. East German researchers found that it was useful for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and lung cancer.

While inhibition of kinases involved in cell cycle regulation induces synthetic lethality in a variety of TP53 mutant cancers, this strategy has not been evaluated in mutant TP53 AML. Previously, we demonstrated that TP-0903 is a novel multikinase inhibitor with low nM activity against AURKA/B, Chk1/2, and other cell cycle regulators. Here, we evaluated the preclinical activity of TP-0903 in TP53 mutant AML cell lines, including a single-cell clone of MV4-11 containing a TP53 mutation (R248W), Kasumi-1 (R248Q), and HL-60 (TP 53 null). TP-0903 inhibited cell viability (IC50, 12−32 nM) and induced apoptosis at 50 nM. By immunoblot, 50 nM TP-0903 upregulated pChk1/2 and pH2AX, suggesting induction of DNA damage. The combination of TP-0903 and decitabine was additive in vitro, and in vivo significantly prolonged median survival compared to single-agent treatments in mice xenografted with HL-60 (vehicle, 46 days; decitabine, 55 days; TP-0903, 63 days; combination, 75 days) or MV4-11 (R248W) (51 days; 62 days; 81 days; 89 days) (p < 0.001). Together, these results provide scientific premise for the clinical evaluation of TP-0903 in combination with decitabine in TP53 mutant AML. Effective treatment for AML is challenging due to the presence of clonal heterogeneity and the evolution of polyclonal drug resistance. Here, we report that TP-0903 has potent activity against protein kinases related to STAT, AKT, and ERK signaling, as well as cell cycle regulators in biochemical and cellular assays. In vitro and in vivo, TP-0903 was active in multiple models of drug-resistant FLT3 mutant AML, including those involving the F691L gatekeeper mutation and bone marrow microenvironment-mediated factors. Furthermore, TP-0903 demonstrated preclinical activity in AML models with FLT3-ITD and common co-occurring mutations in IDH2 and NRAS genes. We also showed that TP-0903 had ex vivo activity in primary AML cells with recurrent mutations including MLL-PTD, ASXL1, SRSF2, and WT1, which are associated with poor prognosis or promote clinical resistance to AML-directed therapies. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that TP-0903 is a multikinase inhibitor with potent activity against multiple drug-resistant models of AML that will have an immediate clinical impact in a heterogeneous disease like AML. Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with a 5-year survival less than 5%. Resistance to standard therapy and limited response to immune checkpoint blockade due to the immunosuppressive and stroma-rich microenvironment remain major challenges in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. A key cellular program involved in therapy resistance is epithelial plasticity, which is also associated with invasion, metastasis, and evasion of immune surveillance. The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is a key driver of tumor cell epithelial plasticity. High expression and activity of AXL is associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and therapy resistance in multiple types of cancer including pancreatic. Here, we show that an AXL inhibitor (TP-0903), has antitumor and therapy sensitizing effects in preclinical models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). We demonstrate that TP-0903 as a single agent or in combination with gemcitabine and/or anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibody has anti-metastatic and anti-tumor effects in PDA tumor bearing mice, leading to increased survival. In addition, gene expression analysis of tumors demonstrated upregulation of pro-inflammatory and immune activation genes in tumors from TP-0903-treated animals compared with the vehicle, indicating pharmacologic inhibition of AXL activation leads to an immunostimulatory microenvironment. This effect was augmented when TP-0903 was combined with gemcitabine and anti-PD1 antibody.

Research into this indication has been largely halted as a result of disappointing trial results. As of 2024, it is under development for the management of erythropoietic protoporphyria. Bitopertin is a glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor that increases levels of the neurotransmitter glycine by inhibiting its reuptake from the synaptic cleft. Glycine acts as a required co-agonist along with glutamate at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. == Erythropoietic protoporphyria == Glycine is an early and crucial substrate in the biosynthesis of haem; inhibiting its transport by blocking GlyT1 reduces its availability for haem biosynthesis and this reduces the downstream accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in people with EPP. == Schizophrenia == Dysfunction of NMDA receptors may play a key role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and modulation of glutamatergic signalling via increased concentrations of glycine in the synaptic cleft may help potentiate NMDA receptor function and improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. In a phase II proof-of-concept study, patients on bitopertin experienced a significant improvement in the change of the Negative Symptom Factor Score from baseline within 8 weeks (from −4.86 in the placebo group to −6.65 in the treatment group, p<0.05, per-protocol population). In addition, 83% of patients on bitopertin described an improvement of negative symptoms on the CGI-I1 versus 66% on placebo (p<0.05, per-protocol population). In January 2014, Roche reported that bitopertin failed to meet its endpoints in two phase III trials assessing its efficacy in reducing negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

1035,"('Pimozide', 'Orap', 'Opiran', 'Pimozidum', 'Pimozidum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Pimozide (sold under the brand name Orap) is a neuroleptic drug of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1963. It has a high potency compared to chlorpromazine (ratio 50-70:1). On a weight basis it is even more potent than haloperidol. It also has special indication for Tourette syndrome and resistant tics. == Medical uses == Pimozide is used for Tourette syndrome, and resistant tics (Europe, United States, and Canada) and in Europe for schizophrenia, chronic psychosis, delusional disorder, and paranoid personality disorder. == Efficacy == A 2013 systematic review compared pimozide with other antipsychotics for schizophrenia or related psychoses: Pimozide versus any other antipsychotic In one case a series of 33 patients with delusional parasitosis (median age, 60 years), pimozide was prescribed for 24 patients, 18 of whom took the drug. The dose ranged from 1 to 5 mg daily. No information regarding initial dosing was specified, although the dose was continued for 6 weeks prior to tapering. Of those patients receiving pimozide, 61% (11/18) experienced improvement in or full remission of symptoms. The use of pimozide for the treatment of delusional parasitosis is based primarily on data from case series/reports that demonstrate some efficacy in the majority of patients. Currently, atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine or risperidone are used as first line treatment. However, patients who experience negative side-effects with the first line medications are typically given pimozide. == Contraindications == It is contraindicated in individuals with either acquired, congenital or a family history of QT interval prolongation. Its use is advised against in individuals with people with either a personal or a family history of arrhythmias or torsades de pointes. Likewise its use is also advised against in individuals with uncorrected hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia or clinical significant cardiac disorders (e.g. a recent myocardial infarction or bradycardia. It is also contraindicated in individuals being cotreated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or in those with a known hypersensitivity to pimozide or other diphenylbutyl-piperidine derivatives. Likewise its use is contraindicated in individuals receiving treatment with CYP3A4, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6 inhibitors. == Side effects == Very common (>10% frequency) side effects include: Akinesia Constipation Dizziness Dry mouth Hyperhidrosis Nocturia Somnolence Speech disorder == Overdose == Pimozide overdose presents with severe extrapyramidal symptoms, hypotension, sedation, QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes. Gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically assisted respiration is the recommended treatment for pimozide overdose. Cardiac monitoring should be continued for at least 4 days due to the long half-life of pimozide. == Pharmacology == Pimozide acts as an antagonist of the D2, D3, and D4 receptors and the 5-HT7 receptor. It is also a hERG blocker. Similarly to other typical antipsychotics pimozide has a high affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor and this likely results in its sexual (due to prolactin hypersecretion) and extrapyramidal side effects as well as its therapeutic efficacy against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. == History == In 1985 pimozide was approved by the FDA for marketing as an orphan drug for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome. == See also == Amisulpride Pipamperone Fluspirilene Penfluridol == Notes == == References == == External links ==",Opiran,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006206168793141842), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008737782947719097)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.1472419600977446e-06)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Development of andarine for all indications has been discontinued, in favor of the structurally related and improved compound enobosarm (ostarine; GTx-024; S-22). Andarine is an orally active partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In intact male rats, 0.5 mg andarine daily was shown to reduce prostate weight to 79.4%, and non-significantly increased levator ani muscle weight. In castrated male rats, this dose restored only 32.5% prostate weight, but 101% levator ani muscle weight This suggests that andarine is able to competitively block binding of dihydrotestosterone to its receptor targets in the prostate gland, but its partial agonist actions at the androgen receptor prevent the side effects associated with the antiandrogens traditionally used for treatment of BPH.

It is marketed in the United States as an eye drop under the brand name Bepreve, by ISTA Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Bausch + Lomb. == Pharmacology == Bepotastine is available as an ophthalmic solution and oral tablet. It is a direct H1-receptor antagonist that inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells. The ophthalmic formulation has shown minimal systemic absorption, between 1 and 1.5% in healthy adults. Common side effects are eye irritation, headache, unpleasant taste, and nasopharyngitis. The main route of elimination is urinary excretion, 75-90% excreted unchanged. == Marketing history == It is marketed in Japan by Tanabe Seiyaku under the brand name Talion. Talion was co-developed by Tanabe Seiyaku and Ube Industries, the latter of which discovered bepotastine. In 2001, Tanabe Seiyaku granted Senju, now owned by Allergan, exclusive worldwide rights, with the exception of certain Asian countries, to develop, manufacture and market bepotastine for ophthalmic use. Senju, in turn, has granted the United States rights for the ophthalmic preparation to ISTA Pharmaceuticals. == Sales and patents == In 2011, ISTA pharmaceuticals experienced a 2.4% increase in net revenues from 2010, which was driven by the sales of Bepreve. Their net revenue for 2011 was $160.3 million. ISTA Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Bausch & Lomb in March 2012 for $500 million. Bausch & Lomb hold the patent for bepotastine besilate (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/temptn.cfm. On November 26, 2014, Bausch & Lomb sued Micro Labs USA for patent infringement. Bausch & Lomb was recently bought out by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in May 2013 for $8.57 billion, Valeant's largest acquisition to date, causing the company's stock to rise 25% when the deal was announced. == Clinical trials == A Phase III clinical trial was carried out in 2010 to evaluate the effectiveness of bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5%. These solutions were compared to a placebo and evaluated for their ability to reduce ocular itchiness. The study was carried out with 130 individuals and evaluated after 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours. There was a reduction in itchiness at all-time points for both ophthalmic solutions. The study concluded that bepotastine besilate ophthalmic formulations reduced ocular itchiness for at least 8 hours after dosing compared to placebo. Phase I and II trials were carried out in Japan. Studies have been performed in animals and bepotastine besilate was not found to be teratogenic in rats during fetal development, even at 3,300 times more than typical use in humans. Evidence of infertility was seen in rats at 33,000 times the typical ocular dose in humans.

Studies have shown that this medication can reduce the rate of combined endpoint cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization. == Contraindications == Vorapaxar is contraindicated for people with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral hemorrhage. In studies of vorapaxar on persons with prior ischemic stroke, there was an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage without an improvement in major vascular events. Vorapaxar possesses a long half-life, which is problematic because there is currently no treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effects of vorapaxar. This family of medication, PAR-1 antagonists in general, has been associated with an increased risk of intracranial bleeding, as demonstrated by a pooled analysis of data that studied 42,000 patients with history of thrombotic vascular disease or acute coronary syndrome comparing the medication and a placebo. == Drug interactions == Vorapaxar is eliminated primarily via metabolism by the CYP3A enzymes. It is best to avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and conivaptan. CYP3A4 inducers, such as carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's wort, and phenytoin, should also be avoided. == Dose adjustment == No dose adjustment is required in persons with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is required in persons with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. If the person has severe hepatic impairment, vorapaxar is not recommended due to the risk of bleeding. == Mechanism of action == Vorapaxar is an antiplatelet drug of the PAR-1 antagonist family. It functions by inhibiting thrombin-related platelet aggregation. This mechanism works by a different pathway from other antiplatelet medications, such as aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors. Vorapaxar does not affect ADP-mediated platelet aggregation, coagulation parameters, or bleeding time. == Storage == Vorapaxar can be stored at 20–25 °C (68–77 °F). It is best to store vorapaxar in original packaging with the bottle tightly closed and to avoid moisture. == History == In January 2011, clinical trials being conducted by Merck were halted for patients with stroke and mild heart conditions due to an increase in brain bleeding. In a randomized double-blind trial comparing vorapaxar with placebo in addition to standard therapy in patients who had acute coronary syndromes, there was no significant reduction in a composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia with rehospitalization, or urgent coronary revascularization. However, there was increased risk of major bleeding. A trial published in February 2012 found no change in all-cause mortality while decreasing the risk of cardiac death and increasing the risk of major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhages. After two years, the data and safety monitoring board recommended discontinuation of the study treatment in people with a history of stroke owing to the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The TRA 2°P–TIMI 50 study of vorapaxar was carried out in patients who had previously experienced a heart attack, stroke, or who had peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In this three-year study, the addition of vorapaxar to standard of care (aspirin and/or an ADP antagonist such as clopidogrel) significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization by 12 percent compared to placebo plus standard of care. Vorapaxar showed the most promising results among patients with a history of heart attack. Among these patients, the drug reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke by 20 percent. There was an increase in moderate or severe bleeding, but no statistically significant increase in fatal bleeding.

Several cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) were found in people treated with dasatinib, possibly due to pulmonary endothelial cell damage. On October 11, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that dasatinib may increase the risk of a rare but serious condition in which there is abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension, PAH). Symptoms of PAH may include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling of the body (such as the ankles and legs). In reported cases, people developed PAH after starting dasatinib, including after more than one year of treatment. Information about the risk was added to the Warnings and Precautions section of the Sprycel drug label. In studies between 2009 and 2017 dasatinib-induced PAH was initiated between 0.3 and 74 months of daily drug usage at doses from 70 to 140 mg. Reported dasatinib-induced PAH had improvements after cessation of drug treatment. == Pharmacology == Dasatinib is an ATP-competitive protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The main targets of dasatinib are BCR/Abl (the ""Philadelphia chromosome""), Src, c-Kit, ephrin receptors, and several other tyrosine kinases. Strong inhibition of the activated BCR-ABL kinase distinguishes dasatinib from other CML treatments, such as imatinib and nilotinib. Although dasatinib only has a plasma half-life of three to five hours, the strong binding to BCR-ABL1 results in a longer duration of action. == History == Dasatinib was developed by collaboration of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, and named for Bristol-Myers Squibb research fellow Jagabandhu Das, whose program leader says that the drug would not have come into existence had he not challenged some of the medicinal chemists' underlying assumptions at a time when progress in the development of the molecule had stalled. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Dasatinib was approved for used in the United States in June 2006 and in the European Union in November 2006 In October 2010, dasatinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of newly diagnosed adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CP-CML). In November 2017, dasatinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. Approval was based on data from 97 pediatric participants with chronic phase CML evaluated in two trials—a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, dose-ranging trial and a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized trial. Fifty-one participants exclusively from the Phase II trial were newly diagnosed with chronic phase CML and 46 participants (17 from the Phase I trial and 29 from the Phase II trial) were resistant or intolerant to previous treatment with imatinib. The majority of participants were treated with dasatinib tablets 60 mg/m2 body surface area once daily. Participants were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. === Economics === The Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment objected to the price of dasatinib, in a letter to the U.S. trade representative. The average wholesale price in the U.S. is $367 per day, twice the price in other high income countries. The price in India, where the average annual per capita income is $1,570, and where most people pay out of pocket, is Rs6627 ($108) a day. Indian manufacturers offered to supply generic versions for $4 a day, but, under pressure from the U.S., the Indian Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion refused to issue a compulsory license. Bristol-Myers Squibb justified the high prices of cancer drugs with the high R&D costs, but the Union of Affordable Cancer Treatment said that most of the R&D costs came from the U.S. government, including National Institutes of Health funded research and clinical trials, and a 50% tax credit. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended against dasatinib because of the high cost-benefit ratio. The Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment said that ""the dasatinib dispute illustrates the shortcomings of US trade policy and its impact on cancer patients"" === Brand names === In Bangladesh dasatinib is available under the trade name Dasanix by Beacon Pharmaceuticals. In India, It is marketed under the brand name Nextki by Emcure Pharmaceuticals. == Research == Dasatinib has been shown to eliminate senescent cells in cultured adipocyte progenitor cells. === Dasatinib+Quercetin === Dasatinib has been shown to induce apoptosis in senescent cells by inhibiting Src kinase, whereas quercetin inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Administration of dasatinib along with quercetin to mice improved cardiovascular function and eliminated senescent cells. Aged mice given dasatinib with quercetin showed improved health and survival. A study of fourteen human patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a disease characterized by increased numbers of senescent cells) given dasatinib and quercetin showed improved physical function and evidence of reduced senescent cells. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Dasatinib"".

It is a nonsteroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor and works by inhibiting the production of androgens and estrogens in the body. As of July 2017, seviteronel is in phase II clinical trials for both prostate cancer and breast cancer. In January 2016, it was designated fast-track status by the United States Food and Drug Administration for prostate cancer. In April 2017, seviteronel received fast-track designation for breast cancer as well. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Seviteronel is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, acting specifically as an androgen synthesis inhibitor via inhibition of the enzyme CYP17A1, for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has approximately 10-fold selectivity for the inhibition of 17,20-lyase (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 69 nM) over 17α-hydroxylase (IC50 = 670 nM), which results in less interference with corticosteroid production relative to the approved CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone acetate (which must be administered in combination with prednisone to avoid glucocorticoid deficiency and mineralocorticoid excess due to 17α-hydroxylase inhibition) and hence may be administerable without a concomitant exogenous glucocorticoid. Seviteronel is 58-fold more selective for inhibition of 17,20-lyase than abiraterone (the active metabolite of abiraterone acetate), which has IC50 values for inhibition of 17,20-lyase and 17α-hydroxylase of 15 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively. In addition, in in vitro models, seviteronel appears to possess greater efficacy as an antiandrogen relative to abiraterone. Similarly to abiraterone acetate, seviteronel has also been found to act to some extent as an antagonist of the androgen receptor. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Seviteronel is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name. == See also == List of investigational sex-hormonal agents § Androgenics == References == == Further reading == == External links == Seviteronel - AdisInsight",Seviteronel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010489867418073118), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011812621960416436)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seviteronel?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Seviteronel', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seviteronel?utm_source=openai')])"
1044,"('Favipiravir', 'Avigan', 'Favipiravir (t-705)', 'T 705', 'Pyrazinecarboxamide, 6-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-')",Medical,"Favipiravir, sold under the brand name Avigan among others, is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza in Japan. It is also being studied to treat a number of other viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Like the experimental antiviral drugs T-1105 and T-1106, it is a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative. It is being developed and manufactured by Toyama Chemical (a subsidiary of Fujifilm) and was approved for medical use in Japan in 2014. In 2016, Fujifilm licensed it to Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. It became a generic drug in 2019. == Medical use == Favipiravir has been approved to treat influenza in Japan. It is, however, only indicated for novel influenza (strains that cause more severe disease) rather than seasonal influenza. As of 2020, the probability of resistance developing appears low. == Side effects == There is evidence that use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Teratogenic and embryotoxic effects were shown on four animal species. In one case report, a 6-month old infant developed benign bright blue discolouration of the cornea after treatment with favipiravir which resolved after treatment cessation. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of its actions is thought to be related to the selective inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Favipiravir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP), available in both oral and intravenous formulations. In 2014, favipiravir was approved in Japan for stockpiling against influenza pandemics. However, favipiravir has not been shown to be effective in primary human airway cells, casting doubt on its efficacy in influenza treatment. Favipiravir-RTP is a nucleoside analogue. It mimics both guanosine and adenosine for the viral RdRP. Incorporating two such bases in a row stops primer extension, although it is unclear how as of 2013. == Synthesis == There are multiple pathways to synthesize favipiravir. One synthesis starts with 3-Hydroxypicolinic acid, which is first reacted with thionyl chloride and then aqueous ammonia to produce 3-Hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide. The resulting material is nitrated with potassium nitrate and sulfuric acid to add a nitro group in the 6 position, which is then reduced using hydrazine hydrate to the corresponding amine. Finally, the amine is turned into a diazonium group using sodium nitrite and replaced with a fluorine group using hydrofluoric acid. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The US Department of Defense developed favipiravir in partnership with MediVector, Inc. as a broad-spectrum antiviral and sponsored it through FDA Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, where it demonstrated safety in humans and efficacy against the influenza virus. favipiravir remains unapproved in the UK and the USA. In 2014, Japan approved favipiravir for treating influenza strains unresponsive to current antivirals. Toyama Chemical initially hoped that favipiravir would become a new influenza medication that could replace oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu). However, animal experiments show the potential for teratogenic effects, and the approval of production by The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare was greatly delayed and the production condition is limited only in an emergency in Japan. Despite limited data on efficacy, as of March 2021 favipiravir is widely prescribed for outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in Egypt, Hungary and Serbia. Patients are required to sign a consent form before obtaining the drug. === Brand names === Favipiravir is sold under the brand names Avigan (アビガン, Abigan), Avifavir, Avipiravir, Areplivir, FabiFlu, Favipira, Reeqonus, and Qifenda. === Use in Russia === Coronavir is the brand name of favipiravir used in Russia, where it is approved for the treatment of COVID-19. It is produced and sold by R-Pharm. Coronavir was approved for use in Russia in hospitals in July 2020, and in September 2020 it received approval for prescription sales for outpatient use. == Research == === COVID-19 === Favipiravir, as an antiviral drug, has been authorized for treating COVID-19 in several countries including Japan, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, India, and Thailand, under emergency provisions. A rapid meta-review in September 2020 (analyzing four studies) noted that the drug led to clinical and radiological improvements; however, no reduction in mortality or differences in oxygen-support requirement were observed and more rigorous studies were sought. A Cochrane Systematic review published in Feb 2024, noted that there is actually no real benefit with Favipiravir in treating Covid-19 in terms of mortality benefits, or admission to mechanical ventillation, or hospitalisation, and it may not make any difference in adverse effects or serious adverse effects. As of May 2021, large-cohort clinical trials are underway. === Ebola === Research in 2014, suggested that favipiravir may have efficacy against Ebola based on studies in mouse models; efficacy in humans was unaddressed. During the 2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak, a French nurse who contracted Ebola while volunteering for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Liberia reportedly recovered after receiving a course of favipiravir. A clinical trial investigating the use of favipiravir against Ebola virus disease began in Guéckédou, Guinea, in December 2014. Preliminary results presented in 2016 at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), later published, showed a decrease in mortality in patients with low-to-moderate levels of virus in blood, but no effect on patients with high levels (the group at a higher risk of death). The trial design was concomitantly criticised for using only historical controls. === Nipah === Nipah virus is a causative agent of outbreaks of encephalitis with pneumonia and has a high case fatality rate. The first outbreak occurred in Malaysia-Singapore, related to contact with pigs in slaughterhouses and an outbreak in Philippines related to slaughter of horses, most other outbreaks have affected India and Bangladesh. in Bangladesh outbreaks are often associated with consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by saliva and urine of fruit bats. In a study published in the Scientific Reports, Syrian hamster model for Nipah virus infection was used, which closely mirrors most aspects of human disease, such as widespread vasculitis, pneumonia, and encephalitis. The hamsters were infected with a lethal dose of 104 PFU NiV-M via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route similar to previous studies and treatment was initiated immediately after infection. Favipiravir was administered twice daily via the peroral (p.o.) route for 14 days. The treated hamsters displayed 100% survival and no obvious morbidity after lethal NiV challenge, whereas all the control cases died of severe disease. === Other === In experiments in animals favipiravir has shown activity against West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus as well as other flaviviruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphaviruses. Activity against enteroviruses and Rift Valley fever virus has also been demonstrated. Favipiravir has showed limited efficacy against Zika virus in animal studies, but was less effective than other antivirals such as MK-608. The agent has also shown some efficacy against rabies, and has been used experimentally in some humans infected with the virus. === Tautomerism === The possible tautomerism of favipiravir has been investigated computationally and experimentally. It was found that the enol-like form was substantially more stable in organic solvents than the keto-like form, meaning that Favipiravir likely exists almost exclusively in the enol-like form. In aqueous solution the keto-like tautomer is substantially stabilized due to the specific interaction with the water molecules. Upon protonation the keto form is switched on. == References == == External links == ""Favipiravir"". Drug Information Portal.

Fenticonazole nitrate significantly enhanced the ability of colistin to combat mcr-1-positive E. coli 42 in vitro. The combination could effectively inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate established biofilms. Fenticonazole nitrate and colistin could increase the outer membrane permeability of E. coli 42, disrupting the membrane potential and impairing PMF synthesis, which in turn led to a reduction in ATP levels and cell death. Further, we found that the outer membrane barrier of Gram-negative bacteria and the innate resistance mechanism mediated by efflux pumps can impair the antimicrobial activity of fenticonazole nitrate.

It is an inhibitor of Lyn and Bcr-Abl. It reached phase II clinical trials in 2010. == Development == Imatinib was the first Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor and was highly successful in treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had previous had no effective treatment. With the emerging resistance to imatinib treatment, alternative treatment was highly sought after. Bafetinib was created as an attempt for a more potent drug than imatinib, with efficacy against various point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase, with fewer adverse effects and with narrower kinase spectra, namely just Lyn and Bcr-Abl. In the search for a substance that fit the criteria mentioned, the crystal structure of imatinib bound to Abl was examined. This revealed a hydrophobic pocket around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinylmethyl group of imatinib. Attempts to utilize this pocket to increase efficacy led to the addition of various hydrophobic groups including single fluoro, bromo and chloro substituents. Finally a trifluoromethyl group at position 3 was found to give the best results, with approximately 36-fold improvement over imatinib. The addition of a hydrophobic group now needed to be countered to sustain the solubility of the substance. Closer examination of the crystal structure of imatinib-kinase complex revealed Tyr-236 was in close proximity to the pyridine ring of imatinib, suggesting there was little or no room for a larger group there. With that in mind a more hydrophilic pyrimidine ring was substituted for the pyridine, which was found to increase solubility while leaving efficacy the same or even slightly greater. Finally to improve the hydrogen bonding of the piperazine ring of imatinib with Ile-360 and His-361, pyrrolidine and azetidine derivatives were introduced. The most promising substance from these final modifications was labeled NS-187. The FDA granted NS-187 orphan drug status in 2007 for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. === Binding === Due to the structural similarities of imatinib and bafetinib, their binding to Bcr-Abl is also quite similar. The only notable difference comes from the hydrophobic interaction between the trifluoromethyl group and the hydrophobic pocket created by Ile-293, Leu-298, Leu-354, and Val-379. This group can also be linked to bafetinib's specificity for Lyn, as the binding site there is almost identical to that on Bcr-Abl. Bafetinib is effective both against most imatinib resistant mutations (not including T315I) and some dasatinib resistant mutations. Bafetinib also has more affinity for Bcr-Abl than nilotinib (but less than dasatinib) but only targets Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases Lck and Lyn; with unrivalled specificity which suggests the probability of fewer adverse effects. == Clinical trials == Bafetinib was in phase II clinical trials for treatment of leukemia in 2010. == References ==",Bafetinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.3841574147809297e-05), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001935277134180069)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafetinib,https://www.empr.com/home/news/drugs-in-the-pipeline/phase-2-trial-of-bafetinib-in-b-cell-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/118/21/2858/82413/A-Pilot-Phase-II-Study-of-the-Lyn-Kinase-Inhibitor ', [])"

Aticaprant is taken by mouth. Side effects of aticaprant include itching, among others. Aticaprant acts as a selective antagonist of the KOR, the biological target of the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin. The medication has decent selectivity for the KOR over the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and other targets, a relatively long half-life of 30 to 40 hours, and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier to produce central effects. Aticaprant was originally developed by Eli Lilly, was under development by Cerecor for a time, and is now under development by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. As of July 2022, it is in phase III clinical trials for major depressive disorder. In March 2025, Johnson & Johnson discontinued development of aticaprant for major depressive disorder due to lack of effectiveness in phase III trials. Aticaprant was also under development for the treatment of alcoholism, cocaine use disorder, and nicotine withdrawal, but development for these indications was discontinued as well. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Aticaprant is a potent, selective, short-acting (i.e., non-""inactivating"") antagonist of the KOR (Ki = 0.81 nM vs. 24.0 nM and 155 nM for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and δ-opioid receptor (DOR), respectively; approximately 30-fold selectivity for the KOR). The drug has been found to dose-dependently block fentanyl-induced miosis at 25 mg and 60 mg in humans (with minimal to no blockade at doses of 4 to 10 mg), suggesting that the drug significantly occupies and antagonizes the MOR at a dose of at least 25 mg but not of 10 mg or less. However, a more recent study assessing neuroendocrine effects of the drug in normal volunteers and subjects with a history of cocaine dependence reported observations consistent with modest MOR antagonism at the 10 mg dose. In animal models of depression, aticaprant has been found to have potent synergistic efficacy in combination with other antidepressants such as citalopram and imipramine. Positron emission tomography imaging revealed that brain KORs were almost completely saturated by the drug 2.5 hours following a single dose of 10 mg, which supported the 4 mg to 25 mg dosages that aticaprant is being explored at in clinical trials. Occupancy was 35% for a 0.5 mg dose and 94% for a 10 mg dose. At 24 hours post-dose, receptor occupancy was 19% for 0.5 mg and 82% for 25 mg. No serious side effects were observed, and all side effects seen were mild to moderate and were not thought to be due to aticaprant. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of aticaprant is 25%. The drug is rapidly absorbed, with maximal concentrations occurring 1 to 2 hours after administration. It has an elimination half-life of 30 to 40 hours in healthy subjects. The circulating levels of aticaprant increase proportionally with increasing doses. Steady-state concentrations are reached after 6 to 8 days of once-daily dosing. Aticaprant has been shown to reproducibly penetrate the blood–brain barrier. == History == Aticaprant was originally developed by Eli Lilly under the code name LY-2456302. It first appeared in the scientific literature in 2010 or 2011. The compound was first patented in 2009. In February 2015, Cerecor Inc. announced that they had acquired the rights from Eli Lilly to develop and commercialize LY-2456302 (under the new developmental code CERC-501). As of 2016, aticaprant has reached phase II clinical trials as an augmentation to antidepressant therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A phase II study of aticaprant in heavy smokers was commenced in early 2016 and results of the study were expected before the end of 2016. Aticaprant failed to meet its main endpoint for nicotine withdrawal in the study. In August 2017, it was announced that Cerecor had sold its rights to aticaprant to Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Janssen was also experimenting with esketamine for the treatment of depression as of 2017. In March 2025, Johnson & Johnson discontinued development of aticaprant for major depressive disorder due to lack of effectiveness in phase 3 trials.

Due to the alarming resistance of these parasites to traditional anti-malarial treatments there is a pressing need to not only identify new anti-malarial compounds, but also to characterize the effect of compounds known to have an effect on the parasite life cycle. This study reports on effects of kinase inhibitor Purvalanol B administration on the growth and protein expression of Plasmodium falciparum late-stage trophozoites. A SYBR® Green I parasite growth assay was used to measure the IC50 of Purvalanol B with P. falciparum (strain W2). Purvalanol B or DMSO control were applied to synchronized parasites 36 hours post invasion and parasites were incubated for 12 hours. Giemsa-stained blood smears were used to determine the effect of Purvalanol B on parasite growth, global quantitative proteomic analysis was used to examine differences in protein expression between Purvalanol B-treated and control parasites and results were confirmed by qPCR. There were no differences in parasitaemia between inhibitor-treated and control parasites. However, the ability of Purvalanol B-treated parasites to form schizonts was significantly reduced. Proteomic analysis detected 76 human proteins and 518 P. falciparum proteins (63 in control cultures only, 56 proteins in Purvalanol B cultures only, and 399 proteins in both cultures). Quantitative analysis of protein extracts revealed eight proteins that were up-regulated in the inhibitor-treated cultures, including several components of the parasite's proteasome complex and thioredoxin reductase. Two proteins appeared to be down-regulated, including a helicase and an RNA-binding protein. Purvalanol B application decreases the ability of late-stage P. falciparum trophozoites to form multinucleated schizonts and up-regulates proteasome subunits and proteins that contribute to redox homeostasis, which may indicate an increase in oxidative stress as a result of inhibitor application. While the efficacy of Purvalanol B is relatively low for use as an anti-malarial therapy, quantitative proteomic analysis may serve as a method of examining the action of drugs on the parasite and indicate the likelihood of future resistance development. The 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine group of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors have the potential to be clinically relevant inhibitors of cancer cell proliferation. We have recently designed and synthesized a novel dansylated analog of purvalanol B, termed VMY-1-103, that inhibited cell cycle progression in breast cancer cell lines more effectively than did purvalanol B and allowed for uptake analyses by fluorescence microscopy. ErbB-2 plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction cascades in a number of epithelial tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). Our previous studies demonstrated that transgenic expression of activated ErbB-2 in the mouse prostate initiated PCa and either the overexpression of ErbB-2 or the addition of the ErbB-2/ErbB-3 ligand, heregulin (HRG), induced cell cycle progression in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. In the present study, we tested the efficacy of VMY-1-103 in inhibiting HRG-induced cell proliferation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. At concentrations as low as 1 μM, VMY-1-103 increased both the proportion of cells in G(1) and p21(CIP1) protein levels. At higher concentrations (5 μM or 10 μM), VMY-1-103 induced apoptosis via decreased mitochondrial membrane polarity and induction of p53 phosphorylation, caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. Treatment with 10 μM Purvalanol B failed to either influence proliferation or induce apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that VMY-1-103 was more effective in inducing apoptosis in PCa cells than its parent compound, purvalanol B, and support the testing of VMY-1-103 as a potential small molecule inhibitor of prostate cancer in vivo.",Purvalanol b,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.048589639365673065)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.08029822260141373), ('ICAL', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4740990996360779)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.2014133334159851), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([rndsystems.com](https://www.rndsystems.com/products/purvalanol-b_1581?utm_source=openai), [tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/purvalanol-b_1581?utm_source=openai), [invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/purvalanol-b.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=262, start_index=6, title='Purvalanol B | Cyclin-dependent Kinase Inhibitors: R&D Systems', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rndsystems.com/products/purvalanol-b_1581?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=262, start_index=6, title='Purvalanol B | Non-selective CDKs | Tocris Bioscience', type='url_citation', url='https://www.tocris.com/products/purvalanol-b_1581?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=262, start_index=6, title='Purvalanol B (NG 95) | cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor | CAS 212844-54-7 | Buy Purvalanol B (NG 95) from Supplier InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/purvalanol-b.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1051,"('Tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor 1', '(2-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione)')",Medical," Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) has been implicated as a potential cancer therapeutic target by its negative regulation of immune cell activation and the activity of the SHP-1 inhibitor sodium stibogluconate that induced IFN-gamma(+) cells for anti-tumor action. To develop more potent SHP-1-targeted anti-cancer agents, inhibitory leads were identified from a library of 34,000 drug-like compounds. Among the leads and active at low nM for recombinant SHP-1, tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor-1 (TPI-1) selectively increased SHP-1 phospho-substrates (pLck-pY394, pZap70, and pSlp76) in Jurkat T cells but had little effects on pERK1/2 or pLck-pY505 regulated by phosphatases SHP-2 or CD45, respectively. TPI-1 induced mouse splenic-IFN-gamma(+) cells in vitro, approximately 58-fold more effective than sodium stibogluconate, and increased mouse splenic-pLck-pY394 and -IFN-gamma(+) cells in vivo. TPI-1 also induced IFN-gamma(+) cells in human peripheral blood in vitro. Significantly, TPI-1 inhibited ( approximately 83%, p < 0.002) the growth of B16 melanoma tumors in mice at a tolerated oral dose in a T cell-dependent manner but had little effects on B16 cell growth in culture. TPI-1 also inhibited B16 tumor growth and prolonged tumor mice survival as a tolerated s.c. agent. TPI-1 analogs were identified with improved activities in IFN-gamma(+) cell induction and in anti-tumor actions. In particular, analog TPI-1a4 as a tolerated oral agent completely inhibited the growth of K1735 melanoma tumors and was more effective than the parental lead against MC-26 colon cancer tumors in mice. These results designate TPI-1 and the analogs as novel SHP-1 inhibitors with anti-tumor activity likely via an immune mechanism, supporting SHP-1 as a novel target for cancer treatment. The distribution of inhibitor-1, a cyclic AMP-regulated inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1, was analyzed in various brain regions and peripheral tissues of various species by immunolabeling of sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel transfers using specific antibodies. The distribution of inhibitor-1 was directly compared to that of DARPP-32, a structurally related cyclic AMP-regulated inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1. In rat CNS, a single immunoreactive protein of M(r) 30,000, identified as inhibitor-1, was widely distributed. In contrast, DARPP-32 was highly concentrated in the basal ganglia. Inhibitor-1 was detected in brain tissue from frog (M(r) 27,000), turtle (M(r) 29,000/33,000), canary (M(r) 26,000), pigeon (M(r) 28,000), mouse (M(r) 30,500), rabbit (M(r) 26,500), cow (M(r) 27,000), and monkey (M(r) 27,500), but not from goldfish. Inhibitor-1 was detected at various levels in most peripheral tissues of the species studied; however, it was not detectable in certain tissues of particular species (e.g., rat and cow liver). DARPP-32 was detected in brain tissue of all the species tested except frog and goldfish, but was not detectable in most peripheral tissues. Both inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 were concentrated in the cytosol and synaptosomal cytosol of rat striatum. The developmental expressions of inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 in rat striatum differed: the level of inhibitor-1 peaked in the first postnatal week and then declined by the third postnatal week, whereas the level of DARPP-32 increased to a peak level by the third postnatal week and remained elevated thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Inhibitor-1 is a protein which inhibits phosphorylase phosphatase only when it has been phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase [Huang, F. L. and Glinsmann, W. H. (1976) Eur. J. Biochem. 70, 419--426]. Inhibitor-1 was purified by a heat treatment at 90 degrees C, precipitation with ammonium sulphate, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and finally rechromatography of the phosphorylated protein on DEAE-cellulose, The protein was purified 4000-fold and 1.5 mg per 1000 g muscle was obtained in seven days corresponding to an overall yield of 15-20%. The purified protein was in a state approaching homogeneity as judged by the criteria of polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugal analysis. The concentration of inhibitor-1 in vivo was calculated to be 1.5 micron, which is at least as high as the concentration of phosphorylase phosphatase. The amino acid composition of inhibitor-1 showed several unusual features. Glutamic acid and proline accounted for nearly one third of the residues, tyrosine, tryptophan and cysteine were absent, and the content of aromatic amino acids was very low. The molecular weight measured by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation was 19200 and by amino acid analysis was 20800. These values were lower than the mol. wt 26000 determined empirically by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate, and much lower than the apparent molecular weight of 60000 estimated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The gel filtration behaviour, stability to heating at 100 degrees C and amino acid composition suggest that inhibitor-1 may possess little ordered structure. The phosphorylated from of inhibitor-1 contained close to one molecule of covalently bound phosphate per mole of protein, which is consistent with the previous finding of a unique decapeptide sequence at the site of phosphorylation, Ile-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Pro-Thr(P)-Pro-Ala-Thr- [Cohen, P., Rylatt, D. B. and Nimmo, G. A. (1977) FEBS Lett. 76, 182-186].the phosphorylated form of inhibitor-1 inhibited phosphorylase phosphatase activity (0.02U) by 50% at a concentration of only 7.0 nM in the standard assay, but the phosphorylated decapeptide was 1000-2000 times less effective as an inhibitor.",Tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor 1,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.25193706154823303), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16126202046871185), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4741409420967102)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20421638/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='Novel SHP-1 inhibitors tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor-1 and analogs with preclinical anti-tumor activities as tolerated oral agents - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20421638/?utm_source=openai')])"
1052,"('Cetirizine (dihydrochloride)', 'Cetirizine', 'Cetirizina', 'Cetirizin', 'Virlix')",Medical,"Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever), dermatitis, and urticaria (hives). It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within thirty minutes and last for about a day. The degree of benefit is similar to other antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, which is a first-generation antihistamine. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, headache, and abdominal pain. The degree of sleepiness that occurs is generally less than with first-generation antihistamines because second-generation antihistamines are more selective for the H1 receptor. Compared to other second-generation antihistamines, cetirizine can cause drowsiness. Among second-generation antihistamines, cetirizine is more likely than fexofenadine and loratadine to cause drowsiness. Use in pregnancy appears safe, but use during breastfeeding is not recommended. The medication works by blocking histamine H1 receptors, mostly outside the brain. Cetirizine can be used for paediatric patients. The main side effect to be cautious about is somnolence. It was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 43rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Allergies === Cetirizine's primary indication is for hay fever and other allergies. Because the symptoms of itching and redness in these conditions are caused by histamine acting on the H1 receptor, blocking those receptors temporarily relieves those symptoms. Cetirizine is also commonly prescribed to treat acute and (in particular cases) chronic urticaria (hives), more efficiently than any other second-generation antihistamine. === Available forms === Cetirizine is available over-the-counter in the US in the form of 5 and 10 mg tablets. A 20 mg strength is available by prescription only. It is also available as a 1 mg/mL syrup for oral administration by prescription. In the UK, up to 30 tablets of 10 mg are on the general sales list (of pharmaceuticals) and can be purchased without a prescription and pharmacist supervision. The drug can be in the form of tablets, capsules or syrup. == Adverse effects == Commonly reported side effects of cetirizine include headache, dry mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue, while more serious, but rare, adverse effects reported include tachycardia and edema. === Pruritus after discontinuation of cetirizine === Discontinuing cetirizine after prolonged use (typically, use beyond six months) may result in pruritus (generalized itchiness). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed cases of pruritus after stopping cetirizine in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and medical literature through April 2017. Their report noted that some patients indicated the itchiness impacted their ability to work, sleep or perform normal daily activities. No specific schedule for weaning is provided in the drug information for cetirizine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cetirizine acts as a highly selective antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor. The Ki values for the H1 receptor are approximately 6 nM for cetirizine, 3 nM for levocetirizine, and 100 nM for dextrocetirizine, indicating that the levorotatory enantiomer is the main active form. Cetirizine has 600-fold or greater selectivity for the H1 receptor over a wide variety of other sites, including muscarinic acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, and α-adrenergic receptors, among many others. The drug shows 20,000-fold or greater selectivity for the H1 receptor over the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence does not exhibit anticholinergic effects. It shows negligible inhibition of the hERG channel (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration > 30 μM) and no cardiotoxicity has been observed with cetirizine at doses of up to 60 mg/day, six times the normal recommended dose and the highest dose of cetirizine that has been studied in healthy subjects. Cetirizine crosses the blood–brain barrier only slightly, and for this reason, produces minimal sedation compared to many other antihistamines. A positron emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 12.6% for 10 mg cetirizine, 25.2% for 20 mg cetirizine, and 67.6% for 30 mg hydroxyzine. (A 10 mg dose of cetirizine equals about a 30 mg dose of hydroxyzine in terms of peripheral antihistamine effect.) PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% is associated with a high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative. In accordance, H1 receptor occupancy correlated well with subjective sleepiness for 30 mg hydroxyzine but there was no correlation for 10 or 20 mg cetirizine. As such, brain penetration and brain H1 receptor occupancy by cetirizine are dose-dependent, and in accordance, while cetirizine at doses of 5 to 10 mg have been reported to be non-sedating or mildly sedating, a higher dose of 20 mg has been found to induce significant drowsiness in other studies. Cetirizine also shows anti-inflammatory properties independent of H1 receptors. The effect is exhibited through suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and by regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, thereby regulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells. It has been shown to inhibit eosinophil chemotaxis and LTB4 release. At a dosage of 20 mg, Boone et al. found that it inhibited the expression of VCAM-1 in patients with atopic dermatitis. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Cetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed upon oral administration in tablet or syrup form. The oral bioavailability of cetirizine is at least 70% and of levocetirizine is at least 85%. The Tmax of cetirizine is approximately 1.0 hour regardless of formulation. The pharmacokinetics of cetirizine have been found to increase linearly with dose across a range of 5 to 60 mg. Its Cmax following a single dose has been found to be 257 ng/mL for 10 mg and 580 ng/mL for 20 mg. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of cetirizine but has been found to delay the Tmax by 1.7 hours (i.e., to approximately 2.7 hours) and to decrease the Cmax by 23%. Similar findings were reported for levocetirizine, which had its Tmax delayed by 1.25 hours and its Cmax decreased by about 36% when administered with a high-fat meal. Steady-state levels of cetirizine occur within 3 days and there is no accumulation of the drug with chronic administration. Following once-daily administration of 10 mg cetirizine for ten days, the mean Cmax was 311 ng/mL. ==== Distribution ==== The mean plasma protein binding of cetirizine has been found to be 93 to 96% across a range of 25 to 1,000 ng/mL independent of concentration. Plasma protein binding of 88 to 96% has also been reported across multiple studies. The drug is bound to albumin with high affinity, while α1-acid glycoprotein and lipoproteins contribute much less to total plasma protein binding. The unbound or free fraction of levocetirizine has been reported to be 8%. The true volume of distribution of cetirizine is unknown but is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.45 L/kg. Cetirizine poorly and slowly crosses the blood–brain barrier, which is thought to be due to its chemical properties and its activity as a P-glycoprotein substrate. ==== Metabolism ==== Cetirizine is notably not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Because of this, it does not interact significantly with drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes such as theophylline, erythromycin, clarithromycin, cimetidine, or alcohol. Studies with cetirizine synthesized with radioactive carbon-14 show that 90% of excreted cetirizine is unchanged at 2 hours, 80% at 10 hours, and 70% at 24 hours, indicating limited and slow metabolism. While cetirizine does not undergo extensive metabolism or metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, it does undergo some metabolism by other means, the metabolic pathways of which include oxidation and conjugation. The precise enzymes responsible for transformation of cetirizine have not been identified. ==== Elimination ==== Cetirizine is eliminated approximately 70 to 85% in the urine and 10 to 13% in the feces. In total, about 60% of cetirizine eliminated in the urine is unchanged. It is eliminated in the urine via an active transport mechanism. The elimination half-life of cetirizine ranges from 6.5 to 10 hours in healthy adults, with a mean across studies of approximately 8.3 hours. The elimination half-life of cetirizine is increased in the elderly (to 12 hours), in hepatic impairment (to 14 hours), and in renal impairment (to 20 hours). Concentrations of cetirizine in the skin decline much slower than concentrations in the blood plasma. Its duration of action is at least 24 hours. == Chemistry == Cetirizine contains L- and D-stereoisomers. Chemically, levocetirizine is the active L-enantiomer of cetirizine. The drug is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines. Analogues include cyclizine and hydroxyzine. === Synthesis === The 1-(4-chlorophenylmethyl)-piperazine is alkylated with methyl (2-chloroethoxy)-acetate in the presence of sodium carbonate and xylene solvent to produce the Sn2 substitution product in 28% yield. Saponification of the acetate ester is done by refluxing with potassium hydroxide in absolute ethanol to afford a 56% yield of the potassium salt intermediate. This is then hydrolyzed with aqueous HCl and extracted to give an 81% yield of the carboxylic acid product. == Availability == Cetirizine is available without a prescription. In some countries, it is only available over-the-counter in packages containing seven or ten 10 mg doses. Cetirizine is available as a combination medication with pseudoephedrine, a decongestant. The combination is often marketed using the same brand name as the cetirizine with a ""-D"" suffix (for example, Zyrtec-D). Cetirizine is sold under various brand names including Alatrol, Alerid, Allacan, Allercet, Alzene, Cerchio, Cetirin, Cetizin, Cetriz, Cetzine, Cezin, Cetgel, Cirrus, Histec, Histazine, Humex, Letizen, Okacet (Cipla), Piriteze, Reactine, Razene, Rigix, Sensahist (Oethmann, South Africa), Triz, Zetop, Zirtec, Zirtek, Zodac, Zyllergy, Zynor, Zyrlek, and Zyrtec (Johnson & Johnson), inter alios. == References ==",Virlix,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.029989687725901604), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008764016442000866)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015023599844425917), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/virlix?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='VIRLIX - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/virlix?utm_source=openai')])"

(A 10 mg dose of cetirizine equals about a 30 mg dose of hydroxyzine in terms of peripheral antihistamine effect.) PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% is associated with a high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative. In accordance, H1 receptor occupancy correlated well with subjective sleepiness for 30 mg hydroxyzine but there was no correlation for 10 or 20 mg cetirizine. As such, brain penetration and brain H1 receptor occupancy by cetirizine are dose-dependent, and in accordance, while cetirizine at doses of 5 to 10 mg have been reported to be non-sedating or mildly sedating, a higher dose of 20 mg has been found to induce significant drowsiness in other studies. Cetirizine also shows anti-inflammatory properties independent of H1 receptors. The effect is exhibited through suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and by regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, thereby regulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells. It has been shown to inhibit eosinophil chemotaxis and LTB4 release. At a dosage of 20 mg, Boone et al. found that it inhibited the expression of VCAM-1 in patients with atopic dermatitis. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Cetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed upon oral administration in tablet or syrup form. The oral bioavailability of cetirizine is at least 70% and of levocetirizine is at least 85%. The Tmax of cetirizine is approximately 1.0 hour regardless of formulation. The pharmacokinetics of cetirizine have been found to increase linearly with dose across a range of 5 to 60 mg. Its Cmax following a single dose has been found to be 257 ng/mL for 10 mg and 580 ng/mL for 20 mg. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of cetirizine but has been found to delay the Tmax by 1.7 hours (i.e., to approximately 2.7 hours) and to decrease the Cmax by 23%. Similar findings were reported for levocetirizine, which had its Tmax delayed by 1.25 hours and its Cmax decreased by about 36% when administered with a high-fat meal. Steady-state levels of cetirizine occur within 3 days and there is no accumulation of the drug with chronic administration. Following once-daily administration of 10 mg cetirizine for ten days, the mean Cmax was 311 ng/mL. ==== Distribution ==== The mean plasma protein binding of cetirizine has been found to be 93 to 96% across a range of 25 to 1,000 ng/mL independent of concentration. Plasma protein binding of 88 to 96% has also been reported across multiple studies. The drug is bound to albumin with high affinity, while α1-acid glycoprotein and lipoproteins contribute much less to total plasma protein binding. The unbound or free fraction of levocetirizine has been reported to be 8%. The true volume of distribution of cetirizine is unknown but is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.45 L/kg. Cetirizine poorly and slowly crosses the blood–brain barrier, which is thought to be due to its chemical properties and its activity as a P-glycoprotein substrate. ==== Metabolism ==== Cetirizine is notably not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Because of this, it does not interact significantly with drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes such as theophylline, erythromycin, clarithromycin, cimetidine, or alcohol. Studies with cetirizine synthesized with radioactive carbon-14 show that 90% of excreted cetirizine is unchanged at 2 hours, 80% at 10 hours, and 70% at 24 hours, indicating limited and slow metabolism. While cetirizine does not undergo extensive metabolism or metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, it does undergo some metabolism by other means, the metabolic pathways of which include oxidation and conjugation. The precise enzymes responsible for transformation of cetirizine have not been identified. ==== Elimination ==== Cetirizine is eliminated approximately 70 to 85% in the urine and 10 to 13% in the feces. In total, about 60% of cetirizine eliminated in the urine is unchanged. It is eliminated in the urine via an active transport mechanism. The elimination half-life of cetirizine ranges from 6.5 to 10 hours in healthy adults, with a mean across studies of approximately 8.3 hours. The elimination half-life of cetirizine is increased in the elderly (to 12 hours), in hepatic impairment (to 14 hours), and in renal impairment (to 20 hours). Concentrations of cetirizine in the skin decline much slower than concentrations in the blood plasma. Its duration of action is at least 24 hours. == Chemistry == Cetirizine contains L- and D-stereoisomers. Chemically, levocetirizine is the active L-enantiomer of cetirizine. The drug is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines. Analogues include cyclizine and hydroxyzine. === Synthesis === The 1-(4-chlorophenylmethyl)-piperazine is alkylated with methyl (2-chloroethoxy)-acetate in the presence of sodium carbonate and xylene solvent to produce the Sn2 substitution product in 28% yield. Saponification of the acetate ester is done by refluxing with potassium hydroxide in absolute ethanol to afford a 56% yield of the potassium salt intermediate. This is then hydrolyzed with aqueous HCl and extracted to give an 81% yield of the carboxylic acid product. == Availability == Cetirizine is available without a prescription. In some countries, it is only available over-the-counter in packages containing seven or ten 10 mg doses. Cetirizine is available as a combination medication with pseudoephedrine, a decongestant. The combination is often marketed using the same brand name as the cetirizine with a ""-D"" suffix (for example, Zyrtec-D). Cetirizine is sold under various brand names including Alatrol, Alerid, Allacan, Allercet, Alzene, Cerchio, Cetirin, Cetizin, Cetriz, Cetzine, Cezin, Cetgel, Cirrus, Histec, Histazine, Humex, Letizen, Okacet (Cipla), Piriteze, Reactine, Razene, Rigix, Sensahist (Oethmann, South Africa), Triz, Zetop, Zirtec, Zirtek, Zodac, Zyllergy, Zynor, Zyrlek, and Zyrtec (Johnson & Johnson), inter alios. == References ==",Cetirizine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3947389561508317e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00027640812913887203)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetirizine,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a623043.html,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00341 ', [])"

It is generally used together with bedaquiline and linezolid. It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include nerve damage, acne, vomiting, headache, low blood sugar, diarrhea, and liver inflammation. It is in the nitroimidazole class of medications. Pretomanid was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2019, and in the European Union in July 2020. Pretomanid was developed by TB Alliance. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Pretomanid is indicated in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the treatment of pulmonary extensively drug resistant, or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. == Mechanism of action == Pretomanid is activated in the mycobacterium by deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn), an enzyme which uses dihydro-F420 (reduced form), into nitric oxide and a highly reactive metabolite. This metabolite attacks the synthesis enzyme DprE2, which is important for the synthesis of cell wall arabinogalactan, to which mycolic acid would be attached. This mechanism is shared with delamanid. Clinical isolates resistant to this drug tend to have mutations in the biosynthetic pathway for Coenzyme F420. == History == Development of this compound was initiated because of the urgent need for new antibacterial drugs effective against resistant strains of tuberculosis. Also, current anti-TB drugs are mainly effective against replicating and metabolically active bacteria, creating a need for drugs effective against persisting or latent bacterial infections as often occur in patients with tuberculosis. === Discovery and pre-clinical development === Pretomanid was first identified in 2000, in a series of 100 nitroimidazopyran derivatives synthesized and tested for antitubercular activity, by PathoGenesis (now a subsidiary of Novartis). Importantly, pretomanid has activity against static M. tuberculosis isolates that survive under anaerobic conditions, with bactericidal activity comparable to that of the existing drug metronidazole. Pretomanid requires metabolic activation by Mycobacterium for antibacterial activity. Pretomanid was not the most potent compound in the series against cultures of M. tuberculosis, but it was the most active in infected mice after oral administration. Oral pretomanid was active against tuberculosis in mice and guinea pigs at safely tolerated dosages for up to 28 days. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pretomanid only in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid for treatment of a limited and specific population of adults with extensively drug resistant, treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Pretomanid was approved under the limited population pathway (LPAD pathway) for antibacterial and antifungal drugs. Pretomanid is only the third tuberculosis drug to receive approval from the FDA in more than 40 years. The FDA granted pretomanid priority review and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) the approval of pretomanid and a tropical disease priority review voucher. === Names === Pretomanid is the international nonproprietary name, the generic name, and the nonproprietary name. Pretomanid is referred to as ""Pa"" in regimen abbreviations, such as BPaL. The ""preto"" part of the compound's name honors Pretoria, South Africa, the home of a TB Alliance clinical development office where much of the drug's development took place, while the ""-manid"" stem designates compounds with similar chemical structures.

1057,"('Glibenclamide', 'Glyburide', 'Glybenclamide', 'Glynase', 'Micronase')",Medical,"Glibenclamide, also known as glyburide, is an antidiabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is recommended that it be taken together with diet and exercise. It may be used with other antidiabetic medication. It is not recommended for use by itself in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea and heartburn. Serious side effects may include angioedema and low blood sugar. It is generally not recommended during pregnancy but can be used during breastfeeding. It is in the sulfonylureas class of medications and works by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas. Glibenclamide was discovered in 1969 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 214th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Glibenclamide is used to lower the blood sugar level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is not controlled by diet and exercise alone. It is not as good as either metformin or insulin in those who have gestational diabetes. == Side effects == Frequently reported side effects include: nausea, heartburn, weight gain, and bloating. The medication is also a major cause of medication-induced hypoglycemia. The risk is greater than with other sulfonylureas. == Contraindications == Glibenclamide may be not recommended in those with G6PD deficiency, as it may cause acute hemolysis. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is generally not recommended during pregnancy but can be used during breastfeeding. == Mechanism of action == The medication, a sulfonylurea, works by binding to and inhibiting the ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) inhibitory regulatory subunit sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) in pancreatic beta cells. This inhibition causes cell membrane depolarization, opening voltage-dependent calcium Channels. This results in an increase in intracellular calcium in the pancreatic beta cell and subsequent stimulation of insulin release. After a stroke, the blood–brain barrier is broken and glibenclamide can reach the central nervous system. Glibenclamide has been shown to bind more efficiently to the ischemic hemisphere. Moreover, under ischemic conditions SUR1, the regulatory subunit of the KATP- and the NCCa-ATP-channels, is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells and by reactive microglia. According to the research, this and other sulphonylurea drugs also have extra hepatic effects. It works by inhibiting the enzyme Carnityl Acyl Transferase I (CAT-I) indirectly, which is present in the mitochondria. This prevents the transport of long chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. This prevents hyperglycemia for which it is prescribed. == History == It was developed in 1966 in a cooperative study between Boehringer Mannheim (now part of Roche) and Hoechst (now part of Sanofi-Aventis). == Society and culture == === Brand names === Glibenclamide is available as a generic medication, is manufactured by many pharmaceutical companies and is sold under many brand names including Gliben-J, Daonil, Diabeta, Euglucon, Gilemal, Glidanil, Glybovin, Glynase, Maninil, Micronase and Semi-Daonil.

1059,"('Fipronil', 'Termidor', 'Rm 1601', 'Mb 46030', 'Fluocyanobenpyrazole')",Medical,"Fipronil is a broad-spectrum insecticide that belongs to the phenylpyrazole insecticide class. Fipronil disrupts the insect central nervous system by blocking the ligand-gated ion channel of the GABAA receptor (IRAC group 2B) and glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channels. This causes hyperexcitation of contaminated insects' nerves and muscles. Fipronil's specificity towards insects is believed to be due to its greater binding affinity for the GABAA receptors of insects than to those of mammals, and for its action on GluCl channels, which do not exist in mammals. As of 2017, there does not appear to be significant resistance among fleas to fipronil. Fipronil is used as the active ingredient in flea control products for pets and home roach baits as well as field pest control for corn, golf courses, and commercial turf. Its widespread use makes its specific effects the subject of considerable attention. Observations on possible harm to humans or ecosystems are ongoing as well as the monitoring of pesticide resistance development. == Physical properties == Fipronil (IUPAC name 5-amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-(trifluoromethylsulfinyl)pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) is a white, solid powder with a moldy odor. It is degraded slightly by sunlight, stable at normal temperatures for one year, and is not stable in presence of metal ions. == Use == Fipronil has been used against many different pests on different crops. It is used against major lepidopteran (moth, butterfly, etc.) and orthopteran (grasshopper, locust, etc.) pests on a range of field and horticultural crops and against coleopteran (beetle) larvae in soils. It is employed for cockroach and ant control as well as locust control and termite pest control. In the United States of America, fipronil was approved for use against the Rasberry crazy ant until 2022 in counties of Texas where positive identification had been made by entomologists from the Texas Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency. In New Zealand, fipronil was used in trials to control wasps (Vespula spp.), which are a threat to indigenous biodiversity. It is now being used by the Department of Conservation to attempt local eradication of wasps, and is being recommended for control of the invasive Argentine ant. Fipronil is also the active ingredient in many commercial tick and flea treatments for pets. == Effects == === Toxicity === Fipronil is classed as a WHO Class II moderately hazardous pesticide, and has a rat acute oral LD50 of 97 mg/kg. It has moderate acute toxicity by the oral and inhalation routes in rats. Dermal absorption in rats is less than 1% after 24 hours exposure and toxicity is considered to be low. It has been found to be very toxic to rabbits. The photodegradate MB46513 or desulfinylfipronil, appears to have a higher acute toxicity to mammals than fipronil itself by a factor of about 10. Symptoms of acute toxicity via ingestion includes sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, dizziness, agitation, weakness, and tonic-clonic seizures. Clinical signs of exposure to fipronil are generally reversible and resolve spontaneously. As of 2011, no data were available regarding the chronic effects of fipronil on humans. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified fipronil as a group C (possible human) carcinogen based on an increase in thyroid follicular cell tumors in both sexes of the rat. However, as of 2011, no human data are available regarding the carcinogenic effects of fipronil. Two Frontline TopSpot products were determined by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to pose no significant exposure risks to workers applying the product. However, concerns were raised about human exposure to Frontline spray treatment in 1996, leading to a denial of registration for the spray product. Commercial pet groomers and veterinary physicians were considered to be at risk from chronic exposure via inhalation and dermal absorption during the application of the spray, assuming they may have to treat up to 20 large dogs per day. Fipronil is not volatile, so the likelihood of humans being exposed to this compound in the air is low. In contrast to neonicotinoids such as acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, which are absorbed through the skin to some extent, fipronil is not absorbed substantially through the skin. === Drinking water contamination === In 2021, the US EPA put fipronil on the Draft Fifth Contaminant Candidate List (CCL 5) which can lead to future regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. === Detection in body fluids === Fipronil may be quantitated in plasma by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. === Ecological toxicity === Fipronil is highly toxic to crustaceans, insects (including bees and termites) and zooplankton, as well as rabbits, the fringe-toed lizard, and certain groups of gallinaceous birds. It appears to reduce the longevity and fecundity of female braconid parasitoids. It is also highly toxic to many fish, though its toxicity varies with species. Conversely, the substance is relatively innocuous to passerines, wildfowl, and earthworms. Its half-life in soil is four months to one year, but much less on the soil surface because it is more sensitive to light (photolysis) than water (hydrolysis). Few studies of effects on wildlife have been conducted, but studies of the nontarget impact from emergency applications of fipronil as barrier sprays for locust control in Madagascar showed adverse impacts of fipronil on termites, which appear to be very severe and long-lived. Also, adverse effects were indicated in the short term on several other invertebrate groups, one species of lizard (Trachylepis elegans), and several species of birds (including the Madagascar bee-eater). Nontarget effects on some insects (predatory and detritivorous beetles, some parasitic wasps and bees) were also found in field trials of fipronil for desert locust control in Mauritania, and very low doses (0.6-2.0 g a.i./ha) used against grasshoppers in Niger caused impacts on nontarget insects comparable to those found with other insecticides used in grasshopper control. The implications of this for other wildlife and the ecology of the habitat remain unknown, but appear unlikely to be severe. This lack of severity was not observed in bee species in South America. Fipronil is also used in Brazil and studies on the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica have shown adverse reactions to the pesticide, including seizures, paralysis, and death with a lethal dose of .54 ng a.i./bee and a lethal concentration of .24 ng a.i./μl diet. These values are highly toxic in Scaptotrigona postica and bees in general. Toxic baiting with fipronil has been shown to be effective in locally eliminating German wasps. All colonies within foraging range were eliminated within one week. In May 2003, the French Directorate-General of Food at the Ministry of Agriculture determined that a case of mass bee mortality observed in southern France was related to acute fipronil toxicity. Toxicity was linked to defective seed treatment, which generated dust. In February 2003, the ministry decided to temporarily suspend the sale of BASF crop protection products containing fipronil in France. The seed treatment involved has since been banned. Notable results from wildlife studies include: Fipronil is highly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. Its tendency to bind to sediments and its low water solubility may reduce the potential hazard to aquatic wildlife. Fipronil is toxic to bees and should not be applied to vegetation when bees are foraging. Based on ecological effects, fipronil is highly toxic to upland game birds on an acute oral basis and very highly toxic on a subacute dietary basis, but is practically nontoxic to waterfowl on both acute and subacute bases. Chronic (avian reproduction) studies show no effects at the highest levels tested in mallards (NOEC = 1000 ppm) or quail (NOEC = 10 ppm). The metabolite MB 46136 is more toxic than the parent to avian species tested (very highly toxic to upland game birds and moderately toxic to waterfowl on an acute oral basis). Fipronil is highly toxic to bluegill sunfish and highly toxic to rainbow trout on an acute basis. An early-lifestage toxicity study in rainbow trout found that fipronil affects larval growth with a NOEC of 0.0066 ppm and an LOEC of 0.015 ppm. The metabolite MB 46136 is more toxic than the parent to freshwater fish (6.3 times more toxic to rainbow trout and 3.3 times more toxic to bluegill sunfish). Based on an acute daphnia study using fipronil and three supplemental studies using its metabolites, fipronil is characterized as highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates. An invertebrate lifecycle daphnia study showed that fipronil affects length in daphnids at concentrations greater than 9.8 ppb. A lifecycle study in mysids shows fipronil affects reproduction, survival, and growth of mysids at concentrations less than 5 ppt. Acute studies of estuarine animals using oysters, mysids, and sheepshead minnows show that fipronil is highly acutely toxic to oysters and sheepshead minnows, and very highly toxic to mysids. Metabolites MB 46136 and MB 45950 are more toxic than the parent to freshwater invertebrates (MB 46136 is 6.6 times more toxic and MB 45950 is 1.9 times more toxic to freshwater invertebrates). === Colony collapse disorder === Fipronil is one of the main chemical causes blamed for the spread of colony collapse disorder among bees. It has been found by the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France that even at very low nonlethal doses for bees, the pesticide still impairs their ability to locate their hive, resulting in large numbers of forager bees lost with every pollen-finding expedition. A synergistic toxic effect of fipronil with the fungal pathogen Nosema ceranae was recently reported. The functional basis for this toxic effect is now understood: the synergy between fipronil and the pathogenic fungus induces changes in male bee physiology leading to infertility. A 2013 report by the European Food Safety Authority identified fipronil as ""a high acute risk to honeybees when used as a seed treatment for maize"" and on July 16, 2013, the EU voted to ban the use of fipronil on maize and sunflowers within the EU. The ban took effect at the end of 2013. === Pharmacodynamics === Fipronil acts by binding to allosteric sites of GABAA receptors and GluCl receptors (of insects) as an antagonist (a form of noncompetitive inhibition). This prevents the opening of chloride ion channels normally encouraged by GABA, reducing the chloride ions' ability to lower a neuron's membrane potential. This results in an overabundance of neurons reaching action potential and likewise CNS toxicity via overstimulation. Acute oral LD50 (rat) 97 mg/kg Acute dermal LD50 (rat) >2000 mg/kg In mammals (including humans) fipronil overdose is characterized by vomiting, agitation, and seizures. Intravenous or intramuscular benzodiazepines are a useful antidote. == History == === Development === Fipronil was discovered and developed by Rhône-Poulenc between 1985 and 1987, and placed on the market in 1993 under the B2 U.S. patent 5,232,940 B2. Between 1987 and 1996, fipronil was evaluated on more than 250 insect pests on 60 crops worldwide, and crop protection accounted for about 39% of total fipronil production in 1997. Since 2003, BASF holds the patent rights for producing and selling fipronil-based products in many countries. === 2017 fipronil eggs contamination === The 2017 fipronil eggs contamination is an incident in Europe and South Korea involving the spread of insecticide contaminated eggs and egg products. Chicken eggs were found to contain fipronil and distributed to 15 European Union countries, Switzerland, and Hong Kong. Approximately 700,000 eggs are thought to have reached shelves in the UK alone. Eggs at 44 farms in Taiwan were also found with excessive fipronil levels. == References == == Further reading == Simon-Delso, N.; Amaral-Rogers, V.; Belzunces, L. P.; et al. (2015).

1060,"('Gimeracil', 'Gimestat')",Medical," Clinicians should be aware that eosinophilic pneumonia is one of the types of drug-induced lung injury that can be caused by tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (TS-1). Gimeracil or 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) has been reported to exert radiosensitization effects in cancer cells by suppressing DNA repair pathways. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of gimeracil and radiation combination therapy against oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The antitumor activity of gimeracil and/or radiation was investigated in HSC2 and/or SAS cells by growth inhibition assays and clonogenic survival assay. The expression of DNA double-strand break repair proteins were assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, also fluorescent measurements of intracellular reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) were carried out in gimeracil and/or radiation-treated HSC2 cells/tumors. Gimeracil and radiation combination treatment significantly inhibited OSCC cell/tumor growth and colony formation. Down-regulated expressions of DNA double-strand break repair proteins were observed in gimeracil and/or radiation treated cells/tumors. Additionally, the growth inhibitory effect of this combination treatment was associated with reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) generation. Gimeracil might exert radiosensitizing effects on OSCC cells. 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (gimeracil) is a component of the oral fluoropyrimidine derivative S-1. Gimeracil was originally added to S-1 to yield prolonged 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) concentrations in serum and tumor tissues by inhibiting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which degrades 5-FU. We previously demonstrated that gimeracil enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy through the suppression of homologous recombination (HR) in DNA double strand repair. The goal of this paper was to examine the effects of gimeracil on the sensitivity of anticancer drugs and hyperthermia in order to obtain effective radiosensitization. Various cell lines, including DLD 1 (human colon carcinoma cells) and cells deficient in HR or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), were used in clonogenic assays. The survival of these cells after various treatments (e.g., drug treatment, heat treatment, and radiation) was determined based on their colony-forming ability. Gimeracil enhanced cell-killing effects of camptothecin (CPT), 5-FU, and hydroxyurea. Gimeracil sensitized effects of CPT or 5-FU to cells deficient in HR or NHEJ to a similar extent as in other cells (DLD1 and a parent cell), indicating that its sensitizing mechanisms may be different from inhibition of HR or NHEJ. Combination of gimeracil and CPT or 5-FU sensitized radiation more effectively than each modality alone. Gimeracil also enhanced heat sensitivity at 42°C or more. The degree of heat sensitization with gimeracil increased as the temperature increased, and the combination of gimeracil and heat-sensitized radiation was more effective than each modality alone. Gimeracil enhanced sensitivity of CPT, 5-FU, and hyperthermia. Combination of these modalities sensitized radiation more efficiently than each modality alone.",Gimeracil,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002337421028641984), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018171735107898712)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09257?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Gimeracil: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09257?utm_source=openai')])"
1061,"('Prucalopride', 'Motegrity', 'Resotrans', 'Prucalopride [usan:inn:ban]', 'Prucalopride (usan/inn)')",Medical,"Prucalopride, sold under brand names Resolor and Motegrity among others, is a medication acting as a selective, high affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonist which targets the impaired motility associated with chronic constipation, thus normalizing bowel movements. Prucalopride was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2009, in Canada in 2011, in Israel in 2014, and in the United States in December 2018. The drug has also been tested for the treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. == Medical uses == The primary measure of efficacy in the clinical trials is three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week; a secondary measure is an increase of at least one complete spontaneous bowel movement per week. Further measures are improvements in PAC-QOL (a quality of life measure) and PAC-SYM (a range of stool, abdominal, and rectal symptoms associated with chronic constipation). Infrequent bowel movements, bloating, straining, abdominal pain, and defecation urge with inability to evacuate can be severe symptoms, significantly affecting quality of life. In three large clinical trials, 12 weeks of treatment with prucalopride 2 and 4 mg/day resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients reaching the primary efficacy endpoint of an average of ≥3 spontaneous complete bowel movements than with placebo. There was also significantly improved bowel habit and associated symptoms, patient satisfaction with bowel habit and treatment, and HR-QOL in patients with severe chronic constipation, including those who did not experience adequate relief with prior therapies (>80% of the trial participants). The improvement in patient satisfaction with bowel habit and treatment was maintained during treatment for up to 24 months; prucalopride therapy was generally well tolerated. Small clinical trials suggested that prucalopride administration results in the 5-HT4 receptor agonism-associated memory enhancing in healthy participants improving their ability to recall and increasing neural activation in the hippocampus and functionally related areas. == Contraindications == Prucalopride is contraindicated where there is hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, renal impairment requiring dialysis, intestinal perforation or obstruction due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis and toxic megacolon/megarectum. == Side effects == Prucalopride has been given orally to ~2700 patients with chronic constipation in controlled clinical trials. The most frequently reported side effects are headache and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea). Such reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment. == Mechanism of action == Prucalopride, a first in class dihydro-benzofuran-carboxamide, is a selective, high affinity serotonin (5-HT4) receptor agonist with enterokinetic activities. Prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT4 receptor stimulation: it stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force for defecation. The observed effects are exerted via highly selective action on 5-HT4 receptors: prucalopride has >150-fold higher affinity for 5-HT4 receptors than for other receptors. Prucalopride differs from other 5-HT4 agonists such as tegaserod and cisapride, which at therapeutic concentrations also interact with other receptors (5-HT1B/D and the cardiac human ether-a-go-go K+ or hERG channel respectively) and this may account for the adverse cardiovascular events that have resulted in the restricted availability of these drugs. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of prucalopride on QT interval and related adverse events have not demonstrated significant differences compared with placebo. == Pharmacokinetics == Prucalopride is rapidly absorbed (Cmax attained 2–3 hours after single 2 mg oral dose) and is extensively distributed. Metabolism is not the major route of elimination. In vitro, human liver metabolism is very slow and only minor amounts of metabolites are found. A large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (about 60% of the administered dose in urine and at least 6% in feces). Renal excretion of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Plasma clearance averages 317 ml/min, terminal half-life is 24–30 hours, and steady-state is reached within 3–4 days. On once daily treatment with 2 mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7 ng/ml, respectively. In vitro data indicate that prucalopride has a low interaction potential, and therapeutic concentrations of prucalopride are not expected to affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of co-medicated medicinal products. == Approval == In the European Economic Area, prucalopride was originally approved for the symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. Subsequently, it has been approved by the European Commission for use in adults – that is, including male patients – for the same indication. == References ==",Motegrity,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.109982233378105e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00017248096992261708)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([takeda.com](https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/shire-news-releases/2018/qmmwqk/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=107, start_index=9, title='FDA approves Shire’s Motegrity™ (prucalopride), the only serotonin-4 receptor agonist for adults with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.takeda.com/newsroom/shire-news-releases/2018/qmmwqk/?utm_source=openai')])"
1062,"('Hydroxyzine (dihydrochloride)', 'Hydroxyzine', 'Hydroxizine', 'Hydroxyzin', 'Hydroxycine')",Medical,"Hydroxyzine, sold under the brand names Atarax and Vistaril among others, is an antihistamine medication. It is used in the treatment of itchiness, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea (including that due to motion sickness). It is used either by mouth or injection into a muscle. Hydroxyzine works by blocking the effects of histamine. It is a first-generation antihistamine in the piperazine family of chemicals. Common side effects include sleepiness, headache, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include QT prolongation. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It was first made by Union Chimique Belge in 1956 and was approved for sale by Pfizer in the United States later that year. In 2022, it was the 46th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hydroxyzine is used in the treatment of itchiness, anxiety, and nausea due to motion sickness. A systematic review concluded that hydroxyzine outperforms placebo in treating generalized anxiety disorder. Insufficient data were available to compare the drug with benzodiazepines and buspirone. Hydroxyzine can also be used for the treatment of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, atopic or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system, or urinary tract. Use of hydroxyzine for premedication as a sedative has no effects on tropane alkaloids, such as atropine, but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified depending upon the state of the individual. Doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride used for sleep range from 25 to 100 mg. As with other antihistamine sleep aids, hydroxyzine is usually only prescribed for short term or ""as-needed"" use since tolerance to the central nervous system (CNS) effects of hydroxyzine can develop in as little as a few days. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of hydroxyzine for insomnia. A 2023 meta-review concludes that hydroxyzine is effective for inducing sleep onset but less effective for maintaining sleep for eight hours. == Contraindications == Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for subcutaneous or intra-articular administration. The administration of hydroxyzine in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during the onset of pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities. When administered to pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits, hydroxyzine caused abnormalities such as hypogonadism with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range. In humans, a significant dose has not yet been established in studies, and, by default, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has introduced contraindication guidelines regarding hydroxyzine. Use by those at risk for or showing previous signs of hypersensitivity is also contraindicated. Other contraindications include the administration of hydroxyzine alongside depressants and other compounds that affect the central nervous system; if necessary, it should only be administered concomitantly in small doses. If administered in small doses with other substances, as mentioned, then patients should refrain from using dangerous machinery, motor vehicles, or any other practice requiring absolute concentration, under safety laws. Studies have also been conducted which show that long-term prescription of hydroxyzine can lead to tardive dyskinesia after years of use, but effects related to dyskinesia have also anecdotally been reported after periods of 7.5 months, such as continual head rolling, lip licking, and other forms of athetoid movement. In certain cases, elderly patients' previous interactions with phenothiazine derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have contributed to dyskinesia at the administration of hydroxyzine due to hypersensitivity caused by prolonged treatment, and therefore some contraindication is given for short-term administration of hydroxyzine to those with previous phenothiazine use. == Side effects == Several reactions have been noted in manufacturer guidelines—deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, and dizziness have been reported in children and adults, as well as others such as hypotension, tinnitus, and headaches. Gastrointestinal effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild antimuscarinic properties of hydroxyzine. Central nervous system effects such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage. Such properties have been attributed to hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of hallucinogenic effects from use of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the reticular formation. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall central nervous system suppression by other CNS agents, such as lithium or ethanol. Hydroxyzine exhibits anxiolytic and sedative properties in many psychiatric patients. One study showed that patients reported very high levels of subjective sedation when first taking the drug, but that levels of reported sedation decreased markedly over 5–7 days, likely due to CNS receptor desensitization. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing sleep onset latency and increasing sleep duration—also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic responses. The use of sedating drugs alongside hydroxyzine can cause oversedation and confusion if administered at high doses—any form of hydroxyzine treatment alongside sedatives should be done under the supervision of a doctor. Because of the potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydroxyzine's predominant mechanism of action is as a potent and selective histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative effects. Unlike many other first-generation antihistamines, hydroxyzine has a lower affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and in accordance, has a lower risk of anticholinergic side effects. In addition to its antihistamine activity, hydroxyzine has also been shown to act more weakly as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor, and the α1-adrenergic receptor. Similarly to the atypical antipsychotics, the comparably weak antiserotonergic effects of hydroxyzine likely underlie its usefulness as an anxiolytic. Other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety. Hydroxyzine crosses the blood–brain barrier easily and exerts effects in the central nervous system. A positron emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 67.6% for a single 30 mg dose of hydroxyzine. In addition, subjective sleepiness correlated well with the brain H1 receptor occupancy. PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% is associated with a high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative. Hydroxyzine also acts as a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase. === Pharmacokinetics === Hydroxyzine can be administered orally or via intramuscular injection. When given orally, hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed and distributed with oral and intramuscular administration, and is metabolized in the liver; the main metabolite (45%), cetirizine, is formed through oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a carboxylic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase, and overall effects are observed within one hour of administration. Higher concentrations are found in the skin than in the plasma. Cetirizine, although less sedating, is non-dialyzable and possesses similar antihistamine properties. The other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated metabolite, and an O-dealkylated 1/16 metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The N-dealykylated metabolite, norchlorcyclizine, bears some structural similarities to trazodone, but it has not been established whether it is pharmacologically active. In animals, hydroxyzine and its metabolites are excreted in feces primarily through biliary elimination. In rats, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged. The time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of hydroxyzine is about 2.0 hours in both adults and children and its elimination half-life is around 20.0 hours in adults (mean age 29.3 years) and 7.1 hours in children. Its elimination half-life is shorter in children compared to adults. In another study, the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in elderly adults was 29.3 hours. One study found that the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in adults was as short as 3 hours, but this may have just been due to methodological limitations. Although hydroxyzine has a long elimination half-life and acts, in-vivo, as an antihistamine for as long as 24 hours, the predominant CNS effects of hydroxyzine and other antihistamines with long half-lives seem to diminish after 8 hours. Administration in geriatrics differs from the administration of hydroxyzine in younger patients; according to the FDA, there have not been significant studies made (2004), which include population groups over 65, which provide a distinction between elderly aged patients and other younger groups. Hydroxyzine should be administered carefully in the elderly with consideration given to possible reduced elimination. == Chemistry == Hydroxyzine is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine class of antihistamines. Hydroxyzine is supplied mainly as a dihydrochloride salt (hydroxyzine hydrochloride) but also to a lesser extent as an embonate salt (hydroxyzine pamoate). The molecular weights of hydroxyzine, hydroxyzine dihydrochloride, and hydroxyzine pamoate are 374.9 g/mol, 447.8 g/mol, and 763.3 g/mol, respectively. Due to their differences in molecular weight, 1 mg hydroxyzine dihydrochloride is equivalent to about 1.7 mg hydroxyzine pamoate. === Analogues === Analogues of hydroxyzine include buclizine, cetirizine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, etodroxizine, meclizine, and pipoxizine among others. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Hydroxyzine preparations require a doctor's prescription. The drug is available in two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or hydrochloride salts. Vistaril, Equipose, Masmoran, and Paxistil are preparations of the pamoate salt, while Atarax, Alamon, Aterax, Durrax, Tran-Q, Orgatrax, Quiess, and Tranquizine are of the hydrochloride salt. == See also == Gabasync == References ==",Hydroxizine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4781842764932662e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034290633630007505)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682866.html ', [])"

Some of the serious adverse effects which occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with other antibiotic drug classes include CNS and tendon toxicity. The currently marketed quinolones have safety profiles similar to that of other antimicrobial classes. The serious events may occur with therapeutic or with acute overdose. At therapeutic doses they include: central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon / articular toxicity, and rarely hepatic toxicity. Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare and include: renal failure and seizure. Children and the elderly are at greater risk. Tendon damage may manifest during, as well as up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy. The FDA added a boxed warnings on all fluoroquinolones about the possible toxic effects of fluoroquinolones on tendons. In August 2013, the FDA issued a Safety Announcement where they described that they are requiring the medication guides and drug labels for all fluoroquinolones to be updated and better describe the risk for peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral neuropathy may occur very quickly, and may be irreversible.

It has a novel mechanism of action which involves inhibition of bacterial type II topoisomerases. Zoliflodacin is being developed as part of a public-private partnership between Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics and the Global Antibiotic Research & Development Partnership (GARDP), and the drug has demonstrated clinical efficacy equivalent to ceftriaxone in Phase III clinical trials. == Susceptible bacteria == Zoliflodacin has shown in vitro activity against the following species of bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus pyogenes Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Mycoplasma pneumoniae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma genitalium == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Zoliflodacin is primarily active against both Gram-positive, but has activity against fastidious Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an enzyme necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell replication. == History == A high throughput screening campaign aimed at identifying compounds with whole cell antibacterial activity performed at Pharmacia & Upjohn identified compound PNU-286607, a progenitor of Zoliflodacin, as having the desired activity. Subsequent biological profiling of PNU-286607 showed that the compound inhibited DNA synthesis in susceptible bacteria, and analysis of mutants resistant to the compound's activity indicated that these compounds acted on DNA gyrase at a site distinct from that of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Subsequent research at AstraZeneca led to the discovery that the nitroaromatic in PNU-286607 could be replaced with a fused benzisoxazole ring, which allowed for an exploration of different groups at the 3-position of the heterocycle. This work was continued at Entasis Pharmaceuticals where extensive optimization resulted in the discovery of ETX0914, which was renamed Zolifodacin in the course of its clinical development. == References ==",Zoliflodacin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011240804451517761), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031963707879185677)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoliflodacin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Zoliflodacin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoliflodacin?utm_source=openai')])"

Cevipabulin-stabilized microtubules were more flexible compared to the microtubules stabilized by paclitaxel, the most commonly used microtubule stabilizing agent. Similar to the paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules, cevipabulin-stabilized microtubules were driven by kinesins in an in vitro gliding assay. The velocity of cevipabulin-stabilized microtubules was significantly higher than that of paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules. These findings will enrich the variety of microtubules with difference in mechanical and dynamic properties and widen their applications in nanotechnology. Antimitotic agents are among the most effective drugs for the treatment of solid tumors and metastatic cancer. These drugs promote cell death by interfering with the crucial structural and regulatory function of microtubules in cells. Most of the agents of clinical relevance are natural products or semisynthetic derivatives thereof, and they fall into two major classes: microtubule stabilizers such as the taxanes, which enhance tubulin polymerization, and microtubule destabilizers such as the Vinca alkaloids, which lead to the depolymerization of existing microtubules. While these drugs are effective in inhibiting the progression of certain types of tumors, their utility is limited in part by incomplete tumor responses and/or significant side effects. In addition, inherent resistance is encountered in many tumor types, or acquired resistance may occur as a result of multiple cycles of therapy. Cevipabulin (TTI-237) is a novel, small synthetic molecule with an unusual biological mode of action. It appears to bind at the vinca site, but exhibits some properties similar to those of taxane-site ligands, such as enhancing tubulin polymerization. The compound works against a variety of tumors, including those resistant to paclitaxel and vincristine. Furthermore, cevipabulin is stable and water-soluble, and can be administered i.v. or p.o. in saline. It can be synthesized in bulk quantities efficiently. Based on these properties, cevipabulin was selected for clinical development. Microtubules, composed of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, have remained popular anticancer targets for decades. Six known binding sites on tubulin dimers have been identified thus far, with five sites on β-tubulin and only one site on α-tubulin, hinting that compounds binding to α-tubulin are less well characterized. Cevipabulin, a microtubule-active antitumor clinical candidate, is widely accepted as a microtubule-stabilizing agent by binding to the vinblastine site. Our x-ray crystallography study reveals that, in addition to binding to the vinblastine site, cevipabulin also binds to a new site on α-tubulin. We find that cevipabulin at this site pushes the αT5 loop outward, making the nonexchangeable GTP exchangeable, which reduces the stability of tubulin, leading to its destabilization and degradation. Our results confirm the existence of a new agent binding site on α-tubulin and shed light on the development of tubulin degraders as a new generation of antimicrotubule drugs targeting this novel site.",Cevipabulin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07889816164970398), (' INDUSTR', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03372126817703247), ('ICAL', -8.106198947643861e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519838809967041)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19907719/,https://www.glpbio.com/cevipabulin.html,https://www.invivochem.com/cevipabulin.html ', [])"
1071,"('Fidaxomicin', 'Tiacumicin b', 'Dificid', 'Dificlir', 'Lipiarmycin')",Medical,"Fidaxomicin, sold under the brand name Dificid (by Merck) among others, is the first member of a class of narrow spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic drugs called tiacumicins. It is a fermentation product obtained from the actinomycete Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subspecies hamdenesis. Fidaxomicin is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream when taken orally, is bactericidal, and selectively eradicates pathogenic Clostridioides difficile with relatively little disruption to the multiple species of bacteria that make up the normal, healthy intestinal microbiota. The maintenance of normal physiological conditions in the colon may reduce the probability of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection. It is marketed by Merck, which acquired Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 2015, and had in turn bought the originating company, Optimer Pharmaceuticals. It is used for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection, which is also known as Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea or Clostridioides difficile-associated illness (CDI), and can develop into Clostridioides difficile colitis and pseudomembranous colitis. It is approved as a generic medication. == Mechanism == Fidaxomicin binds to and prevents movement of the ""switch regions"" of bacterial RNA polymerase. Switch motion occurs during the opening and closing of the DNA:RNA clamp, a process that occurs throughout RNA transcription but is especially important in the opening of double-stranded DNA during the initiation of transcription. It has minimal systemic absorption and a narrow spectrum of activity; it is active against Gram positive bacteria, especially clostridia. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range for C. difficile (ATCC 700057) is 0.03–0.25 μg/mL. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthetic pathway of fidaxomicin, also known as tiacumicin B, was first proposed in 2011 by Zhang et al. based on the identification of and sequence analysis of the tiacumicin B tia-gene cluster. The biosynthesis begins with the formation of the core aglycone, tiacumicinone, done by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) coded for by the tiaA1-tiaA4 genes. The PKS is composed of a loading domain and eight elongating domains. Tiacumicinone formation starts when the loading acyltransferase domain loads propionyl-CoA onto the loading acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. The following eight modules extend and tailor the polyketide using malonyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, and ethylmalonyl-CoA. The final thioesterase domain hydrolyzes the polyketide to form the 18-membered tiacumicinone aglycone. Modification to the aglycone begins with oxidation at the C(20) position by TiaP2, a cytochrome P450. This is followed by attachment of ᴅ-noviose at the OH-C(11) position by the glycotransferase TiaG1. Next, the glycotransferase TiaG2 binds ᴅ-rhamnose at the OH-C(20) position followed by the attachment of an isobutyric ester at the OH-C(4’’) position of the noviose. TiaB, which codes for another type I PKS, forms an homoorsellinic acid moiety from propionyl-CoA and three malonyl-CoA elongating units that is coupled to rhamnose at the OH-C(4’) position by the TiaF, a ketoacyl ACP synthase. This is followed by chlorination of the aryl moiety by the halogenase TiaM and methylation of the OH-C(2’) position of rhamnose by the methyltransferase TiaS5. Lastly, there is another oxidation by the cytochrome P450 TiaP1 that oxidizes at the C(18) position of the aglycone to give tiacumicin B. == Clinical trials == Good results were reported by the company in 2009, from a North American Phase III clinical trial comparing it with oral vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection. The study met its primary endpoint of clinical cure, showing that fidaxomicin was non-inferior to oral vancomycin (92.1% vs. 89.8%). In addition, the study met its secondary endpoint of recurrence: 13.3% of the subjects had a recurrence with fidaxomicin vs. 24.0% with oral vancomycin. The study also met its exploratory endpoint of global cure (77.7% for fidaxomicin vs. 67.1% for vancomycin). Clinical cure was defined as patients requiring no further therapy for the treatment of C. difficile infection two days after completion of study medication. Global cure was defined as patients who were cured at the end of therapy and did not have a recurrence in the next four weeks. Fidaxomicin was shown to be as good as the standard-of-care, vancomycin, for treating Clostridioides difficile infection in a Phase III clinical trial published in February 2011. The authors also reported significantly fewer recurrences of infection, a frequent problem with C. difficile, and similar drug side effects. Based on a multicenter clinical trial, fidaxomicin was reported well tolerated in children with Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea and has a pharmacokinetic profile in children similar to that in adults. Regarding the high budget to spend for fidaxomicin, a systematic literature review published in 2017, showed that fidaxomicin was demonstrated to be cost-effective versus metronidazole and vancomycin in patients with Clostridioides difficile infection. == Approvals and indications == On April 5, 2011, the drug won an FDA advisory panel's unanimous approval for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection, and gained full FDA approval on May 27, 2011. As of January 2020, fidaxomicin is FDA-approved for use in children aged 6 months and older for C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD). == Adverse effects == The most common side effects reported in adults with the use of fidaxomicin include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, anemia, neutropenia, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In children the most common side effects include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, and increased aminotransferases. == References ==",Lipiarmycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.10091550648212433), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011459716595709324)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/807545/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=9, title='Lipiarmycin, a new antibiotic from Actinoplanes.

1077,"('S9718', 'Tk216')",Medical," Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric malignancy driven by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein formed by the chromosomal translocation t(11; 22). The small molecule TK216 was developed as a first-in-class direct EWSR1-FLI1 inhibitor and is in phase II clinical trials in combination with vincristine for patients with EWS. However, TK216 exhibits anti-cancer activity against cancer cell lines and xenografts that do not express EWSR1-FLI1, and the mechanism underlying cytotoxicity remains unresolved. We apply a forward-genetics screening platform utilizing engineered hypermutation in EWS cell lines and identify recurrent mutations in TUBA1B, encoding ⍺-tubulin, that prove sufficient to drive resistance to TK216. Using reconstituted microtubule (MT) polymerization in vitro and cell-based chemical probe competition assays, we demonstrate that TK216 acts as an MT destabilizing agent. This work defines the mechanism of cytotoxicity of TK216, explains the synergy observed with vincristine, and calls for a reexamination of ongoing clinical trials with TK216. Ewing Sarcoma (ES), a rare cancer with a pathognomonic translocation resulting in the Ewing sarcoma gene (EWS)::FLI1 oncoprotein, has a poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting. Tokalas (TK)216 was designed to bind EWS::FLI1 proteins directly, disrupt protein-protein interactions, and inhibit transcription factor function.

The maximum tolerated dose for the 14-day infusion of TK216, 200 mg/m TK216 administered as 14-day continuous infusion with or without vincristine was well tolerated and showed limited activity at the RP2D in R/R ES. The E26-transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors regulate multiple aspects of the normal hematopoietic system. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting aberrant ETS activity and its contribution to leukemia initiation and progression. In this study, we evaluated the small-molecule ETS inhibitor TK216 and demonstrated its anti-tumor activity in pediatric leukemia. We found TK216 induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibited the migratory capability of leukemic cells, without significantly inhibiting the cell viability of normal blood mononuclear cells. Priming the leukemic cells with 5-Azacitidine enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TK216 on pediatric leukemia cells. Importantly, we found purine-rich box1 (PU.1) to be a potential target of TK216 in myeloid and B-lymphoid leukemic cells. In addition, TK216 sharply decreased Mcl-1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this, TK216 also potentiated the cytotoxic effects of Bcl-2 inhibition in venetoclax-resistant cells. The sustained survival benefit provided to leukemic cells in the presence of bone-marrow-derived conditioned media is also found to be modulated by TK216. Taken together, our data indicates that TK216 could be a promising targeted therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute myeloid and B-lymphoid leukemia.",Tk216,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006842655711807311), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003193875541910529)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Glucose lowering effects of DPP-4 inhibitors are mainly mediated by GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) incretin hormones which are inactivated by DPP-4. Gemigliptin was initially developed solely by LG Life Sciences. In 2010, Double-Crane Pharmaceutical Co. (DCPC) joined with LGLS to co-develop the final compound and collaborate on the marketing of the drug in China. LGLS also announced in November 2010 that NOBEL Ilac has been granted rights to develop and commercialize gemigliptin in Turkey. A new drug application (NDA) for gemigliptin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes was submitted to the Korea Food & Drug Administration (KFDA) in July 2011. In June 2012, the KFDA approved the manufacture and distribution of LG Life Sciences’ diabetes treatment, Zemiglo, the main substance of which is gemigliptin. LG Life Sciences signed a licensing agreement with multinational pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi (Paris, France) and Stendhal (Mexico City, Mexico) for 104 countries. Currently, gemigliptin has been approved in eleven countries such as India, Columbia, Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador, and several clinical studies are in progress in Russia, Mexico, and Thailand. == History == The NDA for gemigliptin was submitted to the Korea Food & Drug Administration (KFDA) in July 2011, and it was approved in June 2012. By the end of 2012, gemigliptin will be marketed in Korea as Zemiglo which is the fifth new DPP-4 inhibitor diabetes treatment in the world. Sanofi-Synthelabo India Private Limited announced the launch of drug for type 2 diabetes patients in India: Zemiglo (gemigliptin) in July 2016. Zemiglo is a once daily, oral tablet. As per the International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas 2015, India is home to the second largest number of adults living with diabetes worldwide, after China, with 69.1 million patients and expected to rise to 1401 million in 2040. India is the largest contributor to South East Asia regional mortality, with 1 million deaths attributable to diabetes. These statistics reveal how diabetes is fast gaining the status of a potential epidemic in India and establishes the need for treatment compliance and effective control through diet, exercise and drugs for long-term positive effects in disease management. == Mechanism of action == DPP-4 is a serine protease located on the cell surfaces throughout the body. In plasma, DPP-4 enzyme rapidly inactivates incretins including GLP-1 and GIP which are produced in the intestine depending on the blood glucose level and contribute to the physiological regulation of glucose homeostatis. Active GLP-1 and GIP increase the production and release of insulin by pancreatic beta cells. GLP-1 also reduces the secretion of glucagon by pancreatic alpha cells, thereby resulting in a decreased hepatic glucose production. However these incretins are rapidly cleaved by DPP-4 and their effects last only for a few minutes. DPP-4 inhibitors block the cleavage of the gliptins and thus lead to an increased insulin level and a reduced glucagon level in a glucose-dependent way. This results in a decrease of fasting and postprandial glycemia, as well as HbA1c levels. == Characteristics == ·Gemigliptin is a reversible, potent, selective, competitive, and long-acting inhibitor of DPP-4. ·Gemigliptin is orally administered 50 mg once daily either as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs. It can be taken with or without food. ·No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. ·Gemigliptin shows a low propensity of drug interactions with metformin, pioglitazone, glimepiride, CYP3A4 inhibitors, rosuvastatin, or irbesartan, and dose adjustment of gemigliptin is not required for the patients who are concomitantly receiving these drugs. ·Gemigliptin decreases the mean level of HbA1c from baseline by 1.24% in monotherapy and 0.8% in add-on therapy with metformin. For gemigliptin as an initial combination with metformin, the mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c was 2.8%. In head-to-head comparisons, the mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c was 0.8% for gemigliptin with metformin and 0.8% for sitagliptin with metformin, hence the efficacy of gemigliptin is found to be comparable to sitagliptin. ·Gemigliptin was shown to be more effective in reduction of glycemic variability than glimepiride and sitagliptin with metformin as an initial combination therapy for drug naïve patients with T2DM. ·Gemigliptin is generally well tolerated in controlled clinical studies as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy. The incidences of AEs are generally similar to those of placebo and active control groups. == Research == === Preclinical studies === Gemigliptin is a competitive, reversible DPP-4 inhibitor (Ki = 7.25 ± 0.67 nM) with excellent selectivity over other critical human proteases such as DPP-2, DPP-8, DPP-9, elastase, trypsin, urokinase and cathepsin G. The kinetics of DPP-4 inhibition by gemigliptin was characterized by a fast association and a slow dissociation rate compared to sitagliptin (fast on and fast off rate) or vildagliptin (slow on and slow off rate). Gemigliptin was rapidly absorbed after single oral dosing and the compound was eliminated with a half-life of 3.6 h, 5.2 h, and 5.4 h in the rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. The bioavailability of gemigliptin in the rat, dog, and monkey was species-dependent with the values of 94%, 73%, and 26%, respectively. Following the oral administration of gemigliptin in the rat, dog and monkey, about 80% inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity were observed at the plasma levels of 18 nM, 14 nM and 4 nM, respectively. In a diet-induced obesity model, gemigliptin reduced glucose excursion during OGTT in a dose dependent manner with the minimum effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg and enhanced glucose-stimulated plasma GLP-1 increase in a dose dependent manner reaching the maximum effect at the dose of 1 mg/kg. Following 4 week oral repeat dosing in the DIO mice, gemigliptin reduced significantly HbA1c with the minimum effective dose of 3 mg/kg. In the beagle dog, gemigliptin significantly enhanced active GLP-1, decreased glucagon, and reduced glucose excursion during OGTT following a single dosing. Studies on animals suggest its positive effect on hepatic and renal fibrosis . Data on human patients are still inconclusive . === Clinical studies === Monotherapy The efficacy and safety of gemigliptin monotherapy were evaluated in two blinded placebo controlled studies and one blinded active-controlled study. A phase II study (study identifier: LG-DPCL002) of gemigliptin was conducted in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group design with three doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg qd for the purpose of finding a dose responsiveness and an optimal dose in patients with T2DM. The mean changes of HbA1c at week 12 from the baseline were –0.98%, –0.74%, –0.78% (when adjusted with placebo data, –0.92%, –0.68%, and –0.72%) at 50, 100, and 200 mg, respectively. Among the effective doses obtained from the phase II study in patients with T2DM, the 50 mg dose showed a similar efficacy as the 100 and 200 mg doses, within the maximum safety margin. Similar findings were reported from two phase III studies. Patients were randomized to receive gemigliptin, either a 50 mg qd (n=90) or a placebo (n=92) for 24 weeks (study identifier: LG-DPCL005; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01601990). The placebo-subtracted changes from baseline in HbA1c were reported to be −0.71% (95% confidence interval [CI], −1.04 to −0.37) with gemigliptin 50 mg. In addition, a 28-week open-label extension study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of gemigliptin. Among 165 patients who consented to participate in the extension period of study LG-DPCL005, 158 patients (96%) completed their treatments for 52 weeks. All patients were switched to or continued their treatments only with gemigliptin 50 mg qd during the extension period. A further decrease in HbA1c was observed in the continued treatment with gemigliptin 50 mg in this extension period, and the mean change from baseline at 52 weeks (–0.87%) was still clinically and statistically significant (full analysis set analysis, P<0.0001). In another blinded, active-controlled, phase III trial (study identifier: LG-DPCL011), eligible patients with HbA1c greater than 7.5% were randomized to receive gemigliptin 50 mg qd with metformin slow release (SR) qd (n=141), gemigliptin 50 mg qd (n=142), or metformin SR qd (n=150) for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, the reduction from the baseline in HbA1c was –1.24% for gemigliptin monotherapy. In a meta-analysis involving data from 10 randomized controlled trials (1,792 patients), Dutta et. al. demonstrated the good glycaemic efficacy, durability and safety of gemigliptin in managing type-2 diabetes Initial combination therapy with metformin In this randomized, blinded, active-controlled, phase III trial (study identifier: LG-DPCL011, INICOM study; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01787396), eligible patients with an HbA1c greater than 7.5% were randomized to gemigliptin 50 mg qd+metformin SR qd (n=141), gemigliptin 50 mg qd (n=142), or metformin SR qd (n=150). From weeks 2 to 6, metformin SR was uptitrated incrementally from 500 to 2,000 mg/day maximum in the gemigliptin/metformin and metformin groups. The mean daily doses of metformin at week 24 were 1,699 and 1,868 mg for the gemigliptin/metformin group and the metformin group, respectively. Mean change in HbA1c from baseline was –2.06% for gemigliptin/metformin group versus –1.24% for the gemigliptin group and –1.47% for the metformin group, respectively (P<0.0001 for all comparisons of combination therapy vs. monotherapy). The differences in proportions achieving an HbA1c <7% or <6.5% were also statistically significant (P<0.0001) between the combination therapy and the respective monotherapy groups. Add-on to metformin A 24-week, multinational, randomized, blinded, active-controlled study (study identifier: LG-DPCL006; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01602003) was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin 50 mg compared to the active control (sitagliptin) added to ongoing metformin therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin alone (HbA1c, 7% to 11%). After 24 weeks, the reduction from baseline for HbA1c was 0.81% for gemigliptin 25 mg twice a day (bid) and 0.77% for gemigliptin 50 mg qd, and the differences in the least square mean changes from baseline between groups (each group of gemigliptin-sitagliptin group) were −0.011% in gemigliptin 25 mg bid and 0.004% in gemigliptin 50 mg qd. The proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c <7% at week 24 (gemigliptin 25 mg bid group, 50%; gemigliptin 50 mg qd group, 54.07%) was comparable to the results with sitagliptin 100 mg qd (48.87%). The efficacy of lowering HbA1c in the gemigliptin group was generally consistent across the subgroups based on age (<65 or ≥65 years), gender, duration of T2DM (5, >5 to 10, or >10 years), and baseline body mass index (BMI, <25 or ≥25 kg/m2). In addition, gemigliptin groups led to a significantly greater inhibition of plasma DPP-4 compared to sitagliptin. This study was extended by 28 weeks in order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of gemigliptin. All treatment groups showed clinically and statistically (P<0.0001) significant improvement in glycemic control from baseline after 52 weeks. The reduction from the baseline in HbA1c was –1.06 (95% CI, –1.28 to –0.85) in the patients who continued to receive gemigliptin 50 mg qd. Add-on to metformin and glimepiride In this multicenter, randomized, blinded, phase III study (study identifier: LG-DPCL010, TROICA study; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01990469), eligible patients with inadequate glycemic control (7%≤HbA1c≤11%) were randomized to gemigliptin 50 mg qd (n=109) or placebo (n= 110). The baseline demographics were similar between groups (age, 60.9 years; BMI, 24.9 kg/m2; duration of T2DM, 12.9 years), with mean±standard deviation (SD) baseline HbA1c of 8.12%± 0.82% in the gemigliptin group and 8.15%±0.89% in the placebo group. At week 24, the adjusted mean±standard error change for HbA1c with gemigliptin was –0.88%±0.17% (change with placebo –0.01%±0.18%; difference –0.87%±0.12%; 95% CI, –1.09 to –0.64; P<0.0001). Add-on therapy in patients with renal impairment RI in T2DM limits the usable medications for lowering glucose level and requires frequent monitoring of renal function. Gemigliptin has balanced elimination between urinary/fecal excretion and hepatic metabolism; therefore, it does not require dose adjustment in patient with moderate to severe RI. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin in T2DM patients with moderate to severe RI. This randomized, blinded, parallel group, phase IIIb study (study identifier: LG-DPCL015, GUARD study; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01968044) was composed of a 12-week, placebo controlled period, followed by a 40-week, blinded active controlled extension period (placebo switched to linagliptin). A total of 132 patients with moderate or severe RI were randomized to receive gemigliptin (n=66) or placebo (n=66). Insulin was used as predominant background therapy (63.1%). At week 12, the placebo-adjusted mean change in HbA1c from the baseline was –1.20% (95% CI, –1.53 to –0.87; P<0.0001). A similar profile was also observed in other glycemic control parameters (fasting plasma glucose, glycated albumin, and fructosamine). Effects on glycemic variability Glycemic variability and chronic sustained hyperglycemia are the main components of dysglycemia in diabetes. The previous studies suggested that different pharmacodynamic profiles between DPP-4 inhibitors have been associated with the different effects on glycemic variability. In this study, a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group, open-label, exploratory study was designed to evaluate the efficacy on glycemic variability and safety of initial combination therapy of gemigliptin 50 mg qd versus sitagliptin 100 mg qd, or glimepiride 2 mg qd with metformin in patients with T2DM (study identifier: LG-DPCL012, STABLE study; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01890629). The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and SD of glucose were used for assessing glucose fluctuations from the baseline after 12 weeks of treatment. At 12 weeks, MAGE was significantly lower in the DPP-4 inhibitor groups (gemigliptin and sitagliptin) than in the glimepiride group (–43.1, –38.3, and –21.7 mg/dL, respectively). Furthermore, the SD of mean glucose was significantly lower in patients with gemigliptin when compared with sitagliptin (P=0.023) and glimepiride (P=0.0058). Ongoing studies Several clinical studies in LG Life Sciences are actively underway to assess the efficacy and safety as an add-on combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin) (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02831361), to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin-rosuvastatin fixed-dose combination in patients with T2DM and dyslipidemia in phase III clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02126358), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemigliptin compared with vildagliptin in Russian patients with T2DM (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02343926). == See also == Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 Development of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors == Footnotes == == Further reading == == External links == ""Gemigliptin"".

It was developed by McNeil Pharmaceutical, approved by the FDA in 1980, and sold as the sodium salt zomepirac sodium, under the brand name Zomax. Due to its clinical effectiveness, it was preferred by doctors in many situations and obtained a large share of the analgesics market; however, it was subsequently withdrawn in March 1983 due to its tendency to cause serious anaphylaxis in a small, but unpredictable, subset of the patient population. == Indications == Zomepirac was indicated for the management of mild to severe pain. Multiple clinical trials demonstrated zomepirac to be more effective than aspirin or codeine alone and to be as effective as analgesic combinations containing codeine or other opioids. Zomepirac provided analgesia comparable with usual intramuscular doses of morphine in postoperative pain and that with long-term use, neither tolerance to its analgesic effect nor psychological or physical dependence had been demonstrated. == Chemical structure == Zomepirac is the sodium salt of 5-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-1,4 dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-2-acetate dihydrate. It is a pyrrole-acetic acid which is structurally related to tolmetin. The chemical structure differs from other NSAIDs in that the central benzene ring has been replaced by a pyrrole. == Mechanism of action == Zomepirac is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. == Anaphylaxis == Zomepirac does not cause anaphylaxis directly, but it is metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) to a reactive glucuronide which binds irreversibly to plasma albumin. == Synthesis == Zomepirac can be synthesized from diethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate, chloroacetone, and aqueous methylamine (MeNH2) via modification of the Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis to give intermediate 1. Saponification, monoesterification, and thermal decarboxylation gives ester 2.

Such aryl sulfonamide Nav1.7 channel blockers bind to the extracellular surface of the S1-S4 voltage-sensor segment of homologous Domain 4, whose movement is associated with inactivation. This binding site is different from that of classic sodium channel inhibitors like lidocaine, which also bind with higher affinity to the inactivated state than the resting state but bind at a site within the pore of the channel. The common dependence on gating state with distinct binding sites raises the possibility that inhibition by aryl sulfonamides and by classic local anesthetics might show an interaction mediated by their mutual state dependence. We tested this possibility by examining the state-dependent inhibition by PF-05089771 and lidocaine of human Nav1.7 channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. At -80 mV, where a small fraction of channels are in an inactivated state under drug-free conditions, inhibition by PF-05089771 was both enhanced and speeded in the presence of lidocaine. The results suggest that lidocaine binding to the channel enhances PF-05089771 inhibition by altering the equilibrium between resting states (with D4S4 in the inner position) and inactivated states (with D4S4 in the outer position). The gating state-mediated interaction between the compounds illustrates a principle applicable to many state-dependent agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The results show that lidocaine enhances the degree and rate of inhibition of Nav1.7 channels by the aryl sulfonamide compound PF-05089771, consistent with state-dependent binding by lidocaine increasing the fraction of channels presenting a high-affinity binding site for PF-05089771 and suggesting that combinations of agents targeted to the pore-region binding site of lidocaine and the external binding site of aryl sulfonamides may have synergistic actions.

Furosemide may also be used for the treatment of high blood pressure. It can be taken intravenously or orally. When given intravenously, furosemide typically takes effect within five minutes; when taken orally, it typically metabolizes within an hour. Common side effects include orthostatic hypotension (decrease in blood pressure while standing, and associated lightheadedness), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and photosensitivity (sensitivity to light). Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss. It is recommended that serum electrolytes (especially potassium), serum CO2, creatinine, BUN levels, and liver and kidney functioning be monitored in patients taking furosemide. It is also recommended to be alert for the occurrence of any potential blood dyscrasias. Furosemide works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Common side effects of furosemide injection include hypokalemia (low potassium level), hypotension (low blood pressure), and dizziness. Furosemide was patented in 1959 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, it is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 24th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 23 million prescriptions. In 2020/21 it was the twentieth most prescribed medication in England. It is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned drug list due to concerns that it may mask other drugs. It has also been used in race horses for the treatment and prevention of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage. == Medical uses == Furosemide is primarily used for the treatment of edema, but also in some cases of hypertension (where there is also kidney or heart impairment). It is often viewed as a first-line agent in most people with edema caused by congestive heart failure because of its anti-vasoconstrictor and diuretic effects. Compared with furosemide, however, torasemide (aka ""torsemide"") has been demonstrated to show improvements to heart failure symptoms, possibly lowering the rates of rehospitalization associated with heart failure, with no difference in risk of death. Torsemide may also be safer than furosemide. Providing self-administered subcutaneous furosemide has been found to reduce hospital admissions in people with heart failure, resulting in significant savings in healthcare costs. Furosemide is also used for liver cirrhosis, kidney impairment, nephrotic syndrome, in adjunct therapy for swelling of the brain or lungs where rapid diuresis is required (IV injection), and in the management of severe hypercalcemia in combination with adequate rehydration. === Kidney disease === In chronic kidney diseases with hypoalbuminemia, furosemide is used along with albumin to increase diuresis. It is also used along with albumin in nephrotic syndrome to reduce edema. === Other information === Furosemide is mainly excreted by tubular secretion in the kidney. In kidney impairment, clearance is reduced, increasing the risk of adverse effects. Lower initial doses are recommended in older patients (to minimize side effects) and high doses may be needed in kidney failure. It can also cause kidney damage; this is mainly by loss of excessive fluid (i.e., dehydration), and is usually reversible. Furosemide acts within 1 hour of oral administration (after IV injection, the peak effect is within 30 minutes). Diuresis is usually complete within 6–8 hours of oral administration, but there is significant variation between individuals. == Adverse effects == Furosemide also can lead to gout caused by hyperuricemia. Hyperglycemia is also a common side effect. The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, to cause low serum potassium concentration (hypokalemia) has given rise to combination products, either with potassium or with the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride (Co-amilofruse). Other electrolyte abnormalities that can result from furosemide use include hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. In the treatment of heart failure, many studies have shown that the long-term use of furosemide can cause varying degrees of thiamine deficiency, so thiamine supplementation is also suggested. Furosemide is a known ototoxic agent generally causing transient hearing loss but can be permanent. Reported cases of furosemide-induced hearing loss appeared to be associated with rapid intravenous administration, high dosages, concomitant renal disease, and coadministration with other ototoxic medication. However, a recently reported longitudinal study showed that participants treated with loop diuretics over 10 years were 40% more likely to develop hearing loss and 33% more likely of progressive hearing loss compared to participants who did not use loop diuretics. This suggests the long-term consequences of loop diuretics on hearing could be a more significant than previously thought and further research is required in this area. Other precautions include nephrotoxicity, sulfonamide (sulfa) allergy, and increased free thyroid hormone effects with large doses. == Interactions == Furosemide has potential interactions with these medications: Aspirin and other salicylates Other diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid, hydrochlorothiazide) Synergistic effects with other antihypertensives (e.g. doxazosin) Sucralfate Potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs: Analgesics: increased risk of kidney damage (nephrotoxicity) with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; antagonism of diuretic effect with NSAIDs Antiarrhythmics: a risk of cardiac toxicity exists with antiarrhythmics if hypokalemia occurs; the effects of lidocaine and mexiletine are antagonized. Antibacterials: increased risk of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides, polymyxins and vancomycin; avoid concomitant use with lymecycline Antidepressants: increased risk of hypokalemia with reboxetine; enhanced hypotensive effect with MAOIs; increased risk of postural hypotension with tricyclic antidepressants Antiepileptics: increased risk of hyponatremia with carbamazepine Antifungals: increased risk of hypokalemia with amphotericin Antihypertensives: enhanced hypotensive effect; increased risk of first dose hypotensive effect with alpha-blockers; increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias with sotalol if hypokalemia occurs Antipsychotics: increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias with amisulpride, sertindole, or pimozide (avoid with pimozide) if hypokalemia occurs; enhanced hypotensive effect with phenothiazines Atomoxetine: hypokalemia increases risk of ventricular arrhythmias Cardiac glycosides: increased toxicity if hypokalemia occurs Cyclosporine: variable reports of increased nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity and hepatotoxicity Lithium: risk of toxicity. == Mechanism of action == Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting the luminal Na–K–Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the Na-K-2Cl transporter, thus causing more sodium, chloride, and potassium to be excreted in the urine. The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by the development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors. Furosemide has been reported to reversibly antagonize GABA-evoked currents of α6β2γ2 receptors at μM concentrations, but not α1β2γ2 receptors. During development, the α6β2γ2 receptor increases in expression in cerebellar granule neurons, corresponding to increased sensitivity to furosemide. == Pharmacokinetics == Molecular weight (daltons) 330.7 % Bioavailability 47 – 70% Bioavailability with end-stage renal disease 43 – 46% % Protein binding 91 – 99 Volume of distribution (L/kg) 0.07 – 0.2 Volume of distribution may be higher in patients with cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome Excretion % Excreted in urine (% of total dose) 60 – 90 % Excreted unchanged in urine (% of total dose) 53.1 – 58.8 % Excreted in feces (% of total dose) 7 – 9 % Excreted in bile (% of total dose) 6 – 9 Approximately 10% is metabolized by the liver in healthy individuals, but this percentage may be greater in individuals with severe kidney failure Renal clearance (mL/min/kg) 2.0 Elimination half-life (hrs) 2 Prolonged in congestive heart failure (mean 3.4 hrs) Prolonged in severe kidney failure (4 – 6 hrs) and anephric patients (1.5 – 9 hrs) Time to peak concentration (hrs) Intravenous administration 0.3 Oral solution 0.83 Oral tablet 1.45 The pharmacokinetics of furosemide are not significantly altered by food. No direct relationship has been found between furosemide concentration in the plasma and furosemide efficacy. Efficacy depends upon the concentration of furosemide in urine. == Names == Furosemide is the INN and BAN. The previous BAN was frusemide. Brand names under which furosemide is marketed include Aisemide, Apo-Furosemide, Beronald, Desdemin, Discoid, Diural, Diurapid, Dryptal, Durafurid, Edemid, Errolon, Eutensin, Farsiretic, Flusapex, Frudix, Frusemide, Frusetic, Frusid, Fulsix, Fuluvamide, Furantril, Furesis, Furix, Furo-Puren, Furon, Furosedon, Fusid.frusone, Hydro-rapid, Impugan, Katlex, Lasilix, Lasix, Lodix, Lowpston, Macasirool, Mirfat, Nicorol, Odemase, Oedemex, Profemin, Rosemide, Rusyde, Salix, Seguril, Teva-Furosemide, Trofurit, Uremide, and Urex. == Veterinary uses == The diuretic effects are put to use most commonly in horses to prevent bleeding during a race. In the United States of America, under the racing rules of most states, horses that bleed from the nostrils (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) three times are permanently barred from racing. Sometime in the early 1970s, furosemide's ability to prevent, or at least greatly reduce, the incidence of bleeding by horses during races was discovered accidentally. Clinical trials followed, and by the decade's end, racing commissions in some states in the USA began legalizing its use on race horses. In 1995, New York became the last state in the United States to approve such use, after years of refusing to consider doing so. Some states allow its use for all racehorses; some allow it only for confirmed ""bleeders"". Its use for this purpose is still prohibited in many other countries. Furosemide is also used in horses for pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure (in combination with other drugs), and allergic reactions. Although it increases circulation to the kidneys, it does not help kidney function and is not recommended for kidney disease. It is also used to treat congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and/or ascites) in cats and dogs. === Horses === Furosemide is injected either intramuscularly or intravenously, usually 0.5-1.0 mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, it can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including loss of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a metabolic alkalosis due to hypochloremia and hypokalemia. The drug should, therefore, not be used in horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma. Furosemide should be used with caution when combined with corticosteroids (as this increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases the risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthetics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete aspirin, so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug. Furosemide may increase the risk of digoxin toxicity due to hypokalemia. It is recommended that furosemide not be used during pregnancy or in a lactating mare, as it is passed through the placenta and milk in studies with other species. It should not be used in horses with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (Equine Cushing's Disease). Furosemide is detectable in urine 36–72 hours following injection. Its use is restricted by most equestrian organizations. US major racetracks ban the use of furosemide on race days. == References == == Further reading == Aventis Pharma (1998).

Healthy subjects received inhaled velsecorat (non-radiolabeled; 720  Velsecorat (AZD7594) is a non-steroidal, selective, glucocorticoid receptor modulator (SGRM), being developed for the treatment of asthma. This article reports the initial, first-in-human, single and repeat dose-escalating study in healthy male volunteers. The study comprised two parts, a single ascending dose part (n=47) and a multiple ascending dose part (n=26). Inhaled velsecorat was administered by nebulization as one single dose in the first part of the study and as a single dose with subsequent multiple daily doses (day 5-16) for 12 days once daily in the second part of the study. At each dose level, participants were randomized to velsecorat (n=6) or placebo (n=2/3). The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of velsecorat were evaluated. Inhaled velsecorat was safe and well tolerated up to and including the highest dose tested (1872 µg). Plasma exposure suggested dose proportional PK. The terminal half-life following repeated dosing was 25-31 hours and steady state conditions for velsecorat in plasma were generally reached within 4 doses. The accumulation ratio was low (≤2), and data did not indicate any time-dependent PK. There were dose-related effects on 24-hour plasma cortisol, plasma cortisol after ACTH stimulation and osteocalcin, systemic PD markers of glucocorticoid activity. There were no effects on other biomarkers tested (DHEA-S and 4βOH-cholesterol). The early clinical evaluation of inhaled velsecorat suggests that this novel SGRM is well tolerated in the dose range investigated.

Symptoms of carboxyatractyloside poisoning may include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, palpitations, sweating and trouble breathing. In severe cases, convulsions, liver failure and loss of consciousness may develop, which can lead to death. Carboxyatractyloside can be found in Xanthium species plants, including Xanthium strumarium.

It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including: === Cardiovascular === Hypertension Angina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina) Myocardial infarction Tachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy Portal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure Prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites Anxiety Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy While once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes. Propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study. === Psychiatric === Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias Aggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries Treating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia ==== PTSD and phobias ==== Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia. It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia. Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a ""memory damper"", including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are ""based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose"". === Other uses === Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient Migraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) Infantile hemangioma Glaucoma Thyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy. == Contraindications == Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with: Reversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Slow heart rate (bradycardia) (<60 beats/minute) Sick sinus syndrome Atrioventricular block (second- or third-degree) Shock Severe low blood pressure == Adverse effects == Propranolol should be used with caution in people with: Diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked Peripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated Phaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy Myasthenia gravis, which may be worsened Other drugs with bradycardic effects === Pregnancy and lactation === Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate. Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy ""generally compatible with breastfeeding."" == Overdose == In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. == Interactions == Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with: Verapamil Epinephrine (adrenaline) β2-adrenergic receptor agonists Salbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others Clonidine Ergot alkaloids Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Cimetidine Lidocaine Phenobarbital Rifampicin Fluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity. In addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses. Both enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects. === Mechanism of action === Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to β1 or β2 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β1 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β2 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Propranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L. == History == Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension. == Society and culture == In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals. === Brand names === Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. ""Inderal"" is a quasi-anagram of ""Alderlin"", the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma. == References == == Further reading == Stapleton MP (1997).

It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including: === Cardiovascular === Hypertension Angina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina) Myocardial infarction Tachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy Portal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure Prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites Anxiety Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy While once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes. Propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study. === Psychiatric === Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias Aggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries Treating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia ==== PTSD and phobias ==== Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia. It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia. Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a ""memory damper"", including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are ""based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose"". === Other uses === Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient Migraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) Infantile hemangioma Glaucoma Thyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy. == Contraindications == Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with: Reversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Slow heart rate (bradycardia) (<60 beats/minute) Sick sinus syndrome Atrioventricular block (second- or third-degree) Shock Severe low blood pressure == Adverse effects == Propranolol should be used with caution in people with: Diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked Peripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated Phaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy Myasthenia gravis, which may be worsened Other drugs with bradycardic effects === Pregnancy and lactation === Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate. Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy ""generally compatible with breastfeeding."" == Overdose == In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. == Interactions == Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with: Verapamil Epinephrine (adrenaline) β2-adrenergic receptor agonists Salbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others Clonidine Ergot alkaloids Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Cimetidine Lidocaine Phenobarbital Rifampicin Fluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity. In addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses. Both enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects. === Mechanism of action === Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to β1 or β2 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β1 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β2 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Propranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L. == History == Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension. == Society and culture == In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals. === Brand names === Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. ""Inderal"" is a quasi-anagram of ""Alderlin"", the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma. == References == == Further reading == Stapleton MP (1997).

1087,"('Cimetidine', 'Tagamet', 'Eureceptor', 'Tametin', 'Ulcedin')",Medical,"Cimetidine, sold under the brand name Tagamet among others, is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It is mainly used in the treatment of heartburn and peptic ulcers. With the development of proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, approved for the same indications, cimetidine is available as an over-the-counter formulation to prevent heartburn or acid indigestion, along with the other H2-receptor antagonists. Cimetidine was developed in 1971 and came into commercial use in 1977. Cimetidine was approved in the United Kingdom in 1976, and was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in 1979. == Medical uses == Cimetidine is indicated for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. Cimetidine is also used to relieve or prevent heartburn. == Side effects == Reported side effects of cimetidine include diarrhea, rashes, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, and muscle pain, all of which are usually mild and transient. It has been reported that mental confusion may occur in the elderly. Because of its hormonal effects, cimetidine rarely may cause sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction and gynecomastia (0.1–0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with cimetidine treatment. Cimetidine is also commonly associated with transient raised aminotransferase activity; hepatotoxicity is rare. == Overdose == Cimetidine appears to be very safe in overdose, producing no symptoms even with massive overdoses (e.g., 20 g). == Interactions == Due to its non-selective inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, cimetidine has numerous drug interactions. Examples of specific interactions include, but are not limited to, the following: Cimetidine affects the metabolism of methadone, sometimes resulting in higher blood levels and a higher incidence of side effects, and may interact with the antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine. Cimetidine can also interact with a number of psychoactive medications, including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, causing increased blood levels of these drugs and the potential of subsequent toxicity. Following administration of cimetidine, the elimination half-life and area-under-curve of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were roughly doubled. Cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of tubular creatinine secretion. Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of creatine breakdown. Accumulation of creatinine is associated with uremia, but the symptoms of creatinine accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups. Like several other medications (e.g., erythromycin), cimetidine interferes with the body's metabolization of sildenafil, causing its strength and duration to increase and making its side effects more likely and prominent. Clinically significant drug interactions with the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline, the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide, the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine, and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam have all been demonstrated with cimetidine, and interactions with other substrates of these enzymes are likely as well. Cimetidine has been shown clinically to reduce the clearance of mirtazapine, imipramine, timolol, nebivolol, sparteine, loratadine, nortriptyline, gabapentin, and desipramine in humans. Cimetidine inhibits the renal excretion of metformin and procainamide, resulting in increased circulating levels of these drugs. Interactions of potential clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines. Cimetidine may decrease the effects of CYP2D6 substrates that are prodrugs, such as codeine, tramadol, and tamoxifen. Cimetidine reduces the absorption of ketoconazole and itraconazole (which require a low pH). Cimetidine has a theoretical but unproven benefit in paracetamol toxicity. This is because N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a metabolite of paracetamol (acetaminophen) that is responsible for its hepatotoxicity, is formed from it by the cytochrome P450 system (specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). Cimetidine is used in cancer metastasis research as a blocker of E-selectin. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Histamine H2 receptor antagonism ==== The mechanism of action of cimetidine as an antacid is as a histamine H2 receptor antagonist. It has been found to bind to the H2 receptor with a Kd of 42 nM. ==== Cytochrome P450 inhibition ==== Cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. The drug appears to primarily inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, of which it is described as a moderate inhibitor. This is notable since these three CYP isoenzymes are involved in CYP-mediated drug biotransformations; however, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 are also involved in the oxidative metabolism of many commonly used drugs. As a result, cimetidine has the potential for a large number of pharmacokinetic interactions. Cimetidine is reported to be a competitive and reversible inhibitor of several CYP enzymes, although mechanism-based (suicide) irreversible inhibition has also been identified for cimetidine's inhibition of CYP2D6. It reversibly inhibits CYP enzymes by binding directly with the complexed heme-iron of the active site via one of its imidazole ring nitrogen atoms, thereby blocking the oxidation of other drugs. ==== Antiandrogenic and estrogenic effects ==== Cimetidine has been found to possess weak antiandrogenic activity at high doses. It directly and competitively antagonizes the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, the affinity of cimetidine for the AR is very weak; in one study, it showed only 0.00084% of the affinity of the anabolic steroid metribolone (100%) for the human AR (Ki = 140 μM and 1.18 nM, respectively). In any case, at sufficiently high doses, cimetidine has demonstrated weak but significant antiandrogenic effects in animals, including antiandrogenic effects in the rat ventral prostate and mouse kidney, reductions in the weights of the male accessory glands like the prostate gland and seminal vesicles in rats, and elevated gonadotropin levels in male rats (due to reduced negative feedback on the HPG axis by androgens). In addition to AR antagonism, cimetidine has been found to inhibit the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which are involved in the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased estrogen levels. The medication has also been reported to reduce testosterone biosynthesis and increase prolactin levels in individual case reports, effects which might be secondary to increased estrogen levels. At typical therapeutic levels, cimetidine has either no effect on or causes small increases in circulating testosterone concentrations in men. Any increases in testosterone levels with cimetidine have been attributed to the loss of negative feedback on the HPG axis that results due to AR antagonism. At typical clinical dosages, such as those used to treat peptic ulcer disease, the incidence of gynecomastia (breast development) with cimetidine is very low at less than 1%. In one survey of over 9,000 patients taking cimetidine, gynecomastia was the most frequent endocrine-related complaint but was reported in only 0.2% of patients. At high doses however, such as those used to treat Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, there may be a higher incidence of gynecomastia with cimetidine. In one small study, a 20% incidence of gynecomastia was observed in 25 male patients with duodenal ulcers who were treated with 1,600 mg/day cimetidine. The symptoms appeared after 4 months of treatment and regressed within a month following discontinuation of cimetidine. In another small study, cimetidine was reported to have induced breast changes and erectile dysfunction in 60% of 22 men treated with it. These adverse effects completely resolved in all cases when the men were switched from cimetidine to ranitidine. A study of the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database, which contains over 80,000 men, found that the relative risk of gynecomastia in cimetidine users was 7.2 relative to non-users. People taking a dosage of cimetidine of greater than or equal to 1,000 mg showed more than 40 times the risk of gynecomastia than non-users. The risk was highest during the period of time of 7 to 12 months after starting cimetidine. The gynecomastia associated with cimetidine is thought to be due to blockade of ARs in the breasts, which results in estrogen action unopposed by androgens in this tissue, although increased levels of estrogens due to inhibition of estrogen metabolism is another possible mechanism. Cimetidine has also been associated with oligospermia (decreased sperm count) and sexual dysfunction (e.g., decreased libido, erectile dysfunction) in men in some research, which are hormonally related similarly. In accordance with the very weak nature of its AR antagonistic activity, cimetidine has shown minimal effectiveness in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and hyperandrogenism (high androgen levels) in women. As such, its use for such indications is not recommended. === Pharmacokinetics === Cimetidine is rapidly absorbed regardless of route of administration. The oral bioavailability of cimetidine is 60 to 70%. The onset of action of cimetidine when taken orally is 30 minutes, and peak levels occur within 1 to 3 hours. Cimetidine is widely distributed throughout all tissues. It is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and can produce effects in the central nervous system (e.g., headaches, dizziness, somnolence). The volume of distribution of cimetidine is 0.8 L/kg in adults and 1.2 to 2.1 L/kg in children. Its plasma protein binding is 13 to 25% and is said to be without pharmacological significance. Cimetidine undergoes relatively little metabolism, with 56 to 85% excreted unchanged. It is metabolized in the liver into cimetidine sulfoxide, hydroxycimetidine, and guanyl urea cimetidine. The major metabolite of cimetidine is the sulfoxide, which accounts for about 30% of excreted material. Cimetidine is rapidly eliminated, with an elimination half-life of 123 minutes, or about 2 hours. It has been said to have a duration of action of 4 to 8 hours. The medication is mainly eliminated in urine. == History == Cimetidine, approved by the FDA for inhibition of gastric acid secretion, has been advocated for a number of dermatological diseases. Cimetidine was the prototypical histamine H2 receptor antagonist from which the later members of the class were developed. Cimetidine was the culmination of a project at Smith, Kline and French (SK&F) Laboratories in Welwyn Garden City (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) by James W. Black, C. Robin Ganellin, and others to develop a histamine receptor antagonist to suppress stomach acid secretion. This was one of the first drugs discovered using a rational drug design approach. Sir James W. Black shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of propranolol and also is credited for the discovery of cimetidine. At the time (1964), histamine was known to stimulate the secretion of stomach acid, but also that traditional antihistamines had no effect on acid production. In the process, the SK&F scientists also proved the existence of histamine H2 receptors. The SK&F team used a rational drug-design structure starting from the structure of histamine — the only design lead, since nothing was known of the then hypothetical H2 receptor. Hundreds of modified compounds were synthesized in an effort to develop a model of the receptor. The first breakthrough was Nα-guanylhistamine, a partial H2 receptor antagonist. From this lead, the receptor model was further refined and eventually led to the development of burimamide, the first H2 receptor antagonist. Burimamide, a specific competitive antagonist at the H2 receptor, 100 times more potent than Nα-guanylhistamine, proved the existence of the H2 receptor. Burimamide was still insufficiently potent for oral administration, and further modification of the structure, based on modifying the pKa of the compound, led to the development of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; it was associated, however, with unacceptable nephrotoxicity and agranulocytosis. The toxicity was proposed to arise from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the ultimate discovery of cimetidine. The compound was synthesized in 1972 and evaluated for toxicology by 1973. It passed all trials. Cimetidine was first marketed in the United Kingdom in 1976, and in the U.S. in August 1977; therefore, it took 12 years from initiation of the H2 receptor antagonist program to commercialization. By 1979, Tagamet was being sold in more than 100 countries and became the top-selling prescription product in the U.S., Canada, and several other countries. In November 1997, the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry in the U.K. jointly recognized the work as a milestone in drug discovery by designating it an International Historic Chemical Landmark during a ceremony at SmithKline Beecham's New Frontiers Science Park research facilities in Harlow, England. The commercial name ""Tagamet"" was decided upon by fusing the two words ""antagonist"" and ""cimetidine"". Subsequent to the introduction onto the U.S. drug market, two other H2 receptor antagonists were approved, ranitidine (Zantac, Glaxo Labs) and famotidine (Pepcid, Yamanouchi, Ltd.) Cimetidine became the first drug ever to reach more than $1 billion a year in sales, thus making it the first blockbuster drug. Tagamet has been largely replaced by proton pump inhibitors for treating peptic ulcers, but is available as an over-the-counter medicine for heartburn in many countries. == Research == Some evidence suggests cimetidine could be effective in the treatment of common warts, but more rigorous double-blind clinical trials found it to be no more effective than a placebo. Tentative evidence supports a beneficial role as add-on therapy in colorectal cancer. Cimetidine inhibits ALA synthase activity and hence may have some therapeutic value in preventing and treating acute porphyria attacks. There is some evidence supporting the use of Cimetidine in the treatment of PFAPA. == Veterinary use == In dogs, cimetidine is used as an antiemetic when treating chronic gastritis. == References == == External links == Media related to Cimetidine at Wikimedia Commons",Ulcedin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1625203937292099), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02346741408109665)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/ulcedine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='ULCEDINE - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/ulcedine?utm_source=openai')])"

It has been developed as a Phase 3 candidate for the treatment of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH). This review summarizes the molecular traits of Trabodenoson in intraocular pressure (IOP) regulations and provides a scientific interpretation of the Phase 2 clinical study results. This article sheds light on the root causes of the two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial failures in patients with POAG or OH; it further highlights the discovery of MMP-2 in trabecular meshwork (TM) rejuvenation, which has strategic importance in long-term glaucoma patient care. Trabodenoson is a BID glaucoma eye drop with a possible QD dose as maintenance. Its Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials failed at the wrong dose and dosing regimen because of the misinterpretation of the complex IOP results from the Phase 2 monotherapy and combination studies. The future development should focus on the TM benefits whilst unleashing its potential of neural protection through nanoparticle eye drops, medical coating, and sustained release drug delivery.

Dry-eye disease was induced in adult male C57BL/6 mice using a combination of desiccating environment and transdermal administration of scopolamine. Mice were treated concurrently and twice daily with either vehicle, 6% trabodenoson, or 0.05% cyclosporine (Restasis). Efficacy (P < 0.05 versus vehicle) was determined by clinical assessment of dry-eye symptoms using corneal fluorescein staining and tear volumes and histopathologically by quantifying lacrimal gland pathology and conjunctival goblet cells. Twice-daily topical (ocular) administration of trabodenoson increased tear levels and reduced corneal fluorescein staining (P < 0.05) as compared with vehicle-treated eyes in a mouse model of dry-eye disease. Furthermore, significant infiltration of immune cells in the lacrimal gland and reduced number of mucin-producing conjunctival goblet cells were noted in both untreated and vehicle-treated eyes. Comparatively, trabodenoson treatment significantly reduced lacrimal gland infiltration and increased the number of goblet cells (P < 0.05 for both versus vehicle). These trabodenoson-related effects on lacrimal gland pathology and goblet cells were similar to or better than the effects observed with cyclosporine treatment. Topical ocular delivery of trabodenoson significantly improves the clinical and histopathological signs associated with dry-eye disease in mice. This improvement appears to be related to anti-inflammatory effects from targeting adenosine signaling and represents a novel therapeutic approach to develop for the management of dry-eye disease.",Trabodenoson,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00040904260822571814), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024882566649466753)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.inotekcorp.com/content/ino-8875.asp,https://www.medthority.com/news/2017/01/trabodenoson--ino-8875--fails-phase-iii-trial-for-primary-open-angle-glaucoma---inotek-pharmaceuticals-corporation-/,https://www.genengnews.com/news/inotek-glaucoma-candidate-fails-phase-iii-trial/ ', [])"

It is a class II antiarrhythmic. Esmolol decreases the force and rate of heart contractions by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, which are found in the heart and other organs of the body. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987. == Medical uses == To terminate supraventricular tachycardia, Episodic atrial fibrillation or flutter, Arrhythmia during anaesthesia, To reduce HR and BP during and after cardiac surgery, and In early treatment of myocardial infarction. Esmolol is also used in blunting the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Esmolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is selective for the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Esmolol is considered a soft drug, one that is rapidly metabolized to an inactive form. Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow. Esmolol's short duration of action is based on the ester-methyl side chain which allows for quick hydrolysis. Esmolol's structure is reflected in its name, es-molol as in ester-methyl. Plasma cholinesterases and red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase do not have any action. This metabolism results in the formation of a free acid and methanol. The amount of methanol produced is similar to endogenous methanol production. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about two minutes and an elimination half-life of about nine minutes. Esmolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. == References ==",Brevibloc,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7523612768854946e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000920825288631022)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmolol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='Esmolol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmolol?utm_source=openai')])"

Specifically it is used for open angle glaucoma when other agents are not sufficient. It may also be used to increase the size of the eyelashes. It is used as an eye drop and effects generally occur within four hours. Common side effects include red eyes, dry eyes, change in color of the eyes, blurry vision, and cataracts. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally not recommended. It is a prostaglandin analog and works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes. Bimatoprost was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 195th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Uses == === Medical === Bimatoprost is used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension in adults, either alone or in combination with a beta blocker, typically timolol. Studies have shown bimatoprost to be more effective than timolol in reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) and at least as effective as the prostaglandin analogs latanoprost and travoprost in reducing IOP. === Cosmetic === Bimatoprost may be used to treat small or underdeveloped eyelashes. The medical term for this is treatment of hypotrichosis; however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval is for purely cosmetic purposes (see Prostaglandin F receptor#Clinical significance). == Side effects == Side effects are similar to other prostaglandin analogs applied to the eye. The most common one is conjunctival hyperemia, which occurs in more than 10% of patients. Other effects include blurred vision, eye and eyelid redness, eye burning or other discomfort, and permanent darkening of the iris to brown. Occasional adverse effects (in less than 1% of patients) are headache and nausea. Some side effects are specific to the cosmetic formulation, which is applied to the skin at the base of the eyelash rather than instilled into the eye. These include infection if the one-time applicators are reused, and darkening of the eyelid or of the area beneath the eye. Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid. == Interactions == No interaction studies with this substance have been performed. Interactions with systemic (for example, oral) drugs are considered unlikely because bimatoprost does not reach relevant concentrations in the bloodstream. Bimatoprost does not negatively interact with timolol eye drops. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Bimatoprost is a structural analog of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). Like other PGF2α analogs such as travoprost, latanoprost and tafluprost, it increases the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eye and lowers intraocular pressure. However, in contrast to these it does not act on the prostaglandin F receptor, nor on any other known prostaglandin receptor. It is thought that bimatoprost mimics the human body's own prostamides (which are chemically similar), a class of substances related to prostaglandins, but with an unknown mechanism of action. No prostamide receptor has been identified as of 2015; the search is ongoing. As of 2019 it was thought that bimatoprost worked via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways. === Pharmacokinetics === Bimatoprost is well absorbed through the cornea. It starts lowering intraocular pressure after four hours, lasting for at least 24 hours. A low percentage enters the bloodstream. In the blood plasma, peak concentrations are reached after 10 minutes, then drop below the detection limit of 25 pg/ml after 1.5 hours. The substance does not accumulate in the body. Plasma protein binding is 88%. Bimatoprost is metabolized by oxidation, N-deethylation and glucuronidation, forming a variety of metabolites. Biological half-life was measured to be 45 minutes after intravenous infusion. 67% are eliminated via the kidney, and 25% via the feces. == Research == Bimatoprost has been used to treat eyebrow hypotrichosis in a 60-year old female. The 0.03% solution was applied topically once a day for eight months and showed ""increased hair growth and thickening of the eyebrow hairs"". Bimatoprost and its endogenous analog prostaglandin F2α ethanolamide present the side-effect of being anti-adipogenic, and have been shown to be inducers of preadipocyte proliferation. These findings suggest bimatoprost is a possible therapy for obesity. == References == == Further reading == ""Prostaglandin Analogues for Ophthalmic Use: A Review of the Comparative Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness"".

Between March 2012 and September 2019, 356 patients with pathologically confirmed solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm who underwent preoperative gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI were retrospectively enrolled. MVI was graded as M0, M1, or M2 according to the number and distribution of invaded vessels. Radiomics features were extracted from DWI, arterial, portal venous, and hepatobiliary phase images in regions of the entire tumor, peritumoral area ≤ 10 mm, and randomly selected liver tissue. Multivariate analysis identified the independent predictors for MVI and RFS, with nomogram visualized the ultimately predictive models. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein, total bilirubin and radiomics values, peritumoral enhancement, and incomplete or absent capsule enhancement were independent risk factors for MVI. The AUCs of MVI nomogram reached 0.920 (95% CI: 0.861-0.979) using random forest and 0.879 (95% CI: 0.820-0.938) using logistic regression analysis in validation cohort (n = 106). With the 5-year RFS rate of 68.4%, the median RFS of MVI-positive (M2 and M1) and MVI-negative (M0) patients were 30.5 (11.9 and 40.9) and > 96.9 months (p < 0.001), respectively. Age, histologic MVI, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase independently predicted recurrence, yielding AUC of 0.654 (95% CI: 0.538-0.769, n = 99) in RFS validation cohort. Instead of histologic MVI, the preoperatively predicted MVI by MVI nomogram using random forest achieved comparable accuracy in MVI stratification and RFS prediction. Preoperative radiomics-based nomogram using random forest is a potential biomarker of MVI and RFS prediction for solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm. • The radiomics score was the predominant independent predictor of MVI which was the primary independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence. • The radiomics-based nomogram using either random forest or logistic regression analysis has obtained the best preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC patients so far. • As an excellent substitute for the invasive histologic MVI, the preoperatively predicted MVI by MVI nomogram using random forest (MVI-RF) achieved comparable accuracy in MVI stratification and outcome, reinforcing the radiologic understanding of HCC angioinvasion and progression. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl dimeglumine (gadoxetate) is a recently developed hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast medium. Gadoxetate demonstrates unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, because its uptake in hepatocytes occurs via the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter expressed at the sinusoidal membrane, and its biliary excretion via the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) at the canalicular membrane. Based on these characteristics, gadoxetate-enhanced MRI can provide functional information on hepatobiliary diseases, including liver function estimation, biliary drainage evaluation and characterization of hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition, understanding its mode of action can provide an opportunity to use gadoxetate for cellular and molecular imaging. Radiologists and imaging scientists should be familiar with the basic mechanism of gadoxetate and OATP/MRP transporters.",Gadoxetate (disodium),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.5597102396423e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0026423560921102762), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03809328377246857)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gadoxetate-intravenous-route/description/drg-20072068?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=145, start_index=9, title='Gadoxetate (intravenous route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gadoxetate-intravenous-route/description/drg-20072068?utm_source=openai')])"
