1191,"('Benzocaine', 'Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate', 'Ethyl aminobenzoate', 'Ethyl p-aminobenzoate', 'Anaesthesin')",Medical,"Benzocaine, sold under the brand name Orajel amongst others, is a local anesthetic, belonging to the amino ester drug class, commonly used as a topical painkiller or in cough drops. It is the active ingredient in many over-the-counter anesthetic ointments such as products for oral ulcers. It is combined with antipyrine to form A/B ear drops. In the US, products containing benzocaine for oral application are contraindicated in children younger than two years old. In the European Union, the contraindication applies to children under 12 years of age. It was first synthesised in 1890 in Germany and approved for medical use in 1902. == Medical uses == Benzocaine is indicated to treat a variety of pain-related conditions. It may be used for: Local anesthesia of oral and pharyngeal mucous membranes (sore throat, cold sores, mouth ulcers, toothache, sore gums, denture irritation) Otic pain (earache) Surgical or procedural local anesthesia Relief of skin pain caused by sunburn, ingrown toenails, hemorrhoids, Examples of combination medications of benzocaine include: Antipyrine-benzocaine otic consists of antipyrine and benzocaine, and is used to relieve ear pain and remove earwax. Cepacol consists of menthol and benzocaine, and is used to treat sore throat. A solution of benzocaine and menthol is marketed for the treatment of bee stings, mosquito bites, jellyfish stings, and other insect bites === Other uses === Benzocaine is used as a key ingredient in numerous pharmaceuticals: Some glycerol-based ear medications for use in removing excess wax as well as relieving ear conditions such as otitis media and swimmer's ear. Some previous diet products such as Ayds. Some condoms designed to prevent premature ejaculation. Benzocaine largely inhibits sensitivity on the penis, and can allow for an erection to be maintained longer (in a continuous act) by delaying ejaculation. Conversely, an erection will also fade faster if stimulus is interrupted. Benzocaine mucoadhesive patches have been used in reducing orthodontic pain. In Poland it is included, together with menthol and zinc oxide, in the liquid powder (not to be confused with the liquid face powder) used mainly after mosquito bites. Today's ready-made Pudroderm was once used there as pharmaceutical compound. === Available forms === Benzocaine can come in a variety of preparations including: Oral preparations: Lozenges (ex. Cepacol, Mycinettes) Throat Spray (ex. Ultra Chloraseptic) Topical preparations: Aerosol (ex. Topex) Gel (ex. Orajel, Kank-A) Paste (ex. Orabase) Cream (ex. Lanacane - active ingredient 3% Benzocaine) Otic preparations: Solution (ex. Allergen) == Side effects == Benzocaine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when applied topically as recommended. However, there have been reports of serious, life-threatening adverse effects (e.g., seizures, coma, irregular heart beat, respiratory depression) with over-application of topical products or when applying topical products that contain high concentrations of benzocaine to the skin. Overapplication of oral anesthetics such as benzocaine can increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration by relaxing the gag-reflex and allowing regurgitated stomach contents or oral secretions to enter the airway. Applying an oral anesthetic and consuming beverages before going to bed can be particularly hazardous. The topical use of higher concentration (10–20%) benzocaine products applied to the mouth or mucous membranes has been found to be a cause of methemoglobinemia, a disorder in which the amount of oxygen carried by the blood is greatly reduced. This side effect is most common in children under two years of age. As a result, the FDA has stated that benzocaine products should not be used in children under two years of age, unless directed by and supervised by a healthcare professional. In European countries, the contraindication applies to children under 12 years of age. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia usually occur within minutes to hours of applying benzocaine, and can occur upon the first-time use or after additional use. Benzocaine may cause allergic reactions. These include: Contact dermatitis (redness and itchiness) Anaphylaxis (rare) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pain is caused by the stimulation of free nerve endings. When the nerve endings are stimulated, sodium enters the neuron, causing depolarization of the nerve and subsequent initiation of an action potential. The action potential is propagated down the nerve toward the central nervous system, which interprets this as pain. Benzocaine acts to inhibit the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) on the neuron membrane, stopping the propagation of the action potential. == Chemistry == Benzocaine is the ethyl ester of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). It can be prepared from PABA and ethanol by Fischer esterification or via the reduction of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate. Benzocaine is sparingly soluble in water; it is more soluble in dilute acids and very soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ethyl ether. The melting point of benzocaine is 88–92 °C, and the boiling point is about 310 °C. The density of benzocaine is 1.17 g/cm3. Benzocaine is commonly found, particularly in Britain, as an additive in street cocaine and also as a bulking agent in ""legal highs"". Benzocaine gives a numbing effect similar to cocaine and as a bulking and binding agent it can not be detected once mixed. It is the most popular cutting agent worldwide. Treatment of benzocaine with hydrazine leads to aminostimil, a compound related to isoniazid. === Synthesis === Benzocaine can be prepared by esterification using 4-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol. It can also be prepared by reduction of ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate to the amine. In industrial practice, the reducing agent is usually iron and water in the presence of a little acid. == History == Benzocaine was first synthesized in 1890 by the German chemist Eduard Ritsert (1859–1946), in the town of Eberbach and introduced to the market in 1902 under the name ""Anästhesin"". == Veterinary medicine == Bath solutions of benzocaine and its derivatives are commonly used to anesthetize amphibians for surgery. Benzocaine-based anesthetics are potent and highly effective for both anesthesia and euthanasia in amphibians. == References ==",Anaesthesin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.04860304668545723), (' PERSONAL', -0.008835439570248127), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.06204364821314812), (' INDUSTR', -0.00807134248316288), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.00045622908510267735), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.25198185443878174), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6799564957618713), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07895573228597641)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacycode.com](https://pharmacycode.com/Anaesthesin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Anaesthesin - Anesthetics, Antipruritics, Local Anesthetics, ATC:C05AD03, ATC:D04AB04, ATC:N01BA05, ATC:R02AD01', type='url_citation', url='https://pharmacycode.com/Anaesthesin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors were eligible for this open label, cohort study of sapanisertib (TAK-228) and serabelisib (TAK-117) with weekly paclitaxel. A traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design with 5 dosing cohorts was used. Patient reported outcomes were also evaluated. 19 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled (10 ovarian, 3 breast, and 6 endometrial cancers). All patients received comprehensive genomic profiling prior to enrollment. RP2D is sapanisertib 3 or 4 mg, serabelisib 200 mg on days 2-4, 9-11, 16-18 and 23-25 with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days. All patients in Cohort 5 required dose reductions and one patient experienced a DLT. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased WBCs (20%), nonfebrile neutropenia (12%), anemia (9%), elevated liver enzymes (4%), and hyperglycemia (11%). 3 patients had a CR, 4 had a PR, and 4 patients had SD > six months. ORR was 47% and CBR was 73% in 15 evaluable patients. Including all 19 enrolled patients, the PFS was 11 months and OS is still ongoing at 17 months. The combination of sapanisertib, serabelisib, and paclitaxel was safe and generally well tolerated. Preliminary efficacy was remarkable in an area of unmet need, especially for patient with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway aberrations. Positive effects and sustained clinical benefit were even seen in patients that were refractory to platinum and had failed taxane, everolimus, or temsirolimus. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03154294. Liver cancer is a malignant tumor commonly seen in infants and young children. Serabelisib is a novel and effective phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3Kα) inhibitor, currently in trials for solid malignancy treatment, such as bladder cancer. However, it is unclear whether serabelisib affects liver cancer. To explore the effects of serabelisib on the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis of HepG2 and HuH-6 cells, and elucidate the relevant molecular mechanisms. The HepG2 cells were treated with 2 μM, 4 μM or 8 μM serabelisib, while the 0-μM group was used as a control. A plate clone formation assay was utilized to measure colony formation ability in each group, a 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay examined cell proliferation, a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay assessed cell viability, flow cytometry measured the cell cycle and apoptosis, JC-1 staining determined mitochondrial membrane potential, and transmission electron microscopy evaluated cell morphology. In addition, gene and protein expression levels of apoptosis markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), Gasdermin D (GSDMD), and the PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway were measured. After serabelisib intervention, HepG2 and HuH-6 cells formed fewer colonies, proliferated more slowly, and had reduced viability. The number of HepG2 and HuH-6 cells in the G2 and S phases decreased, apoptosis and the number of apoptotic bodies increased, and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased. Serabelisib treatment also reduced the migration and invasion capacity of the cells. Furthermore, genes and proteins of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway were downregulated, while those that promote apoptosis and pyroptosis or inhibit EMT were upregulated. Serabelisib inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting EMT and promoting apoptosis and pyroptosis in HepG2 and HuH-6 cells. TAK-117 (also known as MLN1117 or serabelisib) is an orally available inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha being developed for treatment of solid tumors. This clinical study in healthy subjects assessed the relative bioavailability of a TAK-117 tablet compared with a capsule formulation (part 1) and the effect of food (part 2) and intragastric pH modulation (part 3) on TAK-117 pharmacokinetics. In part 1, subjects received single doses of 900 mg TAK-117 under fasting conditions as capsules and tablets on 2 different occasions in random order. In part 2, subjects received a single dose of 600 mg TAK-117 under fed (high-fat meal) or fasted conditions on 2 different occasions in random order. In part 3, subjects received a single dose of 900 mg TAK-117 alone and in combination with lansoprazole in a fixed sequence. Blood samples were collected up to 72 hours after each TAK-117 dose. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for the area under the TAK-117 plasma concentration-time curves were 1.53 (0.93-2.51) for tablets versus capsules, 1.50 (1.00-2.25) for fed versus fasted, and 0.02 (0.01-0.04) for TAK-117 plus lansoprazole compared with TAK-117 alone. The most common adverse event was nausea, the incidence of which was reduced when TAK-117 was administered with food despite the increased systemic exposure. The incidence of all adverse events was reduced when TAK-117 was administered with lansoprazole, which was consistent with the substantial reduction in bioavailability. Intersubject variability of TAK-117 was high.

1194,"('Yohimbine (hydrochloride)', 'Yohimbine', 'Yohimbin', 'Quebrachin', 'Quebrachine')",Medical,"Yohimbine (), also known as quebrachine, is an indole alkaloid derived from the bark of the African tree Pausinystalia johimbe (yohimbe); also from the bark of the unrelated South American tree Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco. Yohimbine is an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and has been used in a variety of research projects. It is a veterinary drug used to reverse sedation in dogs and deer. While yohimbine behaves as an aphrodisiac in some mammals, it does not do so in humans. It has been prescribed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, although its reported clinical benefits were modest and it has largely been superseded by the PDE5 inhibitor class of drugs. Substances that have purported to be extracts from the yohimbe tree have been marketed as dietary supplements for various purposes, but they contain highly variable amounts of yohimbine, if any; no published scientific evidence supports their efficacy. == Uses == === Dietary supplementation === === Erectile dysfunction === Yohimbine has been used to treat female sexual dysfunction, but there are few reported clinical trials and these do not show it to be better than placebo. Yohimbine has been largely superseded by the PDE5 inhibitor drugs such as sildenafil (Viagra). Prescriptions for it are now rare, and most US pharmaceutical manufacturers have discontinued production of prescription capsules and tablets.: 357–8 == Yohimbe == === Confusion === Yohimbine should not be confused with yohimbe but often is. Yohimbe is the common English name for the tree species P. johimbe (also called Corynanthe johimbe) and, by extension, the name of a medicinal preparation made from the bark of that tree, sold as an aphrodisiac. In contrast, yohimbine is a pure alkaloid that can be isolated from yohimbe bark. Yohimbine is just one of at least 55 indole alkaloids that have been isolated from the bark; and, while it has been described as the most active of these, it constitutes only 15% of the total alkaloid content. Others include rauwolscine, corynanthine and ajmalicine; the bark also contains non-alkaloids about which virtually nothing is known. Yohimbe, thus a complex mixture, has been studied far less thoroughly than yohimbine, the pure compound. Pharmaceutical grade yohimbine is usually presented as the hydrochloride,: 3, 14, 34 which is more soluble. === Effect on sexual function === Yohimbe is used in folk medicine as an aphrodisiac. In 1900, it attracted scientific interest in Germany, where an initial report claimed that yohimbe exerted a strong aphrodisiacal effect in animals and humans. Attention soon shifted from the plant to its active constituents, particularly yohimbine. === Yohimbe and dietary supplements === In the US, ""yohimbe"" preparations are sold as a dietary supplements for enhancing libido, for weight loss and as aids for bodybuilding; but ""There is virtually no published research on yohimbe which supports these or any other claims"".: 861 Often, these products explicitly claim to contain yohimbine. One study found that samples of brands sold in American brick-and-mortar stores contained highly variable amounts of yohimbine, and sometimes none at all.: 368 Labelling claims were often misleading.: 368 Similar results have been reported by other laboratories for products sold in the US, in other countries and on the internet. One study found that many brands of ""yohimbe"" might not derive from the P. johimbe tree in the first place. According to yet another source, the yohimbe sold in markets in West Africa, where the tree grows, is frequently adulterated with other species of the genus Pausinystalia; these contain little yohimbine. The amounts of alkaloid found even in genuine P. johimbe bark vary considerably, depending on the source of the bark (roots, stem, branches, height, etc.). Some brands sold over-the-counter were found to contain more yohimbine per serving than a standard pharmaceutical dose;: 368 yet, in the US, pharmaceuticals are subject to the strict regulatory regime pertaining to medicines. It is illegal to introduce or deliver ""drugs"" into interstate commerce without the permission of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has asserted that some yohimbine-containing products are ""drugs"" because they are so promoted as to show ""they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease"": 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B). However the legal position is not entirely straightforward, and as of 1 February 2019 there does not appear to be any record of a successful prosecution. Because of the lack of reliable scientific data on yohimbe, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Food Additives determined that it was not possible to conclude on its safety or to establish a health-based guidance value.: 38 They wrote: Overall the missing information include[s] quantitative data on the composition and specifications of yohimbe bark and its preparations used in food and food supplements covering other alkaloids besides yohimbine, data on the bioavailability of active ingredients from the yohimbe bark extract and data on the toxicity of well specified individual preparations of yohimbe bark and the major yohimbe bark alkaloids, especially regarding subchronic toxicity, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. == Side effects == Side effects of yohimbine in humans at high doses include hypertension (high blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), agitation, hypervigilance, anxiety, and urinary frequency. == Pharmacology == Yohimbine has high affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor, moderate affinity for the α1 receptor, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2B, and dopamine D2 receptors, and weak affinity for the 5-HT1E, 5-HT2A, 5-HT5A, 5-HT7, and dopamine D3 receptors. It behaves as an antagonist at α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and dopamine D2, and as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A. Yohimbine interacts with serotonin and dopamine receptors in high concentrations. == Extracts and chemistry == Yohimbe (Pausinystalia johimbe) is a tree that grows in western and central Africa; yohimbine was named as originally extracted from the bark of yohimbe in 1896 by Adolph Spiegel (but see § Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco below). In 1943 the correct constitution of yohimbine was proposed by Witkop. Fifteen years later, a team led by Eugene van Tamelen used a 23-step synthesis to become the first persons to achieve the synthesis of yohimbine. == Research == Yohimbine has been studied as a way to improve the effects of exposure therapy in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yohimbine selectively blocks the pre-synaptic α2-adrenergic receptors. Blockade of post-synaptic α2-adrenergic receptors causes only minor corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation, due to the fact that the majority of adrenoceptors in the corpus cavernosum are of the α1 type. Blockade of pre-synaptic α2-adrenergic receptors facilitates the release of several neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system—thus in the corpus cavernosum—such as nitric oxide and norepinephrine. Whereas nitric oxide released in the corpus cavernosum is the major vasodilator contributing to the erectile process, norepinephrine is the major vasoconstrictor through stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors on the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. Under physiologic conditions, however, nitric oxide attenuates norepinephrine vasoconstriction. It has also been studied as a potential treatment for erectile dysfunction, but there is insufficient evidence to rate its effectiveness. It is illegal in the United States to market an over-the-counter product containing yohimbine as a treatment for erectile dysfunction without getting FDA approval to do so. Nevertheless, the quantity of yohimbine in dietary supplements, often advertised as promoting sexual function, has been found to overlap with prescription doses of yohimbine. Research on yohimbine, while confirming that it behaves as an aphrodisiac in animals, including rats, dogs and golden hamsters, has failed to do so in humans. According to researcher Joseph M. Betz in a 2010 encyclopedia article: experiments show that the alkaloid increases sexual motivation even in sexually exhausted rats due to its action on the central α2-adrenoreceptors found in the locus coeruleus in the brain. Blockage of these brain adrenoreceptors appears to reverse a central negative feedback mechanism that regulates penile erection and maintains detumescence... [But] the compound does not increase sexual desire and thoughts in human clinical trials. The combined evidence from human and animal clinical studies indicates that yohimbine is far less potent in stimulating sexual behavior in humans than in rats. One possible explanation for this finding is the existence of powerful and multiple inhibitory controls on sexual behavior in humans that are not present in rats i.e. the cognitive aspects of sex are far more important in humans than the basic instinctive functions observed in animals. == Veterinary use == Yohimbine is a drug used in veterinary medicine to reverse the effects of xylazine in dogs and deer. == Botanical sources == === Pausinystalia johimbe === The traditional source of yohimbine is the bark of the African tree P. johimbe. It has other uses, but the tree is sought out primarily for its bark; in practice, harvesting the bark kills the tree. Tree density is relatively low (average ≈ 4 harvestable trees/hectare). The high demand for medicines based on the bark has led to the tree's over-exploitation. The bark is traded in local markets and, because it is scarce, it is often adulterated with that of other species which contain little yohimbine. The species is becoming endangered. Around the year 2000, Cameroon was shipping P. johimbe to Europe at the rate of about 100 tonnes annually. Most bark is collected illegally by local people who are paid 150 CFA francs per kilo (about US$0.10 per pound) for delivery of pre-dried bark at the roadside. In practice they confuse and mix it with P. macroceras (""false yohimbe""), a species that contains little yohimbine. === Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco === Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco is an unrelated tree whose common name is quebracho blanco. It is found in large areas of central South America, particularly the Gran Chaco, where it is often the dominant species in the canopy. It is one of the most widely distributed Argentine arboreal species. Traditionally it was logged for fuel, timber and railway sleepers. While in recent times cattle ranching and soya cultivation have led to considerable habitat loss, and while there is still illegal logging, no shortage of the bark is reported. The tree has not been described as endangered: a few members of the genus Aspidosperma are on the IUCN Red List. but the quebracho blanco species is not one of them. In its bark an alkaloid is found which was given the name Quebrachine. In 1914, two scientific papers claimed quebrachine was chemically identical to yohimbine. This was disputed, and the matter long remained in doubt. However, in 1972, Effler and Effler using modern analytical techniques, including mass spectrometry, UV absorption, IR absorption, and NMR, established that quebrachine and yohimbine are one and the same thing. They wrote: While it was almost unthinkable in 1914 ... that the same alkaloid was formed in [completely] different plants, recent studies have shown that this is certainly the case for indole alkaloids. A range of secondary reference works give 'quebrachine' as a synonym for yohimbine. Strictly speaking, wrote George Barger, yohimbine should have been given the scientific name quebrachine, seeing that it was first isolated from the quebracho tree and first named in the scientific literature. However the later work on P. yohimbe was better known, so the newer name stuck. === Other plants === Yohimbine has also been isolated from other plant genera in the family Apocynaceae including Lochnera (Catharanthus), Rauvolfia, Amsonia, Vallesia and Vinca; from the family Loganiaceae (genera Gelsemium and Strychnos); and from the family Euphorbiaceae (genus Alchornea). == Doping == There was a case in the World Anti-Doping Agency practice in 2007, when an athlete, who reportedly consumed Yohimbine prior to a given athletic event, was later tested positive for 19-norandrosterone, which is a prohibited substance. However, WADA did not yet list Yohimbine (which can come into a body via an energy drink, also in a form of pre-workout supplement or fat burner) as a prohibited substance, nor did it confirm that its use can increase the endogenous level of anabolic steroids, in particular of 19-norandrostenedione and testosterone. == See also == Ajmalicine Alstonine Corynanthine Deserpidine Mitragynine Rauwolscine Spegatrine Reserpine Rescinnamine == References == == External links == ""Yohimbine"".

Timolol is a non-selective beta blocker. Timolol was patented in 1968, and came into medical use in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Timolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 155th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === By mouth === In its by mouth or oral form, it is used: to treat high blood pressure to prevent heart attacks to prevent migraine headaches The combination of timolol and the alpha-1 blocker prazosin has sedative effects. === Eye drops === In its eye drop form it is used to treat open-angle and, occasionally, secondary glaucoma. The mechanism of action of timolol is probably the reduction of the formation of aqueous humor in the ciliary body in the eye. It was the first beta blocker approved for topical use in treatment of glaucoma in the United States (1978). When used by itself, it depresses intraocular pressure (IOP) 18–34% below baseline within first few treatments. However, there are short-term escape and long-term drift effects in some people. That is, tolerance develops. It may reduce the extent of the daytime IOP curve up to 50%. The IOP is higher during sleep. Efficacy of timolol in lowering IOP during the sleep period may be limited. It is a 5–10× more potent beta blocker than propranolol. Timolol is light-sensitive; it is usually preserved with 0.01% benzalkonium chloride (BAC), but also comes BAC-free. It can also be used in combination with pilocarpine, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors or prostaglandin analogs. A Cochrane review compared the effect of timolol versus brimonidine in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adults but found insufficient evidence to come to conclusions. === On the skin === In its gel form it is used on the skin to treat infantile hemangiomas. == Contraindications == The medication should not be taken by individuals with: An allergy to timolol or any other beta-blockers Asthma or severe chronic obstructive bronchitis A slow heart rate (bradycardia), or a heart block Heart failure == Side effects == The most serious possible side effects include cardiac arrhythmias and severe bronchospasms. Timolol can also lead to fainting, congestive heart failure, depression, confusion, worsening of Raynaud's syndrome and impotence. Side effects when given in the eye include: burning sensation, eye redness, superficial punctate keratopathy, corneal numbness. == Formulations == It is available in tablet and liquid formulations. For ophthalmic use, timolol is also available combined: with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: timolol and brinzolamide timolol and dorzolamide with α2 agonists: timolol and brimonidine with prostaglandin analogs: timolol and latanoprost timolol and travoprost == Brand names == Timolol is sold under many brand names worldwide. Timolol eye drops are sold under the brand names Timoptic and Istalol among others. == References == == External links == ""Timolol Ophthalmic"".

Normal HTT has a CAG trinucleotide repeat at its N-terminal within the range of 36. However, once the CAG repeats exceed 37, the mutant gene (mHTT) will encode mutant HTT protein (mHTT), which results in neurodegeneration in the brain, specifically in the striatum and other brain regions. Since the mutation was discovered, there have been many research efforts to understand the mechanism and develop therapeutic strategies to treat HD. HTT is a large protein with many post-translational modification sites (PTMs) and can be modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, etc. Some modifications reduced mHTT toxicity both in cell and animal models of HD. We aimed to find the known kinase inhibitors that can modulate the toxicity of mHTT. We performed an in vitro kinase assay using HTT peptides, which bear different PTM sites identified by us previously. A total of 368 kinases were screened. Among those kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) affected the serine phosphorylation on the peptides that contain S1181 and S1201 of HTT. We explored the effect of CDK1 and CDK5 on the phosphorylation of these PTMs of HTT and found that CDK5 modified these two serine sites, while CDK5 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of S1181 and S1201. Modifying these two serine sites altered the neuronal toxicity induced by mHTT. Roscovitine, a CDK inhibitor, reduced the p-S1181 and p-S1201 and had a protective effect against mHTT toxicity. We further investigated the feasibility of the use of roscovitine in HD mice. We confirmed that roscovitine penetrated the mouse brain by IP injection and inhibited CDK5 activity in the brains of HD mice. It is promising to move this study to in vivo for pre-clinical HD treatment.",S1181,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014166207052767277)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.12720593810081482), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00889434851706028)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32330040/,https://www.spectrumchemical.com/hydroxyurea-usp-h1181,https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/bp1181,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28103025/,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/XV36F0JG6L,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.1c00300,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1181 ', [])"

Present study investigated the preparation and characterization of physicochemical properties and permeation of nanovesicles of ceramide-2 containing OA and palmitic acid (PA) respectively and a commercial gel. The vesicles were made using ceramide 2, cholesterol (Chol), cholesteryl sulfate (CS) and OA or PA, respectively, using film hydration method. The vesicles were characterized for physicochemical properties, ex vivo permeation using human skin and pharmacokinetic parameters and anti-inflammatory activity in rats. The vesicles showed size at 102-125 nm while PDI was 0.11-0.13 and negative zeta potential. OV-3 showed highest entrapment efficiency. The drug fluxes were 92.02 and 8.920 μg/cm(2)/h, respectively, for OV-3 and PV-1. The Cmax were 7.91 and 4.01 μg/ml at 4 and 6 h for OV-3 (2.5 mg) and PV-1 (10 mg), respectively. OV-3 and PV-1 showed 98.8% and 77.36% edema inhibition, respectively, at 3 h. Both formulations showed similar physical parameters and different permeation since OA get incorporated in vesicles and increases its permeability and ceramide makes sure that vesicles can rapidly traverse the stratum corneum. OV-3 containing 3% OA showed optimum physical parameters and good permeation with maximum anti-inflammatory activity. Ceramide plays critical roles in cell proliferation, senescence and apoptosis, and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, etc. To clarify if ceramide plays some roles in retinal diseases, we established in vivo and in vitro retinal injury models with ceramide 2 (C2) treatment. In addition, Erythropoietin (EPO), which showed protective effects on retinal cells and blood-retinal barrier (BRB), was also tested for its protection and possible mechanism(s) in these models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups, i.e., normal control, vehicle control, C2 treatment, and C2+EPO treatment. After intravitreal injection, the rats were examined for eye fundus, electroretinogram, histological study, and immunostaining, etc. In vitro, retinal neuronal cell line (R28) and the primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were treated with C2, cell viability assay, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and BRB-related molecules were studied to test the protective effect of EPO. Intravitreal C2-treatment caused significant vision loss in rats, as reflected by reduced b-wave amplitude, increased TUNEL positive cells and GFAP immunostaining in retina. Another major retinal injury observed was BRB breakdown following C2- treatment. Such C2-induced injuries were further confirmed by in vitro study. When HRMECs were treated with C2, the TEER was significantly reduced. The mechanisms for C2 to induce such injuries might be through evidently increased expressions of the related molecules like plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP or PV-1), ecto- 5'-nucleotidase (CD73) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), as observed in C2-treated R28 cells. All these injuries induced by C2 were significantly prevented by EPO both in vivo and in vitro, and its protective mechanisms here might be, in addition to neuroprotective, closely related to its maintenance of BRB integrity, through reducing the expressions of PV-1, CD73 and ICAM-1. C2 could induce severe retinal injury, and such injuries could be effectively prevented by EPO treatment. Sphingolipids are one of the major components of cell membranes and are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms. Ceramide 2-aminoethylphosphonate (CAEP) of marine origin is a unique and abundant sphingophosphonolipid with a C-P bond. Although molluscs such as squids and bivalves, containing CAEP, are consumed globally, the dietary efficacy of CAEP is not understood. We investigated the efficacy of marine sphingophosphonolipids by studying the effect of dietary CAEP on the improvement of the skin barrier function in hairless mice fed a diet that induces severely dry-skin condition. The disrupted skin barrier functions such as an increase in the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), a decrease in the skin hydration index, and epidermal hyperplasia were restored by CEAP dietary supplementation. Correspondingly, dietary CAEP significantly increased the content of covalently bound ω-hydroxyceramide, and the expression of its biosynthesis-related genes in the skin. These effects of dietary CAEP mimic those of dietary plant glucosylceramide. The novel observations from this study show an enhancement in the skin barrier function by dietary CAEP and the effects could be contributed by the upregulation of covalently bound ω-hydroxyceramide synthesis in the skin.",Ceramide 2,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.1357956826686859), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' END', -0.6706737875938416), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -4.036524842376821e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0015045057516545057), (' PERSONAL', -0.3132798373699188), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.10025659948587418), (' FOOD', -1.2113979209971149e-05)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.5896252989768982), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.0005571481888182461), ('ĠPERSON', -0.32201722264289856), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ĠCARE', -4.172316494077677e-06), (',', -0.25195083022117615), ('ĠEND', -0.41576921939849854), ('OG', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47414302825927734)])","('PERSONAL CARE, ENDOGENOUS', [('PERSON', -0.014164221473038197), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0015023599844425917), (' END', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,PERSONAL CARE;https://www.lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMSP02030004,https://whatsinmyjar.com/skincare-ingredients/ceramide-2,https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/product/i-croda-ceramide-2 ', [])"
1198,"('Artemisinin', 'Qinghaosu', 'Artemisinine', 'Huanghuahaosu', 'Artemisine')",Medical,"Artemisinin () and its semisynthetic derivatives are a group of drugs used in the treatment of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum. It was discovered in 1972 by Tu Youyou, who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for P. falciparum malaria as well as malaria due to other species of Plasmodium. Artemisinin is extracted from the plant Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood), a herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine. A precursor compound can be produced using a genetically engineered yeast, which is much more efficient than using the plant. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all sesquiterpene lactones containing an unusual peroxide bridge. This endoperoxide 1,2,4-trioxane ring is responsible for their antimalarial properties. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known. Artemisinin and its derivatives have been used for the treatment of malarial and parasitic worm (helminth) infections. Advantages of such treatments over other anti-parasitics include faster parasite elimination and broader efficacy across the parasite life-cycle; disadvantages include their low bioavailability, poor pharmacokinetic properties, and high cost. Moreover, use of the drug by itself as a monotherapy is explicitly discouraged by the World Health Organization, as there have been signs that malarial parasites are developing resistance to the drug. Combination therapies, featuring artemisinin or its derivatives alongside some other antimalarial drug, constitute the contemporary standard-of-care treatment regimen for malaria. == Medical use == The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin or one of its derivatives ― typically in combination with a longer-lasting partner drug ― as frontline therapy for all cases of malaria. For uncomplicated malaria, the WHO recommends three days of oral treatment with any of five artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs): artemether/lumefantrine, artesunate/amodiaquine (ASAQ), artesunate/mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine, or artesunate/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. In each of these combinations, the artemisinin derivative rapidly kills the parasites, but is itself rapidly cleared from the body. The longer-lived partner drug kills the remaining parasites and provides some lingering protection from reinfection. For severe malaria, the WHO recommends intravenous or intramuscular treatment with the artemisinin derivative artesunate for at least 24 hours. Artesunate treatment is continued until the treated person is well enough to take oral medication. They are then given a three-day course of an ACT, for uncomplicated malaria. Where artesunate is not available, the WHO recommends intramuscular injection of the less potent artemisinin derivative artemether. For children less than six years old, if injected artesunate is not available the WHO recommends rectal administration of artesunate, followed by referral to a facility with the resources for further care. Artemisinins are not used for malaria prevention because of the extremely short activity (half-life) of the drug. To be effective, it would have to be administered multiple times each day. === Contraindications === The WHO recommends avoiding ACT for women in their first trimester of pregnancy due to a lack of research on artemisinin's safety in early pregnancy. Instead the WHO recommends a seven-day course of clindamycin and quinine. For pregnant women in their second or third trimesters, the WHO recommends a normal treatment course with an ACT. For some other groups, certain ACTs are avoided due to side effects of the partner drug: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is avoided during the first few weeks of life as it interferes with the action of bilirubin and can worsen neonatal jaundice. In HIV-positive people, the combination of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, zidovudine-containing antiretroviral treatments, and ASAQ is associated with neutropenia. The combination of the HIV drug efavirenz and ASAQ is associated with liver toxicity. == Adverse effects == Artemisinins are generally well tolerated at the doses used to treat malaria. The side effects from the artemisinin class of medications are similar to the symptoms of malaria: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and dizziness. Mild blood abnormalities have also been noted. A rare but serious adverse effect is allergic reaction. One case of significant liver inflammation has been reported in association with prolonged use of a relatively high-dose of artemisinin for an unclear reason (the patient did not have malaria). The drugs used in combination therapies can contribute to the adverse effects experienced by those undergoing treatment. Adverse effects in patients with acute P. falciparum malaria treated with artemisinin derivatives tend to be higher. == Chemistry == An unusual component of the artemisinin molecules is an endoperoxide 1,2,4-trioxane ring. This is the main antimalarial centre of the molecule. Modifications at carbon 10 (C10) position give rise to a variety of derivatives which are more powerful than the original compound. Because the physical properties of artemisinin itself, such as poor bioavailability, limit its effectiveness, semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin have been developed. Derivatives of dihydroartemisinin were made since 1976. Artesunate, arteether and artemether were first synthesized in 1986. Many derivatives have been produced of which artelinic acid, artemotil, artemisone, SM735, SM905, SM933, SM934, and SM1044 are among the most powerful compounds. There are also simplified analogs in preclinical development. Over 120 other derivatives have been prepared, but clinical testing has not been possible due to lack of financial support. Artemisinin is poorly soluble in oils and water. Therefore, it is typically administered via the digestive tract, either by oral or rectal administration. Artesunate however can be administered via the intravenous and intramuscular, as well as the oral and rectal routes. A synthetic compound with a similar trioxolane structure (a ring containing three oxygen atoms) named RBx-11160 showed promise in in vitro testing. Phase II testing in patients with malaria was not as successful as hoped, but the manufacturer decided to start Phase III testing anyway. == Mechanism of action == As of 2018, the exact mechanism of action of artemisinins has not been fully elucidated. Artemisinin itself is a prodrug of the biologically active dihydroartemisinin. This metabolite undergoes cleavage of its endoperoxide ring inside the erythrocytes. As the drug molecules come in contact with the haem (associated with the hemoglobin of the red blood cells), the iron(II) oxide breaks the endoperoxide ring. This process produces free radicals that in turn damage susceptible proteins, resulting in the death of the parasite. In 2016 artemisinin was shown to bind to a large number of targets suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner. Artemisinin's endoperoxide moiety is however less sensitive to free iron(II) oxide, and therefore more active in the intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. In contrast, clinical practice shows that unlike other antimalarials, artemisinin is active during all life cycle stages of the parasite. == Resistance == Clinical evidence for artemisinin drug resistance in southeast Asia was first reported in 2008, and was subsequently confirmed by a detailed study from western Cambodia. Resistance in neighbouring Thailand was reported in 2012, and in northern Cambodia, Vietnam and eastern Myanmar in 2014. Emerging resistance was reported in southern Laos, central Myanmar and northeastern Cambodia in 2014. The parasite's kelch gene on chromosome 13 appears to be a reliable molecular marker for clinical resistance in Southeast Asia. In 2011, the WHO stated that resistance to the most effective antimalarial drug, artemisinin, could unravel national Indian malaria control programs, which have achieved significant progress in the last decade. WHO advocates the rational use of antimalarial drugs and acknowledges the crucial role of community health workers in reducing malaria in the region. Artemisinins can be used alone, but this leads to a high rate of return of parasites and other drugs are required to clear the body of all parasites and prevent a recurrence. The WHO is pressuring manufacturers to stop making the uncompounded drug available to the medical community at large, aware of the catastrophe that would result if the malaria parasite developed resistance to artemisinins. Two main mechanisms of resistance drive Plasmodium resistance to antimalarial drugs. The first one is an efflux of the drug away from its action site due to mutations in different transporter genes (like pfcrt in chloroquine resistance) or an increased number of the gene copies (like pfmdr1 copy number in mefloquine resistance). The second is a change in the parasite target due to mutations in corresponding genes (like, at the cytosol level, dhfr and dhps in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance or, at the mitochondrion level, cytochrome b in atovaquone resistance). Resistance of P. falciparum to the new artemisinin compounds involves a novel mechanism corresponding to a quiescence phenomenon. As of 2020 future resistance research will make use of transgenic mice to discover relevant molecular markers. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis in Artemisia annua === The biosynthesis of artemisinin is believed to involve the mevalonate pathway (MVA) and the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FDP). It is not clear whether the non-mevalonate pathway can also contribute 5-carbon precursors (IPP or DMAPP), as occurs in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. The routes from artemisinic alcohol to artemisinin remain controversial, and they differ mainly in when the reduction step takes place. Both routes suggested dihydroartemisinic acid as the final precursor to artemisinin. Dihydroartemisinic acid then undergoes photo-oxidation to produce dihydroartemisinic acid hydroperoxide. Ring expansion by the cleavage of hydroperoxide and a second oxygen-mediated hydroperoxidation finish the biosynthesis of artemisinin. === Chemical synthesis === The total synthesis of artemisinin has been performed from available organic starting materials, using basic organic reagents, many times. The first two total syntheses were a stereoselective synthesis by Schmid and Hofheinz at Hoffmann-La Roche in Basel starting from (−)-isopulegol (13 steps, ~5% overall yield), and a concurrent synthesis by Zhou and coworkers at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry from (R)-(+)-citronellal (20 steps, ~0.3% overall yield). Key steps of the Schmid–Hofheinz approach included an initial Ohrloff stereoselective hydroboration/oxidation to establish the ""off-ring"" methyl stereocenter on the propene side chain; two sequential lithium-reagent mediated alkylations that introduced all needed carbon atoms and that were, together highly diastereoselective; and further reduction, oxidation, and desilylation steps performed on this mono-carbocyclic intermediate, including a final singlet oxygen-utilizing photooxygenation and ene reaction, which, after acidic workup closed the three remaining oxacyclic rings of the desired product, artemisinin, in a single step. (In essence, the final oxidative ring-closing operation in these syntheses accomplishes the closing three biosynthetic steps shown above.) A wide variety of further routes continue to be explored, from early days until today, including total synthesis routes from (R)-(+)-pulegone, isomenthene, and even 2-cyclohexen-1-one, as well as routes better described as partial or semisyntheses from a more plentiful biosynthetic precursor, artemisinic acid—in the latter case, including some very short and very high yielding biomimetic synthesis examples (of Roth and Acton, and Haynes et al., 3 steps, 30% yield), which again feature the singlet oxygen ene chemistry. === Synthesis in engineered organisms === The partnership to develop semisynthetic artemisinin was led by PATH's Drug Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health), with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The project began in 2004, and initial project partners included the University of California, Berkeley (which provided the technology on which the project was based – a process that genetically altered yeast to produce artemisinic acid) and Amyris (a biotechnology firm in California, which refined the process to enable large-scale production and developed scalable processes for transfer to an industrial partner). In 2006, a team from UC Berkeley reported they had engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast to produce a small amount of the precursor artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid can then be transported out, purified and chemically converted into artemisinin that they claim will cost roughly US$0.25 per dose. In this effort of synthetic biology, a modified mevalonate pathway was used, and the yeast cells were engineered to express the enzyme amorphadiene synthase and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1), both from Artemisia annua. A three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene gives the resulting artemisinic acid. The UC Berkeley method was augmented using technology from various other organizations. The final successful technology is based on inventions licensed from UC Berkeley and the National Research Council (NRC) Plant Biotechnology Institute of Canada. Commercial production of semisynthetic artemisinin is now underway at Sanofi's site in Garessio, Italy. This second source of artemisinin is poised to enable a more stable flow of key antimalarial treatments to those who need them most. The production goal is set at 35 tonnes for 2013. It is expected to increase to 50–60 tons per year in 2014, supplying approximately one-third of the global annual need for artemisinin. In 2013, WHO's Prequalification of Medicines Programme announced the acceptability of semisynthetic artemisinin for use in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients submitted to WHO for prequalification, or that have already been qualified by WHO. Sanofi's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) produced from semisynthetic artemisinin (artesunate) was also prequalified by WHO on May 8, 2013, making it the first semisynthetic artemisinin derivative prequalified. In 2010, a team from Wageningen University and Research reported they had engineered a close relative of tobacco, Nicotiana benthamiana, that can also produce the precursor, artemisinic acid. == Production and price == China and Vietnam provide 70% and East Africa 20% of the raw plant material. Seedlings are grown in nurseries and then transplanted into fields. It takes about 8 months for them to reach full size. The plants are harvested, the leaves are dried and sent to facilities where the artemisinin is extracted using a solvent, typically hexane. Alternative extraction methods have been proposed. The market price for artemisinin has fluctuated widely, between US$120 and $1,200 per kilogram from 2005 to 2008. The Chinese company Artepharm created a combination artemisinin and piperaquine drug marketed as Artequick. In addition to clinical research performed in China and southeast Asia, Artequick was used in large-scale malaria eradication efforts in the Comoros. Those efforts, conducted in 2007, 2012, and 2013–14, produced a 95–97% reduction in the number of malaria cases in the Comoros. After negotiation with the WHO, Novartis and Sanofi provide ACT drugs at cost on a nonprofit basis; however, these drugs are still more expensive than other malaria treatments. Artesunate injection for severe malaria treatment is made by the Guilin Pharmaceutical factory in China where production has received WHO prequalification. High-yield varieties of Artemisia are being produced by the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products at the University of York using molecular breeding techniques. Using seed supplied by Action for Natural Medicine (ANAMED), the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has developed a hybrid, dubbed A3, which can grow to a height of 3 meters and produce 20 times more artemisinin than wild varieties. In northwestern Mozambique, ICRAF is working together with a medical organization, Médecins Sans Frontières, ANAMED and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to train farmers on how to grow the shrub from cuttings, and to harvest and dry the leaves to make artemisia tea. However, the WHO does not recommend the use of A. annua plant materials, including tea, for the prevention and treatment of malaria. In 2013, Sanofi announced the launch of a production facility in Garessio, Italy, to manufacture the antiplasmodial drug on a large scale. The partnership to create a new pharmaceutical manufacturing process was led by PATH's Drug Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health), with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid, initially designed by Jay Keasling at UC Berkeley and optimized by Amyris. The reaction is followed by a photochemical process creating singlet oxygen to obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55–60 tonnes in 2014. The price per kilogram will be US$350–400, roughly the same as the botanical source. Despite concerns that this equivalent source would lead to the demise of companies, which produce this substance conventionally through extraction of A. annua biomass, an increased supply of this drug will likely produce lower prices and therefore increase the availability for ACT treatment. In 2014, Sanofi announced the release of the first batch of semisynthetic artemisinin. 1.7 million doses of Sanofi's ASAQ, a fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy will be shipped to half a dozen African countries over the next few months. A 2016 systematic review of four studies from East Africa concluded that subsidizing ACT in the private retail sector in combination with training and marketing has led to the increased availability of ACT in stores, increased use of ACT for febrile children under five years of age, and decrease in the use of older, less effective antimalarials among children under five years of age. The underlying studies did not determine if the children had malaria nor determine if there were health benefits. == Metabolism == After ingestion or injection, artemisinin and its derivatives (arteether, artemether, and artesunate) are all rapidly converted in the bloodstream to dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which has 5–10 times greater antimalarial potency than artemisinin. DHA is eventually converted in the liver into metabolites such as deoxyartemisinin, deoxydihydroartemisinin, and 9,10-dihydrodeoxyartemisinin. These reactions are catalyzed by the enzymes CYP2A6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, which belong to the cytochrome P450 group present in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These metabolites lack antimalarial properties due to the loss of the endoperoxide group (deoxyartemisinin however has anti-inflammatory and antiulcer properties.) All these metabolites undergo glucuronidation, after which they are excreted through the urine or feces. Glucuronosyltransferases, in particular UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, are responsible for this process. DHA is also removed through bile as minor glucuronides. Due to their rapid metabolism, artemisinin and its derivatives are relatively safe drugs with a relatively high therapeutic index. == History == === Etymology === Artemisinin is an antimalarial lactone derived from qinghao (青蒿, Artemisia annua or sweet wormwood). In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his Compendium of Materia Medica. The genus name is derived from the Greek goddess Artemis and, more specifically, may have been named after Queen Artemisia II of Caria, a botanist and medical researcher in the fourth century BC. === Discovery === Artemisia annua – a common herb found in many parts of the world. In 1967, a plant screening research program, under a secret military program code-named ""Project 523"", was set up by the People's Liberation Army to find an adequate treatment for malaria; the program and early clinical work were ordered by Mao Zedong at the request of North Vietnamese leaders to provide assistance for their malaria-ridden army. In the course of this research in 1972, Tu Youyou discovered artemisinin in the leaves of Artemisia annua. Named qinghaosu (Chinese: 青蒿素; lit. 'compound of green-blue wormwood'), it was one of many candidates tested as possible treatments for malaria by Chinese scientists, from a list of nearly 2,000 traditional Chinese medicines. Tu Youyou also discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant. Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments written in 340 CE by Ge Hong saying that this herb should be steeped in cold water. This book contained the useful reference to the herb: ""A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all."" Tu's team subsequently isolated an extract. Results were published in the Chinese Medical Journal in 1979. The extracted substance, once subject to purification, proved to be a useful starting point to obtain purified artemisinin. A 2012 review reported that artemisinin-based therapies were the most effective drugs for treatment of malaria at that time; it was also reported to clear malaria parasites from patients' bodies faster than other drugs. In addition to artemisinin, Project 523 developed a number of products that can be used in combination with artemisinin, including lumefantrine, piperaquine, and pyronaridine. In the late 1990s, Novartis filed a new Chinese patent for a combination treatment with artemether/lumefantrine, providing the first artemisinin-based combination therapies (Coartem) at reduced prices to the WHO. In 2006, after artemisinin had become the treatment of choice for malaria, the WHO called for an immediate halt to single-drug artemisinin preparations in favor of combinations of artemisinin with another malaria drug, to reduce the risk of parasites developing resistance. In 2011, Tu Youyou was awarded the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for her role in the discovery and development of artemisinin. On October 5, 2015, she was awarded half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering artemisinin, ""a drug that has significantly reduced the mortality rates for patients suffering from malaria"". The other half of the prize was awarded jointly to William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura for discovering avermectin, ""the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases"". == Research == === New artemisinin-based combination therapies === The WHO notes four additional ACTs that are in preliminary clinical trials or regionally used for which there is no evidence to recommend widespread use: artesunate/pyronaridine, arterolane-piperaquine, artemisinin-piperaquine base, and artemisinin/naphthoquine. === Helminthiasis === A serendipitous discovery was made in China in the early 1980s while searching for novel anthelmintics for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent antihelmintics. Artemisinins were later found to possess a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of trematodes, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. === Cancer === Artemisinin and its derivatives are under laboratory research for their potential anti-cancer effects. As of 2018, only preliminary clinical research had been conducted using artemisininin derivatives in various cancers, with no approved clinical applications. === Autoimmune disease === Artemisinin derivatives may suppress immune reactions, such as inflammation. One derivative, SM934, was approved in 2015 by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a clinical trial as a drug for systemic lupus erythematosus. === Polycystic ovary syndrome === Artemisinin may be potentially useful for treating symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). == See also == Artemisia (genus) Artemisin Santonin Pharmacognosy == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Artemisinin at Wikimedia Commons ""Defeating the Curse"".

Nabumetone was developed by Beecham and first received regulatory approval in 1991. Nabumetone is a non-acidic NSAID prodrug that is rapidly metabolized in the liver to the active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl acetic acid. Nabumetone's active metabolite inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme and preferentially blocks COX-2 activity (which is indirectly responsible for the production of inflammation and pain during arthritis). The active metabolite of nabumetone is felt to be the compound primarily responsible for therapeutic effect. Comparatively, the parent drug is a poor inhibitor of COX-2 byproducts, particularly prostaglandins. It may be less nephrotoxic than indomethacin. There are two known polymorphs of the compound. Nabumetone has little effect on renal prostaglandin secretion and less of an association with heart failure than other traditional drugs of the class. Effects of nabumetone on blood pressure control in hypertensive patients on ACE inhibitors are also good, equivalent to paracetamol. In 2022, it was the 239th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Nabumetone is indicated for relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. == Side effects == Side effects include bloody or black, tarry stools; change in color, frequency, or amount of urine; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; pale stools; numbness; weakness; flu-like symptoms; leg pain; vision problems; speech problems; problems walking; weight gain; stomach pain; cold sweat; skin rash; blisters; headache; swelling; bleeding; bruising; vomiting blood; jaundice; diarrhea; constipation; dizziness; indigestion; gas; nausea; and ringing in the ears. In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescription drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid.

It was discovered in 1972. The IV administration of dexrazoxane is in acidic condition with HCl adjusting the pH. == Medical uses == Dexrazoxane has been used to protect the heart against the cardiotoxic side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines, such as daunorubicin or doxorubicin or other chemotherapeutic agents. However, in July 2011 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a statement restricting use only in adult patients with cancer who have received > 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin or > 540 mg/m2 epirubicin and general approval for use for cardioprotection. That showed a possibly higher rate of secondary malignancies and acute myelogenous leukemia in pediatric patients treated for different cancers with both dexrazoxane and other chemotherapeutic agents that are associated with secondary malignancies. On 19 July 2017, based on evaluation of the currently available data the European Commission issued an EU-wide legally binding decision to implement the recommendations of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on dexrazoxane and lifted its 2011-contraindication for primary prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity with dexrazoxane in children and adolescents where high doses (≥ 300 mg/m3) of anthracyclines are anticipated. Dexrazoxane was designated by the US FDA as an orphan drug for ""prevention of cardiomyopathy for children and adults 0 through 16 years of age treated with anthracyclines"". This decision allows virtually all children to receive dexrazoxane starting with the first dose of anthracycline at the discretion of the treating provider. The label change by the agency announcing dexrazoxane as an approved cardio-oncology protectant has been followed by a review by the agency. Currently, the only FDA and EMA approved cardioprotective treatment for anthracycline cardioprotection is dexrazoxane, which provides effective primary cardioprotection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity without reducing anthracycline activity and without enhancing secondary malignancies. The United States Food and Drug Administration has also approved a dexrazoxane for use as a treatment of extravasation resulting from IV anthracycline chemotherapy. Extravasation is an adverse event in which chemotherapies containing anthracylines leak out of the blood vessel and necrotize the surrounding tissue. == Mechanism == As a derivative of EDTA, dexrazoxane chelates iron and thus reduces the number of metal ions complexed with anthracycline and, consequently, decrease the formation of superoxide radicals. The exact chelation mechanism is unknown, but it has been postulated that dexrazoxane can be converted into ring-opened form intracellularly and interfere with iron-mediated free radical generation that is in part thought to be responsible for anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy. It was speculated that dexrazoxane could be used for further investigation to synthesize new antimalarial drugs. == References ==",Cardioxane,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.827859811484814e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009333306807093322)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicines.org.uk](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/15487/smpc?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=9, title='Cardioxane 500 mg powder for solution for infusion - Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) - (emc) | 15487', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/15487/smpc?utm_source=openai')])"

1205,"('Eslicarbazepine', '(s)-10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydro-5h-dibenzo[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide', 'Sliscarbazepine', '(s)-mhd', 'Ec 810-248-9')",Medical,"Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL), sold under the brand names Aptiom and Zebinix among others, is an anticonvulsant medication approved for use in Europe and the United States as monotherapy or as additional therapy for partial-onset seizures epilepsy. Similarly to oxcarbazepine, ESL behaves as a prodrug to (S)-(+)-licarbazepine. As such, their mechanisms of action are identical. == Contraindications == Eslicarbazepine acetate is contraindicated in people with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, a type of heart block, in the Austria-Codex. However heart block is not mentioned as a contraindication by the US FDA. It is contraindicated for people who are hypersensitive to eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are similar to oxcarbazepine. The most common ones (more than 10% of patients) are tiredness and dizziness. Other fairly common side effects (1 to 10%) include impaired coordination, gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, rash (1.1%), and hyponatremia (low sodium blood levels, 1.2%). There may also be an increased risk of suicidal thoughts. == Overdose == Symptoms of overdosing are similar to adverse effects of standard doses: severe hyponatraemia, somnolence, uncoordinated/unsteady gait, hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body), along with visual and gastrointestinal disturbances. No specific antidote is available. Eslicarbazepine and metabolites can be dialyzed. == Interactions == Like oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine can reduce plasma levels of drugs that are metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 (verified in studies for simvastatin and the oral contraceptive levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and increase plasma levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19. Interaction studies have been conducted with a number of common anticonvulsants. Carbamazepine reduces blood plasma concentrations of eslicarbazepine, probably because it induces glucuronidation. This drug combination also increased the risk for diplopia, impaired coordination and dizziness in a clinical study. Phenytoin also reduces eslicarbazepine plasma concentrations, which may be due to increased glucuronidation of eslicarbazepine; and concomitant administration results in an increase in phenytoin serum concentrations, which is probably due to inhibition of CYP2C19. Combinations with lamotrigine, topiramate, valproic acid or levetiracetam showed no significant interactions in studies, although eslicarbazepine has been shown to cause a minor reduction in lamotrigine levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The active component, eslicarbazepine, has the same mechanism of action as oxcarbazepine (which is a prodrug for licarbazepine, the racemate of eslicarbazepine) and most likely the closely related carbamazepine. It stabilises the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, allowing for less sodium to enter neural cells, which leaves them less excitable. According to some sources, it has not been shown conclusively that this is the actual mechanism. === Pharmacokinetics === Eslicarbazepine acetate is absorbed to at least 90% from the gut, independently of food intake. It is quickly metabolised to eslicarbazepine, so that the original substance cannot be detected in the bloodstream. Peak plasma levels of eslicarbazepine are reached after 2–3 (1–4) hours, and plasma protein binding is somewhat less than 40%. Biological half-life is 10 to 20 hours, and steady-state concentrations are reached after four to five days after start of the treatment. Oxcarbazepine, for comparison, is also nearly completely absorbed from the gut, and peak plasma concentrations of licarbazepine are reached after 4.5 hours on average after oxcarbazepine intake. Plasma protein binding and half-life are of course the same. Other metabolites of ESL are the less active (R)-(−)-licarbazepine (5%; the stereoisomer of eslicarbazepine), the pharmacologically active oxcarbazepine (1%), and inactive glucuronides of all of these substances. The drug is excreted mainly via the urine, of which two thirds are in the form of eslicarbazepine and one third in the form of eslicarbazepine glucuronide. The other metabolites only account for a few percent of the excreted drug. === Pharmacogenomics === Persons with certain genetic variations in human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are under increased risk of developing skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), but also severe ones such as Stevens–Johnson and DRESS syndrome, under treatment with carbamazepine and drugs with related chemical structures. This is true for the HLA-A*3101 allele, which occurs in 2 to 5% of Europeans and 10% of Japanese people, and the HLA-B*1502 allele, which is mainly found in people of Asian descent. Theoretically, this may also apply to ESL. == Chemistry == As the name suggests, eslicarbazepine acetate is the acetate ester prodrug of eslicarbazepine. Eslicarbazepine itself is the pharmacologically more active of the two stereoisomers of licarbazepine. More specifically, it is (S)-(+)-licarbazepine. Related drugs and active metabolites for comparison == History == Eslicarbazepine acetate was developed by the Portuguese pharmaceutical company Bial. In early 2009, Bial sold the marketing rights in Europe to the Japanese company Eisai. The drug was approved in the European Union in April 2009 under the trade names Zebinix and Exalief, but was marketed only under the first name. In the US it is marketed by Sunovion (formerly Sepracor) and was approved in November 2013. == Research == Studies for the use of ESL as an anticonvulsant for children are under way as of 2016. Like oxcarbazepine, ESL has potential uses for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 assessment showed no statistical difference to placebo for the latter disorder. == References == == External links == ""Eslicarbazepine acetate"". Drug Information Portal.

1206,"('Cabazitaxel', 'Taxoid xrp6258', 'Jevtana', 'Cabazitaxelum', 'Jevtana (tn)')",Medical,"Cabazitaxel, sold under the brand name Jevtana, is a semi-synthetic derivative of a natural taxoid. It is a microtubule inhibitor, and the fourth taxane to be approved as a cancer therapy. Cabazitaxel was developed by Sanofi-Aventis and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer in June 2010. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Cabazitaxel is indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following docetaxel-based treatment. == Mechanism of action == Taxanes enhance microtubule stabilization and inhibit cellular mitosis and division. Moreover, taxanes prevent androgen receptor (AR) signaling by binding cellular microtubules and the microtubule-associated motor protein dynein, thus averting AR nuclear translocation. == Clinical trials == In people with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), overall survival (OS) is markedly enhanced with cabazitaxel versus mitoxantrone after prior docetaxel treatment. FIRSTANA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308567) assessed whether cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 (C20) or 25 mg/m2 (C25) is superior to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (D75) in terms of OS in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. However, C20 and C25 did not demonstrate superiority for OS versus D75 in people with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. Cabazitaxel and docetaxel demonstrated different toxicity profiles, and C20 showed the overall lowest toxicity. In a phase III trial with 755 men for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, median survival was 15.1 months for participants receiving cabazitaxel versus 12.7 months for participants receiving mitoxantrone. Cabazitaxel was associated with more grade 3–4 neutropenia (81.7%) than mitoxantrone (58%). Common adverse effects with cabazitaxel include neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia) and GIT side effects appeared mainly in diarrhea, whereas, neuropathy was rarely detected. == Pharmacokinetics == Cabazitaxel administration causes a decrease in plasma concentrations showing triphasic kinetics: a mean half life (t1/2) of 2.6 min in the first phase, a mean t1/2 of 1.3 h in the second phase, and a mean t1/2 of 77.3 h in the third phase. === Metabolism === Cabazitaxel is metabolized in the liver by [cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 > CYP2C8], which result in seven plasma metabolites and excreted 20 metabolites. During 14 days after administration, 80% of cabazitaxel is excreted: 76% in the feces and 3.7% as a renal excretion. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT00417079 for ""XRP6258 Plus Prednisone Compared to Mitoxantrone Plus Prednisone in Hormone Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer (TROPIC)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT01308580 for ""Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m² Compared to 25 mg/m² With Prednisone for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (PROSELICA)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02485691 for ""Cabazitaxel Versus the Switch to Alternative AR-targeted Agent (Enzalutamide or Abiraterone) in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients Previously Treated With Docetaxel and Who Rapidly Failed a Prior AR-targeted Agent (CARD)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Jevtana,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.280832192511298e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005589353386312723)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabazitaxel?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Cabazitaxel', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabazitaxel?utm_source=openai')])"
1207,"('Neopterin', 'Erythro-neopterin')","Endogenous, Medical","Neopterin is an organic compound belonging to the pteridine class of heterocyclic compounds. Neopterin belongs to the chemical group known as pteridines. It is synthesised by human macrophages upon stimulation with the cytokine interferon-gamma and is indicative of a pro-inflammatory immune status. Neopterin serves as a marker of cellular immune system activation. In humans neopterin follows a circadian (daily) and circaseptan (weekly) rhythm. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of neopterin occurs in two steps from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The first being catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase, which opens the ribose group. Phosphatases next catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphate ester group. == Neopterin as disease marker == Measurement of neopterin concentrations in body fluids like blood serum, cerebrospinal fluid or urine provides information about activation of cellular immune activation in humans under the control of T helper cells type 1. High neopterin production is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, neopterin concentrations also allow to estimate the extent of oxidative stress elicited by the immune system. Increased neopterin production is found in, but not limited to, the following diseases: Viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2. Bacterial infections by intracellular living bacteria such as Borrelia (Lyme disease), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Helicobacter pylori. parasites such as Plasmodium (malaria) Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Malignant tumor diseases Allograft rejection episodes. A leukodystrophy called Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome Depression and somatization. Neopterin concentrations usually correlate with the extent and activity of the disease, and are also useful to monitor during therapy in these patients. Elevated neopterin concentrations are among the best predictors of adverse outcome in patients with HIV infection, in cardiovascular disease and in various types of cancer. In the laboratory it is measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), ELISA, or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It has a native fluorescence of wavelength excitation at 353 nm and emission at 438 nm, rendering it readily detected. == References == Cavaleri et al.

Isoxsuprine is a β2 adrenoreceptor agonist that causes direct relaxation of uterine and vascular smooth muscle via β2 receptors. == Use == === In humans === Isoxsuprine is used in humans for treatment of premature labor, i.e. a tocolytic, and as a vasodilator for the treatment of cerebral vascular insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, and other conditions. Isoxsuprine may increase the heart rate, cause changes in blood pressure, and irritate the GI tract. It should therefore be used with caution if combined with other drugs that affect blood pressure, such as sedatives and anesthetic drugs. === In horses === Isoxsuprine is most commonly used to treat hoof-related problems in the horse, most commonly for laminitis and navicular disease, as its effects as a vasodilator are thought to increase circulation within the hoof to help counteract the problems associated with these conditions. Isoxsuprine is given orally, and many horses find the pills quite palatable. Isoxsuprine is a prohibited class B drug in FEI-regulated competition, and is often prohibited by other equine associations. It may be detected in the urine for several weeks or months following administration. It is therefore important to check the drug-rules within an animal's given competitive organization, before administering the drug.

It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, and islands in the western Pacific Ocean. It is consumed as a culinary vegetable and is used in traditional medicine. == Description == Centella grows in temperate and tropical swampy areas in many regions of the world. The stems are slender, creeping stolons, green to reddish-green in color, connecting plants to each other. It has long-stalked, green, rounded apices which have smooth texture with palmately netted veins. The leaves are borne on pericladial petioles, around 2 cm (0.79 in). The rootstock consists of rhizomes, growing vertically down. They are cream in color and covered with root hairs. The flowers are white or crimson in color, born in small, rounded bunches (umbels) near the surface of the soil. Each flower is partly enclosed in two green bracts. The hermaphrodite flowers are minute in size, less than 3 mm (0.12 in), with five to six corolla lobes per flower. Each flower bears five stamens and two styles. The fruit are densely reticulate, distinguishing it from species of Hydrocotyle which have smooth, ribbed or warty fruit. The crop matures in three months, and the whole plant, including the roots, is harvested manually. It is a highly invasive plant, rated as ""high risk"". Centella has numerous common names in its regions of distribution. == Ecology == Centella asiatica is indigenous to the Indian subcontinent (including Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia, parts of Australia, and wetland regions of the Southeastern US. Because the plant is aquatic, it is especially sensitive to biological and chemical pollutants in the water, which may be absorbed into the plant. It can be cultivated in drier soils, including sandy loam, as long as they are watered regularly enough (such as in a home garden arrangement). == Composition == Centella contains pentacyclic triterpenoids and trisaccharide derivatives, including asiaticoside, brahmoside, asiatic acid, and brahmic acid (madecassic acid). Other constituents include centellose, centelloside, and madecassoside. Approximately 124 chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from Centella asiatica. Long term use on the skin can cause severe health problems including: skin irritation, intoxicated blood, red eyes and problems with the lymph nodes. == Uses == === Culinary === In Burmese cuisine, raw pennywort is used as the main constituent in a salad mixed with onions, crushed peanuts, bean powder and seasoned with lime juice and fish sauce. Centella is used as a leafy green in Sri Lankan cuisine, being the predominantly locally available leafy green, where it is called gotu kola or vallaarai. It is most often prepared as malluma, a traditional accompaniment to rice and vegetarian dishes, such as lentils, and jackfruit or pumpkin curry. It is considered nutritious. In addition to finely chopped gotu kola plants, the gotu kola malluma may be eaten with grated coconut, diced shallots, lime (or lemon) juice, and sea salt. Additional ingredients are finely chopped green chilis, chili powder, turmeric powder, or chopped carrots. The Centella fruit-bearing structures are discarded from the gotu kola malluma due to their intense bitter taste. A variation of porridge known as kola kanda is also made with gotu kola in Sri Lanka. Gotu kola kanda or Vallaarai kanji is made with well-boiled red rice with some extra liquid, coconut milk first extract, and gotu kola purée. The porridge is accompanied with jaggery for sweetness. Centella leaves are also used in modern sweet pennywort drinks and herbal teas. In addition the leaves are served stir-fried whole in coconut oil, or cooked in coconut milk with garlic or dhal. In Indonesia, the leaves are used for sambai oi peuga-ga, an Aceh type of salad, and is also mixed into asinan in Bogor. In Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand, this leaf is used for preparing a drink or can be eaten in raw form in salads or cold rolls. In Bangkok, vendors in the Chatuchak Weekend Market sell it alongside coconut, roselle, chrysanthemum, orange and other health drinks. In Malay cuisine it is known as pegaga, and the leaves of this plant are used for ulam, a type of vegetable salad. C. asiatica is widely used in various Indian regional cuisines. In Bangladesh and India (specifically in West Bengal), Centella is called Thankuni Pata and used in various dishes, one of the most appetising of which is the pakora-like snack called Thankuni Patar Bora; made of mashed Centella, lentils, julienned onion and green chilli. === Traditional medicine === In traditional medicine, C. asiatica has been used to treat various disorders, dermatological conditions, and minor wounds, due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, although clinical efficacy and safety have not been investigated in human clinical trials. In animals trials, C. asiatica and its extracts has been shown to relieve cognitive impairment and treat neurodegenerative conditions by way of reducing the production of reactive oxygen species and promoting neuron survival and growth. It has also shown promise in treating endocrine-related disorders like diabetes and obesity, by reducing insulin resistance and aiding in the regulation of blood glucose levels and appetite, and endometriosis by reducing inflammation. Furthermore, C. asiatica has shown to reduce the generation and activity of osteoclasts in Osteoporosis models in mice. C. asiatica may address several skin conditions such as acne, vitiligo, eczema, and increase collagen production. The compounds asiaticoside and asiatic acid may relieve hypertension, atherosclerosis, and ischemic heart disease by promoting endothelium function and reducing pathological apoptosis of heart muscles. C. asiatica's pro-mitochondrial, anti-imflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects have shown benefits in treating digestive diseases in animal and in vitro studies. Asiatic acid may also aid in treating respiratory diseases by targeting inflammation. In animal and cell trials, C. asiatica has been shown to promote cancer cell death. Contact dermatitis and skin irritation can result from topical application. Drowsiness may occur after consuming it. There has been three cases of liver disease associated with use over the span of multiple weeks. === Telomerase activation === C. asiatica has been shown to activate telomerase more than any other known compound yet discovered: 8.8-fold. This exceeds the activation by other known telomerase activators: oleanolic acid 5.9-fold, Astragalus extract 4.3-fold, TA-65 2.2-fold, and maslinic acid 2-fold. === Agricultural use === In the context of phytoremediation, C. asiatica is a potential phytoextraction tool owing to its ability to take up and translocate metals from root to shoot when grown in soils contaminated by heavy metals. == Gallery == == References == == External links == ""Centella asiatica"".

1211,"('Benserazide (hydrochloride)', 'Serazide', 'Ro 4-4602', 'Benserazide', 'Benserazida')",Medical,"Benserazide is a peripherally acting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase or DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, which is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == It is used in the management of Parkinson's disease in combination with L-DOPA (levodopa) as co-beneldopa (BAN), under the brand names Madopar in the UK and Prolopa in Canada, both made by Roche. Benserazide is not approved for use in the US; carbidopa is used, instead, for the same purpose. These combinations are also used for the treatment of restless leg syndrome. == Pharmacology == Levodopa is a precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is administered to increase its levels in the central nervous system. However, most levodopa is decarboxylated to dopamine before it reaches the brain, and since dopamine is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier, this translates to little therapeutic gain with strong peripheral side effects. Benserazide inhibits the aforementioned decarboxylation, and since it cannot cross the blood–brain barrier itself, this allows dopamine to build up solely in the brain, instead. Adverse effects caused by peripheral dopamine, such as vasoconstriction, nausea, and arrhythmia, are minimized. However, benserazide cannot reduce the centrally mediated side effects of levodopa, particularly dyskinesia. Benserazide has little therapeutic effect on its own, and its effect occurs synergically in combination with levodopa. The enzyme inhibited by benzerazide catalyzes many different decarboxylations. The same effect of concentrating the conversion of levodopa into dopamine to the central nervous system can be achieved with the following decarboxylations being confined to the central nervous system: 5-HTP to serotonin Tryptophan to tryptamine Phenylalanine to phenethylamine L-Tyrosine to tyramine Centrally mediated side effects of higher levels of neuro- and trace amine-transmitters may worsen in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

1212,"('Sildenafil',)",Medical,"Sildenafil, sold under the brand name Viagra among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of certain symptoms in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. It is unclear if it is effective for treating sexual dysfunction in females. It can be taken orally (swallowed by mouth), intravenously (injection into a vein), or through the sublingual route (dissolved under the tongue). Onset when taken orally is typically within twenty minutes and lasts for about two hours. Common side effects include headaches, heartburn, and flushed skin. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include vision problems, hearing loss, and prolonged erection (priapism) that can lead to damage to the penis. Sildenafil should not be taken by people on nitric oxide donors such as nitroglycerin, as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure. Sildenafil acts by blocking phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that promotes breakdown of cGMP, which regulates blood flow in the penis. It requires sexual arousal to work, and does not by itself cause or increase sexual arousal. It also results in dilation of the blood vessels in the lungs. Pfizer originally discovered the medication in 1989 while looking for a treatment for angina. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 1998. In 2022, it was the 157th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. In the United Kingdom, it is available over-the-counter (OTC). == Medical uses == === Erectile dysfunction === The primary indication of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability to sustain a satisfactory erection to complete sexual intercourse). Its use is now one of the standard treatments for erectile dysfunction, including for males with diabetes mellitus. ==== Antidepressant-associated erectile dysfunction ==== Tentative evidence suggests that sildenafil may help males who experience antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction. === Pulmonary hypertension === While sildenafil improves some markers of disease in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension, it does not appear to affect the risk of death or serious side effects. === Raynaud's phenomenon === Sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors are used off-label to alleviate vasospasm and treat severe ischemia and ulcers in fingers and toes for people with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon; these drugs have moderate efficacy for reducing the frequency and duration of vasospastic episodes. As of 2016, their role more generally in Raynaud's was not clear. === Altitude sickness === Sildenafil has shown some potential for improving exercise performance at high altitudes. However, its overall efficacy is not clear. ==== High-altitude pulmonary edema ==== Sildenafil has been studied for high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), but its use is currently not recommended for that indication. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache, flushing, indigestion, nasal congestion, and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue (cyanopsia). This cyanopsia can be explained because sildenafil, while selective for PDE5, does have some affinity for PDE6, which is the phosphodiesterase found in the retina. Patients thus taking the drug may experience colorvision abnormalities. Some complained of blurriness and loss of peripheral vision. In July 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated labeling for tadalafil (Cialis), vardenafil (Levitra), and sildenafil (Viagra) to reflect a small number of post-marketing reports of sudden vision loss, while acknowledging that ""...it is not possible to determine whether these oral medicines for erectile dysfunction were the cause of the loss of eyesight or whether the problem is related to other factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes, or to a combination of these problems."" A careful review of pooled data from clinical trials containing well documented information about the dose and duration of exposure to the drug for a large number of patients, yields no evidence for an increased risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or other adverse ocular events associated with PDE5 inhibitor use. Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include prolonged erections, severe low blood pressure, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, and sudden hearing loss. In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss. === Interactions === Care should be exercised by people who are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels. The use of sildenafil and an α1 blocker (typically prescribed for hypertension or for urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy) at the same time may lead to low blood pressure, but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least 4 hours apart. === Contraindications === Contraindications include: Concomitant use of nitric oxide donors, organic nitrites and nitrates, such as: nitroglycerin isosorbide mononitrate isosorbide dinitrate sodium nitroprusside alkyl nitrites (commonly known as ""poppers"") Concomitant use of soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil Sildenafil should not be used if sexual activity is inadvisable due to underlying cardiovascular risk factors. == Non-medical use == === Recreational use === Sildenafil's popularity with young adults has increased over the years. Sildenafil's brand name, Viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of sildenafil when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those who do not have erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25 mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group. Unprescribed recreational use of sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors is noted as particularly high among users of illegal drugs. Sildenafil is sometimes used to counteract the effects of other substances, often illicit. Some users mix it with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), other stimulants, or opiates in an attempt to compensate for the common side effect of erectile dysfunction, a combination known as ""sextasy"", ""rockin' and rollin'"", ""hammerheading"", or ""trail mix"". Mixing it with amyl nitrite, another vasodilator, is particularly dangerous and potentially fatal. === Jet lag research === The 2007 Ig Nobel Prize in aviation went to Patricia V. Agostino, Santiago A. Plano, and Diego A. Golombek of Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Argentina, for their discovery that sildenafil helps treat jet lag recovery in hamsters. === Sports === Professional athletes have been documented using sildenafil, believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich their muscles. In turn, they believe it will enhance their performances. === Analogs === Acetildenafil and other synthetic structural analogs of sildenafil which are PDE5 inhibitors have been found as adulterants in a number of ""herbal"" aphrodisiac products sold over-the-counter. These analogs have not undergone any of the rigorous testing that drugs like sildenafil have passed, and thus have unknown side-effect profiles. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs, but progress has been slow so far, as, even in those jurisdictions that have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogs of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogs of prescription medicines. However, at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned numerous products claiming to be Eurycoma longifolia that, in fact, contain only analogs of sildenafil. Sellers of such fake herbals typically respond by just changing the names of their products. == Detection in biological fluids == Sildenafil and/or N-desmethylsildenafil, its major active metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to assess pharmacokinetic status in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. == Mechanism of action == Sildenafil protects cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation. The molecular mechanism of smooth muscle relaxation involves the enzyme CGMP-dependent protein kinase, also known as PKG. This kinase is activated by cGMP and it phosphorylates multiple targets in the smooth muscle cells, namely myosin light chain phosphatase, RhoA, IP3 receptor, phospholipase C, and others. Overall, this results in a decrease in intracellular calcium and desensitizing proteins to the effects of calcium, engendering smooth muscle relaxation. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and increased penile response to sexual stimulation. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra). Sildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4 (major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose). If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third. == Route of administration == When taken orally, sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average time to onset of erections of 27 minutes (ranging from 12 to 70 minutes). Sublingual use of sildenafil for erectile dysfunction results in an average onset of action of 15 minutes and lasting for an average of 40 minutes. == Chemical synthesis == The preparation steps for synthesis of sildenafil are: Methylation of 3-propylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester with hot dimethyl sulfate Hydrolysis with aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to free acid Nitration with oleum/fuming nitric acid Carboxamide formation with refluxing thionyl chloride/NH4OH Reduction of nitro group to amino group Acylation with 2-ethoxybenzoyl chloride Cyclization Sulfonation to the chlorosulfonyl derivative Condensation with 1-methylpiperazine. == History == Sildenafil (compound UK-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists led by Simon Campbell working at Pfizer's Sandwich, Kent, research facility in England. It was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischaemic heart disease). The first clinical trials were conducted in Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Phase I clinical trials under the direction of Ian Osterloh suggested the drug had little effect on angina, but it could induce marked penile erections. Pfizer therefore decided to market it for erectile dysfunction, rather than for angina; this decision became an often-cited example of drug repositioning. The drug was patented in 1996, approved for use in erectile dysfunction by the FDA on 27 March 1998, becoming the first oral treatment approved to treat erectile dysfunction in the United States, and offered for sale in the United States later that year. It soon became a great success: annual sales of Viagra peaked in 2008 at US$1.934 billion. == Society and culture == === Marketing and sales === In the US, even though sildenafil is available only by prescription from a doctor, it was advertised directly to consumers on TV (famously being endorsed by former United States Senator Bob Dole and football star Pelé). Numerous sites on the Internet offer Viagra for sale after an ""online consultation"", often a simple web questionnaire. The Viagra name has become so well known that many fake aphrodisiacs now call themselves ""herbal viagra"" or are presented as blue tablets imitating the shape and colour of Pfizer's product. Viagra is also informally known as ""vitamin V"", ""the blue pill"", or ""blue diamond"", as well as various other nicknames. Viagra and other products for sexual dysfunction, termed sexuopharmaceuticals, proliferated new types of specialised marketing for such products. Viagra and similar prescription pharmaceuticals were promoted by images in media to the extent of becoming a cultural icon, at the time a relatively new phenomenon known to be permitted only in the United States and New Zealand and which is believed to have significantly contributed to norms regarding male sexuality. One author notes that although the effect of Viagra is only limited to penile blood vessels, advertisements routinely use imagery of couples hugging, smiling and dancing, with the author claiming that pharmaceutical companies were deceptive in the use of such advertisements. In 2000, Viagra sales accounted for 92% of the global market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills. By 2007, Viagra's global share had plunged to about 50% due to several factors, including the entry of Cialis and Levitra, along with several counterfeits and clones, and reports of vision loss in people taking PDE5 inhibitors. In 2008, the FDA forced Pfizer to remove Viva Cruiser, an advergame for Viagra, from appearing on Forbes, after the game failed to disclose risk information about the drug. In February 2007, it was announced that Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in Manchester, England. Males between the ages of 30 and 65 would be eligible to buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist. In 2017, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) enacted legislation that expanded this nationwide, allowing a particular branded formulation of Sildenafil, Viagra Connect (50 mg), to be sold over the counter and without a prescription throughout the UK from early 2018. While the sale remains subject to a consultation with a pharmacist, the other restrictions from the trial have been removed, allowing customers over the age of 18 to purchase an unlimited number of pills. The decision was made, in part, to reduce online sales of counterfeit and potentially dangerous erectile dysfunction treatments. In May 2013, Pfizer, which manufactures Viagra, told the Associated Press they will begin selling the drug directly to people on its website. Pfizer's patents on Viagra expired outside the US in 2012; in the US they were set to expire, but Pfizer settled litigation with each of Mylan and Teva which agreed that both companies could introduce generics in the US on 11 December 2017. In December 2017, Pfizer released its own generic version of Viagra. As of 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved fifteen drug manufacturers to market generic sildenafil in the United States. Seven of these companies are based in India. The patent for Pfizer's Viagra sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction expired in April 2020. === Counterfeits === Counterfeit Viagra, despite generally being cheaper, can contain harmful substances or substances that affect how Viagra works, such as blue printer ink, amphetamines, metronidazole, boric acid, and rat poison. Viagra is one of the world's most counterfeited medicines. According to a 2012 Pfizer study, around 80% of sites claiming to sell Viagra were selling counterfeits. An October 2023 release stated that erectile dysfunction medicines were the most seized drugs by the Interpol accounting for 22% of seizures. International networks may be active. === Regional issues === ==== United States ==== In 1992, Pfizer filed a patent covering the substance sildenafil and its use to treat cardiovascular diseases. This would be marketed as Revatio. The patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012. The patent on Revatio (indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction) expired in late 2012. Generic versions of this low-dose form of sildenafil have been available in the US from a number of manufacturers, including Greenstone, Mylan, and Watson, since early 2013. Health care providers may prescribe generic sildenafil for erectile dysfunction. For a time, the generic was not available in the same dosages as branded Viagra, so using dosages typically required for treating ED required patients to take multiple pills. In 1994, Pfizer filed a patent covering the use of sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction. This would be marketed as Viagra. This patent was published in 2002 and expired in 2019. Teva sued to have the latter patent invalidated, but Pfizer prevailed in an August 2011 federal district court case. An agreement with Pfizer allowed Teva to begin to provide the generic drug in December 2017. In the United States, Pfizer received two patents for sildenafil: one for its indication to treat cardiovascular disease (marketed as Revatio) and another for its indication to treat erectile dysfunction (marketed as Viagra). The substance is the same under both brand names. Sildenafil is available as a generic drug in the United States, labeled for pulmonary arterial hypertension, and to treat erectile dysfunction, as the patent expired in April 2020. In the US, Revatio and Viagra are marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. ==== Brazil ==== Pfizer's patent on sildenafil citrate expired in Brazil in 2010. ==== Canada ==== In Canada, Pfizer's patent 2,324,324 for Revatio (sildenafil used to treat pulmonary hypertension) was found invalid by the Federal Court in June 2010, on an application by Ratiopharm Inc. On 8 November 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Pfizer's patent 2,163,446 on Viagra was invalid from the beginning because the company did not provide full disclosure in its application. The decision, Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., pointed to section 27(3)(b) of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information ""to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains"" to produce it. It added further: ""As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way. This, in my view, is the key issue in this appeal."" Teva Canada launched Novo-Sildenafil, a generic version of Viagra, on the day the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision. To remain competitive, Pfizer then reduced the price of Viagra in Canada. However, on 9 November 2012, Pfizer filed a motion for a re-hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada, on the grounds that the court accidentally exceeded its jurisdiction by voiding the patent. Finally, on 22 April 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated Pfizer's patent altogether. ==== China ==== Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs is common in China, where Pfizer's patent claim is not widely enforced. ==== Egypt ==== Egypt approved Viagra for sale in 2002, but soon afterwards allowed local companies to produce generic versions of the drug, citing the interests of poor people who would not be able to afford Pfizer's price. ==== European Union ==== In June 2013 Pfizer's patent on sildenafil citrate expired in some member countries of the European Union, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. A UK patent held by Pfizer on the use of PDE5 inhibitors (see below) as treatment of impotence was invalidated in 2000 because of obviousness; this decision was upheld on appeal in 2002. ==== India ==== Manufacture and sale of sildenafil citrate drugs known as ""generic Viagra"" is common in India, where Pfizer's patent claim does not apply. Brand names include Kamagra (Ajanta Pharma), Silagra (Cipla), Edegra (Sun Pharmaceutical), Penegra (Zydus Cadila), Manly (Cooper Pharma) and Zenegra (Alkem Laboratories). ==== New Zealand ==== Sildenafil was reclassified in New Zealand in 2014 so it could be bought over the counter from a pharmacist. It is thought that this reduced sales over the Internet and was safer as males could be referred for medical advice if appropriate. ==== South Korea ==== In 1999 South Korea granted two patents to Pfizer related to sildenafil. The first document guaranteed sole production and sale of the substance until 2012, while the second gave Pfizer the exclusive use to treating erectile dysfunction with sildenafil until 2014. In 2011 Hanmi Pharmaceutical and CJ CheilJedang launched a suit against the exclusive use patent. The Korean Court system made a ruling against Pfizer in June 2012, allowing for the unhindered domestic production of generic prescription sildenafil. During 2012 Viagra lost its position as the top selling erectile dysfunction treatment in South Korea. This development was credited largely ""due to the introduction of generic products."" Generic sildenafil became publicly available in May. Sales of PalPal by Hanmi Pharmaceuticals totalled ₩22 billion or about 86% the market share of Viagra that year. By 2017 there were over 50 generic sildenafil pills available. During that year Viagra sales slumped to 38% that of Palpal. ==== United Kingdom ==== There were 2,958,199 prescriptions for Sildenafil in 2016 in England, compared with 1,042,431 in 2006. In 2018, Viagra Connect, a particular formulation of Sildenafil marketed by Pfizer, became available for sale without a prescription in the UK, in an attempt to widen availability and reduce demand for counterfeit products. == References == == External links ==",Sildenafil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.680836794548668e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024903970770537853)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"
1213,"('Edicotinib', 'Edicotinib (usan)', 'Edicotinib [usan]', 'Edicotinibjnj-40346527', 'Ex-a2787')",Medical," The prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) is immunosuppressive, with few effector T cells and enrichment of inhibitory immune populations, leading to limited responses to treatments such as immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs). The immune composition of the prostate TME differs across soft tissue and bone, the most common site of treatment-refractory metastasis. Understanding immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to prostate TMEs will enable rational immunotherapy strategies to generate effective antitumor immune responses. Daratumumab (anti-CD38 antibody) and edicotinib (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor) may alter the balance within the prostate TME to promote antitumor immune responses. Daratumumab or edicotinib will be safe and will alter the immune TME, leading to antitumor responses in localized prostate cancer. In this presurgical study, patients with localized prostate cancer received 4 weekly doses of daratumumab or 4 weeks of daily edicotinib prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). Treated and untreated control (Gleason score ≥8 in prostate biopsy) prostatectomy specimens and patient-matched pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow samples were evaluated. The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events (AEs). The secondary endpoint was pathologic complete remission (pCR) rate. Twenty-five patients were treated (daratumumab, n=15; edicotinib, n=10). All patients underwent RP without delays. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs with daratumumab occurred in 3 patients (12%), and no ≥grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred with edicotinib. No changes in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels or pCRs were observed. Daratumumab led to a decreased frequency of CD38 Daratumumab and edicotinib treatment was safe and well-tolerated in patients with localized prostate cancer but did not induce pCRs. Decreases in CD38 Chemotherapy treatment faces a major obstacle with the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR), often attributed to the elevated expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as ABCG2 and ABCB1 in cancer cells. These transporters hinder the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs via ATP hydrolysis-dependent efflux, leading to diminished intracellular drug levels. The scarcity of approved treatments for multidrug resistant cancers necessitates exploration of alternative strategies, including drug repositioning of molecular targeted agents to counteract ABCG2-mediated MDR in multidrug-resistant cancer cells. This study investigates the potential of edicotinib, a selective colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently undergoing clinical trials for various diseases, to reverse MDR in ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells. Our findings reveal that by attenuating the drug-efflux function of ABCG2 without altering its expression, edicotinib improves drug-induced apoptosis and reverses MDR in ABCG2-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells at non-toxic concentrations. Through ATPase activity analysis and molecular docking, potential interaction sites for edicotinib on ABCG2 were identified. These results underscore an additional pharmacological benefit of edicotinib against ABCG2 activity, suggesting its potential incorporation into combination therapies for patients with ABCG2-overexpressing tumors. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.",Edicotinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.014684110297821e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0020130861084908247), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011061654426157475)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([alzforum.org](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/edicotinib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=6, title='Edicotinib | ALZFORUM', type='url_citation', url='https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/edicotinib?utm_source=openai')])"
1214,"('Cefadroxil', 'Bl-s 578', 'Cephadroxil', 'Cefadroxil anhydrous', 'Cefadroxilo')",Medical,"Cefadroxil (formerly trademarked as Duricef) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the cephalosporin type, effective in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. It is a bactericidal antibiotic. It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1978. == Medical use == Cefadroxil is a first-generation cephalosporin antibacterial drug that is the para-hydroxy derivative of cephalexin, and is used similarly in the treatment of mild to moderate susceptible infections such as the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, causing the disease popularly called strep throat or streptococcal tonsillitis, urinary tract infection, reproductive tract infection, and skin infections. Cefadroxil is used as an antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, for patients allergic to penicillins. === Spectrum of bacterial resistance and susceptibility === Cefadroxil has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating bacteria responsible for causing tonsillitis, and infections of the skin and urinary tract. Cefadroxil covers similar organisms to Cephalexin given that it is a derivative drug. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. Escherichia coli: 8 μg/ml Staphylococcus aureus: 1 – 2 μg/ml Streptococcus pneumoniae: ≤1 – >16 μg/ml == Side effects == The most common side effects of cefadroxil are diarrhea (which, less commonly, may be bloody), nausea, upset stomach, and vomiting. Other side effects include rashes, hives, and itching. == Pharmacokinetics == Cefadroxil is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After doses of 500 mg and 1 g by mouth, peak plasma concentrations of about 16 and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, are obtained after 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Although peak concentrations are similar to those of cefalexin, plasma concentrations are more sustained. Dosage with food does not appear to affect the absorption of cefadroxil. About 20% of cefadroxil is reported to be bound to plasma proteins. Its plasma half-life is about 1.5 hours and is prolonged in patients with renal impairment. Cefadroxil is widely distributed to body tissues and fluids. It crosses the placenta and appears in breast milk. More than 90% of a dose of cefadroxil may be excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; peak urinary concentrations of 1.8 mg/ml have been reported after a dose of 500 mg. Cefadroxil is removed by haemodialysis. == Dosage == Cefadroxil is given by mouth, and doses are expressed in terms of the anhydrous substance; 1.04 g of cefadroxil monohydrate is equivalent to about 1 g of anhydrous cefadroxil. == Veterinary use == It can be used for treating infected wounds on animals. Usually in powder form mixed with water, it has a color and smell similar to Tang. Given orally to animals, the amount is dependent on their weight and severity of infection. == References ==",Cephadroxil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.242440288886428e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011855486081913114)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefadroxil,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682730.html,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cefadroxil-oral-route/description/drg-20073247 ', [])"
1215,"('Deferasirox', 'Exjade', 'Deferasiroxum', 'Deferasiroxum [inn-latin]', 'Deferasirox (exjade)')",Medical,"Deferasirox, sold under the brand name Exjade among others, is an oral iron chelator. Its main use is to reduce chronic iron overload in patients who are receiving long-term blood transfusions for conditions such as beta-thalassemia and other chronic anemias. It is the first oral medication approved in the United States for this purpose. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2005. According to the FDA (May 2007), kidney failure and cytopenias have been reported in patients receiving deferasirox tablets for oral suspension. It is approved in the European Union by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for children six years and older for chronic iron overload from repeated blood transfusions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In July 2020, Teva decided to discontinue deferasirox. It is available as a generic medication. == Properties == The half-life of deferasirox is between 8 and 16 hours allowing once a day dosing. Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron which are subsequently eliminated by fecal excretion. Its low molecular weight and high lipophilicity allows the drug to be taken orally unlike deferoxamine which has to be administered by IV route (intravenous infusion). Together with deferiprone, deferasirox seems to be capable of removing iron from cells (cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes) as well as removing iron from the blood. == Synthesis == Deferasirox can be prepared from simple commercially available starting materials (salicylic acid, salicylamide and 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid) in the following two-step synthetic sequence: The condensation of salicyloyl chloride (formed in situ from salicylic acid and thionyl chloride) with salicylamide under dehydrating reaction conditions results in formation of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3(4H)-benzoxazin-4-one. This intermediate is isolated and reacted with 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid in the presence of base to give 4-(3,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (deferasirox). == Risks == Deferasirox ranked second on the list of drugs most frequently suspected in reported patient deaths compiled for 2019, by the Institute for Safe Medical Practices, with 1320 suspected deaths. A boxed warning was added in the same year with regard to kidney failure, liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding.

In the present study, a new beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disodium salt (NADH)-dependent reductase isolated from Bacillus subtilis was used to reduce the redox dyes CI Acid Blue 74, CI Natural Orange 6, and CI Vat Blue 1 into their water-soluble leuco form. Enzymatic reduction was optimized in relation to pH and temperature conditions. The reductase was able to reduce Acid Blue 74 and Natural Orange 6 in the presence of the stoichiometrically consumed cofactor NADH; meanwhile, Vat Blue 1 required the presence of mediator 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone. Oxygen from air was used to reoxidize the dyes into their initial forms. The enzymatic reduction of the dyes was studied and the kinetic constants determined, and these were compared to the chemically-reduced leuco form. The enzyme responsible for the reduction showed homology to a NADH-dependent reductase from B. subtilis based on results from the MS/MS peptide mass mapping of the tryptically digested protein. Additionally, the reduction of Acid Blue 74 to its leuco form by reductase from B. subtilis was confirmed using NADH regenerated by the oxidation of formic acid with formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii in the same solution. Arsenic is atherogenic, carcinogenic, and genotoxic. Because atherosclerotic plaque has been considered a benign smooth muscle cell tumor, we have studied the effects of arsenite on DNA integrity of human vascular smooth muscle cells.

DNA strand breaks of arsenite-treated cells were increased by Escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase and decreased by diphenylene iodinium, superoxide dismutase, catalase, pyruvate, DMSO, or D-mannitol. Extract from arsenite-treated cells showed increased capacity for producing superoxide when NADH was included in the reaction mixture; however, addition of arsenite to extract from untreated cells did not increase superoxide production. The superoxide-producing ability of arsenite-treated cells was also suppressed by diphenylene iodinium, 4,5-dihydroxy-1, 2-benzenedisulfonic acid disodium salt (Tiron), or superoxide dismutase. Superoxide production and DNA strand breaks in arsenite-treated cells were also suppressed by transfecting antisense oligonucleotides of p22phox, an essential component of NADH oxidase. Treatment with arsenite also increased the mRNA level of p22phox. These results suggest that arsenite activates NADH oxidase to produce superoxide, which then causes oxidative DNA damage. The result that arsenite at low concentrations increases oxidant levels and causes oxidative DNA damage in vascular smooth muscle cells may be important in arsenic-induced atherosclerosis. In this study we examined the intracellular sources of superoxide anion (O2-.) in cultured bovine coronary endothelium, employing lucigenin (250 microM)-elicited chemiluminescence (CL). In the homogenate from these cells, 100 microM NADPH increased O2-. by 81% from 8.9 +/- 1.5 to 16.0 +/- 1.5 x 10(5) cpm/mg protein (P < 0.01, n = 8). In the presence of 100 microM NADH, however, CL increased by 458% from 8.9 +/- 1.6 to 49.6 +/- 12.0 x 10(5) cpm/mg protein (P < 0.01, n = 8). Scavengers of O2-., superoxide dismutase (100 micrograms/ml), or 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid disodium salt (Tiron, 10 mM) inhibited NADH-mediated CL by 70 and 83%, respectively. Neither hypoxanthine (100 microM) nor antimycin (10 microM)+succinate (5 mM) had any significant effect on basal CL levels, thereby excluding xanthine oxidase and mitochondria, respectively, as a detectable sources of O2-. generation. The presence of NAD+ (100 microM) and lactate (1 mM) increased CL by 88% (n = 8, P < 0.01). In the intact cells, basal production of CL was increased by 205% (P < 0.01) by 5 mM lactate, but not by 5 mM pyruvate, and CL was inhibited by 10 mM Tiron, suggesting the reduction of cytosolic NAD by lactate dehydrogenase stimulates O2-. production. Diphenyliodonium at 1 and 10 microM inhibited both NADH-mediated CL in homogenate and lactate-mediated CL in intact endothelium by 50 and 33%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Disodium nadh,PUBMED,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.20224395394325256), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5786381363868713), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02329389750957489)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014166564680635929)])","('PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL; https://incibeauty.com/en/ingredients/21525-disodium-nadh,https://creamscan.com/ingredients/disodium-nadh/,https://ecogolik.com/ingredient/disodium_nadh/,https://skinsort.com/ingredients/disodium-nadh,https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/702152-DISODIUM_NADH/,https://globinmed.com/medicinal_products/nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-nadh-78269/ ', [])"
1218,"('Blarcamesine (hydrochloride)', 'Avex-73 (hydrochloride)', 'Blarcamesine', 'Avex-73', 'Anavex-2-73')",Medical,"Blarcamesine (developmental code name ANAVEX 2-73) is an experimental drug which is under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and a variety of other indications. Blarcamesine acts as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor, the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor, and the ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptor. The drug was developed by Anavex Life Sciences. As of August 2024, it is in preregistration for Alzheimer's disease, phase 2/3 clinical trials for fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome, phase 2 trials for Parkinson's disease, and phase 1 trials for Angelman syndrome and infantile spasms. It was also under development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, cognition disorders, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, but development for these indications was discontinued. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Blacarmesine acts primarily as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor (affinity (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration) = 860 nM). To a lesser extent, it is also an agonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor (affinity = 5 μM) and of the ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptor (affinity = 8 μM). Blarcamesine was originally tested in mice against the effect of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, which induces learning impairment. M1 receptor agonists are known to reverse the amnesia caused by scopolamine. Scopolamine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and motion sickness by reducing the secretions of the stomach and intestines and can also decreases nerve signals to the stomach. This is via competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors are involved in the formation of both short term and long term memories. Experiments in mice have found that M1 and M3 receptor agonists inhibit the formation of β-amyloid and target GSK-3B. Furthermore, stimulation of the M1 receptor activates AF267B, which in turn blocks β-secretase, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to produce the amyloid-beta peptide. These β-amyloid peptides aggregate together to form plaques. This enzyme is involved in the formation of Tau plaques, which are common in Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, M1 receptor activation appears to decreases tau hyperphosphorylation and β-amyloid accumulation. σ1 receptor activation appears to be only involved in long-term memory processes. This partly explains why blarcamesine seems to be more effective in reversing scopolamine-induced long-term memory problems compared to short-term memory deficits. The σ1 receptor is located on mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes and modulates the ER stress response and local calcium exchanges with the mitochondria. Blarcamesine prevented Aβ25-35-induced increases in lipid peroxidation levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cytochrome c release into the cytosol, which are indicative of elevated toxicity. Blarcamesine inhibits mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction and therefore prevents against oxidative stress and apoptosis. This drug prevented the appearance of oxidative stress. Blarcamesine also exhibits anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activity. This is due in part because σ1 receptor agonists stimulate the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 due to reactive oxygen species dependent transcriptional activation of nuclear factor kB. Results from Maurice (2016) found that σ1 receptor agonists may offer a protective potential, both alone and possibly with other agents like donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, or memantine, a NMDA receptor antagonist. === Pharmacokinetics === Blarcamesine may function as a prodrug for ANAVEX 19-144 as well as act as a drug itself. ANAVEX19-144 is a positional isomer of ANAVEX 1-41, which is similar to blarcamesine but is not as selective for sigma σ1 receptor. == Research == In trials for Alzheimer's disease, Anavex Life Sciences reported that in patients with a fully functional SIGMAR1 gene, which encodes the σ1 receptor targeted by blarcamesine, the drug improved cognition as measured by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) by 14% after 70 weeks of treatment. Competence in activities of daily living was improved by 8% in the same subgroup of patients. Additionally, in trials for Parkinson's disease, episodic memory was significantly improved after 14 weeks of treatment. == Other drugs == A related drug is ANAVEX 3-71. == Synthesis == The synthesis of Blarcamesine is via the following method: (Precursor:) The reaction between benzophenone [119-61-9] and succinic anhydride [108-30-5] in the presence of zinc chloride give 2,2-Diphenyloxolane-3-carboxylic acid, PC151808451 (1). The halogenation of with thionyl chloride (2) followed by dimethylamine gives the amide and hence N,N-dimethyl-5-oxo-2,2-diphenyloxolane-3-carboxamide, PC15187451 (3). Strong reduction with lithium aluminium hydride both removes the amide carbonyl as well as reduces the butyrophenone moiety giving a diol and hence 2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1,1-diphenylbutane-1,4-diol, PC15187448 (4).

1219,"('Gliclazide', 'Glimicron', 'Gliclazidum [inn-latin]', 'Gliclazida [inn-spanish]', 'Gliclazida')",Medical,"Gliclazide, sold under the brand name Diamicron among others, is a sulfonylurea type of anti-diabetic medication, used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is used when dietary changes, exercise, and weight loss are not enough. It is taken by mouth. Side effect may include low blood sugar, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, and liver problems. Use by those with significant kidney problems or liver problems or who are pregnant is not recommended. Gliclazide is in the sulfonylurea family of medications. It works mostly by increasing the release of insulin. Gliclazide was patented in 1966 and approved for medical use in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not available for sale in the United States. == Medical uses == Gliclazide is used for control of hyperglycemia in gliclazide-responsive diabetes mellitus of stable, mild, non-ketosis prone, type 2 diabetes. It is used when diabetes cannot be controlled by proper dietary management and exercise and when metformin has already been tried. National Kidney Foundation (2012 Update) claims that Gliclazide does not require dosage up titration even in end stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == Type 1 diabetes Hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas Severe renal or hepatic failure (But relatively useful in mild renal impairment e.g. CKD stage 3) Pregnancy and lactation == Adverse effects == Common adverse effects over 10%: Hypoglycemia (11 - 12%) - while it was shown to have the same efficacy as glimepiride, one of the newer sulfonylureas, the European GUIDE study has shown that it has approximately 50% less hypoglycemic confirmed episodes in comparison with glimepiride. Uncommon adverse effect between 1 - 10%: Hypertension (3 - 4% incidence) Dizziness (2% incidence) Hyperglycemia (2% incidence) Viral infection (6 - 8% incidence) Back pain (4 - 5% incidence) Rare adverse effects (under 1%): cystitis weight gain Vomiting == Interactions == Hyperglycemic action may be caused by danazol, chlorpromazine, glucocorticoids, progestogens, or β-2 agonists. Its hypoglycemic action may be potentiated by phenylbutazone, alcohol, fluconazole, β-blockers, and possibly ACE inhibitors. It has been found that rifampin increases gliclazide metabolism in humans in vivo. == Overdose == Gliclazide overdose may cause severe hypoglycemia, requiring urgent administration of glucose by IV and Monitoring. == Mechanism of action == Gliclazide selectively binds to sulfonylurea receptors (SUR-1) on the surface of the pancreatic beta-cells. It was shown to provide cardiovascular protection as it does not bind to sulfonylurea receptors (SUR-2A) in the heart. This binding effectively closes these K+ ion channels. This decreases the efflux of potassium from the cell which leads to the depolarization of the cell. This causes voltage dependent Ca2+ ion channels to open increasing the Ca2+ influx. The calcium can then bind to and activate calmodulin which in turn leads to exocytosis of insulin vesicles leading to insulin release. The mouse model of Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) diabetes suggested that the reduced gliclazide clearance stands behind their therapeutic success in human MODY patients, but Urbanova et al. found that human MODY patients respond differently and that there was no consistent decrease in gliclazide clearance in randomly selected HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY patients. Its classification has been ambiguous, as literature uses it as both a first-generation and second-generation sulfonylurea. == Properties == According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), gliclazide falls under the BCS Class II drug, which is poorly soluble and highly permeable. Water solubility = 0.027mg/L Hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, restoring first peak of insulin secretion, increasing insulin Sensitivity. No active circulating Metabolites. == Metabolism == Gliclazide undergoes extensive metabolism to several inactive metabolites in human beings, mainly methylhydroxygliclazide and carboxygliclazide. CYP2C9 is involved in the formation of hydroxygliclazide in human liver microsomes and in a panel of recombinant human P450s in vitro. But the pharmacokinetics of gliclazide MR are affected mainly by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism instead of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphism. == References ==",Glimicron,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0016657537780702114), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0068380157463252544)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.07889000326395035)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1220,"('Oleoylethanolamide', 'N-oleoylethanolamide', 'Oleamide mea', 'Oleic acid monoethanolamide', 'N-oleoylethanolamine')","Endogenous, Medical","Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) agonist. It is a naturally occurring ethanolamide lipid that regulates feeding and body weight in vertebrates ranging from mice to pythons. OEA is a shorter, monounsaturated analogue of the endocannabinoid anandamide, but unlike anandamide it acts independently of the cannabinoid pathway, regulating PPAR-α activity to stimulate lipolysis. OEA is produced by the small intestine following feeding in two steps. First an N-acyl transferase (NAT) activity joins the free amino terminus of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to the oleoyl group (one variety of acyl group) derived from sn-1-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, which contains the fatty acid oleic acid at the sn-1 position. This produces an N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine, which is then split (hydrolyzed) by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) into phosphatidic acid and OEA. The biosynthesis of OEA and other bioactive lipid amides is modulated by bile acids. OEA has been demonstrated to bind to the novel cannabinoid receptor GPR119. OEA has been suggested to be the receptor's endogenous ligand. OEA has been hypothesized to play a key role in the inhibition of food seeking behavior and in the lipolysis of brown bears ""ursus arctos"" during the hibernation season together with the alteration of the endocannabinoid system required for the metabolic changes for hibernation. OEA has been reported to lengthen the life span of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans through interactions with lysomal molecules. OEA is mainly known by its anorexigenic effects. However, it has also neuroprotective properties. In this sense, recent research has demonstrated that OEA reduces neuronal death in a murine model of aggressive neurodegeneration. Such neuroprotective effect is triggered by a stabilization of microtubule dynamics and by the modulation of neuroinflammation == References == == External links == Science Magazine BBC: Fatty foods 'offer memory boost'",N-oleoylethanolamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.5570885807392187e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.0002420847595203668), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.3470558769768104e-05), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04863445460796356)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleoylethanolamide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=106, start_index=18, title='Oleoylethanolamide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleoylethanolamide?utm_source=openai')])"
1221,"('Px 12', 'Iv 2 compound', 'Ex-a2436', 'S7947', 'Px 12, >=98% (hplc), powder')",Medical," The thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) inhibitor, PX-12, is active against several cancer types. This study aimed to evaluate its effects on local osteosarcoma (OS) progression and to describe PX-12-related signal transduction pathways. Publicly available expression cohort data were analyzed to determine the relationship between the expression levels of TXN, which codes for the Trx protein, and survival in patients with OS. Murine LM8 OS cells were stimulated with PX-12. Apoptosis-related protein levels, cell viability, caspase activity, and wound healing were evaluated. PX-12 efficacy in suppressing tumor progression was evaluated in C3H mice injected with LM8 cells. High TXN expression was a negative prognostic factor for metastasis and overall survival in OS patients. PX-12 induced apoptosis in OS cells via the oxidative stress-MAPK-caspase 3 pathway and suppressed OS cell migration. PX-12 suppressed local OS progression. PX-12 is a potential therapeutic agent for use in suppressing local OS progression. PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide) as a thioredoxin (Trx) inhibitor has an anti-tumor effect. However, there is no report about the toxicological effect of PX-12 on lung cancer cells. Here, we investigated the anti-growth effects of PX-12 on Calu-6 lung cancer cells in relation to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) levels. PX-12 induced the growth inhibition of Calu-6 cells with IC50 of nearly 3 μM at 72 h. In contrast, PX-12 did not affect the growth of human small airway epithelial cells (HSAECs). Cell cycle distribution analysis indicated that PX-12 significantly induced a G2/M phase arrest in Calu-6 cells. PX-12 also increased the number of annexin V-FITC-positive cells in Calu-6 cells. All the tested caspase inhibitors markedly prevented Calu-6 cell death induced by PX-12. With regard to ROS and GSH levels, PX-12 increased ROS levels containing O2(·-) in Calu-6 cells and induced the depletion of GSH. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which is a well-known antioxidant, significantly reduced O2(·-) level in PX-12-treated Calu-6 cells and prevented apoptosis and GSH depletion in these cells. In conclusion, it is the first report that PX-12 inhibited the growth of Calu-6 cells via a G2/M phase arrest as well as apoptosis, which effect was related to the intracellular increases in ROS levels. Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of solid tumors, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), which causes therapeutic resistance. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is a key regulator of hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) and a promising therapeutic target against solid tumors. Among other HIF-1α inhibitors, vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) targeting the stability of HIF-1α, and PX-12 (1-methylpropyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide) is a thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) inhibitor preventing accumulation of HIF-1α. HDACis are effective against cancers; however, they are accompanied by several side effects along with an emerging resistance against it. This can be overcome by using HDACi in a combination regimen with Trx-1 inhibitor, as their inhibitory mechanisms are interconnected. HDACis inhibit Trx-1, leading to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells; thus, the efficacy of HDACi can be elevated by using a Trx-1 inhibitor. In this study, we have tested the EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) doses of vorinostat and PX-12 on CAL-27 (an OSCC cell line) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The combined EC50 dose of vorinostat and PX-12 is significantly reduced under hypoxia, and the interaction of PX-12 with vorinostat was evaluated by combination index (CI). An additive interaction between vorinostat and PX-12 was observed in normoxia, while a synergistic interaction was observed under hypoxia.

1222,"('Temozolomide', 'Methazolastone', 'Temodar', 'Temodal', 'Temozolamide')",Medical,"Temozolomide, sold under the brand name Temodar among others, is an anticancer medication used to treat brain tumors such as glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. It is taken by mouth or via intravenous infusion. The most common side effects with temozolomide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite, alopecia (hair loss), headache, fatigue, convulsions (seizures), rash, neutropenia or lymphopenia (low white-blood-cell counts), and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts). People receiving the solution for infusion may also have injection-site reactions, such as pain, irritation, itching, warmth, swelling and redness, as well as bruising. Temozolomide is an alkylating agent used to treat serious brain cancers; most commonly as second-line treatments for astrocytoma and as the first-line treatment for glioblastoma. Olaparib in combination with temozolomide demonstrated substantial clinical activity in relapsed small cell lung cancer. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == In the United States, temozolomide is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and subsequently as monotherapy treatment; or adults with newly diagnosed or refractory anaplastic astrocytoma. In the European Union, temozolomide is indicated for adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and subsequently as monotherapy treatment; or children from the age of three years, adolescents and adults with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after standard therapy. Temozolomide is also used to treat aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary cancer. == Contraindications == Temozolomide is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to it or to the similar drug dacarbazine. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite, alopecia (hair loss), headache, fatigue (tiredness), convulsions (fits), rash, neutropenia or lymphopenia (low white-blood-cell counts), and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts). People receiving the solution for infusion may also have injection-site reactions, such as pain, irritation, itching, warmth, swelling and redness, as well as bruising. == Interactions == Combining temozolomide with other myelosuppressants may increase the risk of myelosuppression. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The therapeutic benefit of temozolomide depends on its ability to alkylate/methylate DNA, which most often occurs at the N-7 or O-6 positions of guanine residues. This methylation damages the DNA and triggers the death of tumor cells. However, some tumor cells are able to repair this type of DNA damage, and therefore diminish the therapeutic efficacy of temozolomide, by expressing a protein O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) encoded in humans by the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene. In some tumors, epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene prevents the synthesis of this enzyme, and as a consequence such tumors are more sensitive to killing by temozolomide. Conversely, the presence of AGT protein in brain tumors predicts poor response to temozolomide and these patients receive little benefit from chemotherapy with temozolomide. === Pharmacokinetics === Temozolomide is quickly and almost completely absorbed from the gut, and readily penetrates the blood–brain barrier; the concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid is 30% of the concentration in the blood plasma. Intake with food decreases maximal plasma concentrations by 33% and the area under the curve by 9%. Only 15% (10–20%) of the substance are bound to blood plasma proteins. Temozolomide is a prodrug; it is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiological pH to 3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), which further splits into monomethylhydrazine, likely the active methylating agent, and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). Other metabolites include temozolomide acid and unidentified hydrophilic substances. Plasma half-life is 1.8 hours. The substance and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the urine. == Chemical properties == Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine derivative. It is slightly soluble in water and aqueous acids, and decomposes at 212 °C (414 °F). It was recently discovered that temozolomide is an explosive, tentatively assigned as UN Class 1. Temozolomide has also been reported to be a comparatively safe and stable in situ source of diazomethane in organic synthesis. In particular, use as a methylating and cyclopropanating reagent has been demonstrated. == History == The agent was discovered at Aston University in Birmingham, England. Its preclinical activity was reported in 1987. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 1999, and in the United States in August 1999. The intravenous formulation was approved in the United States in February 2009. == Research == Laboratory studies and clinical trials have started investigating the possibility of increasing the anticancer potency of temozolomide by combining it with other pharmacologic agents. For example, clinical trials have indicated that the addition of chloroquine might be beneficial for the treatment of glioma patients. Laboratory studies found that temozolomide killed brain tumor cells more efficiently when epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a component of green tea, was added; however, the efficacy of this effect has not yet been confirmed in brain-tumor patients. Preclinical studies reported in 2010 on investigations into the use of the novel oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) when combined with temozolomide and radiation therapy and a clinical trial was underway as of August 2015. While the above-mentioned approaches have investigated whether the combination of temozolomide with other agents might improve therapeutic outcome, efforts have also started to study whether altering the temozolomide molecule itself can increase its activity. One such approach permanently fused perillyl alcohol, a natural compound with demonstrated therapeutic activity in brain cancer patients, to the temozolomide molecule. The resultant novel compound, called NEO212 or TMZ-POH, revealed anticancer activity that was significantly greater than that of either of its two parent molecules, temozolomide and perillyl alcohol. Although as of 2016, NEO212 has not been tested in humans, it has shown superior cancer therapeutic activity in animal models of glioma, melanoma, and brain metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer. Because tumor cells that express the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene are more resistant to the effects of temozolomide, researchers investigated whether the inclusion of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG), an AGT inhibitor, could overcome this resistance and improve the drug's therapeutic effectiveness. In the laboratory, this combination indeed showed increased temozolomide activity in tumor-cell culture in vitro and in animal models in vivo. However, a recently completed phase-II clinical trial with brain-tumor patients yielded mixed outcomes; while there was some improved therapeutic activity when O6-BG and temozolomide were given to patients with temozolomide-resistant anaplastic glioma, there seemed to be no significant restoration of temozolomide sensitivity in patients with temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma multiforme. Some efforts focus on engineering hematopoietic stem cells expressing the MGMT gene prior to transplanting them into brain-tumor patients. This would allow for the patients to receive stronger doses of temozolomide, since the patient's hematopoietic cells would be resistant to the drug. High doses of temozolomide in high-grade gliomas have low toxicity, but the results are comparable to the standard doses. Two mechanisms of resistance to temozolomide effects have now been described: 1) intrinsic resistance conferred by MGMT deficiency (MGMTd) and 2) intrinsic or acquired resistance through MMR deficiency (MMRd). The MGMT enzyme is the first line of repair of mismatched bases created by temozolomide. Cells are normally MGMT proficient (MGMTp) as they have an unmethylated MGMT promoter allowing the gene to be expressed normally. In this state, temozolomide induced DNA damage is able to be efficiently repaired in tumor cells (and normal cells) by the active MGMT enzyme. Cells may grow and pass through the cell cycle normally without arrest or death. However, some tumors cells are MGMT deficient (MGMTd). This is most commonly due to abnormal methylation of the MGMT gene promoter and suppression of gene expression. MGMTd has also been described to occur by promoter rearrangement. In cells with MGMTd, DNA damage by temozolomide activates the next stage of repair in cells with a proficient Mismatch Repair enzyme complex (MMRp). In MMRp the MMR protein complex identifies the damage and causes cells to arrest and undergo death which inhibits tumor growth. However, if cells have combined MGMTd and MMR deficiency (MGMTd + MMRd) then cells retain the induced mutations and continue to cycle and are resistant to effects of temozolomide. In gliomas and other cancers MMRd has now been reported to occur as primary MMRd (intrinsic or germline Lynch bMMRd) or as secondary MMRd (acquired - not present in the original untreated tumor). The latter occurs after effective treatment and cytoreduction of tumors with temozolomide and then selection or induction of mutant MSH6, MSH2, MLH1, or PMS2 proteins and cells which are MMRd and temozolomide resistant. The latter is described as an acquired resistance pathway with hotspot mutations in glioma patients (MSH6 p.T1219I). == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Temozolomide (Temodal)"".

However, even broadly applied biotechnological workhorses, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, for which induction of recombinant gene expression commonly relies on the addition of appropriate inducer molecules, perform moderately in this respect. Light offers an alternative to accurately control gene expression, as it allows for simple triggering in a noninvasive fashion with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Thus, optogenetic switches are promising tools to improve the controllability of existing gene expression systems. In this regard, photocaged inducers, whose activities are initially inhibited by light-removable protection groups, represent one of the most valuable photoswitches for microbial gene expression. Here, we report on the evaluation of photocaged isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as a light-responsive control element for the frequently applied tac-based expression module in C. glutamicum In contrast to conventional IPTG, the photocaged inducer mediates a tightly controlled, strong, and homogeneous expression response upon short exposure to UV-A light. To further demonstrate the unique potential of photocaged IPTG for the optimization of production processes in C. glutamicum, the optogenetic switch was finally used to improve biosynthesis of the growth-inhibiting sesquiterpene (+)-valencene, a flavoring agent and aroma compound precursor in food industry. The variation in light intensity as well as the time point of light induction proved crucial for efficient production of this toxic compound. Optogenetic tools are light-responsive modules that allow for a simple triggering of cellular functions with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution and in a noninvasive fashion. Specifically, light-controlled gene expression exhibits an enormous potential for various synthetic bio(techno)logical purposes. Before our study, poor inducibility, together with phenotypic heterogeneity, was reported for the IPTG-mediated induction of lac-based gene expression in Corynebacterium glutamicum By applying photocaged IPTG as a synthetic inducer, however, these drawbacks could be almost completely abolished. Especially for increasing numbers of parallelized expression cultures, noninvasive and spatiotemporal light induction qualifies for a precise, homogeneous, and thus higher-order control to fully automatize or optimize future biotechnological applications. Conditional expression of a gene is a powerful tool to study its function and is typically achieved by placing the gene under the control of an inducible promoter. There is, however, a dearth of such inducible systems in Myxococcus xanthus, a well-studied prokaryotic model for multicellular development, cell differentiation, motility, and light response and a promising source of secondary metabolites. The few available systems have limitations, and exogenously based ones are unavailable. Here, we describe two new, versatile inducible systems for conditional expression of genes in M. xanthus. One employs isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as an inducer and is inspired by those successfully applied in some other bacteria. The other requires vanillate as an inducer and is based on the system developed originally for Caulobacter crescentus and recently adapted for mammalian cells. Both systems are robust, with essentially no expression in the absence of an inducer. Depending on the inducer and the amounts added, expression levels can be modulated such that either system can conditionally express genes, including ones that are essential and are required at high levels such as ftsZ. The two systems operate during vegetative growth as well as during M. xanthus development. Moreover, they can be used to simultaneously induce expression of distinct genes within the same cell. The conditional expression systems we describe substantially expand the genetic tool kit available for studying M. xanthus gene function and cellular biology. Inactivation of the Escherichia coli gene ydeA, which encodes a member of the major facilitator superfamily, decreased the efflux of L-arabinose, thereby affecting the expression of AraC-regulated genes. In addition, overexpression of ydeA decreased the expression of genes regulated by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside.",Isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.160275399684906)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.06224432960152626), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16050833463668823)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.006715370807796717), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

However, the benefits are limited due to the expansion of chondrocytes in monolayer culture, which causes loss of chondrocytic characters. Therefore, culture conditions that enhance chondrocytic characters are needed. We screened 5822 compounds and found that A-674563 enhanced the transcription of several chondrocyte marker genes, including Col2a1, Acan and Col11a2, in mouse primary chondrocytes. Experiments using cycloheximide, MG132 and bafilomycin A1 have revealed that Sox9 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that A-674563 inhibits this degradation, resulting in larger amount of Sox9 protein. RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis showed that A-674563 increases the expression of the gene that encodes ubiquitin-specific peptidase 29, which is known to induce the deubiquitination of proteins. Although the precise mechanism remains to be determined, our findings indicated that A-674563 could contribute to culture conditions that expand chondrocytes without losing chondrocytic characters. The present study aims to investigate the anti-melanoma activity by an Akt1 specific inhibitor A-674563. We showed that A-674563 was anti-proliferative and cytotoxic when added to human melanoma cells (A375, WM-115 and SK-Mel-2 lines). A-674563 induced caspase-dependent apoptotic death of human melanoma cells, and its cytotoxicity was inhibited with pre-treatment of caspase inhibitors. Further, A-674563 treatment blocked Akt and its downstream S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) activation in A375 melanoma cells. Significantly, restoring Akt-S6K1 activation via introduction of constitutively-active Akt1 (ca-Akt1) only partially attenuated A-674563's cytotoxicity against A375 cells. Further, A-674563 induced pro-apoptotic ceramide production in A375 cells. Significantly, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) inhibited A-674563-induced ceramide production and subsequent A375 cell apoptosis. On the other hand, co-treatment with the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor PDMP or the cell permeable short-chain ceramide (C6) potentiated A-674563's cytotoxicity against A375 cells. In vivo, A-674563 oral gavage inhibited A375 xenograft growth in severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mice. Akt inactivation, caspase-3 activation and ceramide production were also observed in A-674563-treated A375 xenografts. Together, these results suggest that A-674563 exerts potent anti-melanoma activity, involving Akt-dependent and Akt-independent mechanisms. AKT is a serine-threonine kinase implicated in tumorigenesis as a central regulator of cellular growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism. Activated AKT is commonly overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and accordingly AKT inhibitors are under clinical investigation for NSCLC treatment. Thus far, the AKT inhibitors being evaluated broadly target all three (1-3) AKT isoforms but recent evidence suggests opposing roles in lung tumorigenesis where loss of Akt1 inhibits while the loss of Akt2 enhances lung tumor development. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that selective inhibition of AKT-1 would be a more effective therapeutic strategy than pan-AKT inhibition for NSCLC treatment. Using six NSCLC cell lines, we found that the AKT-1 inhibitor, A-674563, was significantly more effective at reducing NSCLC cell survival relative to the pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206. Comparison of the downstream effects of the inhibitors suggests that altered cell cycle progression and off-target CDK2 inhibition are likely vital to the improved efficacy of A-674563 over MK-2206.",A 674563,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012356207298580557), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.038939692080020905), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06198834255337715)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.bertin-bioreagent.com/a-674563/,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/a-674563-cas-552325-73-2-cay18715-10,https://www.molnova.com/en/ProductsThr/A-674563.html ', [])"
1225,"('Bilirubin', 'Hematoidin', 'Hemetoidin', 'Principal bile pigment', 'Bilirubin ix-alpha')","Endogenous, Medical","Bilirubin (BR) (adopted from German, originally bili—bile—plus ruber—red—from Latin) is a red-orange compound that occurs in the normcomponent of the straw-yellow color in urine. Another breakdown product, stercobilin, causes the brown color of feces. Although bilirubin is usually found in animals rather than plants, at least one plant species, Strelitzia nicolai, is known to contain the pigment. == Structure == Bilirubin consists of an open-chain tetrapyrrole. It is formed by oxidative cleavage of a porphyrin in heme, which affords biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin. After conjugation with glucuronic acid, bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted. Bilirubin is structurally similar to the pigment phycobilin used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment phytochrome used by plants to sense light. All of these contain an open chain of four pyrrolic rings. Like these other pigments, some of the double-bonds in bilirubin isomerize when exposed to light. This isomerization is relevant to the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed. Increased solubility allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Some textbooks and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of bilirubin. The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer. == Function == Bilirubin is created by the activity of biliverdin reductase on biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Bilirubin, when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, in addition to the demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of bilirubin, has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin's main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant. Consistent with this, animal studies suggest that eliminating bilirubin results in endogenous oxidative stress. Bilirubin's antioxidant activity may be particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging superoxide during N-methyl-D-aspartic acid neurotransmission. == Metabolism == Bilirubin in plasma is mostly produced by the destruction of erythrocytes. Heme is metabolized into biliverdin (via heme oxygenase) and then into bilirubin (via biliverdin reductase) inside the macrophages. Bilirubin is then released into the plasma and transported to the liver bound by albumin, since it is insoluble in water in this state. In this state, bilirubin is called unconjugated (despite being bound by albumin). In the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is up-taken by the hepatocytes and subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid (via the enzyme uridine diphosphate–glucuronyl transferase). In this state, bilirubin is soluble in water and it is called conjugated bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into the bile ducts and enters the duodenum. During its transport to the colon, it is converted into urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Most of the urobilinogen is further reduced into stercobilinogen and is excreted through feces (air oxidizes stercobilinogen to stercobilin, which gives feces their characteristic brown color). A lesser amount of urobilinogen is re-absorbed into portal circulation and transferred to the liver. For the most part, this urobilinogen is recycled to conjugated bilirubin and this process closes the enterohepatic circle. There is also an amount of urobilinogen which is not recycled, but rather enters the systemic circulation and subsequently the kidneys, where it is excreted. Air oxidizes urobilinogen into urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic color. In parallel, a small amount of conjugated billirubin can also enter the systemic circulation and get excreted through urine. This is exaggerated in various pathological situations. == Toxicity == === Hyperbilirubinemia === Hyperbilirubinemia is a higher-than-normal level of bilirubin in the blood. Hyperbilirubinemia may refer to increased levels of conjugated, unconjugated or both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The causes of hyperbilirubinemia can also be classified into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. Prehepatic causes are associated mostly with an increase of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. They include: Hemolysis or increased breakdown of red blood cells (for example hematoma resorption) Intrahepatic causes can be associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin or both. They include: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, where the newborn's liver is not able to properly process the bilirubin causing jaundice Hepatocellular disease Viral infections (hepatitis A, B, and C) Chronic alcohol use Autoimmune disorders Genetic syndromes: Gilbert's syndrome – a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population Rotor syndrome: non-itching jaundice, with rise of bilirubin in the patient's serum, mainly of the conjugated type Dubin–Johnson syndrome Crigler–Najjar syndrome Pharmaceutical drugs (especially antipsychotic, some sex hormones, and a wide range of other drugs) Sulfonamides are contraindicated in infants less than 2 months old (exception when used with pyrimethamine in treating toxoplasmosis) as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to kernicterus. Drugs such as protease inhibitors like Indinavir can also cause disorders of bilirubin metabolism by competitively inhibiting the UGT1A1 enzyme. Post-hepatic causes are associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin. These include: Unusually large bile duct obstruction, e.g. gallstone in common bile duct (which is the most common post-hepatic cause) Biliary stricture (benign or malignant) Cholangitis Severe liver failure with cirrhosis (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis) Pancreatitis Cirrhosis may cause normal, moderately high or high levels of bilirubin, depending on exact features of the cirrhosis. To further elucidate the causes of jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler to look at other liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (hemolysis, etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.). ==== Jaundice ==== Hemoglobin acts to transport oxygen which the body receives to all body tissue via blood vessels. Over time, when red blood cells need to be replenished, the hemoglobin is broken down in the spleen; it breaks down into two parts: heme group consisting of iron and bile, and protein fraction. While protein and iron are utilized to renew red blood cells, pigments that make up the red color in blood are deposited into the bile to form bilirubin. Jaundice leads to raised bilirubin levels> that in turn negatively remove elastin-rich tissues. Jaundice may be noticeable in the sclera of the eyes at levels of about 2 to 3 mg/dl (34 to 51 μmol/L), and in the skin at higher levels. Jaundice is classified, depending upon whether the bilirubin is free or conjugated to glucuronic acid, into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice. ==== Kernicterus ==== Unbound bilirubin (Bf) levels can be used to predict the risk of neurodevelopmental handicaps within infants. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a newborn can lead to accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions that may lead to hyperbilirubinemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the feces (this is largely why the feces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation. In addition, recent studies point towards high total bilirubin levels as a cause for gallstones regardless of gender or age. == Health benefits == In the absence of liver disease, high levels of total bilirubin confers various health benefits. Studies have also revealed that levels of serum bilirubin (SBR) are inversely related to risk of certain heart diseases. While the poor solubility and potential toxicity of bilirubin limit its potential medicinal applications, current research is being done on whether bilirubin encapsulated silk fibrin nanoparticles can alleviate symptoms of disorders such as acute pancreatitis. In addition to this, there have been recent discoveries linking bilirubin and its ε-polylysine-bilirubin conjugate (PLL-BR), to more efficient insulin medication. It seems that bilirubin exhibits protective properties during the islet transplantation process when drugs are delivered throughout the bloodstream. == Blood tests == Bilirubin is degraded by light. Blood collection tubes containing blood or (especially) serum to be used in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination. For adults, blood is typically collected by needle from a vein in the arm. In newborns, blood is often collected from a heel stick, a technique that uses a small, sharp blade to cut the skin on the infant's heel and collect a few drops of blood into a small tube. Non-invasive technology is available in some health care facilities that will measure bilirubin by using a bilirubinometer which shines light onto the skin and calculates the amount of bilirubin by analysing how the light is absorbed or reflected. This device is also known as a transcutaneous bilirubin meter. Bilirubin (in blood) is found in two forms: Note: Conjugated bilirubin is often incorrectly called ""direct bilirubin"" and unconjugated bilirubin is incorrectly called ""indirect bilirubin"". Direct and indirect refer solely to how compounds are measured or detected in solution. Direct bilirubin is any form of bilirubin which is water-soluble and is available in solution to react with assay reagents; direct bilirubin is often made up largely of conjugated bilirubin, but some unconjugated bilirubin (up to 25%) can still be part of the ""direct"" bilirubin fraction. Likewise, not all conjugated bilirubin is readily available in solution for reaction or detection (for example, if it is hydrogen bonding with itself) and therefore would not be included in the direct bilirubin fraction. Total bilirubin (TBIL) measures both BU and BC. Total bilirubin assays work by using surfactants and accelerators (like caffeine) to bring all of the different bilirubin forms into solution where they can react with assay reagents. Total and direct bilirubin levels can be measured from the blood, but indirect bilirubin is calculated from the total and direct bilirubin. Indirect bilirubin is fat-soluble and direct bilirubin is water-soluble. === Total bilirubin === Total bilirubin = direct bilirubin + indirect bilirubin Elevation of both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin is more indicative of serious liver injury than is elevation in ALT alone, as postulated in Hy's law that elucidates the relation between the lab test results and drug-induced liver injury === Indirect (unconjugated) === The measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is underestimated by measurement of indirect bilirubin, as unconjugated bilirubin (without/yet glucuronidation) reacts with diazosulfanilic acid to create azobilirubin which is measured as direct bilirubin. === Direct === Direct bilirubin = Conjugated bilirubin + delta bilirubin ==== Conjugated ==== In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, first to bilirubin glucuronide and then to bilirubin diglucuronide, making it soluble in water: the conjugated version is the main form of bilirubin present in the ""direct"" bilirubin fraction. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Though most bile acid is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum to participate in enterohepatic circulation, conjugated bilirubin is not absorbed and instead passes into the colon. There, colonic bacteria deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless urobilinogen, which can be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys to give urine its yellow color and stercobilin is excreted in the feces giving stool its characteristic brown color. A trace (~1%) of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation to be re-excreted in the bile. Conjugated bilirubin's half-life is shorter than delta bilirubin. ==== Delta bilirubin ==== Although the terms direct and indirect bilirubin are sometimes used interchangeably with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, the direct fraction actually includes both conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin. Delta bilirubin is albumin-bound conjugated bilirubin. In the other words, delta bilirubin is the kind of bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in the serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease. Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate conjugated bilirubin levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin). δ bilirubin = total bilirubin – (unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin) ===== Half-life ===== The half-life of delta bilirubin is equivalent to that of albumin since the former is bound to the latter, yields 2–3 weeks. A free-of-bound bilirubin has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. === Measurement methods === Originally, the Van den Bergh reaction was used for a qualitative estimate of bilirubin. This test is performed routinely in most medical laboratories and can be measured by a variety of methods. Total bilirubin is now often measured by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct bilirubin is often measured by the method of Jendrassik and Grof. == Blood levels == The bilirubin level found in the body reflects the balance between production and excretion. Blood test results are advised to always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test. The SI units are μmol/L. Typical ranges for adults are: 0–0.3 mg/dl – Direct (conjugated) bilirubin level 0.1–1.2 mg/dl – Total serum bilirubin level == Urine tests == Urine bilirubin may also be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice. As with billirubin, under normal circumstances, only a very small amount of urobilinogen is excreted in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, some of the conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase of urobilinogen in the urine. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems. == History == In ancient history, Hippocrates discussed bile pigments in two of the four humours in the context of a relationship between yellow and black biles. Hippocrates visited Democritus in Abdera who was regarded as the expert in melancholy ""black bile"". Relevant documentation emerged in 1827 when M. Louis Jacques Thénard examined the biliary tract of an elephant that had died at a Paris zoo. He observed dilated bile ducts were full of yellow magma, which he isolated and found to be insoluble in water. Treating the yellow pigment with hydrochloric acid produced a strong green color. Thenard suspected the green pigment was caused by impurities derived from mucus of bile. Leopold Gmelin experimented with nitric acid in 1826 to establish the redox behavior in change from bilirubin to biliverdin, although the nomenclature did not exist at the time. The term biliverdin was coined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1840, although he preferred ""bilifulvin"" (yellow/red) over ""bilirubin"" (red). The term ""bilirubin"" was thought to have become mainstream based on the works of Staedeler in 1864 who crystallized bilirubin from cattle gallstones. Rudolf Virchow in 1847 recognized hematoidin to be identical to bilirubin. It is not always distinguished from hematoidin, which one modern dictionary defines as synonymous with it but another defines as ""apparently chemically identical with bilirubin but with a different site of origin, formed locally in the tissues from hemoglobin, particularly under conditions of reduced oxygen tension."" The synonymous identity of bilirubin and hematoidin was confirmed in 1923 by Fischer and Steinmetz using analytical crystallography. In the 1930s, significant advances in bilirubin isolation and synthesis were described by Hans Fischer, Plieninger, and others, and pioneering work pertaining to endogenous formation of bilirubin from heme was likewise conducted in the same decade. The suffix IXα is partially based on a system developed Fischer, which means the bilin's parent compound was protoporphyrin IX cleaved at the alpha-methine bridge (see protoporphyrin IX nomenclature). Origins pertaining to the physiological activity of bilirubin were described by Ernst Stadelmann in 1891, who may have observed the biotransformation of infused hemoglobin into bilirubin possibly inspired by Ivan Tarkhanov's 1874 works. Georg Barkan suggested the source of endogenous bilirubin to be from hemoglobin in 1932. Plieninger and Fischer demonstrated an enzymatic oxidative loss of the alpha-methine bridge of heme resulting in a bis-lactam structure in 1942. It is widely accepted that Irving London was the first to demonstrate endogenous formation of bilirubin from hemoglobin in 1950, and Sjostrand demonstrated hemoglobin catabolism produces carbon monoxide between 1949 and 1952. 14C labeled protoporphyrin biotransformation to bilirubin evidence emerged in 1966 by Cecil Watson. Rudi Schmid and Tenhunen discovered heme oxygenase, the enzyme responsible, in 1968. Earlier in 1963, Nakajima described a soluble ""heme alpha-methnyl oxygeanse"" which what later determined to be a non-enzymatic pathway, such as formation of a 1,2-Dioxetane intermediate at the methine bridge resulting in carbon monoxide release and biliverdin formation. == Notable people == Claudio Tiribelli, Italian hepatologist, studies on bilirubin == See also == Babesiosis Biliary atresia Bilirubin diglucuronide Biliverdin Crigler–Najjar syndrome Gilbert's syndrome, a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population.

1228,"('Febuxostat', 'Adenuric', 'Uloric', 'Feburic', 'Tei-6720')",Medical,"Febuxostat, sold under the brand name Uloric among others, is a medication used long-term to treat gout due to high uric acid levels. It is generally recommended only for people who cannot take allopurinol. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include liver problems, nausea, joint pain, and a rash. Serious side effects include an increased risk of death as compared with allopurinol, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and anaphylaxis. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It inhibits xanthine oxidase, thus reducing production of uric acid in the body. Febuxostat was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2008, and in the United States in 2009. A generic version was approved in 2019. == Medical uses == Febuxostat is used to treat chronic gout and hyperuricemia. Febuxostat is typically recommended only for people who cannot tolerate allopurinol. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence concluded that febuxostat is more effective than standard doses of allopurinol, but not more effective than higher doses of allopurinol. == Side effects == The adverse effects associated with febuxostat therapy include nausea, diarrhea, arthralgia, headache, increased hepatic serum enzyme levels and rash. In November 2017, the FDA issued a safety alert indicating that the preliminary results from a safety clinical trial showed an increased risk of heart-related death with febuxostat compared to allopurinol in people with a history of cardiovascular diseases. The FDA required Takeda to conduct this safety study when the medicine was approved in 2009. The febuxostat drug labels already carry a warning and precaution about cardiovascular events because the clinical trials conducted before approval showed a higher rate of heart-related problems in patients treated with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. These problems included heart attacks, strokes, and heart-related deaths. As a result, the FDA required an additional safety clinical trial after the drug was approved and on the market to better understand these differences, and that trial was finished recently. The safety trial was conducted in over 6,000 patients with gout treated with either febuxostat or allopurinol. The primary outcome was a combination of heart-related death, non-deadly heart attack, non-deadly stroke, and a condition of inadequate blood supply to the heart requiring urgent surgery. The preliminary results show that overall, febuxostat did not increase the risk of these combined events compared to allopurinol. However, when the outcomes were evaluated separately, febuxostat showed an increased risk of heart-related deaths and death from all causes. == Drug interactions == Febuxostat is contraindicated with concomitant use of theophylline and chemotherapeutic agents, namely azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, because it could increase blood plasma concentrations of these drugs and thereby their toxicity. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Febuxostat is a non-purine-selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. It works by non-competitively blocking the molybdenum pterin center, which is the active site of xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is needed to oxidize successively hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Thus, febuxostat inhibits xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing production of uric acid. Febuxostat inhibits both the oxidized and the reduced forms of xanthine oxidase by virtue of its tight binding to the molybdenum pterin site. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral intake, at least 84% of the febuxostat dose is absorbed in the gut, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after 60 to 90 minutes. When taken together with a fatty meal, febuxostat reaches lower concentrations in the body; but this is not considered clinically relevant. When in the bloodstream, 99.2% of the substance is bound to the plasma protein albumin, and 82–91% of the active metabolites are bound to plasma proteins. Febuxostat has three active metabolites in humans, which are formed mainly by a number of cytochrome P450 liver enzymes (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 2C9). One of them is a dicarboxylic acid, the other two are hydroxylated derivatives. These, as well as the original drug, are further glucuronidated, mainly by the enzymes UGT1A1, 1A8, and 1A9. Febuxostat and its metabolites are eliminated via the urine (49% of the total substance, comprising 3% unchanged febuxostat, 30% febuxostat glucuronide, 13% active metabolites and their glucuronides, and 3% unknown entities) and via the faeces (45%, of which 12% unchanged febuxostat, 1% glucuronide, 25% active metabolites and their glucuronides, and 7% unknown entities). Elimination half-life is five to eight hours. == History == Febuxostat was discovered by scientists at the Japanese pharmaceutical company Teijin in 1998. Teijin partnered the drug with TAP Pharmaceuticals in the US and Ipsen in Europe. Ipsen obtained marketing approval for febuxostat from the European Medicines Agency in April 2008, Takeda obtained FDA approval in February 2009, and Teijin obtained approval from the Japanese authorities in 2011. Ipsen exclusively licensed its European rights to Menarini in 2009. Teijin partnered with Astellas for distribution in China and southeast Asia. == Society and culture == === Economics === In the UK, NICE has found that febuxostat has a higher cost/benefit ratio than allopurinol and on that basis recommended febuxostat as a second-line drug for people who cannot use allopurinol. In 2010, before it became generic in the United States, it cost about US$160 per month as opposed to allopurinol which was about $14 per month. === Brand names === Febuxostat is marketed as Adenuric in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan. In Pakistan it is launched by SOLACE Pharmaceuticals a sister subsidiary of SJG, Uloric in the US, Goturic and Goutex in Latin America, Feburic in Japan, Donifoxate in Egypt and is generic in several countries and is available by many names in those countries. == References ==",Uloric,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.629365427419543e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002733095607254654)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/uloric.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=75, start_index=9, title='Uloric: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/uloric.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an efficient, economical, and orally effective Fe chelator. Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) is a tridentate Fe-chelating agent that shows high Fe chelation efficacy both in vitro in cell culture models and also in vivo in rats and mice. In addition, this chelator is relatively nontoxic, economical to synthesize, and orally effective, and it shows high selectivity and affinity for Fe. However, over the last 10 years the development of PIH and its analogs has largely been ignored because of justifiable interest in other ligands such as 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1). Unfortunately, recent clinical trials have shown that significant complications occur with L1 therapy, and it is controversial whether this chelator is effective at reducing hepatic Fe levels in patients. Because of the current lack of a clinically useful Fe chelator to replace DFO, PIH and its analogs appear to be potential candidate compounds that warrant further investigation. In this review we will discuss the studies that have been performed to characterize these chelators at the chemical and biologic levels as effective agents for treating Fe overload.

Investigation into the use of parent nucleotide analog remdesivir (GS-5734) is needed. To assess efficacy and tolerability of remdesivir with or without transition to GS-441524 in cats with FIP and document clinical and clinicopathologic progression over 6 months. Twenty-eight client-owned cats with FIP. Cats were prospectively recruited between May 2021 and May 2022. An induction dosage of remdesivir 10 to 15 mg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously q24h was utilized for 4 doses, with a maintenance dosage of remdesivir (6-15 mg/kg SC) or GS-441524 (10-15 mg/kg per os) every 24 hours continued for at least 84 days. Laboratory testing, veterinary, and owner assessments were recorded. Twenty-four cats survived to 6 months (86%). Three cats died within 48 hours. Excluding these, survival from 48 hours to 6 months was 96% (24/25). Remission was achieved by day 84 in 56% (14/25). Three cats required secondary treatment for re-emergent FIP. Remission was achieved in all 3 after higher dosing (15-20 mg/kg). Adverse reactions were occasional site discomfort and skin irritation with remdesivir injection. Markers of treatment success included resolution of pyrexia, effusions, and presenting signs of FIP in the first half of treatment and normalization of globulin concentration, and continued body weight gains in the latter half of the treatment period. Parenteral administration of remdesivir and oral administration of GS-441524 are effective and well-tolerated treatments for FIP. Early emphasis on clinical, and later emphasis on clinicopathologic response, appears prudent when monitoring treatment efficacy. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a serious disease that arises due to feline coronavirus infection. The nucleoside analogues remdesivir and GS-441524 can be effective in its treatment, but most studies have used unregulated products of unknown composition. The aim of the present study was to describe the treatment of FIP using legally sourced veterinary-prescribed regulated veterinary compounded products containing known amounts of remdesivir (injectable) or GS-441524 (oral tablets). Cats were recruited via email advice services, product sales contacts and study publicity. Cats were excluded if they were deemed unlikely to have FIP, were not treated exclusively with the veterinary compounded products, or if there was a lack of cat and/or treatment (including response) data. Extensive cat and treatment data were collected. Among the 307 cats recruited, the predominant type of FIP was most commonly abdominal effusive (49.5%) and then neurological (14.3%). Three treatment protocols were used; remdesivir alone (33.9%), remdesivir followed by GS-441524 (55.7%) and GS-441524 alone (10.4%). The median (range) initial treatment period duration and longest follow-up time point after starting treatment were 84 (1-330) days and 248 (1-814) days, respectively. The most common side effect was injection pain (in 47.8% of those given subcutaneous remdesivir). Of the 307 cats, 33 (10.8%) relapsed, 15 (45.5%) during and 18 (54.5%) after the initial treatment period. At the longest follow-up time point after completion of the initial treatment period, 84.4% of cats were alive. The cats achieving a complete response within 30 days of starting treatment were significantly more likely to be alive at the end of the initial treatment period than those cats that did not. Legally sourced remdesivir and GS-441524 products, either alone or used sequentially, were very effective in the treatment of FIP in this group of cats. Variable protocols precluded statistical comparison of treatment regimens. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common and highly lethal coronavirus disease of domestic cats. Recent studies of diseases caused by several RNA viruses in people and other species indicate that antiviral therapy may be effective against FIP in cats. The small molecule nucleoside analog GS-441524 is a molecular precursor to a pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate molecule. These analogs act as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. We determined that GS-441524 was non-toxic in feline cells at concentrations as high as 100 uM and effectively inhibited FIPV replication in cultured CRFK cells and in naturally infected feline peritoneal macrophages at concentrations as low as 1 uM. We determined the pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 in cats in vivo and established a dosage that would sustain effective blood levels for 24 h. In an experimental FIPV infection of cats, GS-441524 treatment caused a rapid reversal of disease signs and return to normality with as little as two weeks of treatment in 10/10 cats and with no apparent toxicity.",Gs 441524,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5760523676872253)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008699257858097553), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023281551897525787)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01416350994259119), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS-441524?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='GS-441524', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS-441524?utm_source=openai')])"

The change in the nature of the emission spectra is explained by the formation of hydrophobic stoichiometric and sub-stoichiometric reagent-surfactant associates. Stabilization of the colloid-chemical state and reduction of the total turbidity of rhodamine 6G-anionic surfactant associate solutions with the addition of nonionic surfactant as a modifier were registered. The method of modification of the rhodamine 6G-sodium hexadecyl sulfate system with a nonionic surfactant was used in the development of conditions for the fluorescence determination of protein substances in physiological solutions. The concentration conditions for the use of the modified reagent system rhodamine 6G-anionic surfactant-nonionic surfactant for the fluorescence determination of albumin in urine were optimized. The involvement of G-quadruplex (G4) structures in nucleic acids in various molecular processes in cells such as replication, gene-pausing, the expression of crucial cancer-related genes and DNA damage repair is well known. The compounds targeting G4 usually bind directly to the G4 structure, but some ligands can also facilitate the G4 folding of unfolded G-rich sequences and stabilize them even without the presence of monovalent ions such as sodium or potassium. Interestingly, some G4-ligand complexes can show a clear induced CD signal, a feature which is indirect proof of the ligand interaction. Based on the dichroic spectral profile it is not only possible to confirm the presence of a G4 structure but also to determine its topology. In this study we examine the potential of the commercially available Rhodamine 6G (RhG) as a G4 ligand. RhG tends to convert antiparallel G4 structures to parallel forms in a manner similar to that of Thiazole Orange. Our results confirm the very high selectivity of this ligand to the G4 structure. Moreover, the parallel topology of G4 can be verified unambiguously based on the specific induced CD profile of the G4-RhG complex. This feature has been verified on more than 50 different DNA sequences forming various non-canonical structural motifs. Ring-opening reaction of rhodamine spirolactam has been widely applied to construct fluorescent probes. The fluorescence properties of the probe were finely tuned for specific purpose through changing the rhodamine fluorophore. However, the influence on response range and kinetic parameters of the probe during the change has been seldom discussed.

Habitual food consumption was assessed using three 24-h dietary recalls. Associations between plasma metabolites concentrations and meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products consumption were assessed by fitting generalized linear model, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Total meat intake was associated with plasma concentrations of anserine, carnosine, Π-MH and, the ratio of T-MH to Π-MH.

1235,"('Geneticin sulfate', 'Antibiotic g-418 sulfate', 'Geneticin', 'Antibiotic g 418', 'Antibiotic g-418')",Medical,"G418 (geneticin) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic similar in structure to gentamicin B1. It is produced by Micromonospora rhodorangea. G418 blocks polypeptide synthesis by inhibiting the elongation step in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Resistance to G418 is conferred by the neo gene from Tn5 encoding an aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase, APT 3' II. G418 is an analog of neomycin sulfate, and has similar mechanism as neomycin. G418 is commonly used in laboratory research to select genetically engineered cells . In general, for bacteria and algae, concentrations of 5 μg/mL or less are used; for mammalian cells, concentrations of approximately 400 μg/mL are used for selection and 200 μg/mL for maintenance. However, optimal concentration for resistant clones selection in mammalian cells depends on the cell line used as well as on the plasmid carrying the resistance gene. Therefore, antibiotic titration should be done to find the best condition for every experimental system. Titration should be done using antibiotic concentrations ranging from 100 μg/mL up to 1400 μg/mL. Resistant clones selection could require from 1 to up to 3 weeks. == G418 impurity profile == G418 is produced by fermentation and isolation processes and the G418 producing strain Micromonospora rhodorangea produces many other gentamicins while producing G418. The common impurities of G418 include gentamicins A, C1, C1a, C2, C2a and X2. The quality of G418 is not based on just the potency, but more on the selectivity defined by the killing curve of the sensitive cells vs the resistant cells. A good G418 product has the lowest LD50 for sensitive cells (such as NIH 3T3) and the highest LD50 (can be up to 5,000 μg/ml) for resistant cells (NIH 3T3 transfected with resistant genes). Gentamicins have almost no selectivity, except gentamicin X2. == Use in cell biology == G418 is routinely used as a selective agent in cell culture set-ups. Researchers can link the neoR selective resistance gene with their vector. Then if the vector is successfully introduced into cells, the cells can become G418-resistant cells. After treating with G418, these vector(-) cells will die, while vector(+) cells will survive. This method can help researchers select vector(+) cells. == Mechanism of action == G418 Disulfate and other aminoglycosides prevent protein synthesis at the early stages of elongation, post-initiation, initiation of translation. Resistance to G418 Disulfate is conferred by the Neomycin resistance gene (neo) from either Tn5 or Tn601 (903) transposons. Cells transfected with resistance plasmids containing the neo gene can express aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (APT 3' I or APT 3' II) which covalently modifies G418 to 3-phosphoric G418, which has negligible potency and has low-affinity for prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. == References ==",Geneticin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.018165044486522675), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.1698768138885498), ('DU', 0.0), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2520895302295685)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.029807081446051598), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

1237,"('Aspirin', 'Acetylsalicylic acid', 'O-acetylsalicylic acid', 'O-acetoxybenzoic acid', 'Acylpyrin')",Medical,"Aspirin () is the genericized trademark for acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation, and as an antithrombotic. Specific inflammatory conditions that aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets. One common adverse effect is an upset stomach. More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears. A precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree (genus Salix) has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. Over the next 50 years, other chemists, mostly of the German company Bayer, established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods.: 69–75 Felix Hoffmann (or Arthur Eichengrün) of Bayer was the first to produce acetylsalicylic acid in a pure, stable form in 1897. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it globally.: 27 Aspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions. It is one of the most widely used medications globally, with an estimated 40,000 tonnes (44,000 tons) (50 to 120 billion pills) consumed each year, and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 36th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 16 million prescriptions. == Brand vs. generic name == In 1897, scientists at the Bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines.: 69–75 By 1899, Bayer had named it ""Aspirin"" and was selling it around the world. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the 20th century, leading to competition between many brands and formulations. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, its rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. The name is ultimately a blend of the prefix a(cetyl) + spir Spiraea, the meadowsweet plant genus from which the acetylsalicylic acid was originally derived at Bayer + -in, the common chemical suffix. == Chemical properties == Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate. Like flour mills, factories producing aspirin tablets must control the amount of the powder that becomes airborne inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5 mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5 mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993. === Synthesis === The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly demonstrated in undergraduate teaching labs. Reaction between acetic acid and salicylic acid can also form aspirin but this esterification reaction is reversible and the presence of water can lead to hydrolysis of the aspirin. So, an anhydrous reagent is preferred. Reaction mechanism Formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and acetic acids. == Physical properties == Aspirin, an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance that melts at 136 °C (277 °F), and decomposes around 140 °C (284 °F). Its acid dissociation constant (pKa) is 3.5 at 25 °C (77 °F). === Polymorphism === Polymorphism, or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. Until 2005, there was only one proven polymorph of aspirin (Form I), though the existence of another polymorph was debated since the 1960s, and one report from 1981 reported that when crystallized in the presence of aspirin anhydride, the diffractogram of aspirin has weak additional peaks. Though at the time it was dismissed as mere impurity, it was, in retrospect, Form II aspirin. Form II was reported in 2005, found after attempted co-crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. In form I, pairs of aspirin molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds. In form II, each aspirin molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds, but with two neighbouring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures. The aspirin polymorphs contain identical 2-dimensional sections and are therefore more precisely described as polytypes. Pure Form II aspirin could be prepared by seeding the batch with aspirin anhydrate in 15% weight. Form III was reported in 2015 by compressing form I above 2 GPa, but it reverts back to Form I when pressure is removed. Form IV was reported in 2017. It is stable at ambient conditions. == Mechanism of action == === Discovery of the mechanism === In 1971, British pharmacologist John Robert Vane, then employed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, jointly with Sune Bergström and Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson. === Prostaglandins and thromboxanes === Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme (Suicide inhibition). This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition. Prostaglandins, local hormones produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction. === COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition === At least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified COX-2 (aka prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 or PTGS2) produces epi-lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only COX-2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Several COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been withdrawn from the market, after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express COX-2, and, by selectively inhibiting COX-2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as COX-1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX-1 once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference as compared with reversible inhibitors. Furthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins, converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin-triggered lipoxins(15-epilipoxin-A4/B4), aspirin-triggered resolvins, and aspirin-triggered maresins. These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin. === Additional mechanisms === Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signalling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation. Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin. == Formulations == Aspirin is produced in many formulations, with some differences in effect. In particular, aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, and formulations are sought which deliver the benefits of aspirin while mitigating harmful bleeding. Formulations may be combined (e.g., buffered + vitamin C). Tablets, typically of about 75–100 mg and 300–320 mg of immediate-release aspirin (IR-ASA). Dispersible tablets. Enteric-coated tablets. Buffered formulations containing aspirin with one of many buffering agents. Formulations of aspirin with vitamin C (ASA-VitC) A phospholipid-aspirin complex liquid formulation, PL-ASA. As of 2023 the phospholipid coating was being trialled to determine if it caused less gastrointestinal damage. == Pharmacokinetics == Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionized. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion. About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to human serum albumin, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates. As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important. Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination. It was found that short-term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute kidney injury when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis. Aspirin for some patients with chronic kidney disease and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated. == History == Medicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer as well as the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt.: 8–13 Hippocrates referred to the use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and willow bark preparations were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain, and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century after the Rev Edward Stone of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, noticed that the bitter taste of willow bark resembled the taste of the bark of the cinchona tree, known as ""Peruvian bark"", which was used successfully in Peru to treat a variety of ailments. Stone experimented with preparations of powdered willow bark on people in Chipping Norton for five years and found it to be as effective as Peruvian bark and a cheaper domestic version. In 1763 he sent a report of his findings to the Royal Society in London. By the nineteenth century, pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid, the active component of willow extract.: 46–55 In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time;: 46–48 in the second half of the 19th century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it.: 69–75 That year, Felix Hoffmann (or Arthur Eichengrün) of Bayer was the first to produce acetylsalicylic acid in a pure, stable form. Salicylic acid had been extracted in 1838 from the herb meadowsweet, whose German name, Spirsäure, was the basis for naming the newly synthesized drug, which, by 1899, Bayer was selling globally.: 46–55 : 27 The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the 20th century, leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products. Aspirin's popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects,: 226–231 while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases.: 247–257 The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and US federal law, and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the 20th century, and remain strong in the 21st century with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.: 267–269 === Trademark === Bayer lost its trademark for Aspirin in the United States and some other countries in actions taken between 1918 and 1921 because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of ""Aspirin"" by other manufacturers without defending the intellectual property rights. Today, aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries. Aspirin, with a capital ""A"", remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each. === Compendial status === United States Pharmacopeia British Pharmacopoeia == Medical use == Aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease, but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy. There is evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. === Pain === Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain, although it is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain. Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain types of a headache, but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider. Among primary headaches, the International Classification of Headache Disorders distinguishes between tension headache (the most common), migraine, and cluster headache. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headaches. Aspirin, especially as a component of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning. === Fever === Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of COX. Although aspirin's use as an antipyretic in adults is well established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Food and Drug Administration, strongly advise against using aspirin for the treatment of fever in children because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection. Because of the risk of Reye's syndrome in children, in 1986, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required labeling on all aspirin-containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers. === Inflammation === Aspirin is used as an anti-inflammatory agent for both acute and long-term inflammation, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. === Heart attacks and strokes === Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a heart attack. It is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems, including those over the age of 70. The 2009 Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration published in Lancet evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin in secondary prevention. In those with prior ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction, daily low dose aspirin was associated with a 19% relative risk reduction of serious cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death). This did come at the expense of a 0.19% absolute risk increase in gastrointestinal bleeding; however, the benefits outweigh the hazard risk in this case. Data from previous trials have suggested that weight-based dosing of aspirin has greater benefits in primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes. However, more recent trials were not able to replicate similar outcomes using low dose aspirin in low body weight (<70 kg) in specific subset of population studied i.e. elderly and diabetic population, and more evidence is required to study the effect of high dose aspirin in high body weight (≥70 kg). After percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), such as the placement of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Duration of DAPT was advised in the United States and European Union guidelines after the CURE and PRODIGY studies. In 2020, the systematic review and network meta-analysis from Khan et al. showed promising benefits of short-term (< 6 months) DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors in selected patients, as well as the benefits of extended-term (> 12 months) DAPT in high risk patients. In conclusion, the optimal duration of DAPT after PCIs should be personalized after outweighing each patient's risks of ischemic events and risks of bleeding events with consideration of multiple patient-related and procedure-related factors. Moreover, aspirin should be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete. The status of the use of aspirin for the primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is conflicting and inconsistent, with recent changes from previously recommending it widely decades ago, and that some referenced newer trials in clinical guidelines show less of benefit of adding aspirin alongside other anti-hypertensive and cholesterol lowering therapies. The ASCEND study demonstrated that in high-bleeding risk diabetics with no prior cardiovascular disease, there is no overall clinical benefit (12% decrease in risk of ischaemic events v/s 29% increase in GI bleeding) of low dose aspirin in preventing the serious vascular events over a period of 7.4 years. Similarly, the results of the ARRIVE study also showed no benefit of same dose of aspirin in reducing the time to first cardiovascular outcome in patients with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease over a period of five years. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin. As of April 2022, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) determined that there was a ""small net benefit"" for patients aged 40–59 with a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and ""no net benefit"" for patients aged over 60. Determining the net benefit was based on balancing the risk reduction of taking aspirin for heart attacks and ischaemic strokes, with the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic strokes. Their recommendations state that age changes the risk of the medicine, with the magnitude of the benefit of aspirin coming from starting at a younger age, while the risk of bleeding, while small, increases with age, particular for adults over 60, and can be compounded by other risk factors such as diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. As a result, the USPSTF suggests that ""people ages 40 to 59 who are at higher risk for CVD should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin; people 60 or older should not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke."" Primary prevention guidelines from September 2019 made by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association state they might consider aspirin for patients aged 40–69 with a higher risk of atherosclerotic CVD, without an increased bleeding risk, while stating they would not recommend aspirin for patients aged over 70 or adults of any age with an increased bleeding risk. They state a CVD risk estimation and a risk discussion should be done before starting on aspirin, while stating aspirin should be used ""infrequently in the routine primary prevention of (atherosclerotic CVD) because of lack of net benefit"". As of August 2021, the European Society of Cardiology made similar recommendations; considering aspirin specifically to patients aged less than 70 at high or very high CVD risk, without any clear contraindications, on a case-by-case basis considering both ischemic risk and bleeding risk. === Cancer prevention === Aspirin may reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. There is substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but aspirin must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and prostate cancer. Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. Nine years later however, the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg/day) ""for the primary prevention of CVD [cardiovascular disease] and CRC in adults 50 to 59 years of age who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years"". A meta-analysis through 2019 said that there was an association between taking aspirin and lower risk of cancer of the colorectum, esophagus, and stomach. In 2021, the U.S. Preventive services Task Force raised questions about the use of aspirin in cancer prevention. It notes the results of the 2018 ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) Trial, in which the risk of cancer-related death was higher in the aspirin-treated group than in the placebo group. In 2025, a group of scientists at the University of Cambridge found that aspirin stimulates the immune system to reduce cancer metastasis. They found that a protein called ARHGEF1 suppresses T cells, that are required for attacking metastatic cancer cells. Aspirin appeared to counteract this suppression by targeting a clotting factor called thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which activates ARHGEF1, thus preventing it from suppressing the T cells. The researchers called the discovery a ""Eureka moment"". It was reported that the findings could lead to a more targeted use for aspirin in cancer research. It was also said that taking self-medicating with aspirin should not be done yet due to its potential side effects until clinical trials were held. === Psychiatry === ==== Bipolar disorder ==== Aspirin, along with several other agents with anti-inflammatory properties, has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorders. A 2022 systematic review concluded that aspirin exposure reduced the risk of depression in a pooled cohort of three studies (HR 0.624, 95% CI: 0.0503, 1.198, P=0.033). However, further high-quality, longer-duration, double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine whether aspirin is an effective add-on treatment for bipolar depression. Thus, notwithstanding the biological rationale, the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain. ==== Dementia ==== Although cohort and longitudinal studies have shown low-dose aspirin has a greater likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia, numerous randomized controlled trials have not validated this. ==== Schizophrenia ==== Some researchers have speculated the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin may be beneficial for schizophrenia. Small trials have been conducted but evidence remains lacking. === Other uses === Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment. Along with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness. Low-dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy. Aspirin has also demonstrated anti-tumoral effects, via inhibition of the PTTG1 gene, which is often overexpressed in tumors. === Resistance === For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant. A study in 100 Italian people found, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others were noncompliant. Another study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant, but some had ""pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption"". Meta-analysis and systematic reviews have concluded that laboratory confirmed aspirin resistance confers increased rates of poorer outcomes in cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. Although the majority of research conducted has surrounded cardiovascular and neurovascular, there is emerging research into the risk of aspirin resistance after orthopaedic surgery where aspirin is used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Aspirin resistance in orthopaedic surgery, specifically after total hip and knee arthroplasties, is of interest as risk factors for aspirin resistance are also risk factors for venous thromboembolisms and osteoarthritis; the sequelae of requiring a total hip or knee arthroplasty. Some of these risk factors include obesity, advancing age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and inflammatory diseases. == Dosages == Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300 mg in Britain and 325 mg in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, e.g., 75 mg and 81 mg tablets. The 81 mg tablets are commonly called ""baby aspirin"" or ""baby-strength"", because they were originally – but no longer – intended to be administered to infants and children. No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75 mg and the 81 mg tablets. The dose required for benefit appears to depend on a person's weight. For those weighing less than 70 kilograms (154 lb), low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease; for patients above this weight, higher doses are required. In general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever. For the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily. March 2009 recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study of postmenopausal women found that aspirin resulted in a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause, though there was no significant difference between 81 mg and 325 mg aspirin doses. The 2021 ADAPTABLE study also showed no significant difference in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between 81 mg and 325 mg doses of aspirin in patients (both men and women) with established cardiovascular disease. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81 mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention. In children with Kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks. == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. One exception to the recommendation is the use of low-dose 81 mg aspirin at any point in pregnancy under the direction of a health care professional. === Contraindications === Aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. Aspirin taken at doses of ≤325 mg and ≤100 mg per day for ≥2 days can increase the odds of suffering a gout attack by 81% and 91% respectively. This effect may potentially be worsened by high purine diets, diuretics, and kidney disease, but is eliminated by the urate lowering drug allopurinol. Daily low dose aspirin does not appear to worsen kidney function. Aspirin may reduce cardiovascular risk in those without established cardiovascular disease in people with moderate CKD, without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents under the age of 16 to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome. === Gastrointestinal === Aspirin increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Enteric coating on aspirin may be used in manufacturing to prevent release of aspirin into the stomach to reduce gastric harm, but enteric coating does not reduce gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Enteric-coated aspirin may not be as effective at reducing blood clot risk. Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has been shown to further increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Blockade of COX-1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX-2 as part of a gastric defense. There is no clear evidence that simultaneous use of a COX-2 inhibitor with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury. ""Buffering"" is an additional method used with the intent to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding, such as by preventing aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses magnesium oxide. Other preparations use calcium carbonate. Gas-forming agents in effervescent tablet and powder formulations can also double as a buffering agent, one example being sodium bicarbonate, used in Alka-Seltzer. Taking vitamin C with aspirin has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining. In trials vitamin C-releasing aspirin (ASA-VitC) or a buffered aspirin formulation containing vitamin C was found to cause less stomach damage than aspirin alone. === Retinal vein occlusion === It is a widespread habit among eye specialists (ophthalmologists) to prescribe aspirin as an add-on medication for patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), such as central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The reason of this widespread use is the evidence of its proven effectiveness in major systemic venous thrombotic disorders, and it has been assumed that may be similarly beneficial in various types of retinal vein occlusion. However, a large-scale investigation based on data of nearly 700 patients showed ""that aspirin or other antiplatelet aggregating agents or anticoagulants adversely influence the visual outcome in patients with CRVO and hemi-CRVO, without any evidence of protective or beneficial effect"". Several expert groups, including the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, recommended against the use of antithrombotic drugs (incl. aspirin) for patients with RVO. === Central effects === Large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, cause temporary tinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade. === Reye's syndrome === Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 to 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the UK National Health Service recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor. === Skin === For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms including hives, swelling, and headache. Aspirin can exacerbate symptoms among those with chronic hives, or create acute symptoms of hives. These responses can be due to allergic reactions to aspirin, or more often due to its effect of inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme. Skin reactions may also tie to systemic contraindications, seen with NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm, or those with atopy. Aspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds. Earlier findings from two small, low-quality trials suggested a benefit with aspirin (alongside compression therapy) on venous leg ulcer healing time and leg ulcer size, however larger, more recent studies of higher quality have been unable to corroborate these outcomes. As such, further research is required to clarify the role of aspirin in this context. === Other adverse effects === Aspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared. Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds, having the appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10 mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches. A study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6). Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state. Use of low-dose aspirin before a surgical procedure has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events in some patients, however, ceasing aspirin prior to surgery has also been associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac events. An analysis of multiple studies found a three-fold increase in adverse events such as myocardial infarction in patients who ceased aspirin prior to surgery. The analysis found that the risk is dependent on the type of surgery being performed and the patient indication for aspirin use. On 9 July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings. === Overdose === Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30 to 100 mg/L after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300 mg/L in people taking high doses and 700–1400 mg/L following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate. === Interactions === Aspirin is known to interact with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, an important part of valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, may reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. Although limited evidence suggests this may not result in a reduced cardioprotective effect of aspirin. Analgesic doses of aspirin decrease sodium loss induced by spironolactone in the urine, however this does not reduce the antihypertensive effects of spironolactone. Furthermore, antiplatelet doses of aspirin are deemed too small to produce an interaction with spironolactone. Aspirin is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C. == Research == The ISIS-2 trial demonstrated that aspirin at doses of 160 mg daily for one month, decreased the mortality by 21% of participants with a suspected myocardial infarction in the first five weeks. A single daily dose of 324 mg of aspirin for 12 weeks has a highly protective effect against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina. === Bipolar disorder === Aspirin has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. However, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of bipolar depression. Thus, notwithstanding the biological rationale, the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain. === Infectious diseases === Several studies investigated the anti-infective properties of aspirin for bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. Aspirin was demonstrated to limit platelet activation induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and to reduce streptococcal adhesion to heart valves. In patients with tuberculous meningitis, the addition of aspirin reduced the risk of new cerebral infarction [RR = 0.52 (0.29-0.92)]. A role of aspirin on bacterial and fungal biofilm is also being supported by growing evidence. === Cancer prevention === Evidence from observational studies was conflicting on the effect of aspirin in breast cancer prevention; a randomized controlled trial showed that aspirin had no significant effect in reducing breast cancer, thus further studies are needed to clarify the effect of aspirin in cancer prevention. === In gardening === There are anecdotal reports that aspirin can improve the growth and resistance of plants, though most research has involved salicylic acid instead of aspirin. == Veterinary medicine == Aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis. Aspirin should be given to animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian, as adverse effects—including gastrointestinal issues—are common. An aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning, characterized by hemorrhaging, seizures, coma, and even death. Dogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are. Cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25 mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks, but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is 10 mg/kg every 48 hours to allow for metabolization. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Aspirin at Wikimedia Commons",Acylpyrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7954958821064793e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.770858453819528e-05), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12693749368190765)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7610454708337784e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pillintrip.com](https://pillintrip.com/medicine/acylpyrin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Acylpyrin : Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Dosage / Pillintrip', type='url_citation', url='https://pillintrip.com/medicine/acylpyrin?utm_source=openai')])"

Finerenone is a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Common side effects include abnormally high levels of potassium in the bloodstream, abnormally low levels of sodium in the bloodstream, and abnormally low blood pressure. Finerenone was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2021, and in the European Union in February 2022. The US Food and Drug Administration considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == In the United States, finerenone is indicated to reduce the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attacks, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes. In the European Union, finerenone is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. == Pharmacology == Finerenone has less relative affinity to other steroid hormone receptors than currently available aldosterone antagonists such as eplerenone and spironolactone, which should result in fewer adverse effects like gynaecomastia, impotence, and low libido. This table compares inhibitory (blocking) concentrations (IC50, unit: nM) of three antimineralocorticoids. Mineralocorticoid receptor inhibition is responsible for the desired action of the drugs, whereas inhibition of the other receptors potentially leads to side effects. Lower values mean stronger inhibition. Finerenone acts as an antagonist to mineralocorticoid receptors harboring the S810L mutation, unlike other traditional inhibitors of mineralocorticoids such as spironolactone and eplerenone that incidentally act as agonists. A meta-analysis of data from seven randomized controlled trials (13,783 participants) found a benefit to using finerenone in people with diabetic kidney disease and overt proteinuria. == Adverse effects == Finerenone may cause electrolyte imbalances. Symptoms that correlate with higher levels of potassium include nausea, weakness, chest pain, and loss of movement. People with lower levels of sodium may experience headaches, confusion, weakness, and feeling off balance. == History == The efficacy of finerenone to improve kidney and heart outcomes was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes. In this study, 5,674 participants were randomly assigned to receive either finerenone or a placebo. The study compared the two groups for the number of participants whose disease progressed to a composite (or combined) endpoint that included at least a 40% reduction in kidney function, progression to kidney failure, or kidney death. Results showed that 504 of the 2,833 participants who received finerenone had at least one of the events in the composite endpoint compared to 600 of the 2,841 participants who received a placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for finerenone priority review and fast track designations. The FDA granted the approval of Kerendia to Bayer Healthcare. == Legal status == In December 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Kerendia, intended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. Finerenone was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2022. == Brand names == Finerenone is sold under the brand names Kerendia and Firialta. == Research == In a phase II study, finerenone reduced urine albumin to creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic kidney disease. Based on that finding, it is being studied in phase studies designed to assess whether it reduces risk of progression of chronic kidney disease and adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. These studies have enrolled more than 13,000 patients with primary completion anticipated in 2020 and 2021. == References == == Further reading == Bakris GL, Agarwal R, Anker SD, Pitt B, Ruilope LM, Rossing P, et al.

1239,"('Œ≥-aminobutyric acid', 'Gamma-aminobutyric acid', 'Piperidic acid', 'Piperidinic acid', 'Aminalon')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid, γ-aminobutyric acid) is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the developmentally mature mammalian central nervous system. Its principal role is reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. GABA is sold as a dietary supplement in many countries. It has been traditionally thought that exogenous GABA (i.e., taken as a supplement) does not cross the blood–brain barrier, but data obtained from more recent research (2010s) in rats describes the notion as being unclear. The carboxylate form of GABA is γ-aminobutyrate. == Function == === Neurotransmitter === Two general classes of GABA receptor are known: GABAA in which the receptor is part of a ligand-gated ion channel complex GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that open or close ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins) Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate. Medium spiny cells are a typical example of inhibitory central nervous system GABAergic cells. In contrast, GABA exhibits both excitatory and inhibitory actions in insects, mediating muscle activation at synapses between nerves and muscle cells, and also the stimulation of certain glands. In mammals, some GABAergic neurons, such as chandelier cells, are also able to excite their glutamatergic counterparts. In addition to fast-acting phasic inhibition, small amounts of extracellular GABA can induce slow timescale tonic inhibition on neurons. GABAA receptors are ligand-activated chloride channels: when activated by GABA, they allow the flow of chloride ions across the membrane of the cell. Whether this chloride flow is depolarizing (makes the voltage across the cell's membrane less negative), shunting (has no effect on the cell's membrane potential), or inhibitory/hyperpolarizing (makes the cell's membrane more negative) depends on the direction of the flow of chloride. When net chloride flows out of the cell, GABA is depolarising; when chloride flows into the cell, GABA is inhibitory or hyperpolarizing. When the net flow of chloride is close to zero, the action of GABA is shunting. Shunting inhibition has no direct effect on the membrane potential of the cell; however, it reduces the effect of any coincident synaptic input by reducing the electrical resistance of the cell's membrane. Shunting inhibition can ""override"" the excitatory effect of depolarising GABA, resulting in overall inhibition even if the membrane potential becomes less negative. It was thought that a developmental switch in the molecular machinery controlling the concentration of chloride inside the cell changes the functional role of GABA between neonatal and adult stages. As the brain develops into adulthood, GABA's role changes from excitatory to inhibitory. === Brain development === GABA is an inhibitory transmitter in the mature brain; its actions were thought to be primarily excitatory in the developing brain. The gradient of chloride was reported to be reversed in immature neurons, with its reversal potential higher than the resting membrane potential of the cell; activation of a GABA-A receptor thus leads to efflux of Cl− ions from the cell (that is, a depolarizing current). The differential gradient of chloride in immature neurons was shown to be primarily due to the higher concentration of NKCC1 co-transporters relative to KCC2 co-transporters in immature cells. GABAergic interneurons mature faster in the hippocampus and the GABA machinery appears earlier than glutamatergic transmission. Thus, GABA is considered the major excitatory neurotransmitter in many regions of the brain before the maturation of glutamatergic synapses. In the developmental stages preceding the formation of synaptic contacts, GABA is synthesized by neurons and acts both as an autocrine (acting on the same cell) and paracrine (acting on nearby cells) signalling mediator. The ganglionic eminences also contribute greatly to building up the GABAergic cortical cell population. GABA regulates the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, the migration and differentiation the elongation of neurites and the formation of synapses. GABA also regulates the growth of embryonic and neural stem cells. GABA can influence the development of neural progenitor cells via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. GABA activates the GABAA receptor, causing cell cycle arrest in the S-phase, limiting growth. === Beyond the nervous system === Besides the nervous system, GABA is also produced at relatively high levels in the insulin-producing beta cells (β-cells) of the pancreas. The β-cells secrete GABA along with insulin and the GABA binds to GABA receptors on the neighboring islet alpha cells (α-cells) and inhibits them from secreting glucagon (which would counteract insulin's effects). GABA can promote the replication and survival of β-cells and also promote the conversion of α-cells to β-cells, which may lead to new treatments for diabetes. Alongside GABAergic mechanisms, GABA has also been detected in other peripheral tissues including intestines, stomach, fallopian tubes, uterus, ovaries, testicles, kidneys, urinary bladder, the lungs and liver, albeit at much lower levels than in neurons or β-cells. Experiments on mice have shown that hypothyroidism induced by fluoride poisoning can be halted by administering GABA. The test also found that the thyroid recovered naturally without further assistance after the fluoride had been expelled by the GABA. Immune cells express receptors for GABA and administration of GABA can suppress inflammatory immune responses and promote ""regulatory"" immune responses, such that GABA administration has been shown to inhibit autoimmune diseases in several animal models. In 2018, GABA has shown to regulate secretion of a greater number of cytokines. In plasma of T1D patients, levels of 26 cytokines are increased and of those, 16 are inhibited by GABA in the cell assays. In 2007, an excitatory GABAergic system was described in the airway epithelium. The system is activated by exposure to allergens and may participate in the mechanisms of asthma. GABAergic systems have also been found in the testis and in the eye lens. == Structure and conformation == GABA is found mostly as a zwitterion (i.e., with the carboxyl group deprotonated and the amino group protonated). Its conformation depends on its environment. In the gas phase, a highly folded conformation is strongly favored due to the electrostatic attraction between the two functional groups. The stabilization is about 50 kcal/mol, according to quantum chemistry calculations. In the solid state, an extended conformation is found, with a trans conformation at the amino end and a gauche conformation at the carboxyl end. This is due to the packing interactions with the neighboring molecules. In solution, five different conformations, some folded and some extended, are found as a result of solvation effects. The conformational flexibility of GABA is important for its biological function, as it has been found to bind to different receptors with different conformations. Many GABA analogues with pharmaceutical applications have more rigid structures in order to control the binding better. == History == GABA was first synthesized in 1883; it was first known only as a plant and microbe metabolic product. In 1950, Washington University School of Medicine researchers Eugene Roberts and Sam Frankel used newly-developed techniques of chromatography to analyze protein-free extracts of mammalian brain. They discovered that GABA is metabolized from glutamic acid and accumulates in the mammalian central nervous system. There was not much further research into the substance until 1957, Canadian researchers identified GABA as the mysterious component (termed Factor I by its discoverers in 1954) of brain and spinal cord extracts which inhibited crayfish neurons. In 1959, it was shown that, at an inhibitory synapse on crayfish muscle fibers, GABA acts through stimulation of the inhibitory nerve. Both inhibition by nerve stimulation and by applied GABA are blocked by picrotoxin. == Biosynthesis == GABA is primarily synthesized from glutamate via the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) with pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor. This process converts glutamate (the principal excitatory neurotransmitter) into GABA (the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter). GABA can also be synthesized from putrescine by diamine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Historically it was thought that exogenous GABA did not penetrate the blood–brain barrier, but more current research describes the notion as being unclear pending further research. == Metabolism == GABA transaminase enzymes catalyze the conversion of 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA) and 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) into succinic semialdehyde and glutamate. Succinic semialdehyde is then oxidized into succinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and as such enters the citric acid cycle as a usable source of energy. == Pharmacology == Drugs that act as allosteric modulators of GABA receptors (known as GABA analogues or GABAergic drugs), or increase the available amount of GABA, typically have relaxing, anti-anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects (with equivalent efficacy to lamotrigine based on studies of mice). Many of the substances below are known to cause anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia. In general, GABA does not cross the blood–brain barrier, although certain areas of the brain that have no effective blood–brain barrier, such as the periventricular nucleus, can be reached by drugs such as systemically injected GABA. At least one study suggests that orally administered GABA increases the amount of human growth hormone (HGH). GABA directly injected to the brain has been reported to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the production of growth hormone, depending on the physiology of the individual. Consequently, considering the potential biphasic effects of GABA on growth hormone production, as well as other safety concerns, its usage is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation. GABA enhances the catabolism of serotonin into N-acetylserotonin (the precursor of melatonin) in rats. It is thus suspected that GABA is involved in the synthesis of melatonin and thus might exert regulatory effects on sleep and reproductive functions. == Chemistry == Although in chemical terms, GABA is an amino acid (as it has both a primary amine and a carboxylic acid functional group), it is rarely referred to as such in the professional, scientific, or medical community. By convention the term ""amino acid"", when used without a qualifier, refers specifically to an alpha amino acid. GABA is not an alpha amino acid, meaning the amino group is not attached to the alpha carbon. Nor is it incorporated into proteins as are many alpha-amino acids. == GABAergic drugs == GABAA receptor ligands are shown in the following table. GABAergic pro-drugs include chloral hydrate, which is metabolised to trichloroethanol, which then acts via the GABAA receptor. The plant kava contains GABAergic compounds, including kavain, dihydrokavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin and yangonin. Other GABAergic modulators include: GABAB receptor ligands. Agonists: baclofen, propofol, GHB, phenibut. Antagonists: phaclofen, saclofen. GABA reuptake inhibitors: deramciclane, hyperforin, tiagabine. GABA transaminase inhibitors: gabaculine, phenelzine, valproate, vigabatrin, lemon balm (Melissa officinalis). GABA analogues: pregabalin, gabapentin, picamilon, progabide 4-Amino-1-butanol is a biochemical precursor of GABA and can be converted into GABA by the actions of aldehyde reductase (ALR) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) with γ-aminobutyraldehyde (GABAL) as a metabolic intermediate. == In plants == GABA is also found in plants. It is the most abundant amino acid in the apoplast of tomatoes. Evidence also suggests a role in cell signalling in plants. == See also == 3-Aminoisobutyric acid 4-aminobutyrate transaminase (GABA-transaminase) deficiency GABA analogue GABA receptor GABA tea Giant depolarizing potential Spastic diplegia, a GABA deficiency neuromuscular neuropathology Spasticity Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency Taurine == Notes == == References == == External links == Smart TG, Stephenson FA (2019).

Seliciclib is being developed by Cyclacel. This is a phase II, dose ranging, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The aim of this study is to assess the safety of increasing doses of roscovitine administered orally for 4 cycles of 4 consecutive days (treatment ""on"") separated by a 3 days treatment free period (treatment ""off"") in adult CF subjects with Cystic Fibrosis carrying 2 Cystic Fibrosis causing mutations with at least one F508del-CFTR mutation and chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study involved 36 Cystic Fibrosis patients: 24 treated and 12 controls. Seliciclib is being researched for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Cushing's disease, leukemia, HIV infection, Parkinson's disease, herpes simplex infection, cystic fibrosis and the mechanisms of chronic inflammation disorders. Seliciclib is a 2,6,9-substituted purine analog. Its structure in complex with CDK2 was determined in 1996. Seliciclib inhibits CDK2/E, CDK2/A, CDK7 and CDK9. == Clinical trials and lab tests == === Cancer treatment === Seliciclib has been found to produce apoptosis in treated cancerous cells of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers. Seliciclib has previously undergone Phase IIa clinical trials, in 240 NSCLC patients as a combined dose with existing first- and second-line treatments. In the current APPRAISE trial, the research drug is undergoing Phase IIb clinical trial as a monotherapy for NSCLC in third-line patients. The side-effects reported in Phase I trials of seliciclib for NSCLC were ""nausea, vomiting, transient elevations in serum creatinine and liver function parameters and transient hypokalemia"". === Immunological disorders === Seliciclib is also in clinical trials for B-cell lymphomas, including multiple myeloma. Seliciclib has been shown to inhibit RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and down-regulation of the protein MCL1. Seliciclib has been shown in vitro to induce apoptosis in neutrophil granulocytes. If this mechanism turns out to be safe, reliable and efficient in vivo, the drug could improve treatment of chronic inflammation diseases such as cystic fibrosis and arthritis. These are usually treated with glucocorticoids which often have serious side effects === Neurological therapies === In the nervous system, seliciclib has been shown to suppress microglial activation and to provide some neuroprotection in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, it increases antitumor activity of temozolomide in treatment of glioblastoma multiforme and is considered as a possible therapeutic option for glioma. === Antiviral effect === Seliciclib is also a possible antiviral agent. It causes the death of cells infected with HIV and preventing the replication of herpes simplex virus. === Ovum production === Seliciclib has been shown to cause parthenogenetic egg activation. However it does create abnormal second polar bodies and therefore possible aneuploid zygotes. Egg activation usually involves calcium oscillations however this does not happen with seliciclib. Seciclib causes egg activation by inhibiting protein kinases which results in the inactivation of the maturation promoting factor (MPF). === Renal hypertrophy === Seliciclib reduces renal hypertrophy by 45% after 5/6 nephrectomy. == Side effects == Causes severe side effects that can not be tolerated on daily bases.

Benfotiamine was developed in late 1950s in Japan. == Uses == Benfotiamine is primarily marketed as an over-the-counter drug to treat diabetic polyneuropathy. A 2021 review described two clinical trials with positive results for diabetic polyneuropathy and concluded that more research is needed. As of 2017, benfotiamine was marketed as a pharmaceutical drug in many countries under the following brand names: Benalgis, Benfogamma, Benforce, Benfotiamina, Biotamin, Biotowa, Milgamma, and Vilotram. It was also marketed in some jurisdictions as a combination drug with cyanocobalamin as Milgamma, in combination with pyridoxine as Milgamma, in combination with metformin as Benforce-M, and with thiamine as Vitafos. == Adverse effects == There is little published data on adverse effects.

One of the medical strategies used against bacteria is the therapy with drug delivery systems. Non-ionic vesicles are nanomaterials with good characteristics for encapsulating drugs, due to their bioavailability and biodegradability, which allow the drugs to reach the specific target and reduce their side effects. In this work, the antibiotic Rifamycin S was encapsulated. The rifamycin antibiotics family has been widely used against  The solubility data of rifamycin S were measured in isopropanol, butyl acetate, and their mixed solvents across the temperature range of 283.15-323.15 K by the gravimetric method. The results demonstrate that the solubility of rifamycin S increases with the increasing temperature in the two pure solvents, and in the mixed solvents, it increases first and then decreases with increasing butyl acetate content. The experimental data of rifamycin S in the mixed solvents were better correlated using the modified Apelblat equation and ideal model equation. Furthermore, the relevant thermodynamic parameters of the dissolution process were determined based on the van't Hoff equation. The obtained dissolution enthalpy and Gibbs free energy are positive in all cases, which indicate that the dissolving process of rifamycin S is endothermic and nonspontaneous. The supersolubility data of rifamycin S were measured by the laser and thermal analytic method. The results demonstrate that the width of the metastable zone of rifamycin S becomes larger with decreasing cooling rate and increasing butyl acetate content. Furthermore, the crystallization process of rifamycin S was optimized on the basis of thermodynamic research. The results showed that when  Oxygen enhanced the bactericidal activity of rifamycin SV to Escherichia coli K12. Anaerobically grown cells, which had a low level of superoxide dismutase, were more susceptible to the bactericidal activity than aerobically grown cells, which contained a high level of superoxide dismutase. Oxygen also enhanced the inhibition of RNA polymerase activity of rifamycin SV, when Mn2+ was used as a cofactor. Rifamycin S was reduced to rifamycin SV by NADPH catalyzed by cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli K12. These results indicate that the inhibition of bacterial growth by rifamycin SV is due to the production of active species of oxygen resulting from the oxidation-reduction cycle of rifamycin SV in the cells. The aerobic oxidation of rifamycin SV to rifamycin S was induced by metal ions, such as Mn2+, Cu2+, and Co2+. The most effective metal ion was Mn2+. In the presence of Mn2+, accompanying the consumption of 1 mol of oxygen and the oxidation of 1 mol of rifamycin SV, 1 mol of hydrogen peroxide and 1 mol of rifamycin S were formed. Superoxide was generated during the autoxidation of rifamycin SV. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the formation of rifamycin S, but scavengers for hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical did not affect the oxidation.

1246,"('Hypericin',)","Food, Medical","Hypericin is a naphthodianthrone, an anthraquinone derivative which, together with hyperforin, is one of the principal active constituents of Hypericum (Saint John's wort). Hypericin is believed to act as an antibiotic, antiviral and non-specific kinase inhibitor. Hypericin may inhibit the action of the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, leading to increased dopamine levels, although thus possibly decreasing norepinephrine and epinephrine. It was initially believed that the anti-depressant pharmacological activity of hypericin was due to inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzyme. The crude extract of Hypericum is a weak inhibitor of MAO-A and MAO-B. Isolated hypericin does not display this activity, but does have some affinity for NMDA receptors. This points in the direction that other constituents are responsible for the MAOI effect. The current belief is that the mechanism of antidepressant activity is due to the inhibition of re-uptake of certain neurotransmitters. The large chromophore system in the molecule means that it can cause photosensitivity when ingested beyond threshold amounts. Photosensitivity is often seen in animals that have been allowed to graze on St. John's Wort. Because hypericin accumulates preferentially in cancerous tissues, it is also used as an indicator of cancerous cells. In addition, hypericin is under research as an agent in photodynamic therapy, whereby a biochemical is absorbed by an organism to be later activated with spectrum-specific light from specialized lamps or laser sources, for therapeutic purposes. The antibacterial and antiviral effects of hypericin are also believed to arise from its ability for photo-oxidation of cells and viral particles. Hypericin derives from cyclisation of polyketides. The biosynthesis of hypericins is through the polyketide pathway where an octaketide chain goes through successive cyclizations and decarboxylations to form emodin anthrone which is believed to be the precursor of hypericin. Oxidization reactions yield protoforms which then are converted into hypericin and pseudohypericin. These reactions are photosensitive and take place under exposure to light and using the enzyme Hyp-1. == References ==",Hypericin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.2258557379245758), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00020401719666551799), (' FOOD', -0.0008598887361586094)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.20757779479026794), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.06203271076083183), ('ĠFOOD', -0.21109385788440704), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3134816884994507)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.06248743459582329)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypericin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Hypericin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypericin?utm_source=openai')])"
1247,"('Memantine (hydrochloride)', 'Memantine', 'Ebixa', 'Memantina', 'Memantinum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Memantine, sold under the brand name Namenda among others, is a medication used to slow the progression of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, constipation, sleepiness, and dizziness. Severe side effects may include blood clots, psychosis, and heart failure. It is believed to work by acting on NMDA receptors, working as a pore blocker of these ion channels. Memantine was first discovered in 1963. It was approved for medical use in Germany in 1989, in the European Union in 2002, and in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 150th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease and dementia === Memantine is used to treat moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, especially for people who are intolerant of or have a contraindication to AChE (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitors. One guideline recommends memantine or an AChE inhibitor be considered in people in the early-to-mid stage of dementia. Memantine has been associated with a modest improvement; with small positive effects on cognition, mood, behavior, and the ability to perform daily activities in moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. There does not appear to be any benefit in mild disease. Memantine when added to donepezil in those with moderate-to-severe dementia resulted in ""limited improvements"" in a 2017 review. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance in 2018 recommending consideration of the combination of memantine with donepezil in those with moderate-to-severe dementia. === Radiation therapy === Memantine has been recommended for use by professional organization consensus to prevent neurocognitive decline after whole brain radiotherapy. == Adverse effects == Memantine is, in general, well tolerated. Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common adverse effects include vomiting, anxiety, hypertonia, cystitis, and increased libido. Like many other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine behaves as a dissociative anesthetic at supratherapeutic doses. Despite isolated reports, recreational use of memantine is rare due to the drug's long duration and limited availability. Additionally, memantine seems to lack effects such as euphoria or hallucinations. Memantine appears to be generally well tolerated by children with autism spectrum disorder. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Glutamatergic ==== A dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission, manifested as neuronal excitotoxicity, is hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Targeting the glutamatergic system, specifically ionotropic glutamate NMDA receptors, offers a novel approach to treatment in view of the limited efficacy of existing drugs targeting the cholinergic system. Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent uncompetitive antagonist at glutamatergic NMDA receptors. By binding to the NMDA receptor with a higher affinity than Mg2+ ions, memantine is able to inhibit the prolonged influx of Ca2+ ions, particularly from extrasynaptic receptors, which forms the basis of neuronal excitotoxicity. The low affinity, uncompetitive nature, and rapid off-rate kinetics of memantine at the level of the NMDA receptor channel, however, preserves the function of the receptor at synapses, as it can still be activated by physiological release of glutamate following depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. The interaction of memantine with NMDA receptors plays a major role in the symptomatic improvement that the drug produces in Alzheimer's disease. However, there is no evidence as yet that the ability of memantine to protect against extrasynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity has a disease-modifying effect in Alzheimer's disease, although this has been suggested in animal models. ==== Serotonergic ==== Memantine acts as a non-competitive antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, with a potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor. Many 5-HT3 receptor antagonists function as antiemetics, however the clinical significance of this anti-serotonergic activity of memantine in Alzheimer's disease is unknown. ==== Cholinergic ==== Memantine acts as a non-competitive antagonist of different neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA receptor and 5-HT3 receptor, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at α7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. α7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment. It has been shown that the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, even in the absence of a general decrease in the number of neurons, and nicotinic receptor agonists are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs. ==== Dopaminergic ==== Memantine was shown in a study to act as an agonist at the dopamine D2high receptor with equal or slightly higher affinity than to the NMDA receptors. However, the relevance of this action may be negligible, as studies have shown very low affinity for binding to D2 receptors in general. ==== Sigmaergic ==== Memantine acts as an agonist of the sigma σ1 receptor with low affinity (Ki = 2.6 μM). The consequences of this activity are unclear (as the role of sigma receptors in general is currently not very well understood). Due to this low affinity, therapeutic concentrations of memantine are most likely too low to have any sigmaergic effect as a typical therapeutic dose is 20 mg. However, excessive doses of memantine taken for recreational purposes many times greater than prescribed doses may indeed activate this receptor. ==== Other actions ==== Memantine does not appear to inhibit or induce several cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4/5, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9. It also does not inhibit CYP2A6 or CYP2E1. However, it might have a small effect on CYP2B6. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of memantine is 100%. Time to peak levels of memantine is 3 to 7 hours. Food has no influence on the rate of absorption. Memantine exposure is linear over a dose range of 10 to 40 mg. Peak levels after a single 20 mg dose were found to be 24 to 29 μg/L (0.13–0.16 μmol/L or μM). Steady-state levels of memantine with 20 mg/day are in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 μM. ==== Distribution ==== Memantine has a relatively high volume of distribution (Vd) of 9 to 11 L/kg. It easily crosses biological membranes, is widely distributed throughout the body, and crosses the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system. The drug is transported across the blood–brain barrier by the organic cation transporter novel 1 (OCTN1). The plasma protein binding of memantine is 45% and is described as very low and not clinically significant. Because of its low plasma protein binding, it is unlikely to interact with other highly protein-bound drugs such as warfarin or digoxin. ==== Metabolism ==== Memantine does not undergo extensive metabolism. It is negligibly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. As a result, it has a decreased potential for drug interactions. Metabolites of memantine include memantine glucuronide, 6-hydroxymemantine, and 1-nitrosomemantine, all of which show minimal activity as NMDA receptor antagonists. ==== Elimination ==== Memantine is eliminated primarily in urine, with 57 to 82% excreted in urine unchanged. Its elimination half-life is 60 to 80 hours. The renal clearance of memantine is dependent on urinary pH. More alkaline urine slows the elimination of memantine, whereas more acidic urine accelerates its elimination. == Chemistry == Memantine, also known as 3,5-dimethyl-1-aminoadamantane (DMAA), is an adamantane derivative and is closely structurally related to amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) and other adamantane derivatives. The synthesis of memantine has been described. == History == Memantine was first synthesized, patented, and described by Eli Lilly and Company in 1963 as an anti-diabetic agent, but it was ineffective at lowering blood sugar. By 1972, it was discovered to have central nervous system (CNS) activity, and was developed by Merz for treatment of neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Memantine was first studied in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in 1986. The drug was first marketed for dementia in 1989 in Germany under the name Axura. It was not discovered to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist until 1989, after clinical trials had initiated. Prior to this, it was theorized to directly and/or indirectly modulate the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems. However, these actions were later realized to occur at 100-fold higher concentrations than those achieved therapeutically and hence are unlikely to be involved in its effects. In the United States, some CNS activities were discovered at Children's Hospital of Boston in 1990, and Children's licensed patents covering uses of memantine outside the field of ophthalmology to Neurobiological Technologies (NTI) in 1995. In 1998, NTI amended its agreement with Children's to allow Merz to take over development. In 2000, Merz partnered with Forest to develop the drug for Alzheimer's disease in the United States under the brand name Namenda. In 2000, Merz partnered with Suntory for the Japanese market and with Lundbeck for other markets including Europe; the drug was originally marketed by Lundbeck under the name Ebixa. Memantine was approved in the European Union in 2002 and in the United States in 2003. Sales of the drug reached $1.8 billion for 2014. The cost of Namenda was $269 to $489 a month in 2012. In February 2014, as the July 2015 patent expiration for memantine neared, Actavis, which had acquired Forest, announced that it was launching an extended release (XR) form of memantine that could be taken once a day instead of twice a day as needed with the then-current ""immediate release"" (IR) version, and that it intended to stop selling the IR version in August 2014 and withdraw the marketing authorization. This is a tactic to thwart generic competition called product hopping. However the supply of the XR version ran short, so Actavis extended the deadline until the fall. In September 2014 the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, filed a lawsuit to compel Actavis to keep selling the IR version on the basis of antitrust law. In December 2014, a judge granted New York State its request and issued an injunction, preventing Actavis from withdrawing the IR version until generic versions could launch. Actavis appealed and in May a panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, and in June Actavis asked that its case be heard by the full Second Circuit panel. In August 2015, Actavis' request was denied. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Recreational use of memantine at supratherapeutic doses has been reported. It is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and is reported to produce dissociative and phencyclidine (PCP)-like effects in animals and humans at sufficiently high doses. Even therapeutic doses have been found to produce mild dissociative-like effects in clinical studies. In any case, the very long duration of action of memantine (>40 hours) has likely limited its misuse potential. Recreational use of the related drug amantadine has similarly been reported. A study examining self-reported use of memantine on the social network Reddit showed that the drug was used both recreationally and as a nootropic, but also that it was misused in various illnesses as self-medication without strong scientific basis. === Brand names === As of August 2017, memantine is marketed under many brand names worldwide including Abixa, Adaxor, Admed, Akatinol, Alceba, Alios, Almenta, Alois, Alzant, Alzer, Alzia, Alzinex, Alzixa, Alzmenda, Alzmex, Axura, Biomentin, Carrier, Cogito, Cognomem, Conexine, Cordure, Dantex, Demantin, Demax, Dementa, Dementexa, Ebitex, Ebixa, Emantin, Emaxin, Esmirtal, Eutebrol, Evy, Ezemantis, Fentina, Korint, Lemix, Lindex, Lindex, Lucidex, Manotin, Mantine, Mantomed, Marbodin, Mardewel, Marixino, Maruxa, Maxiram, Melanda, Memabix, Memamed, Memando, Memantin, Memantina, Memantine, Mémantine, Memantinol, Memantyn, Memanvitae, Memanxa, Memanzaks, Memary, Memax, Memexa, Memigmin, Memikare, Memogen, Memolan, Memorel, Memorix, Memotec, Memox, Memxa, Mentikline, Mentium, Mentixa, Merandex, Merital, Mexia, Mimetix, Mirvedol, Modualz, Morysa, Namenda, Nemdatine, Nemdatine, Nemedan, Neumantine, Neuro-K, Neuroplus, Noojerone, Polmatine, Prilben, Pronervon, Ravemantine, Talentum, Timantila, Tingreks, Tonibral, Tormoro, Valcoxia, Vilimen, Vivimex, Witgen, Xapimant, Ymana, Zalatine, Zemertinex, Zenmem, Zenmen, and Zimerz. It is marketed in some countries as a combination drug with donepezil (memantine/donepezil) under the brand names Namzaric, Neuroplus Dual, and Tonibral MD. == Research == === Psychiatric disorders === Memantine has been studied and used off-label in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. These include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance misuse, pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), and binge eating disorder (BED). A 2008 systematic review concluded that although it was promising for such uses, memantine could not be recommended for such indications due to inadequate data. Memantine does not appear to be effective in the treatment of unipolar major depression or bipolar depression on the basis of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including a 2021 Cochrane review. However, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that memantine was significantly effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms in various psychiatric disorders, although with a very small effect size (Hedges' g = -0.17). There are likewise limited data to support memantine in the treatment of schizophrenia based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis reported that memantine was effective in the treatment of the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia with medium to large effect sizes. === Parkinson's disease === Memantine has been studied in the treatment of Parkinson's disease since the early 1970s. Whereas the related drug amantadine is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and has been since the early 1970s, memantine is not approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as of 2024. However, it has been said that memantine, along with amantadine, has been widely used as an antiparkinsonian agent since at least 1994. Although amantadine and memantine have fairly similar pharmacology, it has been said that memantine does not share the antidyskinetic effects of amantadine. However, findings are conflicting, and some data suggest that memantine may also have antidyskinetic effects. Similarly to amantadine and dopamine receptor agonists, memantine reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy and monoamine depletion-induced sedation in animals. Memantine has been found to reduce bradykinesia and resting tremor in people with Parkinson's disease. Memantine and amantadine are said to have moderate anti-akinetic effects in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The doses of memantine used for Parkinson's disease are about 5- to 10-fold lower than those of amantadine, which has been attributed to greater potency of memantine. As of 2022, a phase 3 clinical trial is studying the potential of memantine as disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson's disease that might slow progression of the disease. It is specifically theorized to act by inhibiting cell-to-cell transmission of α-synuclein. Besides Parkinson's disease, memantine has been studied in the treatment of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). === Apathy === Apathy is a disorder of diminished motivation characterized by diminished interest and activity. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published from 2016 to 2022 have found that memantine is not effective in the treatment of apathy in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. However, another 2022 review reported that it was effective. === Long COVID === Memantine, along with amantadine, is being studied and used off-label in the treatment long COVID. === Catatonia === Memantine, along with amantadine, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of catatonia in case reports and case series. === Autism === Effects in autism are unclear. == References == == Further reading ==",Ebixa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00035565727739594877), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0068628787994384766)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Trofinetide is indicated for the treatment of Rett syndrome in people two years of age and older. Rett syndrome is a rare, genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops. People with Rett syndrome experience a progressive loss of motor skills and language. Most babies with Rett syndrome seem to develop as expected for the first six months of life. These babies then lose skills they previously had attained at approximately six to 18 months of age — such as the ability to crawl, walk, communicate, or use their hands. The hallmark of Rett syndrome is near constant repetitive hand movements, such as rubbing or clapping. Rett syndrome leads to severe impairments affecting nearly every aspect of life, including the ability to speak, walk, eat, and breathe. == History == It was developed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals that acts as an analogue of the neuropeptide (1-3) IGF-1, which is a simple tripeptide with sequence Gly-Pro-Glu obtained by enzymatic cleavage of the growth factor IGF-1 within the brain. Trofinetide has anti-inflammatory properties and was originally developed as a potential treatment for stroke, but has subsequently been developed for other applications and is approved by the FDA as an oral solution. It has successfully completed phase III clinical trial against Rett syndrome. Trofinetide has also had a successful phase II trial against Fragile X syndrome. The drug is manufactured by Acadia Pharmaceuticals. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluated the efficacy and safety of trofinetide based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study (Study 1; NCT04181723) of participants with Rett syndrome five to 20 years of age. Participants were randomized to receive trofinetide (N=93) or matching placebo (N=94) for 12 weeks.

In formulas, the group is often abbreviated as Me. This hydrocarbon group occurs in many organic compounds. It is a very stable group in most molecules. While the methyl group is usually part of a larger molecule, bonded to the rest of the molecule by a single covalent bond (−CH3), it can be found on its own in any of three forms: methanide anion (CH−3), methylium cation (CH+3) or methyl radical (CH•3).

All three forms are highly reactive and rarely observed. == Methyl cation, anion, and radical == === Methyl cation === The methylium cation (CH+3) exists in the gas phase, but is otherwise not encountered. Some compounds are considered to be sources of the CH+3 cation, and this simplification is used pervasively in organic chemistry. For example, protonation of methanol gives an electrophilic methylating reagent that reacts by the SN2 pathway: CH3OH + H+ → [CH3OH2]+ Similarly, methyl iodide and methyl triflate are viewed as the equivalent of the methyl cation because they readily undergo SN2 reactions by weak nucleophiles. The methyl cation has been detected in interstellar space. === Methyl anion === The methanide anion (CH−3) exists only in rarefied gas phase or under exotic conditions. It can be produced by electrical discharge in ketene at low pressure (less than one torr) and its enthalpy of reaction is determined to be about 252.2 ± 3.3 kJ/mol. It is a powerful superbase; only the lithium monoxide anion (LiO−) and the diethynylbenzene dianions are known to be stronger. In discussing mechanisms of organic reactions, methyl lithium and related Grignard reagents are often considered to be salts of CH−3; and though the model may be useful for description and analysis, it is only a useful fiction. Such reagents are generally prepared from the methyl halides: 2 M + CH3X → MCH3 + MX where M is an alkali metal. === Methyl radical === The methyl radical has the formula CH•3. It exists in dilute gases, but in more concentrated form it readily dimerizes to ethane. It is routinely produced by various enzymes of the radical SAM and methylcobalamin varieties. == Reactivity == The reactivity of a methyl group depends on the adjacent substituents. Methyl groups can be quite unreactive. For example, in organic compounds, the methyl group resists attack by even the strongest acids. === Oxidation === The oxidation of a methyl group occurs widely in nature and industry. The oxidation products derived from methyl are hydroxymethyl group −CH2OH, formyl group −CHO, and carboxyl group −COOH. For example, permanganate often converts a methyl group to a carboxyl (−COOH) group, e.g. the conversion of toluene to benzoic acid. Ultimately oxidation of methyl groups gives protons and carbon dioxide, as seen in combustion. === Methylation === Demethylation (the transfer of the methyl group to another compound) is a common process, and reagents that undergo this reaction are called methylating agents. Common methylating agents are dimethyl sulfate, methyl iodide, and methyl triflate. Methanogenesis, the source of natural gas, arises via a demethylation reaction. Together with ubiquitin and phosphorylation, methylation is a major biochemical process for modifying protein function. The field of epigenetics focuses on the influence of methylation on gene expression. === Deprotonation === Certain methyl groups can be deprotonated. For example, the acidity of the methyl groups in acetone ((CH3)2CO) is about 1020 times more acidic than methane. The resulting carbanions are key intermediates in many reactions in organic synthesis and biosynthesis. Fatty acids are produced in this way. === Free radical reactions === When placed in benzylic or allylic positions, the strength of the C−H bond is decreased, and the reactivity of the methyl group increases. One manifestation of this enhanced reactivity is the photochemical chlorination of the methyl group in toluene to give benzyl chloride. == Chiral methyl == In the special case where one hydrogen is replaced by deuterium (D) and another hydrogen by tritium (T), the methyl substituent becomes chiral. Methods exist to produce optically pure methyl compounds, e.g., chiral acetic acid (deuterotritoacetic acid CHDTCO2H). Through the use of chiral methyl groups, the stereochemical course of several biochemical transformations have been analyzed. == Rotation == A methyl group may rotate around the R−C axis. This is a free rotation only in the simplest cases like gaseous methyl chloride CH3Cl. In most molecules, the remainder R breaks the C∞ symmetry of the R−C axis and creates a potential V(φ) that restricts the free motion of the three protons. For the model case of ethane CH3CH3, this is discussed under the name ethane barrier. In condensed phases, neighbour molecules also contribute to the potential. Methyl group rotation can be experimentally studied using quasielastic neutron scattering. == Etymology == French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugene Peligot, after determining methanol's chemical structure, introduced ""methylene"" from the Greek μέθυ (methy) ""wine"" and ὕλη (hȳlē) ""wood, patch of trees"" with the intention of highlighting its origins, ""alcohol made from wood (substance)"". The term ""methyl"" was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from ""methylene"", and was then applied to describe ""methyl alcohol"" (which since 1892 is called ""methanol""). Methyl is the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry term for an alkane (or alkyl) molecule, using the prefix ""meth-"" to indicate the presence of a single carbon. == See also == AdoMet Methylation == References ==",Methyl vanillate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.981667537620524e-06)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.003245327156037092), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0012888943310827017)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.029750484973192215), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.1602245420217514), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://www.ingredientreviewer.com/ingredient/3943-74-6/,https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB1138142.htm ', [])"
1253,"('Protriptyline (hydrochloride)', 'Protriptyline', 'Protryptyline', 'Amimetilina', 'Triptil')",Medical,"Protriptyline, sold under the brand name Vivactil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine, indicated for the treatment of depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Uniquely among most of the TCAs, protriptyline tends to be energizing instead of sedating, and is sometimes used for narcolepsy to achieve a wakefulness-promoting effect. TCAs including protriptyline are also used to reduce the incidence of recurring headaches such as migraine, and for other types of chronic pain. == Medical uses == Protriptyline is used primarily to treat depression and to treat the combination of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Like most antidepressants of this chemical and pharmacological class, protriptyline has also been used in limited numbers of patients to treat panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, cocaine dependency, and the depressive phase of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive) disorder. It has also been used to support smoking cessation programs. Protriptyline is available as 5 mg and 10 mg tablets. Doses range from 15 to 40 mg per day and can be taken in one daily dose or divided into up to four doses daily. Some people with severe depression may require up to 60 mg per day. In adolescents and people over age 60, therapy should be initiated at a dose of 5 mg three times a day and increased under the supervision of a physician as needed. Patients over age 60 who are taking daily doses of 20 mg or more should be closely monitored for side effects such as rapid heart rate and urinary retention. Like all TCAs, protriptyline should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision. This is especially so for persons with glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma (the most severe form) or urinary retention, for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate gland), and for the elderly. Before starting treatment, people should discuss the relative risks and benefits of treatment with their doctors to help determine if protriptyline is the right antidepressant for them. == Contraindications == Protriptyline may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. In rare cases in which patients with cardiovascular disease must take protriptyline, they should be monitored closely for cardiac rhythm disturbances and signs of cardiac stress or damage. When protriptyline is used to treat the depressive component of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms may be aggravated. Likewise, in manic-depressive psychosis, depressed patients may experience a shift toward the manic phase if they are treated with an antidepressant drug. Paranoid delusions, with or without associated hostility, may be exaggerated. In any of these circumstances, it may be advisable to reduce the dose of protriptyline or to use an antipsychotic drug concurrently. == Side effects == Protriptyline shares side effects common to all TCAs. The most frequent of these are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, decreased coordination, anxiety, blood disorders, confusion, decreased libido, dizziness, flushing, headache, impotence, insomnia, low blood pressure, nightmares, rapid or irregular heartbeat, rash, seizures, sensitivity to sunlight, stomach and intestinal problems. Other more complicated side effects include; chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; hallucinations, or seizure (convulsions); easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness; restless muscle movements in your eyes, tongue, jaw, or neck; urinating less than usual or not at all; extreme thirst with headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; or feeling light-headed or fainting. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief. Men with prostate enlargement who take protriptyline may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention. Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine. In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant. In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect. A common problem with TCAs is sedation (drowsiness, lack of physical and mental alertness), but protriptyline is considered the least sedating agent among this class of agents. Its side effects are especially noticeable early in therapy. In most people, early TCA side effects decrease or disappear entirely with time, but, until then, patients taking protriptyline should take care to assess which side effects occur in them and should not perform hazardous activities requiring mental acuity or coordination. Protriptyline may increase the possibility of having seizures. === Withdrawal === Though not indicative of addiction, abrupt cessation of treatment after prolonged therapy may produce nausea, headache, and malaise. === List of side effects === Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction; stroke; heart block; arrhythmias; hypotension, particularly orthostatic hypotension; hypertension; tachycardia; palpitation. Psychiatric: Confusional states (especially in the elderly) with hallucinations, disorientation, delusions, anxiety, restlessness, agitation; hypomania; exacerbation of psychosis; insomnia, panic, and nightmares. Neurological: Seizures; incoordination; ataxia; tremors; peripheral neuropathy; numbness, tingling, and paresthesias of extremities; extrapyramidal symptoms; drowsiness; dizziness; weakness and fatigue; headache; syndrome of inappropriate ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion; tinnitus; alteration in EEG patterns. Anticholinergic: Paralytic ileus; hyperpyrexia; urinary retention, delayed micturition, dilatation of the urinary tract; constipation; blurred vision, disturbance of accommodation, increased intraocular pressure, mydriasis; dry mouth and rarely associated sublingual adentitis. Allergic: Drug fever; petechiae, skin rash, urticaria, itching, photosensitization (avoid excessive exposure to sunlight); edema (general, or of face and tongue). Hematologic: Agranulocytosis; bone marrow depression; leukopenia;thrombocytopenia; purpura; eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting; anorexia; epigastric distress; diarrhea; peculiar taste; stomatitis; abdominal cramps; black tongue. Endocrine: Impotence, increased or decreased libido: gynecomastia in the male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; testicular swelling; elevation or depression of blood sugar levels. Other: Jaundice (simulating obstructive); altered liver function; parotid swelling; alopecia; flushing; weight gain or loss; urinary frequency, nocturia; perspiration. == Overdose == Deaths may occur from overdose with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate TCA overdose. As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after TCA overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. Critical manifestations of overdose include: cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions, and CNS depression, including coma. Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of TCA toxicity. Other signs of overdose may include: confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, agitation, hyperactive reflexes, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperpyrexia. == Interactions == The side effects of protriptyline are increased when it is taken with central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines, as well as with other antidepressants including SSRIs, SNRIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It may be dangerous to take protriptyline in combination with these substances. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Protriptyline acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and to a lesser extent serotonin (5-HT) in the brain. Its affinity for the human norepinephrine transporter (NET) is 1.41 nM, 19.6 nM for the serotonin transporter and 2,100 nM for the dopamine transporter. TCAs act to change the balance of naturally occurring chemicals in the brain that regulate the transmission of nerve impulses between cells. Protriptyline increases the concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin (both chemicals that stimulate nerve cells) and, to a lesser extent, blocks the action of another brain chemical, acetylcholine. The therapeutic effects of protriptyline, like other antidepressants, appear slowly. Maximum benefit is often not evident for at least two weeks after starting the drug. Protriptyline is a TCA. It was thought that TCAs work by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. TCAs are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the central nervous system via an indirect serotonergic route. TCAs are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic, similar to psilocybin. === Pharmacokinetics === Metabolic studies indicate that protriptyline is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly sequestered in tissues. Relatively low plasma levels are found after administration, and only a small amount of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine of dogs and rabbits. Preliminary studies indicate that demethylation of the secondary amine moiety occurs to a significant extent, and that metabolic transformation takes place in the liver. It penetrates the brain rapidly in mice and rats, and moreover that which is present in the brain is almost all unchanged drug. Studies on the disposition of radioactive protriptyline in human test subjects showed significant plasma levels within 2 hours, peaking at 8 to 12 hours, then declining gradually. Urinary excretion studies in the same subjects showed significant amounts of radioactivity in 2 hours. The rate of excretion was slow. Cumulative urinary excretion during 16 days accounted for approximately 50% of the drug. The fecal route of excretion did not seem to be important. Protriptyline has uniquely low dosing among TCAs, likely due to its exceptionally long terminal half-life. It is used in dosages of 15 to 40 mg/day, whereas most other TCAs are used at dosages of 75 to 300 mg/day. The maximum dose is 60 mg/day. Therapeutic levels of protriptyline are typically in the range of 70 to 250 ng/mL (266-950 nmol/L), which is similar to that of other TCAs == Chemistry == Protriptyline is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene TCAs include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and butriptyline. Protriptyline is a secondary amine TCA, with its N-methylated analog N–methylprotriptyline being a tertiary amine, and a structural isomer of amitriptyline. The tertiary amine analog of protriptyline, N–methylprotriptyline, has not been marketed. Other secondary amine TCAs include desipramine and nortriptyline. The chemical name of protriptyline is 3-(5H-dibenzo[a,d][7]annulen-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.377 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 438-60-8 and of the hydrochloride is 1225-55-4. == History == Protriptyline was developed by Merck. It was patented in 1962 and first appeared in the literature in 1964. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1966. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Protriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while protriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, and BANMTooltip British Approved Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are protriptylina, in German is protriptylin, and in Latin is protriptylinum. === Brand names === Protriptyline is or has been marketed throughout the world under a variety of brand names including Anelun, Concordin, Maximed, Triptil, and Vivactil. === Availability === The sale of protriptyline was discontinued in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Ireland in 2000. It remains available worldwide only in the United States as of 2024. == See also == List of antidepressants == References ==",Triptil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016115797916427255), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009221353684552014)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1254,"('Mecillinam', 'Amdinocillin', 'Fl 1060', 'Penicillin hx', 'Coactin')",Medical,"Mecillinam (INN) or amdinocillin (USAN) is an extended-spectrum penicillin antibiotic of the amidinopenicillin class that binds specifically to penicillin binding protein 2 (PBP2), and is only considered to be active against Gram-negative bacteria. It is used primarily in the treatment of urinary tract infections, and has also been used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever. Because mecillinam has very low oral bioavailability, an orally active prodrug was developed: pivmecillinam. == Medical uses == Mecillinam is used in the treatment of infections due to susceptible gram-negative bacteria, especially urinary tract infections which are most commonly caused by Escherichia coli. Mecillinam is active against most pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some species of Proteus. Several studies have also found it to be as effective as other antibiotics for treating Staphylococcus saprophyticus infection, though it is Gram-positive, possibly because mecillinam reaches very high concentrations in urine. Worldwide resistance to mecillinam in bacteria causing urinary tract infection has remained very low since its introduction; a 2003 study conducted in 16 European countries and Canada found resistance to range from 1.2% (Escherichia coli) to 5.2% (Proteus mirabilis). Another large study conducted in Europe and Brazil obtained similar results — 95.9% of E. coli strains, for instance, were sensitive to mecillinam. == Adverse effects == The adverse effect profile of mecillinam is similar to that of other penicillins. Its most common side effects are rash and gastrointestinal upset, including nausea and vomiting. == History == With the codename FL 1060, mecillinam was developed by the Danish pharmaceutical company Leo Pharmaceutical Products (now LEO Pharma).

1255,"('Harmine', 'Telepathine', 'Banisterine', 'Leucoharmine', 'Yageine')",Medical,"Harmine is a beta-carboline and a harmala alkaloid. It occurs in a number of different plants, most notably the Syrian rue and Banisteriopsis caapi. Harmine reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme which breaks down monoamines, making it a Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA). Harmine does not inhibit MAO-B. Harmine is also known as banisterin, banisterine, telopathin, telepathine, leucoharmine and yagin, yageine. == Biosynthesis == The coincident occurrence of β-carboline alkaloids and serotonin in Peganum harmala indicates the presence of two very similar, interrelated biosynthetic pathways, which makes it difficult to definitively identify whether free tryptamine or L-tryptophan is the precursor in the biosynthesis of harmine. However, it is postulated that L-tryptophan is the most likely precursor, with tryptamine existing as an intermediate in the pathway. The following figure shows the proposed biosynthetic scheme for harmine. The Shikimate acid pathway yields the aromatic amino acid, L-tryptophan. Decarboxylation of L-tryptophan by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) produces tryptamine (I), which contains a nucleophilic center at the C-2 carbon of the indole ring due to the adjacent nitrogen atom that enables the participation in a Mannich-type reaction. Rearrangements enable the formation of a Schiff base from tryptamine, which then reacts with pyruvate in II to form a β-carboline carboxylic acid. The β-carboline carboxylic acid subsequently undergoes decarboxylation to produce 1-methyl β-carboline III. Hydroxylation followed by methylation in IV yields harmaline. The order of O-methylation and hydroxylation have been shown to be inconsequential to the formation of the harmaline intermediate. In the last step V, the oxidation of harmaline is accompanied by the loss of water and effectively generates harmine. The difficulty distinguishing between L-tryptophan and free tryptamine as the precursor of harmine biosynthesis originates from the presence of the serotonin biosynthetic pathway, which closely resembles that of harmine, yet necessitates the availability of free tryptamine as its precursor. As such, it is unclear if the decarboxylation of L-tryptophan, or the incorporation of pyruvate into the basic tryptamine structure is the first step of harmine biosynthesis. However, feeding experiments involving the feeding of one of tryptamine to hairy root cultures of P. harmala showed that the feeding of tryptamine yielded a great increase in serotonin levels with little to no effect on β-carboline levels, confirming that tryptamine is the precursor for serotonin, and indicating that it is likely only an intermediate in the biosynthesis of harmine; otherwise, comparable increases in harmine levels would have been observed. == Uses == === Monoamine oxidase inhibitor === Harmine is a RIMA, as it reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), but not MAO-B. Oral or intravenous harmine doses ranging from 30 to 300 mg may cause agitation, bradycardia or tachycardia, blurred vision, hypotension, paresthesias. Serum or plasma harmine concentrations may be measured as a confirmation of diagnosis. The plasma elimination half-life of harmine is on the order of 1–3 hours. Medically significant amounts of harmine occur in the plants Syrian rue and Banisteriopsis caapi. These plants also contain notable amounts of harmaline, which is also a RIMA. The psychoactive ayahuasca brew is made from B. caapi stem bark usually in combination with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) containing Psychotria viridis leaves. DMT is a psychedelic drug, but it is not orally active unless it is ingested with MAOIs. This makes harmine a vital component of the ayahuasca brew with regard to its ability to induce a psychedelic experience. Syrian rue or synthetic harmine is sometimes used to substitute B. caapi in the oral use of DMT. === Other === Harmine is a useful fluorescent pH indicator. As the pH of its local environment increases, the fluorescence emission of harmine decreases. Due to its MAO-A specific binding, carbon-11 labeled harmine can be used in positron emission tomography to study MAO-A dysregulation in several psychiatric and neurologic illnesses. Harmine was used as an antiparkinsonian medication since the late 1920s until the early 1950s. It was replaced by other medications. == Research == === Pancreatic islet cell proliferation === Harmine is currently the only known drug that induces proliferation (rapid mitosis and subsequent mass growth) of pancreatic alpha (α) and beta (β) cells in adult humans. These islet sub-cells are normally resistant to growth stimulation in the adult stage of a human's life, as the cell mass plateaus at around age 10 and remains virtually unchanged. == Adverse effects == A 2024 Phase 1 clinical trial investigating pharmaceutical-grade harmine hydrochloride in healthy adults found that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is approximately 2.7 mg/kg body weight. Below this threshold, harmine is generally well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Above 2.7 mg/kg, common adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, which typically occur 60-90 minutes after ingestion. Other reported effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired concentration. These effects are generally mild to moderate in severity and resolve within several hours. No serious adverse cardiovascular effects were observed at any dose tested (up to 500 mg), though rare instances of transient hypotension occurred during episodes of vomiting. Unlike some traditional preparations containing harmine (such as Ayahuasca), pure harmine did not cause diarrhea in study participants. The study found that adverse effects were more common in participants with lower body weight when given fixed doses, leading the researchers to conclude that 2.7 mg/kg represents a more useful threshold than fixed dosing. == Natural sources == Harmine is found in a wide variety of different organisms, most of which are plants. Alexander Shulgin lists about thirty different species known to contain harmine, including seven species of butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. The harmine-containing plants include tobacco, Peganum harmala, two species of passiflora, and numerous others. Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) contains harmine. In addition to B. caapi, at least three members of the Malpighiaceae contain harmine, including two more Banisteriopsis species and the plant Callaeum antifebrile. Callaway, Brito and Neves (2005) found harmine levels of 0.31–8.43% in B. caapi samples. The family Zygophyllaceae, which P. harmala belongs to, contains at least two other harmine-bearing plants: Peganum nigellastrum and Zygophyllum fabago. == History == J. Fritzsche was the first to isolate and name harmine. He isolated it from the husks of Peganum harmala seeds in 1848. The related harmaline was already isolated and named by Fr. Göbel in 1837 from the same plant. The pharmacology of harmine was not studied in detail until 1895. The structures of harmine and harmaline were determined in 1927 by Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske and colleagues. In 1905, the Colombian naturalist and chemist, Rafael Zerda-Bayón suggested the name telepathine to the then unknown hallucinogenic ingredient in ayahuasca brew. ""Telepathine"" comes from ""telepathy"", as Zerda-Bayón believed that ayahuasca induced telepathic visions. In 1923, the Colombian chemist, Guillermo Fischer-Cárdenas was the first to isolate harmine from Banisteriopsis caapi, which is an important herbal component of ayahuasca brew. He called the isolated harmine ""telepathine"". This was solely to honor Zerda-Bayón, as Fischer-Cárdenas found that telepathine had only mild non-hallucinogenic effects in humans. In 1925, Barriga Villalba, professor of chemistry at the University of Bogotá, isolated harmine from B. caapi, but named it ""yajéine"", which in some texts is written as ""yageine"". In 1927, F. Elger, who was a chemist working at Hoffmann-La Roche, isolated harmine from B. caapi. With the assistance of Professor Robert Robinson in Manchester, Elger showed that harmine (which was already isolated in 1848) was identical with telepathine and yajéine. In 1928, Louis Lewin isolated harmine from B. caapi, and named it ""banisterine"", but this supposedly novel compound was soon also shown to be harmine. Harmine was first patented by Jialin Wu and others who invented ways to produce new harmine derivatives with enhanced antitumor activity and lower toxicity to human nervous cells. == Legal status == === Australia === Harmala alkaloids are considered Schedule 9 prohibited substances under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).

At room temperature, cetyl alcohol takes the form of a waxy white solid or flakes. The name cetyl refers to whale oil (cetacea oil, from Latin: cetus, lit. 'whale', from Ancient Greek: κῆτος, romanized: kētos, lit. 'huge fish') from which it was first isolated. == Preparation == Cetyl alcohol was discovered in 1817 by the French chemist Michel Chevreul when he heated spermaceti, a waxy substance obtained from sperm whale oil, with caustic potash (potassium hydroxide). Flakes of cetyl alcohol were left behind on cooling. Modern production is based around the chemical reduction of ethyl palmitate. == Occurrence and uses == The ether chimyl alcohol, derived from cetyl alcohol and glycerol, is a component of some lipid membranes. Cetyl alcohol is used in the cosmetic industry as an opacifier in shampoos, or as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in the manufacture of skin creams and lotions. It is also employed as a lubricant for nuts and bolts, and is the active ingredient in some ""liquid pool covers"" (forming a non-volatile surface layer to reduce water evaporation, related latent vaporization heat loss, and thus to retain heat in the pool). Moreover, it can also be used as a non-ionic co-surfactant in emulsion applications. == Side effects == People who have eczema can be sensitive to cetyl alcohol, though this may be due to impurities rather than cetyl alcohol itself.

1258,"('Didanosine', 'Ddi')",Medical,"Didanosine, sold under the brand name Videx among others, is a medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. It is used in combination with other medications as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). It is of the reverse-transcriptase inhibitor class. Didanosine was first described in 1975 and approved for use in the United States in 1991. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse events with didanosine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, headache, and rash. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 21-26% of participants in key didanosine trials. Pancreatitis is rarely observed but has caused occasional fatalities, and has black box warning status. Other reported serious adverse events are retinal changes, optic neuritis and alterations of liver functions. The risk of some of these serious adverse events is increased by drinking alcohol. In February 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that patients using didanosine (Videx) are at risk for a rare but potentially fatal liver disorder, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. == Drug interactions == A significant interaction has also been recorded with allopurinol, and administration of these drugs together should be avoided. Reduction in indinavir and delavirdine plasma levels have been shown to occur when administered simultaneously with didanosine; these drugs should be administered at different times. Ketoconazole, itraconazole, ciprofloxacin should be administered at a different time from didanosine due to interactions with the buffering agent. Administration with drugs with overlapping toxicity, such as zalcitabine and stavudine, is not recommended. Alcohol can exacerbate didanosine's toxicity, and avoiding drinking alcohol while taking didanosine is recommended. == Resistance == Drug resistance to didanosine does develop, though slower than to zidovudine (ZDV). The most common mutation observed in vivo is L74V in the viral pol gene, which confers cross-resistance to zalcitabine; other mutations observed include K65R and M184V . == Mechanism of action == Didanosine (ddI) is a nucleoside analogue of adenosine. It differs from other nucleoside analogues, because it does not have any of the regular bases, instead it has hypoxanthine attached to the sugar ring. Within the cell, ddI is phosphorylated to the active metabolite of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, ddATP, by cellular enzymes. Like other anti-HIV nucleoside analogs, it acts as a chain terminator by incorporation and inhibits viral reverse transcriptase by competing with natural dATP. == Pharmacokinetics == Oral absorption of didanosine is fairly low (42%) but rapid. Food substantially reduces didanosine bioavailability, and the drug should be administered on an empty stomach. The half-life in plasma is only 1.5 hours, but in the intracellular environment more than 12 hours. An enteric-coated formulation is now marketed as well. Elimination is predominantly renal; the kidneys actively secrete didanosine, the amount being 20% of the oral dose. == History == The related pro-drug of didanosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), was initially synthesized by Morris J. Robins (professor of Organic Chemistry at Brigham Young University) and R.K. Robins in 1964. Subsequently, Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that ddA and ddI could inhibit HIV replication in the test tube and conducted initial clinical trials showing that didanosine had activity in patients infected with HIV. On behalf of the NCI, they were awarded patents on these activities. Since the NCI does not market products directly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a ten-year exclusive license to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMS) to market and sell ddI as Videx tablets. Didanosine became the second drug approved for the treatment of HIV infection in many other countries, including in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 9 October 1991. Its FDA approval helped bring down the price of zidovudine (ZDV), the initial anti-HIV drug. Didanosine has weak acid stability and is easily damaged by stomach acid. Therefore, the original formula approved by the FDA used chewable tablets that included an antacid buffering compound to neutralize stomach acid. The chewable tablets were not only large and fragile, they also were foul-tasting and the buffering compound would cause diarrhea. Although the FDA had not approved the original formulation for once-a-day dosing it was possible for some people to take it that way. At the end of its ten-year license, BMS re-formulated Videx as Videx EC and patented that, which reformulation the FDA approved in 2000. The new formulation is a smaller capsule containing coated microspheres instead of using a buffering compound. It is approved by the FDA for once-a-day dosing. Also at the end of that ten-year period, the NIH licensed didanosine to Barr Laboratories under a non-exclusive license, and didanosine became the first generic anti-HIV drug marketed in the United States. One of the patents for ddI expired in the United States on 29 August 2006, but other patents extend beyond that time. == References == == Further reading ==",Didanosine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.6756979322235566e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013195598148740828)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didanosine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Didanosine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didanosine?utm_source=openai')])"

1260,"('Tetrahydrozoline (hydrochloride)', 'Tetryzoline (hydrochloride)', 'Tetrahydrozoline', 'Tetryzoline', 'Tetryzolin')",Medical,"Tetryzoline (INN), also known as tetrahydrozoline, is a drug used in some over-the-counter eye drops and nasal sprays. Tetryzoline was patented in 1954, and came into medical use in 1959. == Side effects == Tetryzoline eye drops may cause blurred vision, eye irritation and dilated pupils. Tetryzoline is not suitable for prolonged use as its vasoconstrictive effects within the eye eventually decrease or stop. If tolerance to the drug has developed, ceasing its use may cause a rebound effect and increase redness of the eyes — ⁠a vasodilatory effect. Intranasal use of tetryzoline may cause transient burning, stinging, or dryness of the mucosa and sneezing. Prolonged intranasal use often causes opposite effects in the form of rebound congestion with effects such as chronic redness, swelling and rhinitis. Prolonged use thus may result in overuse of the drug. In children, it might cause profound sedation. === Overdose === Overdose most often causes slow heart rate. Respiratory depression, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, hypothermia, brief episodes of high blood pressure, drowsiness, headaches and vomiting may also occur. In serious cases some of these effects may result in circulatory shock. Most often overdoses occur in children who have ingested the drug. There is no antidote for tetryzoline or other similar imidazoline analogue poisoning, but the symptoms can be alleviated. With treatment, death is rare. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tetryzoline is an alpha agonist for the alpha-1 receptor. This action relieves the redness of the eye caused by minor ocular irritants. Moreover, to treat allergic conjunctivitis, tetryzoline can be combined in a solution with antazoline. === Pharmacokinetics === In a healthy person, the biological half-life of tetryzoline is approximately 6 hours, and it is excreted in urine, chemically unchanged, at least in part. In one study, 10 people were given two drops of 0.5 mg/mL of tetryzoline eye drops (0.025–0.05 mg) at 0 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, and 12 hrs. Within a 24-hour time window, since the last dose of tetryzoline, the blood serum concentration of tetryzoline in the test subjects was 0.068-0.380 ng/mL and the urine concentration was 13–210 ng/mL. Both the blood and the urine levels of tetryzoline reached their maximums approximately 9 hrs after the last dose. These fluid-concentration levels correspond to normal ocular use of tetryzoline; thus, greater concentrations of tetryzoline in the blood and the urine of the user can indicate misuse of the drug or of poisoning with the drug. == Chemistry == Chemically, tetryzoline is a derivative of imidazoline. It has two enantiomers. == Society and culture == === Names === Tetryzoline is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN). === Urban legend === An urban legend suggests that tetryzoline can cause violent diarrhea if given orally, such as by putting a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting person's beverage. However, the actual results of the prank may be worse, varying from severe nausea and vomiting to seizures or a coma. Larger doses can cause death. Diarrhea is not a side effect. === Criminal use === In late August 2018, a South Carolina woman was charged with murdering her husband by putting eye drops containing tetryzoline in his drinking water. An autopsy found a high concentration of tetryzoline in his body. Tetryzoline has been used as a date rape drug in a number of cases due to its ability to cause dizziness and unconsciousness. In 2018, a 62 year-old woman in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, died in an apparent overdose or suicide involving tetryzoline and other substances; in November 2023 her caregiver was convicted of first-degree murder, following the allegation that her death was caused by a water bottle laced with Visine. In 2019, a North Carolina paramedic was accused of using tetryzoline eye drops to cause the death of his wife. The blood sample results showed about 30–40 times higher than the therapeutic level of tetryzoline. === Use in Media === In the 9-1-1 Season 4 Episode 13 Suspicion, a mother, Sheila, poisons her son, Charlie, with tetryzoline eye drops by putting it into his food to make him seem sick and gain donations as a form of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Charlie later poisons Sheila the same way with the same medication. == References ==",Tetryzoline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.427741704508662e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02976534329354763)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetryzoline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Tetryzoline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetryzoline?utm_source=openai')])"
1261,"('Pentoxifylline', 'Oxpentifylline', 'Trental', 'Pentoxifyllin', 'Torental')",Medical,"Pentoxifylline, also known as oxpentifylline, is a xanthine derivative used as a drug to treat muscle pain in people with peripheral artery disease. It is generic and sold under many brand names worldwide. == Medical uses == Its primary use in medicine is to reduce pain, cramping, numbness, or weakness in the arms or legs which occurs due to intermittent claudication, a form of muscle pain resulting from peripheral artery diseases. This is its only FDA, MHRA and TGA-labelled indication. However, pentoxifylline is also recommended for off-label use as an adjunct to compression bandaging for the treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) as this has been shown to improve healing rates. Pentoxifylline has been tested for use in sarcoidosis patients as an alternative or compliment to prednisone and other steroids, as the drug can inhibit excess levels of TNF-a, which is associated with granuloma formation. It has further been used to treat immunologic reactions to leprosy with some success. Benefit in alcoholic hepatitis was shown, with some studies demonstrating a reduction in risk of hepatorenal syndrome. For in vitro fertilization, Pentoxifylline has been used to improve sperm quality and motility and as safe oral drug in the treatment of male infertility with erectile dysfunction. An interesting off-label indication of pentoxifylline is the supportive treatment of distal diabetic neuropathy, where it can be added, for example, to thioctic acid or gabapentin. Theoretically, it can (among other things) act prophylactically against ulcerative changes of the lower limbs associated with chronically decompensated diabetes. Patients with measurable impairment in arterial supply are more likely to benefit from adjunctive treatment with pentoxifylline. The administration of higher doses of pentoxifylline in hospitalization for complications of distal diabetic neuropathy is usually conditioned by the joint agreement of the neurologist with the physicians of internal medicine (diabetology and angiology). The combination of tocopherol and pentoxifylline has been evaluated for the treatment of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. Pentoxifylline may be used transdermally for cellulite treatment. == Adverse effects == Common side effects are belching, bloating, stomach discomfort or upset, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, dizziness, and flushing. Uncommon and rare side effects include angina, palpitations, hypersensitivity, itchiness, rash, hives, bleeding, hallucinations, arrhythmias, and aseptic meningitis. Contraindications include intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthine derivatives, recent retinal or cerebral haemorrhage, and risk factors for haemorrhage. == Mechanism == Like other methylated xanthine derivatives, pentoxifylline is a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cAMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. In addition, pentoxifylline improves red blood cell deformability (known as a haemorrheologic effect), reduces blood viscosity and decreases the potential for platelet aggregation and blood clot formation. Pentoxifylline is also an antagonist at adenosine 2 receptors. == Research == There is some evidence that pentoxifylline can lower the levels of some biomarkers in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis but evidence is insufficient to determine if the drug is safe and effective for this use. Animal studies have been conducted exploring the use of pentoxifylline for erectile dysfunction and hearing loss. Human studies have been conducted for Peyronie's disease. Pentoxifylline, in combination with tocopherol and clodronate, has been found to heal refractory osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, and to be prophylactic against osteoradionecrosis. In a Cochrane systematic review on the use of pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication in 2015, the following was concluded ""The quality of included studies was generally low, and very large variability between studies was noted in reported findings including duration of trials, doses of pentoxifylline and distances participants could walk at the start of trials. Most included studies did not report on randomisation techniques or how treatment allocation was concealed, did not provide adequate information to permit judgement of selective reporting and did not report blinding of outcome assessors. Given all these factors, the role of pentoxifylline in intermittent claudication remains uncertain, although this medication was generally well tolerated by participants"". == See also == Lisofylline, an active metabolite of pentoxifylline Propentofylline Cilostazol, a PDE-3 inhibitor with better evidence for intermittent claudication on the Cochrane review cited above. == References == == External links == Pentoxifylline MedlinePlus Drug Information",Torental,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008323303773067892), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024899214040488005)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is the main storage form of glucose in the human body. Glycogen functions as one of three regularly used forms of energy reserves, creatine phosphate being for very short-term, glycogen being for short-term and the triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat) being for long-term storage. Protein, broken down into amino acids, is seldom used as a main energy source except during starvation and glycolytic crisis (see bioenergetic systems). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up 5–6% of the organ's fresh weight: the liver of an adult, weighing 1.5 kg, can store roughly 100–120 grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass): the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo. The amount of glycogen stored in the body mostly depends on oxidative type 1 fibres, physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Different levels of resting muscle glycogen are reached by changing the number of glycogen particles, rather than increasing the size of existing particles though most glycogen particles at rest are smaller than their theoretical maximum. Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times; in fasting individuals, blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores, primarily from the liver (glycogen in skeletal muscle is mainly used as an immediate source of energy for that muscle rather than being used to maintain physiological blood glucose levels). Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself; however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake from the blood, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues. Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system. The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals. Glycogen is an analogue of starch, a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to amylopectin (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa. == Structure == Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 residues per one molecule of glycogen. Like amylopectin, glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain. Each glycogen is essentially a ball of glucose trees, with around 12 layers, centered on a glycogenin protein, with three kinds of glucose chains: A, B, and C. There is only one C-chain, attached to the glycogenin. This C-chain is formed by the self-glucosylation of the glycogenin, forming a short primer chain. From the C-chain grows out B-chains, and from B-chains branch out B- and A-chains. The B-chains have on average 2 branch points, while the A-chains are terminal, thus unbranched. On average, each chain has length 12, tightly constrained to be between 11 and 15. All A-chains reach the spherical surface of the glycogen. Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 millimoles (18 mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen. Glucose is an osmotic molecule, and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified. Glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule, so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure. == Functions == === Liver === As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or ""fed"" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases. After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel. Glucagon, another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources). === Muscle === Muscle glycogen appears to function as a reserve of quickly available phosphorylated glucose, in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, for muscle cells. Glycogen contained within skeletal muscle cells are primarily in the form of β particles. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs. Skeletal muscle needs ATP (provides energy) for muscle contraction and relaxation, in what is known as the sliding filament theory. Skeletal muscle relies predominantly on glycogenolysis for the first few minutes as it transitions from rest to activity, as well as throughout high-intensity aerobic activity and all anaerobic activity. During anaerobic activity, such as weightlifting and isometric exercise, the phosphagen system (ATP-PCr) and muscle glycogen are the only substrates used as they do not require oxygen nor blood flow. Different bioenergetic systems produce ATP at different speeds, with ATP produced from muscle glycogen being much faster than fatty acid oxidation. The level of exercise intensity determines how much of which substrate (fuel) is used for ATP synthesis also. Muscle glycogen can supply a much higher rate of substrate for ATP synthesis than blood glucose. During maximum intensity exercise, muscle glycogen can supply 40 mmol glucose/kg wet weight/minute, whereas blood glucose can supply 4 - 5 mmol. Due to its high supply rate and quick ATP synthesis, during high-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking, jogging, or running), the higher the exercise intensity, the more the muscle cell produces ATP from muscle glycogen. This reliance on muscle glycogen is not only to provide the muscle with enough ATP during high-intensity exercise, but also to maintain blood glucose homeostasis (that is, to not become hypoglycaemic by the muscles needing to extract far more glucose from the blood than the liver can provide). A deficit of muscle glycogen leads to muscle fatigue known as ""hitting the wall"" or ""the bonk"" (see below under glycogen depletion). == Structure Type == In 1999, Meléndez et al claimed that the structure of glycogen is optimal under a particular metabolic constraint model, where the structure was suggested to be ""fractal"" in nature. However, research by Besford et al used small angle X-ray scattering experiments accompanied by branching theory models to show that glycogen is a randomly hyperbranched polymer nanoparticle. Glycogen is not fractal in nature. This has been subsequently verified by others who have performed Monte Carlo simulations of glycogen particle growth, and shown that the molecular density reaches a maximum near the centre of the nanoparticle structure, not at the periphery (contradicting a fractal structure that would have greater density at the periphery). == History == Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a ""ferment"" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called ""la matière glycogène"", or ""sugar-forming substance"". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, M.A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of (C6H10O5)n was established by August Kekulé in 1858. Sanson, M. A. ""Note sur la formation physiologique du sucre dans l’economie animale."" Comptes rendus des seances de l’Academie des Sciences 44 (1857): 1323-5. == Metabolism == === Synthesis === Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the nonreducing end of the glycogen chain. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains. === Breakdown === Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate: In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100. Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6 phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the α(1→6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates: G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel. G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5 carbon sugars. In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase. This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway. == Clinical relevance == === Disorders of glycogen metabolism === The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Various inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes or transport proteins necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases. === Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise === Long-distance athletes, such as marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as ""hitting the wall"" in running and ""bonking"" in cycling. Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways: First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting, low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel, sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores. This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion. When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established. === Nanomedicine === Glycogen nanoparticles have been investigated as potential drug delivery systems. == See also == Bioenergetic systems Chitin Peptidoglycan == References == == External links == ""Glycogen storage disease"".

1263,"('Dimesna', ""Ethanesulfonic acid, 2,2'-dithiobis-"", 'Bis(2-sulfoethyl)disulfide', 'Coenzyme m disulfide', ""Omega,omega'-ethanedisulfidedisulfonic acid"")",Medical," The chemical reduction of the disulfide homodimer dimesna to its constituent mesna moieties is essential for its mitigation of nephrotoxicity associated with cisplatin and ifosfamide anticancer therapies and enhancement of dialytic clearance of the cardiovascular risk factor homocysteine. The objective of this study was to investigate potential enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms of intracellular dimesna reduction. Similar to endogenous intracellular disulfides, dimesna undergoes thiol-disulfide exchange with thiolate anion-forming sulfhydryl groups via the two-step SN2 reaction. Determination of equilibrium constants of dimesna reduction when mixed with cysteine or glutathione provided a mechanistic explanation for dramatic cysteine and homocysteine depletion, but sparing of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione, previously observed during mesna therapy. Dimesna was reduced by recombinant enzymes of the thioredoxin system; however, oxidation of NADPH by the glutaredoxin system was only observed in the presence of combined dimesna and reduced glutathione, suggesting formation of oxidized glutathione following an initial non-enzymatic reduction of dimesna. Production of mesna by enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms in HeLa cell lysate following dimesna incubation was demonstrated by a loss in mesna production following protein denaturation and prediction of residual non-enzymatic mesna production by mathematical modeling of thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Reaction modeling also revealed that mixed disulfides make up a significant proportion of intracellular thiols, supporting their role in providing additional nephroprotection, independent of direct platinum conjugation. Mesna and its dimer, dimesna, are coadministered for mitigation of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities, respectively. Dimesna is selectively reduced to mesna in the kidney, producing its protective effects. In vitro screens of uptake and efflux transporters revealed saturable uptake by renal organic anion transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OAT4. Efflux transporters breast cancer resistance protein; multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1); multidrug resistance proteins MRP1, MRP2, MRP4, and MRP5; and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) significantly reduced dimesna accumulation. Further investigation demonstrated that renal apical efflux transporters MATE1, MRP2, and Pgp were also capable of mesna efflux. Administration of OAT inhibitor probenecid to healthy subjects significantly increased combined mesna and dimesna plasma exposure (91% ± 34%) while decreasing the renal clearance due to net secretion (67.0% ± 12.7%) and steady-state volume of distribution (45.2% ± 13.4%). Thus, the kidney represents a significant sink of total mesna, whereas function of renal drug transporters facilitates clearance in excess of glomerular filtration rate and likely the presence of active mesna in the urine. Loss of renal transporter function due to genetic variability or drug-drug interactions may decrease the efficacy of chemoprotectants, increasing the risk of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities. Mesna is administered with ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide to reduce the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis. In the present model of mesna metabolism and disposition, mesna is rapidly and irreversibly oxidized to dimesna in the plasma, passes unchanged through the liver, and is then reduced by the kidney and excreted. Our detection of a high ratio of mesna to dimesna in the plasma of clinical samples led us to reinvestigate the hepatic metabolism of mesna and dimesna. We perfused isolated rat livers from female Sprague Dawley rats with protein-free buffered solution containing dimesna at concentrations observed during therapy. In single-pass perfusions, each liver was perfused with up to three dimesna concentrations during consecutive 20-min periods. Recirculating perfusions were used to study single supratherapeutic concentrations of dimesna or mesna. Mesna and dimesna concentrations were measured by specific chromatographic procedures. Dimesna reduction, adjusted by the effluent flow rate and liver weight (0.4-58.5 nmol/min/g liver), correlated closely by linear regression (r = 0.98; n = 36) to the perfused dimesna concentration (4.2-249 microM), indicating a clearance of 0.20 ml/min/g liver. The concentration of dimesna that entered the liver closely matched the summed concentration of mesna and dimesna emerging in the effluent perfusate (single-pass experiments: slope, 0.98; intercept, -0.30; r = 1.00; n = 31). Only trace amounts of unidentified thiols were detected in the bile during recirculation of perfusates with 1 mM mesna or 250 microM dimesna. The effluent mesna concentration correlated inversely with the flow rate, which was consistent with a low extraction ratio in the perfusion model. These data suggested that the dimesna reduction rate was limited by hepatic uptake. Dimesna reduction was decreased by agents that deplete glutathione. Pretreatment of rats with up to 100 mg/kg ifosfamide did not impair hepatic dimesna reduction. In control experiments, dimesna was not reduced during recirculation through the apparatus without a liver. Mesna was oxidized to dimesna during oxygenation of the perfusate in the reservoir, but mesna injected directly into the perfusate just before entry into the liver passed unchanged into the effluent. Extrapolation of the dimesna clearance data from the perfusion model to humans suggests that hepatic dimesna reduction may counterbalance the rapid oxidation of mesna in plasma. The proposed equilibrium is consistent with clinical observations and suggests a new model for mesna metabolism and disposition.",Dimesna,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.749814019713085e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012687736889347434), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860220476984978)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.clincosm.com/trial/dimesna-solid-tumors-undergoing-cisplatin-paclitaxel,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/230R951Y4D,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6401591/ ', [])"

This review is based on a PubMed search for all articles on fasiglifam and TAK-875. The pharmacology of fasiglifam is reviewed, focusing on studies in human volunteers and patients with T2DM. All published clinical trials with fasiglifam in T2DM are summarized, including two 12-week dose-ranging studies (one from Japan and the other from Central and North America), both of which employed glimepiride as an active comparator. Fasiglifam, a novel glucose-dependent insulin secretagogue, is the first GPR40 agonist to enter Phase III clinical evaluation. It has been shown to produce statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in glycemic control in patients with early-stage T2DM. Furthermore, its tolerability and safety profile was comparable to placebo and no dose-related adverse effects were observed. Importantly, fasiglifam was comparable to placebo with regards to the incidence of hypoglycemia and it produced significantly fewer episodes compared with glimepiride. Fasiglifam is an interesting and novel oral anti-diabetic agent which may offer new avenues for treating T2DM, but clearly more thorough clinical evaluation is still needed. Fasiglifam, a potent and highly selective agonist of G protein-coupled receptor 40, was developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, phase III clinical programs were terminated owing to liver safety concerns. Fasiglifam-related liver toxicity was also observed in repeat-dose dog toxicology studies, characterized by granulomatous inflammation with crystal formation in the liver and/or bile ducts. These histopathological changes were not observed in rat toxicology studies. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of dog liver sections obtained from a repeat-dose toxicology study indicated that the crystalline material in the affected dog liver contained fasiglifam and fasiglifam glucuronide (fasiglifam-G).

1266,"('Acetazolamide', 'Diamox', 'N-(5-sulfamoyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)acetamide', 'Acetazolamid', 'Acetamox')",Medical,"Acetazolamide, sold under the trade name Diamox among others, is a medication used to treat glaucoma, epilepsy, acute mountain sickness, periodic paralysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (raised brain pressure of unclear cause), heart failure and to alkalinize urine. It may be used long term for the treatment of open angle glaucoma and short term for acute angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be carried out. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Acetazolamide is a first generation carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and it decreases the ocular fluid and osmolality in the eye to decrease intraocular pressure. Common side effects include numbness, ringing in the ears, loss of appetite, vomiting, and sleepiness. It is not recommended in those with significant kidney problems, liver problems, or who are allergic to sulfonamides. Acetazolamide is in the diuretic and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor families of medication. It works by decreasing the formation of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and water. Acetazolamide came into medical use in 1952. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Acetazolamide is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is used in the treatment of glaucoma, drug-induced edema, heart failure-induced edema, epilepsy and in reducing intraocular pressure after surgery. It has also been used in the treatment of altitude sickness, Ménière's disease, increased intracranial pressure and neuromuscular disorders. Acetazolamide is also used in the critical care setting to stimulate respiratory drive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as an off-label indication. In epilepsy, the main use of acetazolamide is in menstrual-related epilepsy and as an add on to other treatments in refractory epilepsy. Though various websites on the internet report that acetazolamide can be used to treat dural ectasia in individuals with Marfan syndrome, the only supporting evidence for this assertion exists from a small study of 14 patients which was not peer-reviewed or submitted for publication. Several published cases of intracranial hypotension related to Marfan syndrome would warrant caution in using acetazolamide in these patients unless there is a clear indication, as it could lower intracranial pressure further. A 2012 review and meta-analysis found that there was ""limited supporting evidence"" but that acetazolamide ""may be considered"" for the treatment of central (as opposed to obstructive) sleep apnea. It has also been used to prevent methotrexate-induced kidney damage by alkalinizing the urine, hence speeding up methotrexate excretion by increasing its solubility in urine. There is some evidence to support its use to prevent hemiplegic migraine. === High altitude sickness === Acetazolamide is also used for the treatment of acute mountain sickness. In the prevention or treatment of mountain sickness, acetazolamide inhibits the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb bicarbonate, the conjugate base of carbonic acid. Increasing the amount of bicarbonate excreted in the urine leads to acidification of the blood. Because the body senses CO2 concentration indirectly via blood pH (increase in CO2 causes a decrease in pH), acidifying the blood through decreased renal reabsorption of bicarbonate is sensed as an increase in CO2. This, in turn, causes the body to increase minute ventilation (the amount of air breathed per minute) in order to ""breathe off"" CO2, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. Acetazolamide is not an immediate cure for acute mountain sickness; rather, it speeds up (or, when taking before traveling, forces the body to early start) part of the acclimatization process which in turn helps to relieve symptoms. Acetazolamide is still effective if started early in the course of mountain sickness. As prevention, it is started one day before travel to altitude and continued for the first two days at altitude. === Pregnancy and lactation === Acetazolamide is pregnancy category B3 in Australia, which means that studies in rats, mice and rabbits in which acetazolamide was given intravenously or orally caused an increased risk of fetal malformations, including defects of the limbs. Despite this, there is insufficient evidence from studies in humans to either support or discount this evidence. Limited data are available on the effects of nursing mothers taking acetazolamide. Therapeutic doses create low levels in breast milk and are not expected to cause problems in infants. == Side effects == Common adverse effects of acetazolamide include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black stool, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia). Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias. === Contraindications === Contraindications include: Hyperchloremic acidosis Hypokalemia (low blood potassium) Hyponatremia (low blood sodium) Adrenal insufficiency Impaired kidney function Hypersensitivity to acetazolamide or other sulphonamides. Marked liver disease or impairment of liver function, including cirrhosis because of the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetazolamide decreases ammonia clearance. == Interactions == It is possible that it might interact with: Amphetamines, because it increases the pH of the renal tubular urine, hence reducing the clearance of amphetamines. Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors—potential for additive inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase and hence potential for toxicity. Ciclosporin, may increase plasma levels of ciclosporin. Antifolates such as trimethoprim, methotrexate, pemetrexed and raltitrexed. Hypoglycemics, acetazolamide can both increase or decrease blood glucose levels. Lithium, increases excretion, hence reducing therapeutic effect. Methenamine compounds, reduces the urinary excretion of methenamines. Phenytoin, reduces phenytoin excretion, hence increasing the potential for toxicity. Primidone, reduces plasma levels of primidone. Hence reducing anticonvulsant effect. Quinidine, reduces urinary excretion of quinidine, hence increasing the potential for toxicity. Salicylates, potential for severe toxicity. Sodium bicarbonate, potential for kidney stone formation. Anticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, may have their effects potentiated by acetazolamide. == Mechanism of action == Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, hence causing the accumulation of carbonic acid. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found in red blood cells and many other tissues that catalyses the following reaction: H2CO3 ⇌ H2O + CO2 hence lowering blood pH, by means of the following reaction that carbonic acid undergoes: H2CO3 ⇌ HCO3− + H+ which has a pKa of 6.3. The mechanism of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. A general side effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is loss of potassium due to this function. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul breathing), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. In the eye this results in a reduction in aqueous humour. Bicarbonate (HCO3−) has a pKa of 10.3 with carbonate (CO32−), far further from physiologic pH (7.35–7.45), and so it is more likely to accept a proton than to donate one, but it is also far less likely for it to do either, thus bicarbonate will be the major species at physiological pH. Under normal conditions in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, most of the carbonic acid (H2CO3) produced intracellularly by the action of carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates in the cell to bicarbonate (HCO3−) and an H+ ion (a proton), as previously mentioned. The bicarbonate (HCO3−) exits at the basal portion of the cell via sodium (Na+) symport and chloride (Cl−) antiport and re-enters circulation, where it may accept a proton if blood pH decreases, thus acting as a weak, basic buffer. The remaining H+ left over from the intracellular production of carbonic acid (H2CO3) exits the apical (urinary lumen) portion of the cell by Na+ antiport, acidifying the urine. There, it may join with another bicarbonate (HCO3−) that dissociated from its H+ in the lumen of the urinary space only after exiting the proximal convoluted kidney cells/glomerulus as carbonic acid (H2CO3) because bicarbonate (HCO3−) itself can not diffuse across the cell membrane in its polar state. This will replenish carbonic acid (H2CO3) so that it then may be reabsorbed into the cell as itself or CO2 and H2O (produced via a luminal carbonic anhydrase). As a result of this whole process, there is a greater net balance of H+ in the urinary lumen than bicarbonate (HCO3−), and so this space is more acidic than physiologic pH. Thus, there is an increased likelihood that any bicarbonate (HCO3−) that was left over in the lumen diffuses back into the cell as carbonic acid, CO2, or H2O. In short, under normal conditions, the net effect of carbonic anhydrase in the urinary lumen and cells of the proximal convoluted tubule is to acidify the urine and transport bicarbonate (HCO3−) into the body. Another effect is excretion of Cl− as it is needed to maintain electroneutrality in the lumen, as well as the reabsorption of Na+ into the body. Thus, by disrupting this process with acetazolamide, urinary Na+ and bicarbonate (HCO3−) are increased, and urinary H+ and Cl− are decreased.

1270,"('N-acetyl-l-tyrosine', 'Ac-tyr-oh', 'N-acetyl-tyrosine', 'Acetyl tyrosine', 'Tyrosine, n-acetyl-')","Endogenous, Medical"," Under stress conditions, mitochondria release low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggers a cytoprotective response, called ""mitohormesis"". It still remains unclear how mitochondria respond to stress-derived stimuli and release a low level of ROS. Here, we show that N-acetyl-l-tyrosine (NAT) functions as a plausible intrinsic factor responsible for these tasks in stressed animals. NAT is present in the blood or hemolymph of healthy animals, and its concentrations increase in response to heat stress. Pretreatment with NAT significantly increases the stress tolerance of tested insects and mice. Analyses using Drosophila larvae and cultured cells demonstrate that the hormetic effects are triggered by transient NAT-induced perturbation of mitochondria, which causes a small increase in ROS production and leads to sequential retrograde responses: NAT-dependent FoxO activation increases in the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and Keap1. Moreover, we find that NAT represses tumor growth, possibly via the activation of Keap1. In sum, we propose that NAT is a vital endogenous molecule that could serve as a triggering factor for mitohormesis. N-acetyl tyrosine (NAT) is hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase and the N-acetyl dopa formed is oxidized by the enzyme to N-acetyl dopaquinone (lambda max = 390 +/- 10 nm). H2O2 and NH2OH each shortened the lag period of NAT hydroxylation by the enzyme. H2O2 had an effect on the changes with time in the spectrum of product(s) formed and on the spectrum of the final product(s) obtained when NAT was hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase, in a manner suggesting that H2O2 converts N-acetyl dopaquinone to a pink-violet product(s) (lambda max = 490 nm), whereas such a product(s) was not formed in the absence of H2O2. A pink-violet product(s) (lambda max 490 +/- 20 nm) was also formed when NAT was hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase in the presence of NH2OH or para amino benzoic acid (PABA), probably as a result of an interaction between N-acetyl dopaquinone and NH2OH or PABA forming mono- or di-oximes. Kojic acid (5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl)-4H-pyran-4-one) inhibited effectively the rate of NAT hydroxylation by mushroom tyrosinase in the absence or presence of H2O2. When NAT was oxidized by the enzyme in the absence of kojic acid, N-acetyl dopaquinone was formed at once and a shoulder at 490-530 nm appeared later. Under identical conditions but in the presence of kojic acid, a yellow product(s), characterized by a peak at 320 +/- 10 nm, was detected, suggesting that N-acetyl dopaquinone oxidizes kojic acid to the yellow product(s). Maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one), a gamma-pyrone derivative structurally related to kojic acid, also inhibited the rate of NAT hydroxylation by mushroom tyrosinase. The addition of maltol at the plateau phase of the reaction resulted in an immediate decline in absorbance at 400 nm, suggesting that maltol conjugates with N-acetyl dopaquinone, yielding a product(s) characterized by a lower extinction coefficient at 400 nm than that of N-acetyl dopaquinone alone. The final brown-red product(s) formed when NAT was hydroxylated by mushroom tyrosinase was bleached in the presence of ascorbic acid or H2O2. The tyrosine content of parenteral solutions is limited by poor tyrosine solubility. N-acetyl-L-tyrosine has excellent solubility and is a potential source of intravenous tyrosine. Infusion of N-acetyl-U-14C-L-tyrosine as part of a total parenteral nutrition regimen in the rat at a level of 0.5 mmol/kg/day resulted in rapid labeling of tissue tyrosine pools, production of 14CO2, incorporation of 14C-labeled tyrosine into protein, and modest urinary losses (8.3%). Plasma tyrosine levels, however, remained at fasting values (73.8 +/- 5.40 microM). Infusion of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine at 2 mmol/kg/day increased plasma tyrosine above fasting levels (141 +/- 16.1 microM), resulted in a rapid labeling of tissue tyrosine pools, production of 14CO2, and incorporation of 14C-labeled tyrosine into protein. However, urinary losses were higher (16.8%). Rapid utilization of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine was noted at both infusion levels.

It is a derivative and prodrug of sirolimus. == Mechanism of action == Temsirolimus is a specific inhibitor of mTOR and interferes with the synthesis of proteins that regulate proliferation, growth, and survival of tumor cells. Though temsirolimus shows activity on its own, it is also known to be converted to sirolimus (rapamycin) in vivo; therefore, its activity may be more attributed to its metabolite rather than the prodrug itself (despite claims to the contrary by the manufacturer). Treatment with temsirolimus leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, and also inhibits tumor angiogenesis by reducing synthesis of VEGF. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a kinase enzyme inside the cell that collects and interprets the numerous and varied growth and survival signals received by tumor cells. When the kinase activity of mTOR is activated, its downstream effectors, the synthesis of cell cycle proteins such as cyclin D and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) are increased. HIF-1a then stimulates VEGF. Whether or not mTOR kinase is activated, determines whether the tumor cell produces key proteins needed for proliferation, growth, survival, and angiogenesis. mTOR is activated in tumor cells by various mechanisms including growth factor surface receptor tyrosine kinases, oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes. These activating factors are known to be important for malignant transformation and progression. mTOR is particularly important in the biology of renal cancer (RCC) owing to its function in regulating HIF-1a levels. Mutation or loss of the von Hippel Lindau tumor-suppressor gene is common in RCC and is manifested by reduced degradation of HIF-1a. In RCC tumors, activated mTOR further exacerbates accumulation of HIF-1a by increasing synthesis of this transcription factor and its angiogenic target gene products. == Efficacy == In an international three-arm phase III study with 626 previously untreated, poor-prognosis patients, temsirolimus, interferon-α and the combination of both agents was compared. Median overall survival improved significantly in the temsirolimus group (10.9 months) compared with interferon-α group (7.3 months) and the combination group (8.4 months). Further studies are needed to determine the role of temsirolimus in the first-line treatment of patients with a more favorable prognosis, how it can be combined with other targeted agents and as sequential therapy with sunitinib or sorafenib. == Adverse reactions == The toxicity profile is based on what was found in the phase III trial. adverse reaction fatigue skin rash mucositis hematologic abnormalities hemoglobin decreased lymphocytes decreased laboratory abnormalities triglycerides increased glucose increased phosphorus decreased Temsirolimus has been generally well tolerated in clinical settings by patients with advanced RCC. In patients with RCC, the adverse effect profile of temsirolimus is primarily metabolic in nature, with minimal impact on QoL compared with the commonly seen side-effects with oral multikinase inhibitors. Temsirolimus' high level of specificity for mTOR likely contributes to the tolerability of temsirolimus. However, temsirolimus increases mortality in cancer patients. == Lung toxicity == Temsirolimus is associated with lung toxicity, and the risk of developing this complication may be increased among subjects with abnormal pre-treatment pulmonary functions or history of lung disease. The risk of interstitial lung disease is increased with temsirolimus doses greater than 25 mg, symptoms of which may include dry cough, fever, eosinophilia, chest pain, and dyspnea on exertion. Toxicity usually occurred early (within days to weeks) or late (months to years) after treatment. == Dosing == Although infusion reactions can occur while temsirolimus is being administered, most hypersensitivity reactions occurring on the same day as temsirolimus administration were not severe. Antihistamine pretreatment (e.g. 25–50 mg diphenhydramine, 30 minutes prior to administration) is recommended to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction. == See also == Discovery and development of mTOR inhibitors == References == == External links == ""Temsirolimus"".

1276,"('Reboxetine (mesylate)', 'Reboxetine', 'Vestra', '(2r)-2-[(r)-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)-phenylmethyl]morpholine', 'Norebox')",Medical,"Reboxetine, sold under the brand name Edronax among others, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (sNRI) medication marketed as an antidepressant by Pfizer for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder, although it has also been used off-label for panic disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is approved for use in many countries worldwide, but has not been approved for use in the United States. == Medical uses == === Major depressive disorder === There has been much debate as to whether reboxetine is more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of depression. According to a 2009 meta-analysis of 12 second-generation antidepressants, reboxetine was no more effective than placebo, and was ""significantly less"" effective and less acceptable than the other drugs in treating the acute-phase of adults with unipolar major depression. The British MHRA said in September 2011 that the study had several limitations, and that ""Overall the balance of benefits and risks for reboxetine remains positive in its authorised indication."" A UK and Europe-wide review of available efficacy and safety data has confirmed that reboxetine has benefit over placebo in its authorised indication. Efficacy was clearly shown in patients with severe or very severe depression. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis by IQWiG, including unpublished data, published data on reboxetine overestimated the benefit of reboxetine versus placebo by up to 115% and reboxetine versus SSRIs by up to 23%, and also underestimated harm, concluding that reboxetine was an ineffective and potentially harmful antidepressant. The study also showed that nearly three quarters of the data on patients who took part in trials of reboxetine had not been published by Pfizer. A 2018 systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs concluded that reboxetine was more effective than placebo but significantly less efficacious than other antidepressants tested. === Panic disorder === In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial reboxetine significantly improved the symptoms of panic disorder. Another randomised controlled trial that compared paroxetine to reboxetine found that paroxetine significantly outperformed reboxetine as a treatment for panic disorder. Despite this discouraging finding an open-label trial examining the efficacy of reboxetine in SSRI-resistant panic disorder demonstrated significant benefit from reboxetine treatment. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Numerous clinical trials have provided support for the efficacy of reboxetine in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both the short and long-term and in both children/adolescents and adults. === Other uses === A case series and open-label pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of reboxetine in treating bulimia nervosa. Reboxetine may also have efficacy in treating therapy-resistant paediatric nocturnal enuresis. A pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of reboxetine in the treatment of narcolepsy. Individual trials and meta-analysis suggest that reboxetine can attenuate antipsychotic-induced weight gain and there is some evidence of a benefit on depressive, and possibly other symptoms of schizophrenia when added to antipsychotic treatment. == Contraindications == Reboxetine is contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, those hypersensitive to reboxetine or any of its excipients. There is conflicting information regarding use with MAOIs: one says the combination is possible with monitoring of side effects but the product informations indicate them as contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include insomnia, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and excessive sweating. Common (1–10%) adverse effects include loss of appetite, agitation, anxiety, headache, restlessness, tingling sensations, distorted sense of taste, difficulty with seeing near or far (problems with accommodation), fast heart beat, heart palpitations, relaxing of blood vessels leading to low blood pressure, high blood pressure, vomiting, rash, sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, urinary tract infection, painful or difficult urination, urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory pain or delay, and chills. A 2009 meta-analysis found that reboxetine was significantly less well tolerated than the other 11 second-generation antidepressants compared in the analysis. == Overdose == Reboxetine is considered a relatively low-risk antidepressant in overdose. The symptoms are as follows: Sweating Tachycardia Changes in blood pressure == Interactions == Because of its reliance on CYP3A4, reboxetine O-desethylation is markedly inhibited by papaverine and ketoconazole. It weakly inhibits CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Reboxetine is an intermediate-level inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, which gives it the potential to interact with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, paroxetine, sertraline, quinidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Reboxetine is a fairly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), with approximately 20-fold selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) over the serotonin transporter (SERT). Despite this selectivity, reboxetine does slightly inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at therapeutic doses. It does not interact with or inhibit the dopamine transporter (DAT). Reboxetine has been found to inhibit both brain and cardiac GIRKs, a characteristic it shares with the NRI atomoxetine. === Pharmacokinetics === Both the (R,R)-(–) and (S,S)-(+)-enantiomers of reboxetine are predominantly metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The primary metabolite of reboxetine is O-desethylreboxetine, and there are also three minor metabolites—Phenol A, Phenol B, and UK1, Phenol B being the most minor. == Chemistry == Reboxetine has two chiral centers. Thus, four stereoisomers may exist, the (R,R)-, (S,S)-, (R,S)-, and (S,R)-isomers. The active ingredient of reboxetine is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, the (R,R)-(–)- and (S,S)-(+)-isomer. == History == Reboxetine was discovered at Farmitalia-Carlo Erba and was first published in 1984; Farmitalia did the first clinical studies. Farmitalia was acquired by Pharmacia in 1993, and Pharmacia in turn was acquired by Pfizer in 2003. It was first approved in Europe in 1997 and was provisionally approved by the FDA in 1999. In 2001 the FDA issued Pfizer a ""not approvable"" letter based on clinical trials the FDA had required when it issued the preliminary approval letter. In 2010, the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQEHC) published results of a meta-analysis of clinical trial data for reboxetine in acute depression, which included data on about 3,000 subjects that Pfizer had never published but had mentioned; IQEHC had combed through Pfizer's publications and reboxetine approvals and had determined this data was missing from the publication record. The analysis of the complete data set yielded a result that reboxetine was not more effective than placebo but had more side effects than placebo and more than fluoxetine; the paper led to widespread and sharp criticism of Pfizer, and stronger calls for publication of all clinical trial data. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Edronax is the brand name of reboxetine in every English-speaking country that has approved it for clinical use.

1278,"('Indinavir (sulfate)', 'Indinavir', 'Crixivan', 'Compound j', 'Indinavir anhydrous')",Medical,"Indinavir (IDV; trade name Crixivan, made by Merck) is a protease inhibitor used as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV/AIDS. It is soluble white powder administered orally in combination with other antiviral drugs. The drug prevents protease from functioning normally. Consequently, HIV viruses cannot reproduce, causing a decrease in the viral load. Commercially sold indinavir is indinavir anhydrous, which is indinavir with an additional amine in the hydroxyethylene backbone. This enhances its solubility and oral bioavailability, making it easier for users to intake. It was synthetically produced for the purpose of inhibiting the protease in the HIV virus. It is no longer recommended for use in HIV/AIDS treatment due to its side effects. Furthermore, it is controversial for many reasons starting from its development to its usage. It was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in 1996, on 13 March by the United States Food and Drug Administration, on 1 October by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and on 4 October by the European Medicines Agency. == Medical uses == Indinavir does not cure HIV/AIDS, but it can extend the length of a person's life for several years by slowing the progression of the disease. The type that is widely used and created by Merck is indinavir sulfate. The pills are created from sulfate salts and are sold in dosages of 100, 200, 333, and 400 mg of indinavir. It is normally used as one of the three drugs in a triple-combination therapy for the HIV virus. Commercially available capsules should be stored at 15 – 30 °C. It should be kept in a tight container so that it is kept away from moisture. Therefore, it is advised that users should keep the pills in the manufacturer-provided bottle and do not remove the desiccant. Indinavir wears off quickly after dosing. Unboosted indinavir requires a very precise dosing of 400 mg every eight hours to thwart HIV from forming drug-resistant mutations, including resistances to other protease inhibitors. Boosted indinavir requires two 400-mg indinavir capsules with 1 to 2 100-mg ritonavir capsules twice a day. In both cases, the drugs must be taken with plenty of water one or two hours after a meal. It is recommended that users drink at least 1.5 liters a day when intaking the drug. Drug users must significantly increase their water intake due to indinavir's low solubility that can cause it to crystallize. There are restrictions on what sorts of food may be eaten concurrently with the unboosted indinavir treatment. Furthermore, it is no longer recommended to use in the United States for initial treatments due to pill burden and risk of kidney stones. === Viral resistance === Many people were skeptical of being too hopeful with indinavir due to previous events that occurred with AZT. Viral resistance to the drug leads to the drug becoming useless since the virus evolves to have cells that are able to resist the protease inhibitor. In order to avoid this as much as possible, it is important for users to consistently take the exact amount of the drug at the allocated times. This fear of viral resistance caused a lot of users to be wary of the drug. == Side effects == The most common side effects of indinavir include: Gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) General malaise and fatigue Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis (the formation of kidney stones), which sometimes may lead to more severe condition including kidney failure Metabolic alterations including hyperlipidemia (cholesterol or triglyceride elevations) and hyperglycemia Alterations in body shape (lipodystrophy), colloquially known as ""Crix belly"" Increased levels of Bilirubin, causing skin and white parts of the eyes to turn yellow Inhibits urinary nitrous oxide production and may inhibit nitric oxide production. Renal abnormalities, sterile leukocyturia, and reduced creatinine clearance. Impairs endothelial function in healthy HIV-negative men and may accelerate atherosclerotic disease. == Chemical properties == Indinavir is a white crystalline powder. It is very soluble in water and methanol. Each capsule contains sulfate salt in addition to anhydrous lactose and magnesium stearate. The capsule shell is made of gelatin and titanium dioxide. Its melting point or its temperature of decomposition is 150 – 153 °C at which it starts to emit toxic vapors such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The drug fits inside the protease, stopping it from functioning normally. As a result, structural proteins, resulting from polypeptide products of gag and gag-pol genes, cannot form. These structural proteins are necessary for the synthesis of new HIV virions. Eventually, the viral load decreases because of the lack of reproduction. == History == The official start to its development started in December 1986 when Merck's president, Edward Scolnick, announced that they would start a comprehensive AIDS research program. They started a laboratory dedicated to AIDS research in West Point, Pennsylvania and placed Emilio Emini in charge of the laboratory. A couple months later in January 1987, a team of researchers consisting of Emilio Emini, Joel Huff, and Irving Sigal, kickstarted their studies by basing their project off of earlier research on the protease enzyme, renin. They were the ones who started the process of research and development into protease inhibitors and its relation to the virus. Over a year later, in July 1988, Nancy Kohl, Emilio Emini, et al., published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Science about the idea of inhibiting the protease. In February 1989, Manuela Navia, Paula Fitzgerald, et al., published a paper that showed the three-dimensional structure of HIV's protease enzyme. Other researchers claim that this study helped determine the future trajectory of the development of the inhibitor. After much research, in March, 1990, researchers under Reider received a patent to synthesize part of L-689, 502 compound. These were similar to existing inhibitors. However, it failed safety assessments because of its toxicity. Seeing that the research on their drug was heading in the direction of eventually getting it on the market, Merck decided to formulate a community advisory board composed of AIDS activists who would help with the development effort of the drug in March 1991. Later on, Merck faced serious backlash from community members who though did not like the pricing and distribution of the drug. In January 1992, researchers synthesized indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), which was assigned compound number L-735,524. They started to test L-735,524 on animals a couple months later and found that it was safe for animals. Consequently, the company decided that it was safe to start human trials on September of the same year. Bruce D. Dorsey, James P. Guare, Joseph P. Vacca, M. Katherine Holloway and Randall W. Hungate were named inventors of the year by the Intellectual Property Owners for Crixivan. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved indinavir in March 1996, making it the eighth antiretroviral drug approved. It was first given its blessing by the FDA on March 1 then approved merely 42 days after the company filed the drug to the FDA. A major reason for this fast approval was the presentation Merck gave to the committee with results from Study 035 (see below). The fact that they had fast approval ran into trouble with groups like Treatment Action Group who thought that accelerated drug approval was not beneficial for people infected with HIV/AIDS. From then on, indinavir used with dual NRTIs set a new standard for treatment of HIV/AIDS. Protease inhibitors changed the nature of AIDS from a terminal illness to a somewhat manageable one. It significantly increased life expectancies and decreased noticeable symptoms from infectious diseases that were the result of a weakened immune system from the virus. Currently, it is being replaced by newer drugs that are more convenient to take, less likely to promote virus resistance, and less toxic, such as darunavir or atazanavir. == Clinical trials == In January 1996, Merck & Co. proved that indinavir was a clinically efficient drug based on data from human trials. They were able to show that indinavir, when used with two other anti-HIV drugs, could significantly reduce the HIV viral load. === Study 035 === The study's goal was to show the different effects of different antiviral treatments. 97 patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: indinavir monotherapy, AZT and lamivudine, or all three agents. Eligible patients were those who received AZT for at least 6 months and have CD4 cell counts between 50 and 400, viral loads of at least 200,000 copies/mL, and had no prior antiretroviral therapy with protease inhibitor or lamivudine. The results of the study showed that the most effective treatment was the three drug treatment. After 24 weeks of treatment, 24 patients of the 28 patients who were treated with the three drugs were able to have viral load levels have less than 500 copies/ml. 12 out of 28 patients under indinavir monotherapy reached 500 copies/ml, and none of the thirty patients in AZT and lamivudine group got below 500 copies. === ACTG 320 === This study took a look at clinical efficiency of the different treatments. Patients had to have CD4 cell counts less than 200 and at least 3 months of AZT therapy before the trials. 1156 patients with a mean of 87 CD4 cell counts and mean viral load of 100,000 copies/ml were randomized to one of the two groups: AZT plus lamivudine or AZT plus lamivudine plus indinavir. Just like Study 035, patients couldn't be in the study if they had prior protease inhibitor treatment or lamivudine for more than one week. The end point of the study was death or development of opportunistic infections. After 38 weeks, 6% of the people in the three-drug group died while 11% of the people died in the two-drug group. There were higher CD4 cell counts and less viral load in patients assigned to the three-drug group, proving that a three-drug treatment is more efficient than a two-drug one. == Controversy == === Supply === Merck did not have enough time to prepare enough drugs to distribute for all those who were infected. 650,000 to 900,000 people were infected with the virus, and Merck could only provide drugs for about 25,000 to 30,000 people. Furthermore, the drug has to be taken consistently or else users face dangers, meaning that the company has to take into account refills for users who take the drugs. This situation of limited supply caused a lot of activists to be angry at the fact that they were selling in such limited quantities. === Distribution === Because of its limited supply, Merck decided to adopt a single distributor system in which they would send indinavir to only one pharmaceutical retail company. They sold it to Stadtalnder's Pharmacy and limited quantities to Veteran Administration's hospitals and some managed-care organizations. This caused prices to be raised and limited the number of people who could have access to this possibly life-saving drug. === Price === Indinavir cost about $12 for a daily dose, which is 24% less than Invirase and 33% less than Norvir. Because the company used a single distributor system to sell their drugs, the retail price was marked up 37% by the pharmacy that sold it. In response to this hefty price, Merck stated that it cost a lot to research and develop the drug, and they did not have enough supplies to sell it through a normal distributor system. Activists protested against this price because it made it harder for people to have access to the drug. == References ==",Crixivan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4450891689630225e-05), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001933373394422233)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12337/crixivan-oral/details?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='Crixivan Oral: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings & Dosing - WebMD', type='url_citation', url='https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12337/crixivan-oral/details?utm_source=openai')])"
1279,"('Tetraethylammonium (chloride)', 'Tetraethylammonium', 'Tetraethylazanium', 'Tetramon', 'N,n,n-triethylethanaminium')","Medical, Industrial","Tetraethylammonium (TEA) is a quaternary ammonium cation with the chemical formula [Et4N]+, consisting of four ethyl groups (−C2H5, denoted Et) attached to a central nitrogen atom. It is a counterion used in the research laboratory to prepare lipophilic salts of inorganic anions. It is used similarly to tetrabutylammonium, the difference being that its salts are less lipophilic, more easily crystallized and more toxic. == Preparation == The halide salt is prepared by the reaction of triethylamine and an ethyl halide: Et3N + EtX → Et4N+X− This method works well for the preparation of tetraethylammonium iodide (where X = I). Most tetraethylammonium salts are prepared by salt metathesis reactions. For example, the synthesis of tetraethylammonium perchlorate, a salt that has been useful as a supporting electrolyte for polarographic studies in non-aqueous solvents, is carried out by mixing the water-soluble salts tetraethylammonium bromide and sodium perchlorate in water, from which the water-insoluble tetraethylammonium perchlorate precipitates: Et4N+Br−(aq) + Na+[ClO4]−(aq) → Na+Br−(aq) + Et4N+[ClO4]−(s) Other examples include tetraethylammonium cyanide (Et4NCN), and trichlorostannate (Et4NSnCl3). In some cases, salts are produced of anions that cannot be generated in water, such as the tetrahedral [NiCl4]2− salt. === Uses === The principal chemical characteristic of tetraethylammonium salts is their ability to engage in processes involving phase-transfer, such as phase-transfer catalysis. Typically, the four ethyl groups surrounding the nitrogen are too small to facilitate efficient ion transfer between aqueous and organic phases, but tetraethylammonium salts have been found to be effective in a number of such applications, and these are exemplified under the headings of the individual salts. TEA salts such as tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate and tetraethylammonium methylsulfonate are used in supercapacitors as organic electrolytes. TEA halide and its hydroxide are used for the synthesis of high-silica zeolite, especially for the zeolite beta. TEA can act as a template for micropore of zeolites under hydrothermal conditions during crystallization processes. === Properties === The effective radius of the tetraethylammonium ion is reported as ~0.45 nm, which is comparable in size to that of the hydrated K+ ion. The ionic radius for TEA is given as 0.385 nm; several thermodynamic parameters for the TEA ion are also recorded. The octanol-water partition coefficient of TEA iodide, Po-w was determined experimentally to be 6.9×10−4 (or log P ≈ −3.16). == Biology == === Pharmacology === The literature dealing with the pharmacologically-related properties of tetraethylammonium is vast, and research continues. It is clear that TEA blocks autonomic ganglia - it was the first ""ganglionic blocker"" drug to be introduced into clinical practice. However, TEA also produces effects at the neuromuscular junction and at sympathetic nerve terminals. At the mechanistic level, TEA has long been known to block voltage-dependent K+ channels in nerve, and it is thought that this action is involved in the effects of TEA at sympathetic nerve terminals. With respect to activity at the neuromuscular junction, TEA has been found to be a competitive inhibitor at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, although the details of its effect on these receptor proteins are complex. TEA also blocks Ca2+ - activated K+ channels, such as those found in skeletal muscle and pituitary cells. It has also been reported that TEA inhibits aquaporin (APQ) channels, but this still seems to be a disputed issue. A partial effect of these voltage-dependent and permeability properties within each system mentioned above is not only due to the aforementioned inhibitory properties of TEA, but also its ability to inhibit Na,K-ATPase. Acting on the extracellular vestibule of the Na,K-ATPase, inhibiting K+ access similar to ouabain, TEA further accentuates the disrupted K, and Na, gradients within each of these systems. === Clinical considerations === Although TEA (sometimes under the name ""Etamon"") was explored in a number of different clinical applications, including the treatment of hypertension, its major use seems to have been as a probe to assess the capacity for vasodilation in cases of peripheral vascular disease. Because of dangerous, even fatal reactions in some patients, as well as inconsistent cardiovascular responses, TEA was soon replaced by other drugs. TEA is not orally active. Typical symptoms produced in humans include the following: dry mouth, suppression of gastric secretion, drastic reduction of gastric motility, paralysis of urinary bladder, and relief of some forms of pain. Most studies with TEA seem to have been performed using either its chloride or bromide salt without comment as to any distinctions in effect, but Birchall and his co-workers preferred the use of TEA chloride in order to avoid the sedative effects of the bromide ion. === Toxicology === An extensive study of the toxicology of tetraethylammonium chloride in mice, rats and dogs was published by Gruhzit and co-workers in 1948. These workers reported the following symptoms in mice and rats receiving toxic parenteral doses: tremors, incoordination, flaccid prostration, and death from respiratory failure within 10–30 minutes; dogs exhibited similar symptoms, including incoordination, flaccid prostration, respiratory and cardiac depression, ptosis, mydriasis, erythema, and death from respiratory paralysis and circulatory collapse. After non-lethal doses, symptoms abated within 15–60 minutes. There was little evidence of toxicity from chronic administration of non-lethal doses. These investigators recorded the following acute toxicities, as LD50s for TEA chloride (error ranges not shown): Mouse: 65 mg/kg, i.p.; 900 mg/kg, p.o. Rat: ~56 mg/kg, i.v.; 110 mg/kg, i.m.; 2630 mg/kg, p.o. Dog: ~36 mg/kg, i.v.; 58 mg/kg, i.m. Another research group, working at about the same time, but using tetraethylammonium bromide, published the following LD50 data: Mouse: 38 mg/kg, i.v.; 60 mg/kg, i.p.; >2000 mg/kg, p.o. Rat: 63 mg/kg, i.v.; 115 mg/kg, i.p. Dog: 55 mg/kg, i.v. Rabbit: 72 mg/kg, i.v. Writing in 1950, Graham made some observations on the toxic effects of tetraethylammonium bromide in humans. In one subject, described as a ""healthy woman"", 300 mg of tetraethylammonium bromide, i.v., produced incapacitating ""curariform"" (i.e., resembling the effects of tubocurarine) paralysis of the skeletal muscles, as well as marked drowsiness. These effects were largely dissipated within 2 hours. Citing the work of other investigators, Graham noted that Birchall had also produced ""alarming curariform effects"" in humans with i.v. doses of 32 mg/kg of tetraethylammonium chloride. == See also == Tetraethylammonium bromide Tetraethylammonium chloride Tetraethylammonium iodide == References ==",Tetraethylammonium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.5782900452613831), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' INDUSTR', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.10777720808982849), ('DU', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ST', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.014272631146013737), ('ĠMED', -0.01429872028529644), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018216803669929504)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.10389687120914459), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0001584850688232109), (' INDUSTR', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethylammonium,https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/tetraethylammonium,https://www.britannica.com/science/tetraethylammonium ', [])"

1282,"('Gentamicin (sulfate)', 'Gentamicin')",Medical,"Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections. This may include bone infections, endocarditis, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis among others. It is not effective for gonorrhea or chlamydia infections. It can be given intravenously, by intramuscular injection, or topically. Topical formulations may be used in burns or for infections of the outside of the eye. It is often only used for two days until bacterial cultures determine what specific antibiotics the infection is sensitive to. The dose required should be monitored by blood testing. Gentamicin can cause inner ear problems and kidney problems. The inner ear problems can include problems with balance and hearing loss. These problems may be permanent. If used during pregnancy, it can cause harm to the developing fetus. However, it appears to be safe for use during breastfeeding. Gentamicin is a type of aminoglycoside and works by disrupting the ability of the bacteria to make proteins, which typically kills the bacteria. Gentamicin is naturally produced by the bacterium Micromonospora purpurea, was patented in 1962, approved for medical use in 1964. The antibiotic is collected from the culture of the Micromonospora by perforating the cell wall of the bacterium. Current research is underway to understand the biosynthesis of this antibiotic in an attempt to increase expression and force secretion of gentamicin for higher titer. Gentamicin is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies gentamicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Gentamicin is active against a wide range of bacterial infections, mostly Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, Proteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia, and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus. Gentamicin is used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, blood, bone and soft tissue infections of these susceptible bacteria. There is insufficient evidence to support gentamicin as the first line treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Gentamicin is not used for Neisseria meningitidis or Legionella pneumophila bacterial infections (because of the risk of the person going into shock from lipid A endotoxin found in certain Gram-negative organisms). Gentamicin is also useful against Yersinia pestis (responsible for plague), its relatives, and Francisella tularensis (the organism responsible for tularemia often seen in hunters and trappers). Some Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp. have varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin. === Special populations === ==== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ==== Gentamicin is not recommended in pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks for the mother. Gentamicin can cross the placenta and several reports of irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children have been seen. Intramuscular injection of gentamicin in mothers can cause muscle weakness in the newborn. The safety and efficacy for gentamicin in nursing mothers has not been established. Detectable gentamicin levels are found in human breast milk and in nursing babies. ==== Elderly ==== In the elderly, renal function should be assessed before beginning therapy as well as during treatment due to a decline in glomerular filtration rate. Gentamicin levels in the body can remain higher for a longer period of time in this population. Gentamicin should be used cautiously in persons with renal, auditory, vestibular, or neuromuscular dysfunction. ==== Children ==== Gentamicin may not be appropriate to use in children, including babies. Studies have shown higher serum levels and a longer half-life in this population. Kidney function should be checked periodically during therapy. Long-term effects of treatment can include hearing loss and balance problems. Hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and muscle weakness have been reported when used by injection. == Contraindications == Gentamicin should not be used if a person has a history of hypersensitivity, such as anaphylaxis, or other serious toxic reaction to gentamicin or any other aminoglycosides. Greater care is required in people with myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular disorders as there is a risk of worsening weakness. Gentamicin should also be avoided when prescribing empirical antibiotics in the setting of possible infant botulism (Ampicillin with Gentamicin is commonly used as empiric therapy in infants) also due to worsening of neuromuscular function. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects of gentamicin can range from less severe reactions, such as nausea and vomiting, to more severe reactions including: Low blood cell counts Allergic reactions Neuromuscular problems Nerve damage (neuropathy) Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity) Ear disorders (ototoxicity) Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are thought to be dose related with higher doses causing greater chance of toxicity. These two toxicities may have delayed presentation, sometimes not appearing until after completing treatment. === Kidney damage === Kidney damage is a problem in 10–25% of people who receive aminoglycosides, and gentamicin is one of the most nephrotoxic drugs of this class. Oftentimes, acute nephrotoxicity is reversible, but it may be fatal. The risk of nephrotoxicity can be affected by the dose, frequency, duration of therapy, and concurrent use of certain medications, such as NSAIDs, diuretics, cisplatin, ciclosporin, cephalosporins, amphotericin, iodide contrast media, and vancomycin. Factors that increase risk of nephrotoxicity include: Increased age Reduced renal function Pregnancy Hypothyroidism Hepatic dysfunction Volume depletion Metabolic acidosis Sodium depletion Kidney dysfunction is monitored by measuring creatinine in the blood, electrolyte levels, urine output, presence of protein in the urine, and concentrations of other chemicals, such as urea, in the blood. === Inner ear === About 11% of the population who receives aminoglycosides experience damage to their inner ear. The common symptoms of inner ear damage include tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, trouble with coordination, and dizziness. Chronic use of gentamicin can affect two areas of the ears. First, damage of the inner ear hair cells can result in irreversible hearing loss. Second, damage to the inner ear vestibular apparatus can lead to balance problems. To reduce the risk of ototoxicity during treatment, it is recommended to stay hydrated. Factors that increase the risk of inner ear damage include: Increased age High blood uric acid levels Kidney dysfunction Liver dysfunction Higher doses Long courses of therapy Also taking strong diuretics (e.g., furosemide) == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Gentamicin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, negatively impacting protein synthesis. The primary mechanism of action is generally accepted to work through ablating the ability of the ribosome to discriminate on proper transfer RNA and messenger RNA interactions. Typically, if an incorrect tRNA pairs with an mRNA codon at the aminoacyl site of the ribosome, adenosines 1492 and 1493 are excluded from the interaction and retract, signaling the ribosome to reject the aminoacylated tRNA::Elongation Factor Thermo-Unstable complex. However, when gentamicin binds at helix 44 of the 16S rRNA, it forces the adenosines to maintain the position they take when there is a correct, or cognate, match between aa-tRNA and mRNA. This leads to the acceptance of incorrect aa-tRNAs, causing the ribosome to synthesize proteins with wrong amino acids placed throughout (roughly every 1 in 500). The non-functional, mistranslated proteins misfold and aggregate, eventually leading to death of the bacterium. Moreover, it has been observed that gentamicin can cause a substantial slowdown in the overall elongation rate of peptide chains in live bacterial cells, independent of the misincorporation of amino acids. This finding indicates that gentamicin not only induces errors in protein synthesis but also broadly hampers the efficiency of the translation process itself. An additional mechanism has been proposed based on crystal structures of gentamicin in a secondary binding site at helix 69 of the 23S rRNA, which interacts with helix 44 and proteins that recognize stop codons. At this secondary site, gentamicin is believed to preclude interactions of the ribosome with ribosome recycling factors, causing the two subunits of the ribosome to stay complexed even after translation completes, creating a pool of inactive ribosomes that can no longer re-initiate and translate new proteins. == Chemistry == === Structure === Since gentamicin is derived from the species Micromonospora, the backbone for this antibiotic is the aminocyclitol 2-deoxystreptamine. This six carbon ring is substituted at the carbon positions 4 and 6 by the amino sugar molecules cyclic purpurosamine and garosamine, respectively. The gentamicin complex, is differentiated into five major components (C1, C1a, C2, C2a, C2b) and multiple minor components by substitution at the 6' carbon of the purpurosamine unit indicated in the image to the right by R1 and R2. The R1 and R2 can have the follow substitutions for some of the species in the gentamicin complex. Gentamicins consist of three hexosamines: gentosamine/garosamine, 2-deoxystreptamine, and purpurosamine (see illustrations, from left to right). Kanamycins and tobramycin exhibit similar structures. Sisomicin is 4,5-dehydrogentamicin-C1a. === Components === Gentamicin is composed of a number of related gentamicin components and fractions which have varying degrees of antimicrobial potency. The main components of gentamicin include members of the gentamicin C complex: gentamicin C1, gentamicin C1a, and gentamicin C2 which compose approximately 80% of gentamicin and have been found to have the highest antibacterial activity. Gentamicin A, B, X, and a few others make up the remaining 20% of gentamicin and have lower antibiotic activity than the gentamicin C complex. The exact composition of a given sample or lot of gentamicin is not well defined, and the level of gentamicin C components or other components in gentamicin may differ from lot-to-lot depending on the gentamicin manufacturer or manufacturing process. Because of this lot-to-lot variability, it can be difficult to study various properties of gentamicin including pharmacokinetics and microorganism susceptibility if there is an unknown combination of chemically related but different compounds. === Biosynthesis === The complete biosynthesis of gentamicin is not entirely elucidated. The genes controlling the biosynthesis of gentamicin are of particular interest due to the difficulty in obtaining the antibiotic after production. Since gentamicin is collected at the cell surface and the cell surface must be perforated somehow to obtain the antibiotic. Many propose the amount of gentamicin collected after production could increase if the genes are identified and re-directed to secrete the antibiotic instead of collecting gentamicin at the cell surface. Literature also agrees with the gentamicin biosynthesis pathway starting with D-Glucose-6-phosphate being dephopsphorylated, transaminated, dehydrogenated and finally glycosylated with D-glucosamine to generate paromamine inside Micromonospora echinospora. The addition of D-xylose leads to the first intermediate of the gentamicin C complex pathway, gentamicin A2. Gentamicin A2 is C-methylated and epimerized into gentamicin X2, the first branch point of this biosynthesis pathway When X2 is acted on by the cobalamin-dependent radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine enzyme GenK, the carbon position 6' is methylated to form the pharmacologically active intermediate G418 G418 then undergoes dehydrogenation and amination at the C6' position by the dehydrogenase gene, GenQ, to generate the pharmacologically active JI-20B, although another intermediate, 6'-dehydro-6'oxo-G418 (6'DOG) is proposed to be in-between this step and for which the gene GenB1 is proposed as the aminating gene. JI-20B is dehydroxylated and epimerized to first component of the gentamicin C complex, gentamicin C2a which then undergoes an epimerization by GenB2 and then a N-methylation by an unconfirmed gene to form the final product in this branch point, gentamicin C1. When X2 bypasses GenK and is directly dehydrogenated and aminated by the GenQ enzyme, the other pharmacologically relevant intermediate JI-20A is formed. Although, there has been identification of an intermediate for this step, 6'-dehydro-6'-oxo-gentamicin X2 (6'-DOX), for which the enzyme GenB1 is purposed as the aminating enzyme. JI-20A is then dehydroxylated into the first component of the gentamicin C complex for this branch, gentamicin C1a via a catalytic reaction with GenB4. C1a then undergoes an N-methylation by an unconfirmed enzyme to form the final component, gentamicin C2b. ==== Fermentation ==== Gentamicin is only synthesized via submerged fermentation and inorganic sources of nutrients have been found to reduce production. Traditional fermentation used yeast beef broth, but there has been research into optimizing the growth medium for producing gentamicin C complex due to the C complex currently being the only pharmaceutically relevant component. The main components of the growth medium are carbon sources, mainly sugars, but several studies found increased gentamicin production by adding vegetable and fish oils and decreased gentamicin production with the addition of glucose, xylose and several carboxylic acids. Tryptone and various forms of yeast and yeast derivatives are traditionally used as the nitrogen source in the growth medium, but several amino acids, soybean meal, corn steep liquor, ammonium sulfate, and ammonium chloride have proven to be beneficial additives. Phosphate ions, metal ions (cobalt and a few others at low concentration), various vitamins (mostly B vitamins), purine and pyrimidine bases are also supplemented into the growth medium to increase gentamicin production, but the margin of increase is dependent on the species of Micromonospora and the other components in the growth medium. With all of these aforementioned additives, pH and aeration are key determining factors for the amount of gentamicin produced. A range of pH from 6.8 to 7.5 is used for gentamicin biosynthesis and the aeration is determined by independent experimentation reliant on type of growth medium and species of Micromonospora. == History == Gentamicin is produced by the fermentation of Micromonospora purpurea. It was discovered in 1963 by Weinstein, Wagman et al. at Schering Corporation in Bloomfield, N.J. while working with source material (soil samples) provided by Rico Woyciesjes. When M. purpurea grows in culture it is a vivid purple colour similar to the colour of the dye Gentian Violet and hence this was why Gentamicin took then name it did. Subsequently, it was purified and the structures of its three components were determined by Cooper, et al., also at the Schering Corporation. It was initially used as a topical treatment for burns at burn units in Atlanta and San Antonio and was introduced into IV usage in 1971. It remains a mainstay for use in sepsis. It is synthesized by Micromonospora, a genus of Gram-positive bacteria widely present in the environment (water and soil). According to the American Medical Association Committee on Generic Names, antibiotics not produced by Streptomyces should not use y in the ending of the name, and to highlight their specific biological origins, gentamicin and other related antibiotics produced by this genus (verdamicin, mutamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and retymicin) have their spellings ending in ~micin and not in ~mycin. == Research == Gentamicin is also used in molecular biology research as an antibacterial agent in tissue and cell culture, to prevent contamination of sterile cultures. Gentamicin is one of the few heat-stable antibiotics that remain active even after autoclaving, which makes it particularly useful in the preparation of some microbiological growth media. == References == == Further reading ==",Gentamicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6938157677650452), (' INDUSTR', -0.0019913245923817158), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048598457127809525)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Gentamicin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentamicin?utm_source=openai')])"

While regulation of p53 by Mdm2 is important, Mdm2 also regulates numerous proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. We investigated if Serdemetan would alter the Mdm2-HIF1α axis and affect cell survival in human glioblastoma cells independently of p53. Treatment of cells with Serdemetan under hypoxia resulted in a decrease in HIF1α levels. HIF1α downstream targets, VEGF and the glycolytic enzymes (enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase1/2, and glucose transporter 1), were all decreased in response to Serdemetan. The involvement of Mdm2 in regulating gene expression of glycolytic enzymes raises the possibility of side effects associated with therapeutically targeting Mdm2. JNJ-26854165 was originally developed as an activator of p53 capable of inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines. In vitro, JNJ-26854165 demonstrated cytotoxic activity. The ALL cell line panel had a significantly lower median IC(50) (0.85 µM) than the remaining cell lines. In vivo JNJ-26854165 induced significant differences in EFS distribution compared to control in 18 of 37 solid tumors and in 5 of 7 of the evaluable ALL xenografts. Objective responses were observed in 4 of 37 solid tumor xenografts, and 2 of 7 ALL xenografts achieved PR or CR. Responses were noted in xenografts with both mutant and wild-type p53. Serdemetan (JNJ-26854165) is a novel tryptamine compound with antiproliferative activity in various p53 wild-type (WT) tumor cell lines. We investigated its potential as radiosensitizer using four human cancer cell lines: H460, A549, p53-WT-HCT116, and p53-null-HCT116. Serdemetan inhibited clonogenic survival in all cell lines, but in a lower extent in p53-null-HCT116. In the combination studies, Serdemetan treatment at 0.25μM in H460 and at 5μM in A549 cells resulted in a sensitivity-enhancement ratio of 1.18 and 1.36, respectively. At 2Gy, surviving fractions were 0.72 and 0.97 for p53-WT HCT116 and p53-null cells exposed to 0.5μM of Serdemetan, respectively (p<0.05). Radiosensitization of H460 and A549 cells was associated with G2/M cell cycle arrest and with an increased expression of p53 and p21. In vivo, Serdemetan caused a greater than additive increase in tumor growth delay. The dose enhancement factor was 1.9 and 1.6 for H460 and A549 tumors, respectively. Serdemetan inhibited proliferation, capillary tube formation and migration of HMEC-1 cells. These effects were more marked concurrently with irradiation. These results in tumor and endothelial cells suggest that Serdemetan has potential as a radiosensitizer.

Tandospirone was introduced for medical use in Japan in 1996 and in China in 2004. == Medical uses == === Anxiety and depression === Tandospirone is most commonly used as a treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders, such as generalised anxiety disorder and dysthymia respectively. For both indications it usually takes a couple of weeks for therapeutic effects to begin to be seen, although at higher doses more rapid anxiolytic responses have been seen. It has also been used successfully as a treatment for bruxism. === Augmentation for depression === Tandospirone can be used as an effective augmentation, especially when coupled with fluoxetine or clomipramine. === Other uses === Tandospirone might been tried successfully as an adjunctive treatment for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic individuals. == Side effects == Common adverse effects include: Dizziness Drowsiness Insomnia Headache Gastrointestinal disorders Dry mouth Negative influence on explicit memory function Nausea Adverse effects with unknown frequency include: Hypotension (low blood pressure) Dysphoria Tachycardia Malaise Psychomotor impairment It is not believed to be addictive but is known to produce mild withdrawal effects (e.g., anorexia) after abrupt discontinuation. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tandospirone acts as a potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, with a Ki affinity value of 27 ± 5 nM and approximately 55 to 85% intrinsic activity. It has relatively weak affinity for the 5-HT2A (1,300 ± 200), 5-HT2C (2,600 ± 60), α1-adrenergic (1,600 ± 80), α2-adrenergic (1,900 ± 400), D1 (41,000 ± 10,000), and D2 (1,700 ± 300) receptors, and is essentially inactive at the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, β-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin transporter, and benzodiazepine allosteric site of the GABAA receptor (all of which are > 100,000).

It is orally active and acts as a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, such as theophylline, have been used to treat COPD for centuries; however, the clinical benefits of these agents have never been shown to outweigh the risks of their numerous adverse effects. Four clinical trials were identified evaluating the efficacy of cilomilast, the usual randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled protocols were used. It showed reasonable efficacy for treating COPD, but side effects were problematic and it is unclear whether cilomilast will be marketed, or merely used in the development of newer drugs. Cilomilast is a second-generation PDE4 inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effects that target bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and airway remodeling associated with COPD. == History == GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) filed for drug approval with the U.S. FDA at the end of 2002 and in January 2003 with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). In October 2003, the FDA issued an approvable letter for use of cilomilast in maintenance of lung function in COPD patients poorly responsive to salbutamol, despite an earlier decision by the FDA advisory panel to reject approval. The rejection was based on concerns over the efficacy of the agent, as well as gastrointestinal side effects. Before issuing final approval, however, the FDA requested additional efficacy and safety data.

Dopamine can be metabolized into one of three substances. One such substance is DOPAC. Another is 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT). Both of these substances are degraded to form homovanillic acid (HVA). Both degradations involve the enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), albeit in reverse order: MAO catalyzes dopamine to DOPAC, and COMT catalyzes DOPAC to HVA; whereas COMT catalyzes dopamine to 3-MT and MAO catalyzes 3-MT to HVA. The third metabolic end-product of dopamine is norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It can also be found in the bark of Eucalyptus globulus. This product has been synthesized (52% yield) from 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid via aerobic biotransformation using whole cell cultures of Arthrobacter protophormiae. == References ==",Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -4.60414821645827e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -8.554343366995454e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.07889540493488312), (' FOOD', -2.522638169466518e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.0026839682832360268), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('OUS', -1.6689286894688848e-06), (',', -0.5760365128517151), ('ĠFOOD', -0.6552488803863525), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062066324055194855)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.688212614681106e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/medicine-and-healthcare/pharmaceutical-medicine/3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic-acid,https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB000316 ', [])"
1289,"('Carbetapentane (citrate)', 'Pentoxyverine citrate', 'Carbetapentane', 'Pentoxyverine', 'Pentoxyverin')",Medical,"Pentoxyverine (rINN) or carbetapentane is an antitussive (cough suppressant) commonly used for cough associated with illnesses like common cold. It is sold over-the-counter as Solotuss, or in combination with other medications, especially decongestants. One such product is Certuss, a combination of guaifenesin and pentoxyverine. The drug has been available in the form of drops, suspensions and suppositories. It was formerly available over-the-counter in United States. However, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ruled in 1987 that pentoxyverine was not generally recognized as safe and effective and ordered it to be removed from the over-the-counter market. == Uses == The drug is used for the treatment of dry cough associated with conditions such as common cold, bronchitis or sinusitis. Like codeine and other antitussives, it relieves the symptom, but does not heal the illness. No controlled clinical trials regarding the efficiency of pentoxyverine are available. Pharmacologists use the substance as a selective agonist at the sigma-1 receptor in animal and in vitro experiments. == Contraindications == Pentoxyverine is contraindicated in persons with bronchial asthma or other kinds of respiratory insufficiency (breathing difficulties), as well as angle-closure glaucoma. No data are available for the use of pentoxyverine during pregnancy, lactation, or children under two years of age, wherefore the drug must not be used under these circumstances. Antitussive drugs are not useful in patients with extensive phlegm production because they prevent coughing up the phlegm. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects (seen in more than 1% of patients) are upper abdominal (belly) pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting. Allergic reactions of the skin like itching, rashes, hives and angiooedema are rare. The same is true for anaphylactic shock and convulsions. == Overdose == Overdosage leads to drowsiness, agitation, nausea and anticholinergic effects like tachycardia (high heart rate), dry mouth, blurred vision, glaucoma, or urinary retention. Especially in children, pentoxyverine can cause hypoventilation, but much more seldom than codeine and other opioid antitussives. The treatment of overdosage aims at the symptoms; there are no specific antidotes available. == Interactions == No interactions have been described at usual doses. It is possible that pentoxyverine can increase the potency of sedative drugs like benzodiazepines, some anticonvulsants and antidepressants, and alcohol. Likewise, some consumer informations warn patients from taking the drug in combination with or up to two weeks after monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are known to cause potentially fatal reactions in combination with the (chemically only distantly related) antitussive dextromethorphan. == Mechanism of action == Pentoxyverine is believed to suppress the cough reflex in the central nervous system, but the exact mechanism of action is not known with certainty. The drug acts as an antagonist at muscarinic receptors (subtype M1) and as an agonist at sigma receptors (subtype σ1) with an IC50 of 9 nM. Its anticholinergic properties can theoretically relax the pulmonary alveoli and reduce phlegm production. Spasmolytic and local anaesthetic properties have also been described. The clinical relevance of these mechanisms is uncertain. == Pharmacokinetics == The substance is absorbed quickly from the gut and reaches its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after about two hours. If applied rectally, Cmax is reached after four hours. The bioavailability of the suppositories, measured as area under the curve (AUC), is about twofold that of oral formulations, due to a first pass effect of over 50%. By far the most important metabolisation reaction is ester hydrolysis, which accounts for 26.3% of the total clearance through the kidneys. Only 0.37% are cleared in form of the original substance. The plasma half life is 2.3 hours for oral formulations and three to 3.5 hours for suppositories. Pentoxyverine is also excreted into the breast milk. == Chemical properties == Pentoxyverine dihydrogen citrate, the salt that is commonly used for oral preparations, is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. It dissolves easily in water or chloroform, but not in benzene, diethyl ether, or petroleum ether. It melts at 90 to 95 °C (194 to 203 °F). Other orally available salts are the hydrochloride and the tannate; suppositories contain the free base. == See also == Cough syrup Noscapine Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Racemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol Butamirate Tipepidine Cloperastine; Levocloperastine == References ==",Pentoxyverine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5629668016335927e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031860326416790485)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentoxyverine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Pentoxyverine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentoxyverine?utm_source=openai')])"
