1983,"('Kaempferol', 'Kempferol', 'Robigenin', 'Kaempherol', 'Rhamnolutein')","Food, Medical","Kaempferol (3,4′,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonol, a type of flavonoid, found in a variety of plants and plant-derived foods including kale, beans, tea, spinach, and broccoli. It is also found in propolis extracts. Kaempferol is a yellow crystalline solid with a melting point of 276–278 °C (529–532 °F). It is slightly soluble in water and highly soluble in hot ethanol, ethers, and DMSO. Kaempferol is named for 17th-century German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer. == Natural occurrence == Kaempferol is a secondary metabolite found in many plants, plant-derived foods, and traditional medicines. Its flavor is considered bitter. === In plants and food === Kaempferol is common in Pteridophyta, Pinophyta, and Angiospermae. Within Pteridophyta and Pinophyta, kaempferol has been found in diverse families. Kaempferol has also been identified in Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons of Angiosperms. The total average intake of flavonols and flavones in a normal diet is estimated as 23 mg/day, to which kaempferol contributes approximately 17%. Common foods that contain kaempferol include: apples, grapes, tomatoes, green tea, potatoes, onions, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, squash, cucumbers, lettuce, green beans, peaches, blackberries, raspberries, and spinach. Plants that are known to contain kaempferol include Aloe vera, Coccinia grandis, Cuscuta chinensis, Euphorbia pekinensis, Glycine max, Hypericum perforatum, Pinus sylvestris, Moringa oleifera, Rosmarinus officinalis, Sambucus nigra, Toona sinensis, and Ilex. It also is present in endive. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of kaempferol occurs in four major steps: Phenylalanine is converted into 4-coumaroyl-CoA 4-Coumaroyl-CoA combines with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form naringenin chalcone (tetrahydroxychalcone) through the action of the enzyme chalcone synthase Naringenin chalcone is converted to naringenin and then a hydroxyl group is added to form dihydrokaempferol Dihydrokaempferol has a double bond introduced into it to form kaempferol The amino acid phenylalanine is formed from the Shikimate pathway, which is the pathway that plants use in order to make aromatic amino acids. This pathway is located in the plant plastid, and is the entry to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. The phenylpropanoid pathway is the pathway that converts phenylalanine into tetrahydroxychalcone. Flavonols, including kaempferol, are products of this pathway. == Notes == == External links == Media related to Kaempferol at Wikimedia Commons Flavonoid composition of tea: Comparison of black and green teas",Rhamnolutein,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759548544883728)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.5857275128364563), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5776075720787048)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://bpsbioscience.com/kaempferol,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~540204,https://www.enzo.com/product/kaempferol-2/,https://www.glpbio.com/kr/kaempferol.html ', [])"
1984,"('Auranofin',)",Medical,"Auranofin is an orally administered gold salt classified by the World Health Organization as an antirheumatic agent. It has the brand name Ridaura. Along with sodium aurothiomalate it is one of only two gold compounds currently employed in modern medicine. == Use == Auranofin is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It improves arthritis symptoms including painful or tender and swollen joints and morning stiffness. Auranofin is a safer treatment compared to the more common injectable gold thiolates (gold sodium thiomalate and gold thioglucose), but meta-analysis of 66 clinical trials concluded that it is somewhat less effective. The drug was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1985. No longer a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, due to its adverse effects, ""most of which are associated with long-term use for chronic disease. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal complaints such as loose stools, abdominal cramping and watery diarrhea, which can develop in the early months of treatment. The development of loose stools occurs in 40 % of patients, while watery diarrhea is reported in just 2–5 % of patients, and in most cases these symptoms were alleviated by reducing or splitting the dose"". == Research == === HIV infection === Auranofin is under investigation as a means of reducing the viral reservoir of HIV that lies latent in the body's T-cells despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy. The drug was shown to reduce the amount of latent virus in monkey trials. A human study testing auranofin and other investigational treatments is ongoing in Brazil. Preliminary results show that auranofin contributed to a decrease in the viral reservoir. === Amebiasis === Auranofin has been identified in a high-throughput drug screen as 10 times more potent than metronidazole against Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan agent of human amebiasis. Assays of thioredoxin reductase and transcriptional profiling suggest that the effect of auranofin on the enzyme enhances the sensitivity of the trophozoites to reactive oxygen-mediated killing in mouse and hamster models; the results are marked reductions of the number of parasites, the inflammatory reaction to the infestation, and the damage to the liver. === Acanthamoeba Keratitis and Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis === Auranofin may be useful in the prevention and control of Acanthamoeba infections, and in the treatment of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, caused by pathogenic free-living amoebae Acanthamoeba spp. and Naegleria fowleri, respectively. === Tuberculosis === In a cell-based screen, auranofin showed potent activity against replicating and non-replicating M. tuberculosis as well as other gram-positive bacteria. Auranofin protected mice from an otherwise lethal infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The drug acts in a similar manner in bacteria as in parasites by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Studies in humans are needed to evaluate the potential of this drug to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections in humans. === Ovarian cancer === Drug-screening reveals auranofin induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells in vitro. === Lung cancer including Adenocarcinoma === When mice with Protein kinase Cι (PKCι)–dependent KP adenocarcinoma tumors that exhibited resistance to anti–PD-1 antibody therapy (α-PD-1) were treated with auranofin, the PKCι inhibitor auranofin inhibited KP tumor growth and sensitized these tumors to α-PD-1. The Mayo clinic is running a clinical trial to research the effects of auranofin and sirolimus on squamous, ras mutated lung adenocarcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. === COVID-19 === Auranofin may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for causing COVID-19 in cell culture. Inflammation may also be reduced. == Etymology == The brand name Ridaura was coined from the phrase Remission-Inducing Drug + Auranofin. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Auranofin at Wikimedia Commons MedlinePlus DrugInfo medmaster-a685038",Auranofin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.373566141817719e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019351581577211618)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/monograph/auranofin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Auranofin Monograph for Professionals - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/monograph/auranofin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1986,"('Dipyridamole', 'Dipyridamol', 'Persantin', 'Dipyridamine', 'Dipyudamine')",Medical,"Dipyridamole, sold under the brand name Persantine among others, is an antiplatelet drug of the nucleoside transport inhibitor and PDE3 inhibitor class that inhibits blood clot formation when given chronically and causes blood vessel dilation when given at high doses over a short time. == Medical uses == Dipyridamole is used to dilate blood vessels in people with peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole has been shown to lower pulmonary hypertension without significant drop of systemic blood pressure. It inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vivo and modestly increases unassisted patency of synthetic arteriovenous hemodialysis grafts. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate impairs platelet aggregation and also causes arteriolar smooth muscle relaxation. Chronic therapy did not show significant drop of systemic blood pressure. It inhibits the replication of mengovirus RNA. It can be used for myocardial stress testing as an alternative to exercise-induced stress methods such as treadmills. It is an experimental agent used for the treatment of restless leg syndrome, conditionally recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as a second-line treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). === Stroke === A combination of dipyridamole and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid/dipyridamole) is FDA-approved for the secondary prevention of stroke and has a bleeding risk equal to that of aspirin use alone. Dipyridamole absorption is pH-dependent and concomitant treatment with gastric acid suppressors (such as a proton pump inhibitor) will inhibit the absorption of liquid and plain tablets. However, it is not licensed as monotherapy for stroke prophylaxis, although a Cochrane review suggested that dipyridamole may reduce the risk of further vascular events in patients presenting after cerebral ischemia. A triple therapy of aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole has been investigated, but this combination led to an increase in adverse bleeding events. == Interactions == Due to its action as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, dipyridamole is likely to potentiate the effects of adenosine. This occurs by blocking the nucleoside transporter (ENT1) through which adenosine enters erythrocyte and endothelial cells. According to Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland 2016 guidelines, dipyridamole is considered to not cause risk of bleeding when receiving neuroaxial anaesthesia and deep nerve blocks. It does not therefore require cessation prior to anaesthesia with these techniques, and can continue to be taken with nerve block catheters in place. == Overdose == Dipyridamole overdose can be treated with aminophylline: 6 or caffeine which reverses its dilating effect on the blood vessels. Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit. == Mechanisms of action == Dipyridamole has two known effects, acting via different mechanisms of action: Dipyridamole inhibits the phosphodiesterase enzymes that normally break down cAMP (increasing cellular cAMP levels and blocking the platelet aggregation, response to ADP) and/or cGMP. Dipyridamole inhibits the cellular reuptake of adenosine into platelets, red blood cells, and endothelial cells, leading to increased extracellular concentrations of adenosine. == References ==",Persantin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00046659549116156995), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001652104256208986)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipyridamole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Dipyridamole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipyridamole?utm_source=openai')])"

In the United States, it (bismuth subgallate) is the active ingredient in Devrom (internal deodorant), an over-the-counter FDA-approved medicine. Also, it has been used to treat Helicobacter pylori infection and is used in wound therapy. As an internal deodorant, it is commonly used by individuals who have had gastrointestinal stoma surgery, bariatric surgery, fecal incontinence, and irritable bowel syndrome. Also, a double blind study in 1974 reported its effectiveness as a flatulence/stool deodorant in ileostomy patients. == Adverse effects == It can cause darkening of the tongue and stools, which is temporary.

1992,"('Eicosapentaenoic acid', 'Timnodonic acid', 'Icosapent', 'Icosapentaenoic acid', 'Cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid')","Food, Medical","Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; also icosapentaenoic acid) is an omega−3 fatty acid. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:5(n−3). It also has the trivial name timnodonic acid. In chemical structure, EPA is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and five cis double bonds; the first double bond is located at the third carbon from the omega end. EPA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that acts as a precursor for prostaglandin-3 (which inhibits platelet aggregation), thromboxane-3, and leukotriene-5 eicosanoids. EPA is both a precursor and the hydrolytic breakdown product of eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA: C22H35NO2; 20:5,n−3). Although studies of fish oil supplements, which contain both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and EPA, have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes, a recent multi-year study of Vascepa (ethyl eicosapentaenoate, the ethyl ester of the free fatty acid), a prescription drug containing only EPA, was shown to reduce heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 25% relative to a placebo in those with statin-resistant hypertriglyceridemia. == Sources == EPA is obtained in the human diet by eating oily fish, e.g., cod liver, herring, mackerel, salmon, menhaden and sardine, various types of edible algae, or by taking supplemental forms of fish oil or algae oil. It is also found in human breast milk. Fish, like most vertebrates, can synthesize very little EPA from dietary alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Because of this extremely low conversion rate, fish primarily obtain it from the algae they consume. It is available to humans from some non-animal sources (e.g., commercially, from Yarrowia lipolytica, and from microalgae such as Nannochloropsis oculata, Monodus subterraneus, Chlorella minutissima and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, which are being developed as a commercial source). EPA is not usually found in higher plants, but it has been reported in trace amounts in purslane. In 2013, it was reported that a genetically modified form of the plant camelina produced significant amounts of EPA. The human body converts a portion of absorbed alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA. ALA is itself an essential fatty acid, and humans need an appropriate supply of it. The efficiency of the conversion of ALA to EPA, however, is much lower than the absorption of EPA from food containing it. Because EPA is also a precursor to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), ensuring a sufficient level of EPA on a diet containing neither EPA nor DHA is harder both because of the extra metabolic work required to synthesize EPA and because of the use of EPA to metabolize into DHA. Medical conditions like diabetes or certain allergies may significantly limit the human body's capacity for metabolization of EPA from ALA. == Forms == Commercially available dietary supplements are most often derived from fish oil and are typically delivered in the triglyceride, ethyl ester, or phospholipid form of EPA. There is debate among supplement manufacturers about the relative advantages and disadvantages of the different forms. One form found naturally in algae, the polar lipid form, has been shown to have improved bioavailability over the ethyl ester or triglyceride form. Similarly, DHA or EPA in the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) form was found to be more efficient than triglyceride and phosphatidylcholines (PC) in a 2020 study. == Biosynthesis == === Aerobic eukaryote pathway === Aerobic eukaryotes, specifically microalgae, mosses, fungi, and most animals (including humans), perform biosynthesis of EPA usually as a series of desaturation and elongation reactions, catalyzed by the sequential action of desaturase and elongase enzymes. This pathway, originally identified in Thraustochytrium, applies to these groups: a desaturation at the sixth carbon of alpha-linolenic acid by a Δ6 desaturase to produce stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4 ω-3), elongation of the stearidonic acid by a Δ6 elongase to produce eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, 20:4 ω-3), desaturation at the fifth carbon of eicosatetraenoic acid by a Δ5 desaturase to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 ω-3), === Polyketide synthase pathway === Marine bacteria and the microalgae Schizochytrium use an anerobic polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway to synthesize DHA. The PKS pathway includes six enzymes namely, 3-ketoacyl synthase (KS), 2 ketoacyl-ACP-reductase (KR), dehydrase (DH), enoyl reductase (ER), dehydratase/2-trans 3-cos isomerase (DH/2,3I), dehydratase/2-trans, and 2-cis isomerase (DH/2,2I). The biosynthesis of EPA varies in marine species, but most of the marine species' ability to convert C18 PUFA to LC-PUFA is dependent on the fatty acyl desaturase and elongase enzymes. The molecule basis of the enzymes will dictate where the double bond is formed on the resulting molecule. The proposed polyketide synthesis pathway of EPA in Shewanella (a marine bacterium) is a repetitive reaction of reduction, dehydration, and condensation that uses acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as building blocks. The mechanism of α-linolenic acid to EPA involves the condensation of malonyl-CoA to the pre-existing α-linolenic acid by KS. The resulting structure is converted by NADPH dependent reductase, KR, to form an intermediate that is dehydrated by the DH enzyme. The final step is the NADPH-dependent reduction of a double bond in trans-2-enoyl-ACP via ER enzyme activity. The process is repeated to form EPA. == Clinical significance == The US National Institute of Health's MedlinePlus lists medical conditions for which EPA (alone or in concert with other ω-3 sources) is known or thought to be an effective treatment. Most of these involve its ability to lower inflammation. Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega−3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (> 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater than 500 mg/dL). Dietary supplements containing EPA and DHA lower triglycerides in a dose dependent manner; however, DHA appears to raise low-density lipoprotein (the variant which drives atherosclerosis, sometimes inaccurately called ""bad cholesterol"") and LDL-C values (a measurement/estimate of the cholesterol mass within LDL-particles), while EPA does not. This effect has been seen in several meta-analyses that combined hundreds of individual clinical trials in which both EPA and DHA were part of a high dose omega−3 supplement, but it is when EPA and DHA are given separately that the difference can be seen clearly. For example, in a study by Schaefer and colleagues of Tufts Medical School, patients were given either 600 mg/day DHA alone, 600 or 1800 mg/day EPA alone, or placebo for six weeks. The DHA group showed a significant 20% drop in triglycerides and an 18% increase in LDL-C, but in the EPA groups modest drops in triglyceride were not considered statistically significant and no changes in LDL-C levels were found with either dose. Ordinary consumers commonly obtain EPA and DHA from foods such as fatty fish, fish oil dietary supplements, and less commonly from algae oil supplements in which the omega−3 doses are lower than those in clinical experiments. A Cooper Center Longitudinal Study that followed 9253 healthy men and women over 10 years revealed that those who took fish oil supplements did not see raised LDL-C levels. In fact, there was a very slight decrease of LDL-C which was statistically significant but too small to be of any clinical significance. These individuals took fish oil supplements of their own choosing, and it should be recognized that the amounts and ratios of EPA and DHA vary according to the source of fish oil. Omega−3 fatty acids, particularly EPA, have been studied for their effect on autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Some have theorized that, since omega−3 fatty acid levels may be low in children with autism, supplementation might lead to an improvement in symptoms. While some uncontrolled studies have reported improvements, well-controlled studies have shown no statistically significant improvement in symptoms as a result of high-dose omega−3 supplementation. In addition, studies have shown that omega−3 fatty acids may be useful for treating depression. EPA and DHA ethyl esters (all forms) may be absorbed less well, thus work less well, when taken on an empty stomach or with a low-fat meal. == Notes == == References == == External links == EPA bound to proteins in the PDB Eicosapentaenoyl Ethanolamide; Anandamide (20:5, n-3); EPEA. - PubChem",Icosapentaenoic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.20729584991931915), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.693188488483429), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -7.505351095460355e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.008129963040119e-06), (' FOOD', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.47616028785705566), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('ĠEND', -0.31330880522727966), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', 0.0), (',', -4.6491513785440475e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015095992712303996)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5046189427375793), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.6931852698326111), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1993,"('Ambroxol', 'Rac-cis-ambroxol', 'Ambroxol base', 'Ambroxolum', 'Bisolvon metabolite viii')",Medical,"Ambroxol is a drug that breaks up phlegm, used in the treatment of respiratory diseases associated with viscid or excessive mucus. Ambroxol is often administered as an active ingredient in cough syrup. It was patented in 1966 and came into medical use in 1979. == Medical uses == Ambroxol is indicated as ""secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport. It promotes mucus clearance, facilitates expectoration and eases productive cough, allowing patients to breathe freely and deeply"". There are many different formulations developed since the first marketing authorisation in 1978. Ambroxol is available as syrup, tablets, pastilles, dry powder sachets, inhalation solution, drops and ampules as well as effervescent tablets. Ambroxol also provides pain relief in acute sore throat. Pain in sore throat is the hallmark of acute pharyngitis. Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection. The infection is self limited and the patient recovers normally after a few days. What is most bothering for the patient is the continuous pain in the throat maximized when the patient is swallowing. The main goal of treatment is thus to reduce pain. The main property of ambroxol for treating sore throat is the local anaesthetic effect, described first in the late 1970s, but explained and confirmed in more recent work. High-dose ambroxol, delivered via intravenous injection, reduces the mortality rate in paraquat poisoning by 31%. == Side effects == Studies and observations to date have not uncovered specific contraindications of ambroxol; however, caution is suggested for patients with gastric ulceration, and usage during the first trimester of pregnancy is not recommended. == Mechanism of action == The substance acts on mucous membranes, restoring the physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract (which play an important role in the body's natural defence mechanisms) through several mechanisms, including breaking up phlegm, stimulating mucus production, and stimulating synthesis and release of surfactant by type II pneumocytes. Surfactant acts as an anti-glue factor by reducing the adhesion of mucus to the bronchial wall, in improving its transport and in providing protection against infection and irritating agents. Ambroxol is a potent inhibitor of the neuronal Na+ channels, explaining its anaesthetic effect. This property led to the development of a lozenge containing 20 mg of ambroxol. Many state-of-the-art clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ambroxol in relieving pain in acute sore throat, with a rapid onset of action, with its effect lasting at least three hours. Ambroxol is also anti-inflammatory, reducing redness in a sore throat. It reduces the release of inflammatory cytokines and histamines in cell cultures. It also acts as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and hypochloric acid generated by neutrophils. These two effects explain its effect in treating acute lung injury caused by paraquat. Ambroxol has recently been shown to increase activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Because of this it may be a useful therapeutic agent for both Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. It was also recently shown that ambroxol triggers exocytosis of lysosomes by releasing calcium from acidic cellular calcium stores. This occurs by diffusion of ambroxol into lysosomes and lysosomal pH neutralization. This mechanism is most likely responsible for the mucolytic effects of the drug, but may also explain the reported activity in Gaucher and Parkinson's disease. Both ambroxol and its parent drug bromhexine have been shown to induce autophagy in several cell types, and ambroxol was shown to potentiate rifampicin therapy in a model of tuberculosis through host directed effects. Ambroxol also enhances lung levels of a wide range of antibiotics. == Brand names == Ambroxol is the active ingredient of Muciclar (Italy), Mucosolvan, Mucobrox (Spain), Bisolvon (Switzerland), Cloxan (Mexico), Mucol, Lasolvan, Mucoangin, Surbronc, Brontex (Lithuania), Ambro (Kazakhstan), Ambolar, Inhalex, Mucolite (India), Fluibrox (Greece) and Lysopain. Ambroxol has been approved as a safe and effective substance in the European Medicines Agency, but has not been approved in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration. Ambroxol is also not registered for use in Australia. == References ==",Ambroxol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007335832342505455), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043644916149787605)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroxol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Ambroxol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroxol?utm_source=openai')])"

Most methodologies to assess itching suffer from being unidimensional, for example only measuring intensity without impact on quality of life, or only measuring scratching activity. None has actually been demonstrated to be able to detect change over time, which is essential to using them as an outcome measure of response to an intervention. The 5-D itch scale was developed as a brief but multidimensional questionnaire designed to be useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The five dimensions are degree, duration, direction, disability and distribution. To study the 5-D with respect to validity, reliability and response to change. The 5-D was administered to 234 individuals with chronic pruritus due to liver disease (n = 63), kidney disease (n = 36), dermatological disorders (n = 56), HIV/AIDS (n = 28) and burn injuries (n = 51). The 5-D was administered at baseline and after a 6-week follow-up period. A subset of 50 untreated patients was retested after 3 days to assess test-retest reliability. The 5-D score correlated strongly with a visual analogue score: r = 0.727 at baseline (P < 0.0001), r = 0.868 at the 3-day repeat (P < 0.0001), and r = 0.892 at the 6-week follow-up (P < 0.0001). There was no change in mean 5-D score between day 1 and day 3 in untreated individuals (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96, P < 0.0001). The 5-D did, however, detect significant changes in pruritus over the 6-week follow-up period (P < 0.0001). Subanalysis of the different patient groups revealed similar response patterns and scores, with the exception of lower total scores for the burn victims due to lower scores on the distribution domain because they itched only at the site of their burn. The 5-D, therefore, is a reliable, multidimensional measure of itching that has been validated in patients with chronic pruritus to able to detect changes over time. The 5-D should be useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are various free radicals generated in a biological milieu (1, 2). They are propagated through a cascade of reactions in the pathogenesis in many diseases, including cancer, stroke, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetic vascular diseases, and inflammatory diseases (2). In particular, ROS interact with glutathione (GSH), NADPH, and ascorbates to maintain cellular redox status (3). Therefore, the distribution of ROS in tissue can be used as a surrogate marker to characterize the redox status/environment in disease-related physiological and pathological conditions (1). Because all free radicals contain unpaired electrons, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique, also called electron spin resonance (ESR), is specific for detecting and quantifying ROS (2). EPR spectra can provide a wealth of information for unequivocal identification of free radicals, such as fine, hyperfine, and superhyperfine structures, g-factor, and lineshape (2). EPR imaging (EPRI) technique allows for non-invasive mapping of free radicals in animals/organs (4). EPR is fundamentally similar to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (5). However, the differences in the physical and chemical properties of the resonance species (unpaired electrons  5-HT(6) receptors are relatively recently-discovered receptors. After an uncertain beginning, where results were ambiguous, findings are now apparently more congruent. Nevertheless, discrepancies still exist. The aim of the present manuscript is to point out some of these discrepancies, in order to reflect on the current status of the field of the 5-HT(6) receptor neuropharmacology, and where the field should move next. Examples of 5-HT(6) receptor ligand-induced changes in behavior, neurochemistry and binding highlight areas where discrepancies remain and further experimental attention is needed. Possible methodological as well as conceptual issues underlying the inconsistencies are considered in an effort to increase awareness of the need for more thorough consideration of these aspects in future research.",Example 5 [wo2012136776a1],PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014259939081966877), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048995137214660645)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2012136776 ', [])"
1995,"('Olopatadine (hydrochloride)', 'Olopatadine', 'Patanol', 'Opatanol', 'Pazeo')",Medical,"Olopatadine, sold under the brand name Patanol among others, is an antihistamine medication used to decrease the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is used as eye drops or as a nasal spray. The eye drops generally result in an improvement within half an hour. Common side effects include headache, sore throat, eye discomfort, or changes in perception of taste. More significant side effects may include sleepiness. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. Olopatadine was patented in 1986 and came into medical use in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 250th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Olopatadine is an active ingredient in eye drops designed to alleviate allergic conjunctivitis, a condition characterized by itchy, red, and watery eyes. It is intended to serve as a superior alternative to eye drops that contain corticosteroids. By utilizing olopatadine, the goal is to minimize the side effects associated with corticosteroids. These side effects include elevated intraocular pressure, which can lead to glaucoma, and an increased susceptibility to infections. In nasal sprays, olopatadine is used either as a standalone active ingredient, or in a combination with mometasone, a corticosteroid. A fixed-dose combination of olopatadine hydrochloride 665 μg and mometasone furoate 25 μg is called ""GSP301"". == Side effects == Known side effects for olopatadine eye drops include headache, eye burning and/or stinging, blurred vision, dry eyes, foreign body sensation, hyperemia, keratitis, eyelid edema, pruritus, asthenia, sore throat (pharyngitis), rhinitis, sinusitis, taste perversion, and vomiting. Olopatadine nasal spray may cause side effects such as nosebleeds, painful nasal sores, fever, urinary discomfort, nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, a bitter taste, drowsiness, headaches, rashes, and repeated instances of painful urination. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Olopatadine acts as a selective antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor, thus stabilizing mast cells and inhibiting histamine release. == History == Olopatadine was patented in 1986 by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo and came into medical use in 1997. In the United States, Pataday Twice Daily Relief was first approved by the FDA in 1996, under the name Patanol as a prescription drug and was indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (referring to ocular redness and itching due to allergies). Pataday – now Pataday Once Daily Relief – was first approved by the FDA in 2004, as a prescription drug and was indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. These drugs are mast cell stabilizers, which work by preventing the release of histamine and therefore prevent or control allergic disorders. In February 2020, Pataday Twice Daily Relief and Pataday Once Daily Relief were switched to be over-the-counter drugs in the United States when the FDA granted the approvals of the nonprescription products to Alcon. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Pallada, Pazeo, Pataday, Patanol S, Patanol, Opatanol, Olopat, Patanase.

1996,"('Doxycycline (hyclate)', 'Doxycycline hydrochloride hemiethanolate hemihydrate', 'Doxycycline', 'Vibramycin', 'Doxytetracycline')",Medical,"Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the tetracycline class used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria and certain parasites. It is used to treat bacterial pneumonia, acne, chlamydia infections, Lyme disease, cholera, typhus, and syphilis. It is also used to prevent malaria. Doxycycline may be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and an increased risk of sunburn. Use during pregnancy is not recommended. Like other agents of the tetracycline class, it either slows or kills bacteria by inhibiting protein production. It kills malaria by targeting a plastid organelle, the apicoplast. Doxycycline was patented in 1957 and came into commercial use in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Doxycycline is available as a generic medicine. In 2022, it was the 68th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == In addition to the general indications for all members of the tetracycline antibiotics group, doxycycline is frequently used to treat Lyme disease, chronic prostatitis, sinusitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, severe acne, rosacea, and rickettsial infections. The efficiency of oral doxycycline for treating papulopustular rosacea and adult acne is not solely based on its antibiotic properties, but also on its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties. In Canada, in 2004, doxycycline was considered a first-line treatment for chlamydia and non-gonococcal urethritis and with cefixime for uncomplicated gonorrhea. === Antibacterial === ==== General indications ==== Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is employed in the treatment of numerous bacterial infections. It is effective against bacteria such as Moraxella catarrhalis, Brucella melitensis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Additionally, doxycycline is used in the prevention and treatment of serious conditions like anthrax, leptospirosis, bubonic plague, and Lyme disease. However, some bacteria, including Haemophilus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have shown resistance to doxycycline. It is also effective against Yersinia pestis (the infectious agent of bubonic plague), and is prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Specifically, doxycycline is indicated for treatment of the following diseases: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, scrub typhus, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsia, respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Lymphogranuloma venereum, trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, psittacosis, non-gonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum, relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis, chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, plague due to Yersinia pestis, tularemia, cholera, campylobacter fetus infections, brucellosis caused by Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin), bartonellosis, granuloma inguinale (Klebsiella species), Lyme disease (Borrelia species). ==== Gram-negative bacteria specific indications ==== When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug, doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli infections, Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes) infections, Shigella species infections, Acinetobacter species (formerly Mima species and Herellea species) infections, respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. ==== Gram-positive bacteria specific indications ==== Some Gram-positive bacteria have developed resistance to doxycycline. Up to 44% of Streptococcus pyogenes and up to 74% of S. faecalis specimens have developed resistance to the tetracycline group of antibiotics. Up to 57% of P. acnes strains developed resistance to doxycycline. When bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug, doxycycline may be used to treat these infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria: upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae), skin and soft tissue infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis infection. ==== Specific applications of doxycycline when penicillin is contraindicated ==== When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline can be used to treat: syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum, yaws caused by Treponema pertenue, listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes, Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme, actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii, infections caused by Clostridium species. ==== Use as adjunctive therapy ==== Doxycycline may also be used as adjunctive therapy for severe acne. Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline (SDD) is widely used as an adjunctive treatment to scaling and root planing for periodontitis. Significant differences were observed for all investigated clinical parameters of periodontitis in favor of the scaling and root planing + SDD group where SDD dosage regimens is 20 mg twice daily for three months in a meta-analysis published in 2011. SDD is also used to treat skin conditions such as acne and rosacea, including ocular rosacea. In ocular rosacea, treatment period is 2 to 3 months. After discontinuation of doxycycline, recurrences may occur within three months; therefore, many studies recommend either slow tapering or treatment with a lower dose over a longer period of time. Doxycycline is used as an adjunctive therapy for acute intestinal amebiasis. Doxycycline is also used as an adjunctive therapy for chancroid. ==== As prophylaxis against sexually transmitted infections ==== Doxycycline is used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted bacterial infections (STIs), but it has been associated with tetracycline resistance in associated species, in particular, in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. For this reason, the Australian consensus statement mentions that doxycycline for PEP particularly in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) should be considered only for the prevention of syphilis in GBMSM, and that the risk of increasing antimicrobial resistance outweighed any potential benefit from reductions in other bacterial STIs in GBMSM. Appropriate use of doxycycline for PEP is supported by guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Australasian Society for HIV Medicine. ==== Use in combination ==== The first-line treatment for brucellosis is a combination of doxycycline and streptomycin. The second-line is a combination of doxycycline and rifampicin (rifampin). === Antimalarial === Doxycycline is active against the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum but not against the gametocytes of P. falciparum. It is used to prevent malaria. It is not recommended alone for initial treatment of malaria, even when the parasite is doxycycline-sensitive, because the antimalarial effect of doxycycline is delayed. Doxycycline blocks protein production in apicoplast (an organelle) of P. falciparum—such blocking leads to two main effects: it disrupts the parasite's ability to produce fatty acids, which are essential for its growth, and it impairs the production of heme, a cofactor. These effects occur late in the parasite's life cycle when it is in the blood stage, causing the symptoms of malaria. By blocking important processes in the parasite, doxycycline both inhibits the growth and prevents the multiplication of P. falciparum. It does not directly kill the living organisms of P. falciparum but creates conditions that prevent their growth and replication. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that the combination of doxycycline with either artesunate or quinine may be used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum or following intravenous treatment of severe malaria. === Antihelminthic === Doxycycline kills the symbiotic Wolbachia bacteria in the reproductive tracts of parasitic filarial nematodes, making the nematodes sterile, and thus reducing transmission of diseases such as onchocerciasis and elephantiasis. Field trials in 2005 showed an eight-week course of doxycycline almost eliminates the release of microfilariae. === Spectrum of susceptibility === Doxycycline has been used successfully to treat sexually transmitted, respiratory, and ophthalmic infections. Representative pathogenic genera include Chlamydia, Streptococcus, Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, and others. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. Chlamydia psittaci: 0.03 μg/mL Mycoplasma pneumoniae: 0.016–2 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.06–32 μg/mL === Sclerotherapy === Doxycycline is also used for sclerotherapy in slow-flow vascular malformations, namely venous and lymphatic malformations, as well as post-operative lymphoceles. == Off-label use == Doxycycline has found off-label use in the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Together with tauroursodeoxycholic acid, doxycyclin appears to be a promising combination capable of disrupting transthyretin TTR fibrils in existing amyloid deposits of ATTR patients. == Routes of administration == Doxycycline can be administered via oral or intravenous routes. The combination of doxycycline with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants is not inherently dangerous, but any of these foods and supplements may decrease absorption of doxycycline. Doxycycline has a high oral bioavailability, as it is almost completely absorbed in the stomach and proximal small intestine. Unlike other tetracyclines, its absorption is not significantly affected by food or dairy intake. However, co-administration of dairy products reduces the serum concentration of doxycycline by 20%. Doxycycline absorption is also inhibited by divalent and trivalent cations, such as iron, bismuth, aluminum, calcium and magnesium. Doxycycline forms unstable complexes with metal ions in the acidic gastric environment, which dissociate in the small intestine, allowing the drug to be absorbed. However, some doxycycline remains complexed with metal ions in the duodenum, resulting in a slight decrease in absorption. == Contraindications == Severe liver disease or concomitant use of isotretinoin or other retinoids are contraindications, as both tetracyclines and retinoids can cause intracranial hypertension (increased pressure around the brain) in rare cases. === Pregnancy and lactation === Doxycycline is categorized by the FDA as a class D drug in pregnancy. Doxycycline crosses into breastmilk. Other tetracycline antibiotics are contraindicated in pregnancy and up to eight years of age, due to the potential for disrupting bone and tooth development. They include a class warning about staining of teeth and decreased development of dental enamel in children exposed to tetracyclines in utero, during breastfeeding or during young childhood. However, the FDA has acknowledged that the actual risk of dental staining of primary teeth is undetermined for doxycycline specifically. The best available evidence indicates that doxycycline has little or no effect on hypoplasia of dental enamel or on staining of teeth. The CDC recommends the use of doxycycline for treatment of Q fever and tick-borne rickettsial diseases in young children; others advocate for its use in malaria. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are similar to those of other members of the tetracycline antibiotic group. Doxycycline can cause gastrointestinal upset. Oral doxycycline can cause pill esophagitis, particularly when it is swallowed without adequate fluid, or by persons with difficulty swallowing or impaired mobility. Doxycycline is less likely than other antibiotic drugs to cause Clostridioides difficile colitis. An erythematous rash in sun-exposed parts of the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline as prophylaxis against malaria. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug. Unlike some other members of the tetracycline group, it may be used in those with renal impairment. Doxycycline use has been associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In one large retrospective study, patients who were prescribed doxycycline for their acne had a 2.25-fold greater risk of developing Crohn's disease. == Interactions == Previously, doxycycline was believed to impair the effectiveness of many types of hormonal contraception due to CYP450 induction. Research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline), although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug to prevent unwanted pregnancy. == Pharmacology == Doxycycline, like other tetracycline antibiotics, is bacteriostatic. It works by preventing bacteria from reproducing by inhibiting protein synthesis. Doxycycline is highly lipophilic, so it can easily enter cells, meaning the drug is easily absorbed after oral administration and has a large volume of distribution. It can also be re-absorbed in the renal tubules and gastrointestinal tract due to its high lipophilicity, giving it a long elimination half-life. It is also prevented from accumulating in the kidneys of patients with kidney failure due to the compensatory excretion in faeces. Doxycycline–metal ion complexes are unstable at acidic pH, therefore more doxycycline enters the duodenum for absorption than the earlier tetracycline compounds. In addition, food has less effect on the absorption of doxycycline than on the absorption of earlier drugs, with doxycycline serum concentrations being reduced by about 20% by test meals compared with 50% for tetracycline. === Mechanism of action === Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic. It inhibits the synthesis of bacterial proteins by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, which is only found in bacteria. This prevents the binding of transfer RNA to messenger RNA at the ribosomal subunit, meaning amino acids cannot be added to polypeptide chains and new proteins cannot be made. This stops bacterial growth, giving the immune system time to kill and remove the bacteria. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is almost completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. It reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to two hours and has a high plasma protein binding rate of about 80–90%. Doxycycline penetrates into almost all tissues and body fluids. Very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder, liver, kidneys, lungs, breast milk, bones, and genitals; low concentrations are found in saliva, aqueous humor, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and especially in inflamed meninges. By comparison, the tetracycline antibiotic minocycline penetrates significantly better into the CSF and meninges. Doxycycline metabolism is negligible. It is actively excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels), where some of it is inactivated by forming chelates. About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys, much less in people with end-stage kidney disease. The biological half-life is 18 to 22 hours (16 ± 6 hours according to another source) in healthy people, slightly longer in those with end-stage kidney disease, and significantly longer in those with liver disease. == Chemistry == Expired tetracyclines or tetracyclines allowed to stand at a pH less than 2 are reported to be nephrotoxic due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome. In the case of doxycycline, the absence of a hydroxyl group in C-6 prevents the formation of the nephrotoxic compound. Nevertheless, tetracyclines and doxycycline itself have to be taken with caution in patients with kidney injury, as they can worsen azotemia due to catabolic effects. === Chemical properties === Doxycycline, doxycycline monohydrate and doxycycline hyclate are yellow, crystalline powders with a bitter taste. The latter smells faintly of ethanol, a 1% aqueous solution has a pH of 2–3, and the specific rotation is [ α ] D 25 {\displaystyle [\alpha ]_{D}^{25}} −110° cm3/dm·g in 0.01 N methanolic hydrochloric acid. == History == After penicillin revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections in World War II, many chemical companies moved into the field of discovering antibiotics by bioprospecting. American Cyanamid was one of these, and in the late 1940s chemists there discovered chlortetracycline, the first member of the tetracycline class of antibiotics. Shortly thereafter, scientists at Pfizer discovered oxytetracycline and it was brought to market. Both compounds, like penicillin, were natural products and it was commonly believed that nature had perfected them, and further chemical changes could only degrade their effectiveness. Scientists at Pfizer led by Lloyd Conover modified these compounds, which led to the invention of tetracycline itself, the first semi-synthetic antibiotic. Charlie Stephens' group at Pfizer worked on further analogs and created one with greatly improved stability and pharmacological efficacy: doxycycline. It was clinically developed in the early 1960s and approved by the FDA in 1967. As its patent grew near to expiring in the early 1970s, the patent became the subject of lawsuit between Pfizer and International Rectifier that was not resolved until 1983; at the time it was the largest litigated patent case in US history. Instead of a cash payment for infringement, Pfizer took the veterinary and feed-additive businesses of International Rectifier's subsidiary, Rachelle Laboratories. In January 2013, the FDA reported shortages of some, but not all, forms of doxycycline ""caused by increased demand and manufacturing issues"". Companies involved included an unnamed major generics manufacturer that ceased production in February 2013, Teva (which ceased production in May 2013), Mylan, Actavis, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals. The shortage came at a particularly bad time, since there were also shortages of an alternative antibiotic, tetracycline, at the same time. The market price for doxycycline dramatically increased in the United States in 2013 and early 2014 (from $20 to over $1800 for a bottle of 500 tablets), before decreasing again. == Society and culture == Doxycycline is available worldwide under many brand names. Doxycycline is available as a generic medicine. Doxycycline is also used in the prevention of certain sexually transmitted infections, particularly among men who have sex with men. == Research == === Medical conditions === Research areas on the application of doxycycline include the following medical conditions: macular degeneration; rheumatoid arthritis instead of minocycline (both of which have demonstrated modest efficacy for this disease). === Dosing === Although doxycycline is approved to treat Lyme disease, the optimal dosing and duration of treatment for this condition is a topic of ongoing research. it can be used in adults and children. For treatment or prophylaxis of Lyme disease in children, it can be used for a duration of up to 21 days in children of any age. Doxycycline is specifically indicated to treat Lyme disease for patients presenting with erythema migrans. As for the optimal duration of treatment of this disease, guidelines vary, with some recommending a 10-day course of doxycycline, while others suggest a 14-day course; still, recent data suggest that even a 7-day course of doxycycline can be effective. Compared to other drugs, there are no significant differences in treatment response across antibiotic agents, doses, or durations when comparing 14 days versus 21 days; as such, the optimal duration of treatment of Lyme disease remains uncertain, as prolonged antibiotic courses have drawbacks, including diminishing returns in terms of patient outcomes, heightened risks of adverse events, superinfections, increased healthcare costs, and the potential for development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the consensus remains to treat patients with the shortest effective duration of antibiotics, as is the case with doxycycline for Lyme disease as well. === Anti-inflammatory agent === Some studies show doxycycline as a potential agent to possess anti-inflammatory properties acting by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Some studies suggest that doxycycline can suppress the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, which is responsible for upregulating several inflammatory mediators in various cells, including neurons; therefore, it is studied as a potential agent for treating neuroinflammation. A potential explanation of doxycycline's anti-inflammatory properties is its inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are a group of proteases known to regulate the turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) and thus are suggested to be important in the process of several diseases associated with tissue remodeling and inflammation. Doxycycline has been shown to inhibit MMPs, including matrilysin (MMP7), by interacting with the structural zinc atom and/or calcium atoms within the structural metal center of the protein. Doxycycline also inhibits allikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5). The inhibition of MMPs and KLK5 enzymes subsequently suppresses the expression of LL-37, a cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide that, when overexpressed, can trigger inflammatory cascades. By inhibiting LL-37 expression, doxycycline helps to mitigate these downstream inflammatory cascades, thereby reducing inflammation and the symptoms of inflammatory conditions. Doxycycline is used to treat acne vulgaris and rosacea. However, there is no clear understanding of what contributes more: the bacteriostatic properties of doxycycline, which affect bacteria (such as Propionibacterium acnes) on the surface of sebaceous glands even in lower doses called ""submicrobial"" or ""subantimicrobial"", or whether doxycycline's anti-inflammatory effects, which reduce inflammation in acne vulgaris and rosacea, including ocular rosacea, contribute more to its therapeutic effectiveness against these skin conditions. Subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline (SDD) can still have a bacteriostatic effect, especially when taken for extended periods, such as several months in treating acne and rosacea. While the SDD is believed to have anti-inflammatory effects rather than solely antibacterial effects, SDD was proven to work by reducing inflammation associated with acne and rosacea. Still, the exact mechanisms have yet to be fully discovered. One probable mechanism is doxycycline's ability to decrease the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inflammation in rosacea may be associated with increased production of ROS by inflammatory cells; these ROS contribute toward exacerbating symptoms. Doxycycline may reduce ROS levels and induce antioxidant activity because it directly scavenges hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, helping minimize tissue damage caused by highly oxidative and inflammatory conditions. Studies have shown that SDD can effectively improve acne and rosacea symptoms, probably without inducing antibiotic resistance. It is observed that doxycycline exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis and oxidative bursts, which are common mechanisms involved in inflammation and ROS activity in rosacea and acne. Doxycycline's dual benefits as an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory make it a helpful treatment option for diseases involving inflammation not only of the skin, such as rosacea and acne, but also in conditions such as osteoarthritis or periodontitis. Nevertheless, current results are inconclusive, and evidence of doxycycline's anti-inflammatory properties needs to be improved, considering conflicting reports from animal models so far. Doxycycline has been studied in various immunological disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and periodontitis. In these conditions, doxycycline has been researched to determine anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that could be beneficial in treating these conditions. However, a solid conclusion still needs to be provided. Doxycycline is also studied for its neuroprotective properties which are associated with antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this context, it is important to note that doxycycline is able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Several studies have shown that doxycycline inhibits dopaminergic neurodegeneration through the upregulation of axonal and synaptic proteins. Axonal degeneration and synaptic loss are key events at the early stages of neurodegeneration and precede neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, the regeneration of the axonal and synaptic network might be beneficial in PD. It has been demonstrated that doxycycline mimics nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling in PC12 cells. However, the involvement of this mechanism in the neuroprotective effect of doxycycline is unknown. Doxycycline is also studied in reverting inflammatory changes related to depression. While there is some research on the use of doxycycline for treating major depressive disorder, the results are mixed. After a large-scale trial showed no benefit of using doxycycline in treating COVID‑19, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance to not recommend the medication for the treatment of COVID‑19. Doxycycline was expected to possess anti-inflammatory properties that could lessen the cytokine storm associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the trials did not demonstrate the expected benefit. Researchers also believed that doxycycline possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that could reduce the production of cytokines in COVID-19, but these supposed effects failed to improve the outcome of COVID-19 treatment. === Wound healing === Research on novel drug formulations for the delivery of doxycycline in wound treatment is expanding, focusing on overcoming stability limitations for long-term storage and developing consumer-friendly, parenteral antibiotic delivery systems. The most common and practical form of doxycycline delivery is through wound dressings, which have evolved from mono- to three-layered systems to maximize healing effectiveness. Research directions on the use of doxycycline in wound healing include the continuous stabilization of doxycycline, scaling up technology and industrial production, and exploring non-contact wound treatment methods like sprays and aerosols for use in emergencies and when medical care is not readily accessible. === Research reagent === Doxycycline and other members of the tetracycline class of antibiotics are often used as research reagents in in vitro and in vivo biomedical research experiments involving bacteria as well in experiments in eukaryotic cells and organisms with inducible protein expression systems using tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria impairing metabolism and leading to effects that can confound experimental results. Doxycycline is also used in ""tet-on"" (gene expression activated by doxycycline) and ""tet-off"" (gene expression inactivated by doxycycline) tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation to regulate transgene expression in organisms and cell cultures. Doxycycline is more stable than tetracycline for this purpose. At subantimicrobial doses, doxycycline is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases, and has been used in various experimental systems for this purpose, such as for recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions. == References == == External links ==",Vibramycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.957670196541585e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019463420612737536)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/vibramycin.html ', [])"

An autoinjector is a medical device designed to deliver a single dose of a particular (typically life-saving) drug. Most autoinjectors are spring-loaded syringes. By design, autoinjectors are easy to use and are intended for self-administration by patients. The site of injection depends on the drug loaded, but it typically is administered into the thigh or the buttocks. The injectors were initially designed to overcome the hesitation associated with self-administration of the needle-based drug delivery device. It is the newer delivery vehicle to be used in lieu of the Mark I NAAK. == Purpose == The ATNAA provides atropine and pralidoxime chloride in a single delivery system, although the two drugs are separate within the device. The use of the device is only to be administered in the extreme case of organophosphate poisoning. The delivery system is designed for use by military personnel only, and is only issued to DOD personnel that are considered to be in immediate danger of a chemical attack or work in a position (such as ordnance disposal) where there is a high likelihood of nerve agent exposure. == FDA approval == During initial trials and submission to the FDA for approval, the United States Department of Defense requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) waive the requirement for the phrase 'Rx only' being included on the labeling for the ATNAA device; the rationale being that it would be confusing to troops. The waiver request was denied. The DoD opted to include the phrase at the end of the package insert instead, and this modification was found acceptable. == Training == As a condition of approval, the FDA lists on the device label the precise instructions that are to be given to military personnel on dosage and administration. While each branch of the DoD typically provides their own tailored training, an example of the MK I NAAK and ATNAA are referenced in the United States Air Force Self Aid Buddy Care Training (SABC).

Targeted inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for various inflammatory diseases. Ergolide (ERG) is a sesquiterpene lactone natural product derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb, Inula britannica. ERG has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, but the target is remains unknown. This study performed an in-depth investigation of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of ERG in NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and NLPR3 inflammasome related sepsis and acute lung injury model. ELISA and Western blot were used to determine the IL-1β and P20 levels. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect the interaction between proteins. Drug affinity response target stability (DARTS) assays were used to explore the potential target of ERG. C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with E. coli DH5α (2 × 10 We showed that ERG is an efficient inhibitor of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis in the first and second signals of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ERG irreversibly bound to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to prevent the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ERG remarkably improved the survival rate of wild-type septic mice. In lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury model, ERG alleviated acute lung injury of wild-type mice but not NLRP3 knockout mice. Our results revealed that the anti-pyroptosis effect of ERG are dependent on NLRP3 and NLRP3 NACHT domain is ERG's direct target. Therefore, ERG can serve as a precursor drug for the development of novel NLRP3 inhibitors to treat NLRP3 inflammasome mediated inflammatory diseases. Uveal melanoma is a poor prognosis cancer. Ergolide, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from  Ergolide bioactivity was screened via long-term proliferation assay in UM/MUM cells and in zebrafish MUM xenograft models. Mass spectrometry profiled proteins modulated by ergolide within whole cell or extracellular vesicle (EVs) lysates of the OMM2.5 MUM cell line. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblots and correlation analyses to UM patient survival used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Ergolide treatment resulted in significant, dose-dependent reductions (48.5 to 99.9%;  Ergolide is a novel, promising anti-proliferative agent for UM/MUM. Proteomic profiling of OMM2.5 cellular/EV lysates identified candidate pathways elucidating the action of ergolide and putative biomarkers of UM, that require further examination. The most common form of adult eye cancer is uveal melanoma (UM). Once UM cancer cells spread to organs in the rest of the body, metastatic UM (MUM), there is a poor prognosis for patients with only one approved drug treatment. Hence, it is vital to better understand the cellular and extracellular proteins that regulate UM pathology in order to uncover biomarkers of disease and therapeutic targets. In this original study, we demonstrate a compound called ergolide is capable of severely reducing the metabolic activity and growth of UM cancer cells, grown as isolated monolayers. Ergolide was also able to reduce the growth of human MUM cells growing as tumors in transplanted zebrafish larvae. We identify that ergolide alters specific proteins found in the human UM cells. These proteins once analyzed in detail offer opportunities to understand how new treatment strategies can be developed for UM. Treatment with ergolide, a sesquiterpene lactone from Inula britannica var chinensis, caused the induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in response to ergolide. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction appeared to be associated with ergolide-induced apoptosis, because Bax translocation and cytochrome c release were stimulated by ergolide. In parallel, the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway was significantly inhibited by ergolide, which was accompanied by down-regulation of cell survival molecules, such as X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and Bcl-2. In addition, the JNK signaling pathway was involved in ergolide-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our results identified a new mechanism for the anti-cancer property of ergolide, attributable to the induction of apoptosis through down-regulation of cell survival signal molecules resulting from inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",Ergolide,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00572057394310832), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.02326073683798313), (' FOOD', -1.6405310816480778e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.07936863601207733), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759752988815308)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.chemdatabank.com/compounds/compound-ergolide.html,https://www.medchemexpress.com/ergolide.html,https://plantaedb.com/compounds/ergolide ', [])"

Lactulose was first made in 1929, and has been used medically since the 1950s. Lactulose is made from the milk sugar lactose, which is composed of two simple sugars, galactose and glucose. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 267th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Constipation === Lactulose is used in the treatment of chronic constipation in patients of all ages as a long-term treatment. The dosage of lactulose for chronic idiopathic constipation is adjusted depending on the constipation severity and desired effect, from a mild stool softener to causing diarrhea. Lactulose is contraindicated in case of galactosemia, as most preparations contain the monosaccharide galactose due to its synthesis process. Lactulose may be used to counter the constipating effects of opioids, and in the symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids as a stool softener. Lactulose is commonly prescribed for children who develop fear of their bowel movements and are withholders. This is because lactulose, when dosed in the proper amount, causes a bowel movement that is impossible to retain for very long. Lactulose is also used for the elderly because of its gentle and consistent results. === Hyperammonemia === Lactulose is useful in treating hyperammonemia (high blood ammonia), which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose helps trap the ammonia (NH3) in the colon and bind to it. It does this by using gut flora to acidify the colon, transforming the freely diffusible ammonia into ammonium ions (NH+4), which can no longer diffuse back into the blood. It is also useful for preventing hyperammonemia caused as a side effect of administration of valproic acid. === Small intestine bacterial overgrowth === Lactulose is used as a test of small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Recently, the reliability of it for diagnosing SIBO has been seriously questioned. A large amount of it is given with subsequent testing of molecular hydrogen gas in the breath. The test is positive if an increase in exhaled hydrogen occurs before that which would be expected by normal digestion by the normal gut flora in the colon. An earlier result has been hypothesized to indicate digestion occurring within the small intestine. An alternate explanation for differences in results is the variance in small bowel transit time among tested subjects. === Pregnancy === No evidence of harm to the fetus has been found when used during pregnancy. It is generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding. == Side effects == Common side effects of lactulose are abdominal cramping, borborygmus, and flatulence. In normal individuals, overdose is considered uncomfortable, but not life-threatening. Uncommon side effects are nausea and vomiting. In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced kidney function, excess lactulose dosage can result in dehydration and electrolyte disturbances such as low magnesium levels. Ingestion of lactulose does not cause a weight gain because it is not digestible, with no nutritional value. Although lactulose is less likely to cause dental caries than sucrose, as a sugar, a potential for this exists, which is relevant when taken by people with a high susceptibility to this condition. == Mechanism of action == Lactulose is not absorbed in the small intestine nor broken down by human enzymes, thus stays in the digestive bolus through most of its course, causing retention of water through osmosis leading to softer, easier-to-pass stool. It has a secondary laxative effect in the colon, where it is fermented by the gut flora, producing metabolites which have osmotic powers and peristalsis-stimulating effects (such as acetate), but also methane associated with flatulence. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by bacterial flora into short-chain fatty acids, including lactic acid and acetic acid. These partially dissociate, acidifying the colonic contents (increasing the H+ concentration in the gut). This favors the formation of the nonabsorbable NH+4 from NH3, trapping NH3 in the colon and effectively reducing plasma NH3 concentrations. Lactulose is therefore effective in treating hepatic encephalopathy. Specifically, it is effective as secondary prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Moreover, research showed improved cognitive functions and health-related quality of life in people with cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy treated with lactulose. == Chemistry == Lactulose is a disaccharide formed from one molecule each of the simple sugars (monosaccharides) fructose and galactose. Lactulose is not normally present in raw milk, but is a product of heat processes: the greater the heat, the greater amount of this substance (from 3.5 mg/L in low-temperature pasteurized milk to 744 mg/L in in-container sterilized milk). Lactulose is produced commercially by isomerization of lactose. A variety of reaction conditions and catalysts can be used. == Society and culture == === Name === Lactulose is its international nonproprietary name (INN). It is sold under various brand names. === Availability === Lactulose is available as a generic medication. It is available without prescription in most countries, but a prescription is required in the United States, Philippines, and Austria. === Food additive === In some countries where lactulose may be obtained without a prescription, lactulose is commonly used as a food additive to improve taste and promote intestinal transit. == Veterinary use == Lactulose is used in veterinary medicine. == References == == External links ==",Constilac,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -4.961759259458631e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.004078997299075127), (' FOOD', -3.6550729419104755e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00021181246847845614), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.1603110283613205), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0010056205792352557), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004180265124887228)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0015023599844425917)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/monograph/lactulose.html,https://www.catalog.md/drugs/constilac.html,https://www.rxwiki.com/constilac ', [])"

Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists may exhibit anti-tumor activity by transactivating genes which are closely associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. However, it remains not clear whether efatutazone has similar roles in lung adenocarcinoma cells of gefitinib resistant such as HCC827-GR and PC9-GR. It has been demonstrated by us that efatutazone prominently increased the mRNA and protein expression of PPARγ, liver X receptor alpha (LXRα),as well as ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1). In the presence of GW9662 (a specific antagonist of PPARγ) or GGPP (a specific antagonist of LXRα), efatutazone (40 μmol/L) restored the proliferation of both HCC827-GR and PC9-GR cells and obviously inhibited the increased protein and mRNA expression of PPAR-gamma, LXR-alpha, and ABCA1 induced by efatutazone. LXRα knockdown by siRNA (si-LXRα) significantly promoted the HCC827-GR and PC9-GR cells proliferation, whereas incubation efatutazone with si-LXRα restored the proliferation ability compared with the control group. In addition, combination of efatutazone and LXRα agonist T0901317 showed a synergistic therapeutic effect on lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and PPAR gamma, LXR A and ABCA1 protein expression. These results indicate that efatutazone could inhibit the cells proliferation of HCC827-GR and PC9-GR through PPARγ/LXRα/ABCA1 pathway, and synergistic therapeutic effect is achieved when combined with T0901317. A phase 1 study was initiated to determine the safety, potential effectiveness, and maximal tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of efatutazone and paclitaxel in anaplastic thyroid cancer. Patients received efatutazone (0.15, 0.3, or 0.5 mg) orally twice daily and then paclitaxel every 3 weeks. Patient tolerance and outcomes were assessed, as were serum efatutazone pharmacokinetics. Ten of 15 patients were women. Median age was 59 years. Seven patients received 0.15 mg of efatutazone, 6 patients received 0.3 mg, and 2 patients received 0.5 mg. One patient receiving 0.3 mg of efatutazone had a partial response from day 69 to day 175; 7 patients attained stable disease.

When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme alliinase converts alliin into allicin, which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. Allicin is unstable and quickly changes into a series of other sulfur-containing compounds such as diallyl disulfide. Allicin is an antifeedant, i.e. the defense mechanism against attacks by pests on the garlic plant. Allicin is an oily, slightly yellow liquid that gives garlic its distinctive odor. It is a thioester of sulfenic acid. It is also known as allyl thiosulfinate. Its biological activity can be attributed to both its antioxidant activity and its reaction with thiol-containing proteins. == Structure and occurrence == Allicin features the thiosulfinate functional group, R-S-(O)-S-R. The compound is not present in garlic unless tissue damage occurs, and is formed by the action of the enzyme alliinase on alliin. Allicin is chiral but occurs naturally only as a racemate. The racemic form can also be generated by oxidation of diallyl disulfide: (SCH2CH=CH2)2 + 2 RCO3H + H2O → 2 CH2=CHCH2SOH + 2 RCO2H 2 CH2=CHCH2SOH → CH2=CHCH2S(O)SCH2CH=CH2 + H2O Alliinase is irreversibly deactivated below pH 3; as such, allicin is generally not produced in the body from the consumption of fresh or powdered garlic. Furthermore, allicin can be unstable, breaking down within 16 hours at 23 °C. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of allicin commences with the conversion of cysteine into S-allyl-L-cysteine. Oxidation of this thioether gives the sulfoxide (alliin). The enzyme alliinase, which contains pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), cleaves alliin, generating allylsulfenic acid (CH2=CHCH2SOH), pyruvate, and ammonium ions. At room temperature, two molecules of allylsulfenic acid condense to form allicin. == Research == Allicin has been studied for its potential to treat various kinds of multiple drug resistance bacterial infections, as well as viral and fungal infections in vitro, but as of 2016, the safety and efficacy of allicin to treat infections in people was unclear. A Cochrane review found there to be insufficient clinical evidence regarding the effects of allicin in preventing or treating common cold. == History == It was first isolated and studied in the laboratory by Chester J. Cavallito and John Hays Bailey in 1944. Allicin was discovered as part of efforts to create thiamine derivatives in the 1940s, mainly in Japan. Allicin became a model for medicinal chemistry efforts to create other thiamine disulfides. The results included sulbutiamine, fursultiamine (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) and benfothiamine. These compounds are hydrophobic, easily pass from the intestines to the bloodstream, and are reduced to thiamine by cysteine or glutathione.: 302 == See also == Allyl isothiocyanate, the active piquant chemical in mustard, radishes, horseradish and wasabi syn-Propanethial-S-oxide, the lachrymatory chemical found in onions List of phytochemicals in food == References ==",Allicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0015359314857050776), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INFO', [('FO', -0.011680309660732746), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.048601411283016205), ('ĠINFO', -0.34310925006866455), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003582789213396609)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=6, title='Allicin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin?utm_source=openai')])"

The genetic association datasets pertaining to exposure and outcomes were reviewed using the most recent and public genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median (WM), and MR-Egger strategies were implemented for the MR analyses.

In mouse mammary tumor FM3A cells, ECyd was rapidly phosphorylated to ECyd-triphosphate (ECTP) as the final product, strongly inhibiting RNA synthesis. The ultimate metabolite of ECyd, ECTP, is stable in cultured FM3A cells with a half-life of 21 hr; ECyd is on a ""closed"" metabolic pathway to ECTP. Deaminated ECyd derivatives were minor metabolites in the cells treated with Ecyd; therefore cytidine forms probably were not converted to uridine forms at the nucleoside or nucleotide stage. The characteristics of ECyd may be important for the antitumor activity. RNA polymerase in the nucleus was inhibited competitively by ECTP; the ki value was 21 nM. ECyd induced DNA and 28S ribosomal RNA fragnetations. The cleavage pattern of rRNA resembled in that mediated by RNase L. The results suggested that RNase L related mechanisms might be involved in the antitumor activity of ECyd. Detection of RNA synthesis in cells to measure the rate of total transcription is an important experimental technique. To screen the best nucleoside analogue for labeling RNA synthesis, a series of alkyne-modified nucleoside analogues, including 5-ethynylcytidine (EC) and 8-ethynyladenosine (EA), were successfully synthesized by the Sonogashira coupling reaction. The synthesis of RNA or DNA was assayed based on the biosynthetic incorporation of these analogues into newly transcribed RNA or replicating DNA. Analogue-labeled cellular RNA or DNA was detected quickly and with high sensitivity via ""click"" chemistry with fluorescent azides, followed by fluorescence microscopic imaging. The results showed that EC was efficiently incorporated into RNA, but not into DNA, in seven cell lines, as also previously shown for 5-ethynyluridine (EU). Moreover, EC was able to assay transcription rates of various tissues in animals and the rate of metabolism of EC was much faster than that of EU. Prodrugs can have the advantage over parent drugs in increased activation and cellular uptake. The multidrug ETC-L-FdUrd and the duplex drug ETC-FdUrd are composed of two different monophosphate-nucleosides, 5-fluoro-2'deoxyuridine (FdUrd) and ethynylcytidine (ETC), coupled via a glycerolipid or phosphodiester, respectively. The aim of the study was to determine cytotoxicity levels and mode of drug cleavage. Moreover, we determined whether a liposomal formulation of ETC-L-FdUrd would improve cytotoxic activity and/or cleavage. Drug effects/cleavage were studied with standard radioactivity assays, HPLC and LC-MS/MS in FM3A/0 mammary cancer cells and their FdUrd resistant variants FM3A/TK(-). ETC-FdUrd was active (IC(50) of 2.2 and 79 nM) in FM3A/0 and TK(-) cells, respectively. ETC-L-FdUrd was less active (IC(50): 7 nM in FM3A/0 vs 4500 nM in FM3A/TK(-)). Although the liposomal formulation was less active than ETC-L-FdUrd in FM3A/0 cells (IC(50):19.3 nM), resistance due to thymidine kinase (TK) deficiency was greatly reduced. The prodrugs inhibited thymidylate synthase (TS) in FM3A/0 cells (80-90%), but to a lower extent in FM3A/TK(-) (10-50%). FdUMP was hardly detected in FM3A/TK(-) cells. Inhibition of the transporters and nucleotidases/phosphatases resulted in a reduction of cytotoxicity of ETC-FdUrd, indicating that this drug was cleaved outside the cells to the monophosphates, which was verified by the presence of FdUrd and ETC in the medium.

2010,"('Tubocurarine (chloride pentahydrate)', 'Tubocurarine', 'Tubocurarin', 'Tubocurarine chloride', 'Tubocurarinum')",Medical,"Tubocurarine (also known as d-tubocurarine or DTC) is a toxic benzylisoquinoline alkaloid historically known for its use as an arrow poison. In the mid-1900s, it was used in conjunction with an anesthetic to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Safer alternatives, such as cisatracurium and rocuronium, have largely replaced it as an adjunct for clinical anesthesia and it is now rarely used. == History == Tubocurarine is a naturally occurring mono-quaternary alkaloid obtained from the bark of the Menispermaceous South American plant Chondrodendron tomentosum, a climbing vine known to the European world since the Spanish conquest of South America. Curare had been used as a source of arrow poison by South American natives to hunt animals, and they were able to eat the animals' contaminated flesh subsequently without any adverse effects because tubocurarine cannot easily cross mucous membranes. Thus, tubocurarine is effective only if given parenterally, as demonstrated by Bernard, who also showed that the site of its action was at the neuromuscular junction. Virchow and Munter confirmed the paralyzing action was limited to voluntary muscles. === Etymology === The word curare comes from a word in the Cariban languages. Tubocurarine is so-called because some of the plant extracts designated curare were stored, and subsequently shipped to Europe, in bamboo tubes. Likewise, curare stored in calabash containers was called calabash curare, although this was usually an extract not of Chondrodendron, but of the Strychnos species S. toxifera, containing a different alkaloid, namely toxiferine. Pot curare was generally a mixture of extracts from various genera in the families Menispermaceae and Strychnaceae. The tripartite classification into ""tube"", ""calabash"", and ""pot"" curares early became untenable, due to inconsistencies in the use of the different types of vessels and the complexities of the dart poison recipes themselves. === Use in anesthesia === Griffith and Johnson are credited with pioneering the formal clinical introduction of tubocurarine as an adjunct to anesthetic practice on 23 January 1942, at the Montreal Homeopathic Hospital. In this sense, tubocurarine is the prototypical adjunctive neuromuscular non-depolarizing agent. However, others before Griffith and Johnson had attempted use of tubocurarine in several situations: some under controlled study conditions while others not quite controlled and remained unpublished. Regardless, all in all some 30,000 patients had been given tubocurarine by 1941, although it was Griffith and Johnson's 1942 publication that provided the impetus to the standard use of neuromuscular blocking agents in clinical anesthetic practice – a revolution that rapidly metamorphosized into the standard practice of ""balanced"" anesthesia: the triad of barbiturate hypnosis, light inhalational anesthesia and muscle relaxation. The technique as described by Gray and Halton was widely known as the ""Liverpool technique"", and became the standard anesthetic technique in England in the 1950s and 1960s for patients of all ages and physical status. Present clinical anesthetic practice still employs the central principle of balanced anesthesia though with some differences to accommodate subsequent technological advances and introductions of new and better gaseous anesthetic, hypnotic and neuromuscular blocking agents, and tracheal intubation, as well as monitoring techniques that were nonexistent in the day of Gray and Halton: pulse oximetry, capnography, peripheral nerve stimulation, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, etc. == Chemical properties == Structurally, tubocurarine is a benzylisoquinoline derivative. Its structure, when first elucidated in 1948 and for many years, was incorrectly thought to be bis-quaternary: in other words, it was thought to be an N,N-dimethylated alkaloid. In 1970, the correct structure was finally established, showing one of the two nitrogens to be tertiary, actually a mono-N-methylated alkaloid. === Biosynthesis === Tubocurarine biosynthesis involves a radical coupling of the two enantiomers of N-methylcoclaurine. (R) and (S)-N-methylcoclaurine come from a Mannich-like reaction between dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, facilitated by norcoclaurine synthase (NCS). Both dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde originate from L-tyrosine. Methylation of the amine and hydroxyl substituents are facilitated by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). One methyl group is present on each nitrogen atom prior to the radical coupling. The additional methyl group is transferred to form tubocurarine, with its single quaternary N,N-dimethylamino group. == Biological effects == Without intervention, acetylcholine (ACh) in the peripheral nervous system activates skeletal muscles. Acetylcholine is produced in the body of the neuron by choline acetyltransferase and transported down the axon to the synaptic gap. Tubocurarine chloride acts as an antagonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChr), meaning it blocks the receptor site from ACh. This may be due to the quaternary amino structural motif found on both molecules. === Clinical pharmacology === Unna et al. reported the effects of tubocurarine on humans: Forty-five seconds after the beginning of the injection, heaviness of the eyelids and transitory diplopia were perceived. At the completion of the injection, diplopia became fixed, but could be noticed only when the subject's eyelids were raised by the operator. As curarization proceeded, it seemed to the subject as if the facial muscles, those of the tongue, pharynx, and lower jaw, the muscles of the neck and back, and the muscles of the extremities became relaxed in about that order. Accompanying the paralysis of the pharynx and the jaw muscles, inability of the subject to swallow was noted ... Shortly after the injection was completed the subjects experienced a sensation of increased difficulty in breathing, as if an extra effort was necessary to maintain an adequate respiratory exchange. This sensation was present even though there was no objective evidence of impaired oxygenation or of carbon dioxide retention. It reached its maximum about five minutes after the injection, coinciding with the maximum depression of the vital capacity. In the majority of the experiments the respiratory rate was increased by about 50–100 per cent the first minutes after the injection of any one of the drugs while the tidal volume decreased. Tubocurarine has a time of onset of around 5 minutes which is relatively slow among neuromuscular-blocking drugs, and has a duration of action of 60 to 120 minutes. It also causes histamine release, now a recognized hallmark of the tetrahydroisioquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents. Histamine release is associated with bronchospasms, hypotension, and salivary secretions, making it dangerous for asthmatics, children, and those who are pregnant or lactating. However, the main disadvantage in the use of tubocurarine is its significant ganglion-blocking effect, that manifests as hypotension, in many patients; this constitutes a relative contraindication to its use in patients with myocardial ischaemia. Because of the shortcomings of tubocurare, much research effort was undertaken soon after its clinical introduction to find a suitable replacement. The efforts unleashed a multitude of compounds borne from structure-activity relations developed from the tubocurare molecule. Some key compounds that have seen clinical use are identified in the muscle relaxants template box below. Of the many tried as replacements, only a few enjoyed as much popularity as tubocurarine: pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium, atracurium, and cisatracurium. Succinylcholine is a widely used muscle relaxant drug which acts by activating, instead of blocking, the ACh receptor. The potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) has been shown to reverse the effects of tubocurarine. It is thought to do so by increasing ACh release, which counteracts the antagonistic effects of tubocurarine on the ACh receptor. === Use as spider bite treatment === Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have α-latrotoxin in their venom. The most well known spider in this genus is the black widow spider. α-latrotoxin causes the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic gap, including acetylcholine. Bites are usually not fatal, but do cause a significant amount of pain in addition to muscle spasms. The venom is the most damaging to nerve endings, but the introduction of d-tubocurarine chloride blocks the nAChr, alleviating pain and muscle spasms while an antivenom can be administered. == Toxicology == An individual administered tubocurarine chloride will be unable to move any voluntary muscles, including the diaphragm. A large enough dose will therefore result in death from respiratory failure unless artificial ventilation is initiated. The LD50 for mice and rabbits are 0.13 mg/kg and 0.146 mg/kg intravenously, respectively. It releases histamine and causes hypotension. == References ==",Tubocurarine chloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00024168188974726945), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0013458014000207186), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), (',', -0.2519474923610687), ('ĠINDU', -0.2921563684940338), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02977529540657997)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubocurarine_chloride?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=6, title='Tubocurarine chloride', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubocurarine_chloride?utm_source=openai')])"
2011,"('Cefuroxime (sodium)', 'Cefuroxime', 'Cephuroxime', 'Cefuroxim', 'Cefuroximo')",Medical,"Cefuroxime, sold under the brand name Zinacef among others, is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat and prevent a number of bacterial infections. These include pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, sepsis, urinary tract infections, and Lyme disease. It is used by mouth or by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, allergic reactions, and pain at the site of injection. Serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile infection, anaphylaxis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is believed to be safe. It is a second-generation cephalosporin and works by interfering with a bacteria's ability to make a cell wall resulting in its death. Cefuroxime was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 283rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Cefuroxime is active against many bacteria including susceptible strains of Staphylococci and Streptococci, as well as a range of gram negative organisms. As with the other cephalosporins, it is susceptible to beta-lactamase, although as a second-generation variety, it is less so. Hence, it may have greater activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Lyme disease. Unlike other second-generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime can cross the blood–brain barrier. A systematic review found high quality evidence that injecting the eye with cefuroxime after cataract surgery will lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis after surgery. == Side effects == Cefuroxime is generally well tolerated, and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headaches/migraines, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class. Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and penicillin, an assessment in 2006 have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins. == Related compounds == Cefuroxime axetil is an acetoxyethyl ester prodrug of cefuroxime which is effective when taken by mouth. It is a second-generation cephalosporin. == Trade names == In the US it is marketed as Zinacef by Covis Pharmaceuticals since the company acquired the U.S. rights to the product from GSK. GSK had continued marketing a pediatric oral suspension as Ceftin; however, this presentation was discontinued as of 24 June 2017. In Bangladesh, it is available as Sefur by Opsonin Pharma, Kilbac by Incepta, Axim by Aristopharma, Rofurox by Radiant, Xorimax by Sandoz and Uroxime by EURO Pharma Ltd. In India, it is available as Ceftum and Cefuall by Allencia Biosciences in tablet form and Supacef in injection form by GSK. In Poland, it is available as Zamur by Mepha, subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. In Australia, the ""first generic"" form of Cefuroxime axetil, Pharmacor Cefuroxime (tablets) from Pharmacor Pty Ltd, was registered on 27 March 2017, by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Cefuroxime axetil is sold in tablet form in Turkey under the brand names Aksef and Cefaks.

2012,"('Tenofovir disoproxil', 'Bis(poc)-pmpa', 'Gs 4331', 'Bis(poc)pmpa', 'Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate')",Medical,"Tenofovir disoproxil, sold under the brand name Viread among others, is a medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B and to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention of HIV/AIDS among those at high risk before exposure, and after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and together in combinations such as emtricitabine/tenofovir, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir, and elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir. It does not cure HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B. It is available by mouth as a tablet or powder. Common side effects include nausea, rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, and weakness. Severe side effects include high blood lactate and an enlarged liver. There are no absolute contraindications. It is often recommended during pregnancy and appears to be safe. It is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor and works by decreasing the ability of the viruses to replicate. Tenofovir was patented in 1996 and approved for use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available in the United States as a generic medication as of 2017. == Medical uses == Tenofovir disoproxil is used for HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B treatment. For HIV-1 infection, tenofovir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for people 2 years of age and older. For chronic hepatitis B patients, tenofovir is indicated for patients 12 years of age and older. === HIV risk reduction === Tenofovir can be used for HIV prevention in people who are at high risk for infection through sexual transmission or injecting drug use. A Cochrane review examined the use of tenofovir for prevention of HIV before exposure and found that both tenofovir alone and the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination decreased the risk of contracting HIV for high risk patients. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also conducted a study in partnership with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health to ascertain the effectiveness of providing people who inject drugs illicitly with daily doses of tenofovir as a prevention measure. The results revealed a 48.9% reduced incidence of the virus among the group of subjects who received the drug in comparison to the control group who received a placebo. == Adverse effects == Tenofovir disoproxil is generally well tolerated with low discontinuation rates among the HIV and chronic hepatitis B population. There are no contraindications for use of this drug. The most commonly reported side effects due to use of tenofovir disoproxil were dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects include depression, sleep disturbances, headache, itching, rash, and fever. The US boxed warning cautions potential onset of lactic acidosis or liver damage due to use of tenofovir disoproxil. Long term use of tenofovir disoproxil is associated with nephrotoxicity and bone loss. Presentation of nephrotoxicity can appear as Fanconi syndrome, acute kidney injury, or decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil can potentially lead to reversal of renal impairment. Nephrotoxicity may be due to proximal tubules accumulation of Tenofovir disoproxil leading to elevated serum concentrations. == Interactions == Tenofovir interacts with didanosine and HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Tenofovir increases didanosine concentrations and can result in adverse effects such as pancreatitis and neuropathy. Tenofovir also interacts with HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, by decreasing atazanavir concentrations while increasing tenofovir concentrations. In addition, since tenofovir is excreted by the kidney, medications that impair renal function can also cause problems. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tenofovir disoproxil is a nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). It selectively inhibits viral reverse transcriptase, a crucial enzyme in retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while showing limited inhibition of human enzymes, such as DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. In vivo tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted to tenofovir, an acyclic analog of deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate (dAMP). Tenofovir lacks a hydroxyl group in the position corresponding to the 3' carbon of the dAMP, preventing the formation of the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation. Once incorporated into a growing DNA strand, tenofovir causes premature termination of DNA transcription, preventing viral replication. === Pharmacokinetics === Tenofovir disoproxil is a prodrug that is quickly absorbed from the gut and cleaved to release tenofovir. Inside cells, tenofovir is phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (which is analogous to a triphosphate, as tenofovir itself already has one phosphonate residue), the active compound that inhibits reverse transcriptase via chain termination. In fasting persons, bioavailability is 25%, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. When taken with fatty food, highest plasma concentrations are reached after two hours, and the area under the curve is increased by 40%. It is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2. Tenofovir is mainly excreted via the kidneys, both by glomerular filtration and by tubular secretion using the transport proteins OAT1, OAT3 and ABCC4. === Detection in body fluids === Tenofovir may be measured in plasma by liquid chromatography. Such testing is useful for monitoring therapy and to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity in people with kidney or liver problems. == Chemistry == Tenofovir is a derivative of adenine and this was the chemical starting point for its first published synthesis which was included in patents to the compound. During drug development, attention switched to the phosphonate ester derivative, tenofovir disoproxil, which was the subject of extensive process chemistry to provide a viable manufacturing route. Adenine is first reacted with a chiral version of propylene carbonate with R absolute configuration, using sodium hydroxide as base. Under these conditions, the reaction is regioselective, with alkylation occurring exclusively in the imidazole ring and at the less-hindered carbon of the dioxolane. In the second step, the hydroxyl group is reacted with a phosphonic acid derivative, using tert-butyllithium as base to ensure selective O-alkylation, with the formation of an ether bond. Tenofovir is formed when the diethyl phosphonate group is converted to its acid using trimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of sodium bromide, a further refinement of the original manufacturing route. The synthesis of the alternative ester in tenofovir disoproxil is completed by alkylation with the appropriate chloromethyl ether derivative and this may be purified as its fumarate salt. == History == Tenofovir was initially synthesized by Antonín Holý at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in Prague. The patent filed in 1986 makes no mention of the potential use of the compound for the treatment of HIV infection but claims activity against herpes simplex virus. In 1985, De Clercq and Holý described the activity of PMPA against HIV in cell culture. Shortly thereafter, a collaboration with the biotechnology company Gilead Sciences led to the investigation of PMPA's potential as a treatment for HIV infected patients. In 1997 researchers from Gilead and the University of California, San Francisco demonstrated that tenofovir exhibits anti-HIV effects in humans when dosed by subcutaneous injection. The initial form of tenofovir used in these studies had limited potential for widespread use because it poorly penetrated cells and was not absorbed when given by mouth. Gilead developed a pro-drug version of tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil. This version of tenofovir is often referred to simply as ""tenofovir"". In this version of the drug, the two negative charges of the tenofovir phosphonic acid group are masked, thus enhancing oral absorption. Tenofovir disoproxil was approved in the U.S. in 2001, for the treatment of HIV, and in 2008, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. == Drug forms == Tenofovir disoproxil can be taken by mouth and is sold under the brand name Viread, among others. Tenofovir disoproxil is a pro-drug form of tenofovir phosphonate, which is liberated intracellularly and converted to tenofovir disphophate. It is marketed by Gilead Sciences (as the fumarate, abbreviated TDF). Tenofovir disoproxil is also available in pills which combine a number of antiviral drugs into a single dose. Well-known combinations include Atripla (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), Stribild (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat), and Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine). Gilead has created a second pro-drug form of the active drug, tenofovir diphosphate, called tenofovir alafenamide. It differs from tenofovir disoproxil due to its activation in the lymphoid cells. This allows the active metabolites to accumulate in those cells, leading to lower systemic exposure and potential toxicities. == References ==",Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0847986231965479e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00026806574896909297)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir_disoproxil?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='Tenofovir disoproxil', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenofovir_disoproxil?utm_source=openai')])"

Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, meaning that it acts as an antagonist of two endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB. However, macitentan has a 50-fold increased selectivity for the ETA subtype compared to the ETB subtype. Macitentan was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2013. Macitentan is available as a generic medication. == Adverse effects == The FDA prescription label contains a boxed warning for embryo-fetal toxicity. It is only available to females in the US through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program. == Mechanism of action == === Endothelin and endothelin receptors === Endothelin (ET) is an extremely potent blood vessel constricting substance that is secreted by endothelial cells. In the lungs, the most common ET form released is ET-1. ET-1 release can occur through both constitutive and non-constitutive pathways. Upon release, ET-1 can bind to the ET receptors that are expressed on arterial smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts in the lungs. ET receptors are G protein coupled receptors and, when activated, lead to an increase in intracellular calcium levels via the Gαq signaling pathway. There are two receptor subtypes that endothelin will bind to: ETA and ETB. ETA is associated with cell growth and vasoconstriction while ETB is responsible for anti-proliferation of cells, vasodilation and ET-1 clearance. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to contraction of the arterial smooth muscle, as well as vascular remodelling due to cell proliferation. Prolonged constriction and fibrosis are factors in the pathogenesis of PAH. === Role of macitentan === Macitentan blocks the ET1-dependent rise in intracellular calcium by inhibiting the binding of ET-1 to ET receptors. Blocking of the ETA receptor subtype seems to be of more importance in the treatment of PAH than blocking of ETB, likely because there are higher numbers of ETA receptors than ETB receptors in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. The blocking of Endothelin 1 leads to vasodilation and decreases the proliferation of cells in the vessels of the arteries which contributes to the narrowing and leads to the pulmonary arterial hypertension. == Pharmacokinetics == Macitentan is taken as a 10 mg oral dose once a day. Its half-life in humans is about 16 hours and steady state is reached by the third day of administration. It is absorbed slowly into the plasma. Macitentan dealkylates into the active metabolite aprocitentan (ACT-132577), which reaches its peak plasma concentration about 30 hours after the first dose is administered, and has a half-life of approximately 48 hours. Although aprocitentan has a lower affinity for the ET receptors than its parent compound, It maintains higher plasma concentrations than macitentan. Both compounds can be excreted from the body through the urine or feces. Co-administration of ciclosporin has only a slight effect on the concentrations of macitentan and its active metabolite, while rifampicin decreases the area under the curve (AUC) of the drug's blood plasma concentration by 79%, and ketoconazole approximately doubles it. This corresponds to the finding that macitentan is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4. === Experimental pharmacokinetics === Macitentan has slow association kinetics. Its potency increases 6.3-fold when it is pre-incubated with pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells for 120 minutes compared to 10 minutes with pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Macitentan also has a high receptor occupancy half-life (approximately 17 minutes) compared to bosentan (approximately 70 seconds) and ambrisentan (approximately 40 seconds). This increased receptor occupancy half-life allows macitentan to act as a non-competitive antagonist of ET receptors. Bosentan and ambrisentan are both competitive antagonists. == References ==",Opsumit,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2874520507466514e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007155956700444221)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macitentan,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/opsumit,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-165290/opsumit-oral/details ', [])"

Here, we describe MK-2461, a novel ATP-competitive multitargeted inhibitor of activated c-Met. MK-2461 inhibited in vitro phosphorylation of a peptide substrate recognized by wild-type or oncogenic c-Met kinases (N1100Y, Y1230C, Y1230H, Y1235D, and M1250T) with IC(50) values of 0.4 to 2.5 nmol/L. In contrast, MK-2461 was several hundredfold less potent as an inhibitor of c-Met autophosphorylation at the kinase activation loop. In tumor cells, MK-2461 effectively suppressed constitutive or ligand-induced phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane domain and COOH-terminal docking site of c-Met, and its downstream signaling to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT and Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, without inhibiting autophosphorylation of the c-Met activation loop. BIAcore studies indicated 6-fold tighter binding to c-Met when it was phosphorylated, suggesting that MK-2461 binds preferentially to activated c-Met. MK-2461 displayed significant inhibitory activities against fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and other receptor tyrosine kinases. In cell culture, MK-2461 inhibited hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met-dependent mitogenesis, migration, cell scatter, and tubulogenesis. Seven of 10 MK-2461-sensitive tumor cell lines identified from a large panel harbored genomic amplification of MET or FGFR2. In a murine xenograft model of c-Met-dependent gastric cancer, a well-tolerated oral regimen of MK-2461 administered at 100 mg/kg twice daily effectively suppressed c-Met signaling and tumor growth. Similarly, MK-2461 inhibited the growth of tumors formed by s.c. injection of mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressing oncogenic c-Met mutants. Taken together, our findings support further preclinical development of MK-2461 for cancer therapy. Two series of novel 1,5-naphthyridine and 1,6-naphthyridine derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the c-Met kinase inhibitor MK-2461 under the guidance of scaffold hopping strategy. All were tested on c-Met kinase and in vitro anti-tumor activities against Hela and A549 cell lines. The results indicated that 1,6-naphthyridine was a more promising c-Met inhibitory structure core compared with 1,5-naphthyridine. Among them, 26b and 26c showed the best enzymic and cytotoxic activities. The western blot experiments implied that the cytotoxic activity of 26c might be partially through suppressing the phosphorylation of c-Met kinase. c-Met is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that mediates activation of several signaling pathways implicated in aggressive cancer phenotypes. In recent years, research into this area has highlighted c-Met as an attractive cancer drug target, triggering a number of approaches to disrupt aberrant c-Met signaling. Screening efforts identified a unique class of 5H-benzo[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridin-5-one kinase inhibitors, exemplified by 1. Subsequent SAR studies led to the development of 81 (MK-2461), a potent inhibitor of c-Met that was efficacious in preclinical animal models of tumor suppression. In addition, biochemical studies and X-ray analysis have revealed that this unique class of kinase inhibitors binds preferentially to the activated (phosphorylated) form of the kinase. This report details the development of 81 and provides a description of its unique biochemical properties.",Mk 2461,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00033546582562848926), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005983707960695028), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02325849048793316)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.004078401252627373)])","('INFO; ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm200112k?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=6, title='Discovery of a 5H-Benzo[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridin-5-one (MK-2461) Inhibitor of c-Met Kinase for the Treatment of Cancer | Journal of Medicinal Chemistry', type='url_citation', url='https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm200112k?utm_source=openai')])"
2015,"('Dydrogesterone', 'Isopregnenone', 'Hydrogesterone', 'Duphaston', 'Hydrogestrone')",Medical,"Dydrogesterone, sold under the brand name Duphaston among others, is a progestin medication which is used for a variety of indications, including threatened or recurrent miscarriage during pregnancy, dysfunctional bleeding, infertility due to luteal insufficiency, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, secondary amenorrhea, irregular cycles, premenstrual syndrome, and as a component of menopausal hormone therapy. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of dydrogesterone include menstrual irregularities, headache, nausea, breast tenderness, and others. Dydrogesterone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. The medication is an atypical progestogen and does not inhibit ovulation. It has weak antimineralocorticoid activity and no other important hormonal activity. Dydrogesterone was developed in the 1950s and introduced for medical use in 1961. It is available widely throughout Europe, no longer available in the United Kingdom, since 2008 and is also marketed in Australia and elsewhere in the world. The medication was previously available in the United States, but it has been discontinued in that country. == Medical uses == Dydrogesterone has proven effective in a variety of conditions associated with progesterone deficiency, Infertility due to luteal insufficiency including threatened miscarriage, habitual or recurrent miscarriage, Menstrual disorders premenstrual syndrome, and endometriosis. Dydrogesterone has also been registered as a component of menopausal hormone therapy to counteract the effects of unopposed estrogen on the endometrium in persons with an intact uterus. === Gynecological disorders === Primary or essential dysmenorrhea is a very common gynecological phenomenon experienced by women during their reproductive years. Clinical studies have shown symptom relief and a reduction in pain with dydrogesterone treatment for dysmenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea is not a specific disease, but is instead a symptom. Dydrogesterone has been found to adequately induce bleeding within a sufficiently estrogen-primed endometrium. When estradiol levels are found to be low, dydrogesterone treatment is more effective when supplemented with estrogens. Endometriosis is a chronic disease which can cause severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility. Dydrogesterone relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. Dydrogesterone is particularly suitable in cases where the woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems. Dydrogesterone results in statistically significant reductions in the symptoms pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia after the first treatment cycle for the treatment of post-laparoscopic endometriosis. The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and from the end of the third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the majority of patients. Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients. Dydrogesterone has shown reasonable efficacy in relieving a number of premenstrual syndrome symptoms like mood swings and physical symptoms. Cyclic treatment with low-dose (10 mg/day) dydrogesterone has been found to be effective in the treatment of fibrocystic breast changes and associated breast pain. === Infertility and miscarriage === Oral dydrogesterone is an effective medication, well tolerated and accepted among patients, and can be considered for routine luteal support. Advantage of dydrogesterone is oral administration, easy to use and better patient compliance which results in high satisfaction score of oral dydrogesterone in luteal support of IVF/ICSI cycles. Oral administration of progestins dydrogesterone at least similar live birth rate than vaginal progesterone capsules when used for luteal support in embryo transfer, with no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage is defined as bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy while the cervix is closed. It is the most common complication in pregnancy, occurring in 20% of all pregnancies. Recurrent abortion is defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies. Dydrogesterone is associated with approximately two-fold significant reduction in the miscarriage rate as compared to standard care in threatened and recurrent miscarriages with minimal side effects. === Hormone therapy === The objective behind menopausal hormone therapy is to actively increase the circulating levels of estrogen to control hot flashes and to prevent the long-term effects of the menopause, such as bone resorption and unfavourable changes in blood lipids. The administration of estradiol halts, or reverses atrophic changes that occur due to the loss of endogenous estradiol during the menopause. Estrogen promotes endometrial cell growth and in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, estrogen monotherapy results in continued endometrial development without the physiological secretory changes normally brought on by progesterone. This action is associated with an increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore important in patients with an intact uterus who receive estrogen therapy. Dydrogesterone counters the proliferative effect of estrogens on the endometrium and ensures the transition to a secretory pattern and cyclical shedding of the endometrium in serial menopausal hormone therapy regimes. Dydrogesterone effectively protects against the ontogenesis of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, dydrogesterone does not reverse the benefits brought on by estradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. In a continuous, combined menopausal hormone therapy regimen, dydrogesterone retards the proliferation of the endometrium so that it remains atrophic or inactive. === Available forms === Dydrogesterone is available in the form of 10 mg oral tablets both alone and in combination with estradiol. == Contraindications == == Side effects == The most commonly reported medication-related adverse reactions in people taking dydrogesterone without an estrogen in clinical trials of indications have included menstrual irregularities, headaches, migraines, nausea, breast tenderness, bloating, and weight gain. The use of progestins, in particular medroxyprogesterone acetate, in treating postmenopausal symptoms have been associated with increased risk of blood clots and breast cancer in a study carried out by the Women's Health Initiative. While the study did not involve dydrogesterone, it is possible, but not certain, that it too increases these risks. Dydrogesterone has been prescribed and used in over 10 million pregnancies worldwide. There have been no harmful effects exhibited due to the use of dydrogesterone while pregnant. Dydrogesterone is safe to use during pregnancy only when prescribed and indicated by a medical practitioner. Studies have not shown any incidence of decreased fertility due to dydrogesterone at therapeutic dose. The Ames test found no evidence of any potential mutagenic or toxicity properties. == Overdose == There is not enough clinical data to support overdose in humans. The maximum dose of dydrogesterone administered to humans to date was 360 mg orally, and the medication was found to be well tolerated at this dose. There are no antidotes to overdose, and treatment should be based on symptoms. In acute toxicity trials, the LD50 doses in rats were in excess of 4,640 mg/kg orally. == Interactions == In menopausal hormone therapy, dydrogesterone is administered together with an estrogen. Therefore, the interaction between dydrogesterone and estrogens has been assessed, and no clinically significant interaction has been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Dydrogesterone is a highly selective progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is comparatively much more potent by the oral route, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times lower than that of progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two medications, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Dydrogesterone binds to and activates both of the major isoforms of the PR, the PR-A and PR-B, with a similar selectivity ratio between the two receptors as that of progesterone and with lower efficacy at the receptors relative to progesterone. The major active metabolite of dydrogesterone, 20α-dihydrodydrogesterone (20α-DHD), has progestogenic activity as well but with greatly decreased potency relative to dydrogesterone. As with other progestogens, dydrogesterone has functional antiestrogenic effects in certain tissues, for instance in the endometrium, and induces endometrial secretory transformation. Dydrogesterone does not bind importantly to the androgen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptor. As such, it is devoid of androgenic or antiandrogenic, estrogenic or antiestrogenic, and glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. Similarly to progesterone however, dydrogesterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and possesses antimineralocorticoid activity, but only weakly so. Like other progestins but unlike progesterone, which forms sedative neurosteroid metabolites, dydrogesterone is not able to be metabolized in a similar way, and for this reason, is non-sedative. The medication and 20α-DHD do not inhibit 5α-reductase. Dydrogesterone has been found to inhibit myometrium contractility via an undefined progesterone receptor-independent mechanism in vivo in pregnant rats and in vitro in human tissue at concentrations at which progesterone and other progestogens do not. ==== Atypical progestogenic profile ==== Due to its progestogenic activity, dydrogesterone can produce antigonadotropic effects at sufficient doses in animals. However, it does not suppress secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or inhibit ovulation at typical clinical dosages in humans. Oral doses of dydrogesterone of 5 to 40 mg/day on days 5 to 25 of the cycle fail to suppress ovulation (assessed by urinary pregnanediol and laparotomy), and one study found that ovulation persisted even in women treated with an oral dosage of as great as 400 mg/day (assessed by visual inspection of the ovaries). Likewise, an intramuscular injection of 100 mg dydrogesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension on the first to third day of the cycle did not interfere with the development of an ovulatory pattern of spontaneous uterine contractions in women. A couple of conflicting studies exist on the issue of ovulation inhibition by dydrogesterone however, with findings of partial or full inhibition of ovulation by oral dydrogesterone. This included prevention of the mid-cycle LH and FSH peaks and the luteal-phase rise in body temperature and pregnanediol excretion. Nonetheless, the overall consensus among researchers seems to be that dydrogesterone does not inhibit ovulation in women. The apparent inability of dydrogesterone to prevent ovulation is in contrast to all other clinically used progestogens except trengestone, which is closely related to dydrogesterone. Similarly to trengestone but also unlike all other clinically used progestogens, dydrogesterone does not have a hyperthermic effect in humans (i.e., it does not increase body temperature). It has been said that the lack of ovulation inhibition and hyperthermic effect with retroprogesterone derivatives like dydrogesterone may represent a dissociation of peripheral and central progestogenic activity. However, a related retroprogesterone derivative, trengestone, likewise does not inhibit ovulation or produce a hyperthermic effect but rather has an inducing effect on ovulation. Whereas all other assessed progestins are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer when combined with an estrogen in postmenopausal women, neither oral progesterone nor dydrogesterone are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (although the risk of breast cancer is non-significantly higher with dydrogesterone). Similarly, like oral progesterone but in contrast to other progestins, dydrogesterone does not appear to further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism when used in combination with an oral estrogen. Dydrogesterone may also provide inferior endometrial protection relative to other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone acetate, with a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer in combination with an estrogen with long-term therapy (>5 years). ==== Other activity ==== Dydrogesterone weakly stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins are also active in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone, dydrogesterone, and other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Dydrogesterone and its major metabolite, 20α-DHD, have predictable pharmacokinetics. The single-dose kinetics are linear in the oral dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics do not change during repeated administration of up to 20 mg dydrogesterone once daily. Dydrogesterone is readily absorbed with oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of dydrogesterone is on average 28%. Tmax values vary between 0.5 and 2.5 hours. Steady state is attained after 3 days of treatment. The levels of 20α-DHD, which is the main active metabolite, are also found to peak about 1.5 hours post-dose. A single intramuscular injection of 100 mg dydrogesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension has been found to have a duration of action of 16 to 38 days in terms of clinical biological effect in the uterus in women. This was specifically the time until the onset of withdrawal bleeding in estrogen-treated amenorrheic women. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of dydrogesterone and 20α-DHD are unknown. Based on the plasma protein binding of other progestins however, they are probably bound to albumin and not to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. ==== Metabolism ==== The metabolism of dydrogesterone occurs in the liver. It is virtually completely metabolized. The primary metabolic pathway is the hydrogenation of the 20-keto group mainly by AKR1C1 and to a lesser extent AKR1C3, resulting in 20α-DHD. This active metabolite is a progestogen similarly to dydrogesterone, albeit with much lower potency. With oral administration of dydrogesterone, circulating levels of 20α-DHD are substantially higher than those of dydrogesterone. The ratios of 20α-DHD to dydrogesterone in terms of peak levels and area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels have been found to be 25:1 and 40:1, respectively. For these reasons, despite the lower relative progestogenic potency of 20α-DHD, dydrogesterone may act as a prodrug of this metabolite. The metabolism of dydrogesterone differs from progesterone. Whereas the major metabolite of progesterone is pregnanediol, the corresponding derivative of dydrogesterone, retropregnanediol, cannot be detected in urine with oral administration of dydrogesterone. All of the metabolites of dydrogesterone retain the 4,6-diene-3-one structure and are metabolically stable. As such, similarly to progesterone, dydrogesterone does not undergo aromatization. The mean elimination half-lives of dydrogesterone and 20α-DHD are in the ranges of 5 to 7 hours and 14 to 17 hours, respectively. ==== Excretion ==== Dydrogesterone and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in urine. Total clearance of plasma is at a rate of 6.4 L/min. Within 72 hours, excretion is virtually complete. 20α-DHD is preponderantly present in the urine as a conjugate of glucuronic acid. Approximately 85% of the oral dose is successfully removed from the body within 24 hours. Around 90% of excreted material is 20α-DHD. ==== Miscellaneous ==== The pharmacokinetics of dydrogesterone have been reviewed. == Chemistry == Dydrogesterone, also known as 6-dehydro-9β,10α-progesterone or as 9β,10α-pregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and retroprogesterone (9β,10α-progesterone). Retroprogesterone derivatives like dydrogesterone are analogues of progesterone in which the hydrogen atom at the 9th carbon has been switched from the α-position (below the plane) to the β-position (above the plane) and the methyl group at the 10th carbon has been switched from the β-position to the α-position. This reversed configuration in dydrogesterone results in a ""bent"" spatial geometry in which the plane of rings A and B is orientated at a 60° angle below the rings C and D. Dydrogesterone also has an additional double bond between the C6 and C7 positions (4,6-dien-3-one configuration). While its chemical structure is close to that of progesterone, these changes result in dydrogesterone having improved oral activity and metabolic stability, among other differences, in comparison to progesterone. === Analogues === Other retroprogesterone derivatives, and analogues of dydrogesterone, include trengestone (1,6-didehydro-6-chlororetroprogesterone) and Ro 6-3129 (16α-ethylthio-6-dehydroretroprogesterone). === Synthesis === Dydrogesterone is synthesized and manufactured by treatment of progesterone with ultraviolet light exposure. Chemical syntheses of dydrogesterone have been published. == History == Dydrogesterone is a progestin which was first synthesized by Duphar in the 1950s and was first introduced to the market in 1961. It is unique, being the only retrosteroid that is commercially available and its molecular structure is closely related to that of natural progesterone, but it has enhanced oral bioavailability. It is estimated that during the period from 1977 to 2005 around 38 million women were treated with dydrogesterone and that fetuses were exposed to dydrogesterone in utero in more than 10 million pregnancies. It has been approved in more than 100 countries worldwide. It is commercially marketed under the brand name Dydroboon and manufactured by Mankind Pharma. Dydrogesterone was first introduced, by Duphar, as Duphaston in the United Kingdom in 1961. Subsequently, it was introduced in the United States as Duphaston and Gynorest in 1962 and 1968, respectively. Duphaston was removed from the United States market in 1979, and Gynorest is also no longer available in the United States. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Dydrogesterone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while dydrogestérone is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and didrogesterone is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. It was also originally known as isopregnenone. Dydrogesterone has also been referred to as retroprogesterone, but should not be confused with retroprogesterone. === Brand names === Dydrogesterone is marketed mainly under the brand names Duphaston (alone) and Femoston (in combination with estradiol). It also is or has been marketed alone under the brand names Dabroston, Divatrone, Dufaston, Duvaron, Dydrofem, Femoston, Gestatron, Gynorest, Prodel, Retrone, Terolut and Zuviston and in combination with estradiol under the brand names Climaston, Femaston, and Femphascyl. === Availability === Dydrogesterone is available widely throughout the world. It is marketed in the United Kingdom, India, Ireland, South Africa, and Australia, but not in the United States, Canada, or New Zealand. The medication was previously available in the United States, but has since been discontinued in this country. Dydrogesterone is also available in elsewhere in Europe, as well as in Central and South America, Asia, and North Africa. == References == Estradiol/dydrogesterone == References == == Further reading ==",Duphaston,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.794906312279636e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015093612018972635)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dydrogesterone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=93, start_index=9, title='Dydrogesterone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dydrogesterone?utm_source=openai')])"

2017,"('Idebenone', 'Idebenona', 'Idebenonum', 'Cv 2619', 'Sovrima')",Medical,"Idebenone, sold under the brand name Raxone among others, is a medication that was initially developed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive defects. This has been met with limited success. The Swiss company Santhera Pharmaceuticals has started to investigate it for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases. In 2010, early clinical trials for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been completed. As of December 2013 the drug is not approved for these indications in North America or Europe. It is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and was designated an orphan drug in 2007. Chemically, idebenone is an organic compound of the quinone family. It is also promoted commercially as a synthetic analog of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). == Uses == === Indications that are or were approved in some territories === ==== Nootropic effects and Alzheimer's disease ==== Idebenone improved learning and memory in experiments with mice. In humans, evaluation of Surrogate endpoints like electroretinography, auditory evoked potentials and visual analogue scales also suggested positive nootropic effects, but larger studies with hard endpoints are missing. Research on idebenone as a potential therapy of Alzheimer's disease have been inconsistent, but there may be a trend for a slight benefit. In May 1998, the approval for this indication was cancelled in Japan due to the lack of proven effects. In some European countries, the drug is available for the treatment of individual patients in special cases. ==== Friedreich's ataxia (Sovrima) ==== Preliminary testing has been done in humans and found idebenone to be a safe treatment for Friedreich's ataxia (FA), exhibiting a positive effect on cardiac hypertrophy and neurological function. The latter was only significantly improved in young patients. In a different experiment, a one-year test on eight patients, idebenone reduced the rate of deterioration of cardiac function, but without halting the progression of ataxia. The drug was approved for Friedreich's ataxia in Canada in 2008 under conditions including proof of efficacy in further clinical trials. However, in February 2013, Health Canada announced that idebenone would be voluntarily recalled as of April 2013 by its Canadian manufacturer, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, due to the failure of the drug to show efficacy in the further clinical trials that were conducted. In 2008, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) refused a marketing authorisation for this indication. As of 2013 the drug was not approved for FA in Europe nor in the US, where, as of February 2023, there is only one approved treatment. ==== Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (Raxone) ==== Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrially inherited (mother to all offspring) degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons that leads to an acute or subacute loss of central vision; this affects predominantly young adult males. Santhera completed a Phase III clinical trial in this indication in Europe with positive results, and submitted an application to market the drug to European regulators in July 2011. It is approved by EMA for this indication and was designated an orphan drug in 2007. === Indications being explored === ==== Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Catena) ==== After experiments in mice and preliminary studies in humans, idebenone has entered Phase II clinical trials in 2005 and Phase III trials in 2009. ==== Other neuromuscular diseases ==== Phase I and II clinical trial for the treatment of MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) was conducted. Phase I/II trial for primary progressive multiple sclerosis concluded that Idebenone did not inhibit disability progression. As of 2022, a phase III clinical trial is ongoing for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. === Life style === Idebenone is claimed to have properties similar to CoQ10 in its antioxidant properties, and has therefore been used in anti-aging on the basis of free-radical theory. Clinical evidence for this use is missing. It has been used in topical applications to treat wrinkles. == Pharmacology == In cellular and tissue models, idebenone acts as a transporter in the electron transport chain of mitochondria and thus increases the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is the main energy source for cells, and also inhibits lipoperoxide formation. Positive effects on the energy household of mitochondria has also been observed in animal models. Clinical relevance of these findings has not been established. === Pharmacokinetics === Idebenone is well absorbed from the gut but undergoes excessive first pass metabolism in the liver, so that less than 1% reach the circulation. This rate can be improved with special formulations (suspensions) of idebenone and by administering it together with fat food; but even taking these measures bioavailability still seems to be considerably less than 14% in humans. More than 99% of the circulating drug are bound to plasma proteins. Idebenone metabolites include glucuronides and sulfates, which are mainly (~80%) excreted via the urine. == References ==",Sovrima,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -1.1637164789135568e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00015920029545668513), (' PERSONAL', -0.00021807955636177212), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005614938214421272), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062019601464271545)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([nutriavenue.com](https://www.nutriavenue.com/et/ingredients/idebenone/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=6, title='Idebenone Bulk Powder: Uses, Benefits, and More | NutriAvenue', type='url_citation', url='https://www.nutriavenue.com/et/ingredients/idebenone/?utm_source=openai')])"
2018,"('Penicillin g procaine', 'Penicillin g', 'Benzylpenicillin', 'Benzylpenicillinic acid', 'Free penicillin ii')",Medical,"Benzylpenicillin, also known as penicillin G (PenG) or BENPEN, is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. This includes pneumonia, strep throat, syphilis, necrotizing enterocolitis, diphtheria, gas gangrene, leptospirosis, cellulitis, and tetanus. It is not a first-line agent for pneumococcal meningitis. Due to benzylpenicillin's limited bioavailability for oral medications, it is generally taken as an injection in the form of a sodium, potassium, benzathine, or procaine salt. Benzylpenicillin is given by injection into a vein or muscle. Two long-acting forms benzathine benzylpenicillin and procaine benzylpenicillin are available for use by injection into a muscle only. Side effects include diarrhea, seizures, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. When used to treat syphilis or Lyme disease a reaction known as Jarisch–Herxheimer may occur. It is not recommended in those with a history of penicillin allergy. Use during pregnancy is generally safe in the penicillin and β-lactam class of medications. Benzylpenicillin is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Antimicrobial potency === As an antibiotic, benzylpenicillin is noted to possess effectiveness mainly against gram-positive organisms. Some gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Leptospira weilii are also reported to be susceptible to benzylpenicillin. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects can include hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, fever, joint pains, rashes, angioedema, anaphylaxis, serum sickness-like reaction. Rarely central nervous system toxicity including convulsions (especially with high doses or in severe renal impairment), interstitial nephritis, haemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders. Also reported diarrhoea (including antibiotic-associated colitis). Benzylpenicillin has relatively low toxicity, except for in the nervous system, in which it is one of the most active drugs among β-lactam agents. In addition, benzylpenicillin is a potential skin irritant and may cause breathing difficulties if inhaled. Benzylpenicillin serum concentrations can be monitored either by traditional microbiological assay or by more modern chromatographic techniques. Such measurements can be useful to avoid central nervous system toxicity in any person receiving large doses of the drug on a chronic basis, but they are especially relevant to patients with kidney failure, who may accumulate the drug due to reduced urinary excretion rates. == Manufacture == Benzylpenicillin is produced by fermentation of Penicillium chrysogenum. The production of benzylpenicillin involves fermentation, recovery and purification of the penicillin. The fermentation process of the production of benzylpenicillin creates the product. The presence of the product in solution inhibits the reaction and reduces the product rate and yield. Thus, in order to obtain the most product and increase the rate of reaction, it is continuously extracted. This is done by mixing the mold with either glucose, sucrose, lactose, starch, or dextrin, nitrate, ammonium salt, corn steep liquor, peptone, meat or yeast extract, and small amounts of inorganic salts. The recovery of the benzylpenicillin is the most important part of the production process because it affects the later purification steps if done incorrectly. There are several techniques used to recover benzylpenicillin: aqueous two-phase extraction, liquid membrane extraction, microfiltration, and solvent extraction. In the purification step, the benzylpenicillin is separated from the extraction solution. This is normally done by using a separation column. == Synonyms == Penicillin II (old UK nomenclature for naming penicillins) Wonder drug == References ==",Benzylpenicillin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2278481335670222e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024830244947224855)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzylpenicillin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=9, title='Benzylpenicillin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzylpenicillin?utm_source=openai')])"

The authors escalated the dose of CXD101 from 1 mg twice daily orally for 5 days in a 21-day cycle (3+3 design). A total of 39 patients were enrolled, 36 of whom received CXD101. Of the 30 patients in the escalation cohort, 29 were evaluable for determination of the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLTs were noted at doses of 16 mg twice daily (1 of 6 patients), 20 mg twice daily (1 of 6 patients), and 24/25 mg twice daily (2 of 5 patients, both of whom developed neutropenic fever). The MTD was 20 mg twice daily, which achieved maximal plasma concentrations (±standard deviation) of 231±76 nM to 342±126 nM, which was within the biologically active range. Six patients received 20 mg twice daily in an expansion cohort. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, nausea, and reversible cytopenia. Key grade 3 to 4 adverse events (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria [version 4.03]) included thrombocytopenia (11%), neutropenia (17%), and neutropenic fever (2%) across the 133 CXD101 cycles given. The toxicity profile was similar to that of licensing studies with other histone deacetylase inhibitors. In 22 evaluable patients receiving a dose of ≥16 mg twice daily (17 of whom had lymphoma and 5 of whom had solid tumors), 3 partial responses (2 in patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma after allogenic stem cell transplantation and 1 in a patient with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma) and 1 complete response (in a patient with follicular lymphoma) were noted (overall response rate of 18%) in addition to 9 patients who achieved durable stable disease. Responses were noted predominantly among patients with lymphoma (tumor reduction noted in 63% of patients on standard computed tomography). The MTD in the current study was found to be 20 mg twice daily. Encouraging and durable activity was observed in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.

It may also have application in treating invasive Aspergillus infection when used in combination with voriconazole. It is a member of the class of antifungal drugs known as the echinocandins; its mechanism of action is by inhibition of (1→3)-β-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme important to the synthesis of the fungal cell wall. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Indications == Candidemia and other forms of invasive Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis) Esophageal candidiasis Anidulafungin has not been studied in endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis due to Candida, and has not been studied in sufficient numbers of neutropenic patients to determine efficacy in this group. == Pharmacology == == Pharmacodynamics == Anidulafungin significantly differs from other antifungals in that it undergoes chemical degradation to inactive forms at body pH and temperature. Because it does not rely on enzymatic degradation or hepatic or renal excretion, the drug is safe to use in patients with any degree of hepatic or renal impairment. == Pharmacokinetics == Anidulafungin is not evidently metabolized by the liver. This specific drug undergoes slow chemical hydrolysis to an open-ring peptide which lacks antifungal activity. The half-life of the drug is 27 hours. About 30% is excreted in the feces (10% as unchanged drug). Less than 1% is excreted in the urine. == Mechanism of action == Anidulafungin inhibits glucan synthase, an enzyme important in the formation of (1→3)-β-D-glucan, a major fungal cell wall component. Glucan synthase is not present in mammalian cells, so it is an attractive target for antifungal activity. == Semisynthesis == Anidulafungin is manufactured via semi-synthesis. The starting material is echinocandin B (a lipopeptide fermentation product of Aspergillus nidulans or the closely related species, A. rugulosus), which undergoes deacylation (cleavage of the linoleoyl side chain) by the action of a deacylase enzyme from the bacterium Actinoplanes utahensis; in three subsequent synthetic steps, including a chemical reacylation, the antifungal drug anidulafungin is synthesized. == History == Anidulafungin was originally discovered at Lilly laboratories by Turner and Debono and licensed to Vicuron Pharmaceuticals who submitted it to the FDA.

It was patented in 1959 and came into medical use in 1961. In 2022, it was the 293rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Cyproheptadine is used to treat allergic reactions (specifically hay fever). There is evidence supporting its use for allergies, but second generation antihistamines such as ketotifen and loratadine have shown equal results with fewer side effects. It is also used as a preventive treatment against migraine. In a 2013 study the frequency of migraine was dramatically reduced in patients within 7 to 10 days after starting treatment. The average frequency of migraine attacks in these patients before administration was 8.7 times per month, this was decreased to 3.1 times per month at 3 months after the start of treatment. This use is on the label in the UK and some other countries. It is also used off-label in the treatment of cyclical vomiting syndrome in infants; the only evidence for this use comes from retrospective studies. Cyproheptadine is sometimes used off-label to improve akathisia in people on antipsychotic medications. It is used off-label to treat various dermatological conditions, including psychogenic itch, drug-induced hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and prevention of blister formation for some people with epidermolysis bullosa simplex. One of the effects of the drug is increased appetite and weight gain, which has led to its use (off-label in the USA) for this purpose in children who are wasting as well as people with cystic fibrosis. It is also used off-label in the management of moderate to severe cases of serotonin syndrome, a complex of symptoms associated with the use of serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (and monoamine oxidase inhibitors), and in cases of high levels of serotonin in the blood resulting from a serotonin-producing carcinoid tumor. Cyproheptadine has sedative effects and can be used to treat insomnia similarly to other centrally-acting antihistamines. The recommended dose for this use is 4 to 8 mg. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects include: === Overdose === Gastric decontamination measures such as activated charcoal are sometimes recommended in cases of overdose. The symptoms are usually indicative of CNS depression (or conversely CNS stimulation in some) and excess anticholinergic side effects. The LD50 in mice is 123 mg/kg and 295 mg/kg in rats. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cyproheptadine is a very potent antihistamine or inverse agonist of the H1 receptor. At higher concentrations, it also has anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, and antidopaminergic activities. Of the serotonin receptors, it is an especially potent antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptors. This is thought to underlie its effectiveness in the treatment of serotonin syndrome. However, it is possible that blockade of 5-HT1 receptors may also contribute to its effectiveness in serotonin syndrome. Cyproheptadine has been reported to block 85% of 5-HT2 receptors in the human brain at a dose of 4 mg three times per day (12 mg/day total) and to block 95% of 5-HT2 receptors in the human brain at a dose of 6 mg three times per day (18 mg/day total) as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). The dose of cyproheptadine recommended to ensure blockade of the 5-HT2 receptors for serotonin syndrome is 20 to 30 mg. Besides its activity at neurotransmitter targets, cyproheptadine has been reported to possess weak antiandrogenic activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Cyproheptadine is well-absorbed following oral ingestion, with peak plasma levels occurring after 1 to 3 hours. Its terminal half-life when taken orally is approximately 8 hours. == Chemistry == Cyproheptadine is a tricyclic benzocycloheptene and is closely related to pizotifen and ketotifen as well as to tricyclic antidepressants. == Research == Cyproheptadine was studied in one small trial as an adjunct in people with schizophrenia whose condition was stable and were on other medication; while attention and verbal fluency appeared to be improved, the study was too small to draw generalizations from. It has also been studied as an adjuvant in two other trials in people with schizophrenia, around fifty people overall, and did not appear to have an effect. There have been some trials to see if cyproheptadine could reduce sexual dysfunction caused by SSRI and antipsychotic medications. Cyproheptadine has been studied for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. == Veterinary use == Cyproheptadine is used in cats as an appetite stimulant: 1371 and as an adjunct in the treatment of asthma. Possible adverse effects include excitement and aggressive behavior. The elimination half-life of cyproheptadine in cats is 12 hours.

CBL0137 has been reported to target cancer stem cells (CSCs) and enhance chemotherapy/monotherapy efficacy. The translational advance of CBL0137 into clinical practice is expected to provide a promising future for cancer treatment. Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Our previous study uncovered that endothelium-specific knockdown of YAP suppresses atherogenesis, suggesting that YAP is a promising therapeutic target against atherosclerotic vascular disease. We established a drug screening platform, which aimed to identify new YAP inhibitors for anti-atherosclerotic treatment. Drug screening was performed by a luciferase reporter gene assay. RNA sequencing was performed to acquire the transcriptomic profile of CBL0137-treated endothelial cells. We assessed and validated the inhibitory effect of CBL0137 on YAP activity and inflammatory response in HUVECs and HAECs. We evaluated the vasoprotective effect of CBL0137 in vivo against plaque formation in ApoE We identified CBL0137 as a novel YAP inhibitor from an FDA drug library. CBL0137 inhibited YAP activity by restraining its phosphorylation at Y357. CBL0137 inhibited YAP activity to repress endothelial inflammation. Mechanistically, CBL0137 suppressed YAP phosphorylation at Y357 via the tyrosine-protein kinase Src. Furthermore, administration of CBL0137 ameliorated endothelial inflammation and the atherogenesis induced by disturbed flow and consumption of an atherogenic diet in ApoE To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify CBL0137 as a novel YAP inhibitor. We have demonstrated that pharmacologically targeting YAP by CBL0137 inhibits atherogenesis. The present results suggest that CBL0137 holds promise as a new drug for the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease. PANoptosis, a new form of regulated cell death, concomitantly manifests hallmarks for pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. It has been usually observed in macrophages, a class of widely distributed innate immune cells in various tissues, upon pathogenic infections. The second-generation curaxin, CBL0137, can trigger necroptosis and apoptosis in cancer-associated fibroblasts. This study aimed to explore whether CBL0137 induces PANoptosis in macrophages in vitro and in mouse tissues in vivo. Bone marrow-derived macrophages and J774A.1 cells were treated with CBL0137 or its combination with LPS for indicated time periods. Cell death was assayed by propidium iodide staining and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect cellular protein distribution. Mice were administered with CBL0137 plus LPS and their serum and tissues were collected for biochemical and histopathological analyses, respectively. The results showed that CBL0137 alone or in combination with LPS induced time- and dose-dependent cell death in macrophages, which was inhibited by a combination of multiple forms of cell death inhibitors but not each alone. This cell death was independent of NLRP3 expression. CBL0137 or CBL0137 + LPS-induced cell death was characterized by simultaneously increased hallmarks for pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis, indicating that this is PANoptosis. Induction of PANoptosis was associated with Z-DNA formation in the nucleus and likely assembly of PANoptosome. ZBP1 was critical in mediating CBL0137 + LPS-induced cell death likely by sensing Z-DNA. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of CBL0137 plus LPS induced systemic inflammatory responses and caused multi-organ (including the liver, kidney and lung) injury in mice due to induction of PANoptosis in these organs. CBL0137 alone or plus inflammatory stimulation induces PANoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, which is associated with systemic inflammatory responses in mice.",Cbl0137,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012446045875549316), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011071558110415936)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.008709830231964588)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.glpbio.com/cbl0137-hydrochloride.html,https://www.medchemexpress.com/CBL-0137.html,https://www.mycancergenome.org/content/drugs/cbl0137/ ', [])"
2030,"('Estrone sulfate (potassium)', 'Estrone sulfate', 'Estrone sulphate', 'Estrone 3-sulfate', 'Estrone hydrogen sulfate')","Endogenous, Medical","Estrone sulfate, also known as E1S, E1SO4 and estrone 3-sulfate, is a natural, endogenous steroid and an estrogen ester and conjugate. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estrone sulfate is used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy; for information on estrone sulfate as a medication, see the estrone sulfate (medication) article. == Biological function == E1S itself is biologically inactive, with less than 1% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ. However, it can be transformed by steroid sulfatase, also known as estrogen sulfatase, into estrone, an estrogen. Simultaneously, estrogen sulfotransferases, including SULT1A1 and SULT1E1, convert estrone to E1S, resulting in an equilibrium between the two steroids in various tissues. Estrone can also be converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into the more potent estrogen estradiol. E1S levels are much higher than those of estrone and estradiol, and it is thought to serve as a long-lasting reservoir for estrone and estradiol in the body. In accordance, E1S has been found to transactivate the estrogen receptor at physiologically relevant concentrations. This was diminished with co-application of irosustat (STX-64), a steroid sulfatase inhibitor, indicating the importance of transformation of estrone sulfate into estrone in the estrogenicity of E1S. Unlike unconjugated estradiol and estrone, which are lipophilic compounds, E1S is an anion and is hydrophilic. As a result of this, whereas estradiol and estrone are able to readily diffuse through the lipid bilayers of cells, E1S is unable to permeate through cell membranes. Instead, estrone sulfate is transported into cells in a tissue-specific manner by active transport via organic-anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), including OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1C1, OATP2B1, OATP3A1, OATP4A1, and OATP4C1, as well as by the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT; SLC10A6). E1S, serving as a precursor and intermediate for estrone and estradiol, may be involved in the pathophysiology of estrogen-associated diseases including breast cancer, benign breast disease, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. For this reason, enzyme inhibitors of steroid sulfatase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and inhibitors of OATPs, which prevent activation of E1S into estrone and estradiol, are of interest in the potential treatment of such conditions. == Chemistry == E1S, also known as estrone 3-sulfate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-one 3-sulfate, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid and a derivative of estrone. It is an estrogen conjugate or ester, and is specifically the C3 sulfate ester of estrone. Related estrogen conjugates include estradiol sulfate, estriol sulfate, estrone glucuronide, estradiol glucuronide, and estriol glucuronide, while related steroid conjugates include dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and pregnenolone sulfate. The logP of E1S is 1.4. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === E1S is produced via estrogen sulfotransferases from the peripheral metabolism of the estrogens estradiol and estrone. Estrogen sulfotransferases are expressed minimally or not at all in the gonads. In accordance, E1S is not secreted in meaningful amounts from the gonads in humans. However, measurable amounts of estrogen sulfates are said to be secreted by the ovaries in any case. === Distribution === Whereas free steroids like estradiol are lipophilic and can enter cells via passive diffusion, steroid conjugates like E1S are hydrophilic and are unable to do so. Instead, steroid conjugates require active transport via membrane transport proteins to enter cells. Studies in animals and humans have had mixed findings on uptake of exogenously administered E1S in normal and tumorous mammary gland tissue. This is in contrast to substantial uptake of exogenously administered estradiol and estrone by the mammary glands. Another animal study found that E1S wasn't taken up by the uterus but was taken up by the liver, where it was hydrolyzed into estrone. === Metabolism === The elimination half-life of E1S is 10 to 12 hours. Its metabolic clearance rate is 80 L/day/m2. Ovarian tumors have been found to express steroid sulfatase and have been found to convert E1S into estradiol. This may contribute to the often elevated levels of estradiol observed in women with ovarian cancer. === Levels === E1S levels have been characterized in humans. E1S using radioimmunoassay (RIA) have been reported to be 0.96 ± 0.11 ng/mL in men, 0.96 ± 0.17 ng/mL during the follicular phase in women, 1.74 ± 0.32 ng/mL during the luteal phase in women, 0.74 ± 0.11 ng/mL in women taking oral contraceptives, 0.13 ± 0.03 ng/mL in postmenopausal women, and 2.56 ± 0.47 ng/mL in postmenopausal women on menopausal hormone therapy. In addition, E1S levels in pregnant women were 19 ± 5 ng/mL in the first trimester, 66 ± 31 ng/mL in the second trimester, and 105 ± 22 ng/mL in the third trimester. E1S levels are about 10 to 15 times higher than those of estrone in women. == References == == Further reading ==",Estrone 3-sulfate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.07906461507081985), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00015860427811276168), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' MED', -3.054500666621607e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.2018318474292755), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('OUS', -3.099436753473128e-06), (',', -0.00012694983161054552), ('ĠMED', -7.60526381782256e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007185738068073988)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -2.696889623621246e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.25192928314208984), (' MED', -0.0004306692280806601), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone_sulfate ', [])"

It is marketed by Clinigen Group under the trade name Ethyol. == Indications == Amifostine is used therapeutically to reduce the incidence of neutropenia-related fever and infection induced by DNA-binding chemotherapeutic agents including alkylating agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide) and platinum-containing agents (e.g. cisplatin). It is also used to decrease the cumulative nephrotoxicity associated with platinum-containing agents. Amifostine is also indicated to reduce the incidence of xerostomia in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Amifostine was originally indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity from cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer. However, while nephroprotection was observed, the probability that amifostine could protect tumors could not be excluded. Additional data have shown that amifostine-mediated tumor protection, in any clinical scenario, is unlikely. == Pharmacokinetics == Amifostine is an organic thiophosphate prodrug which is hydrolysed in vivo by alkaline phosphatase to the active cytoprotective thiol metabolite, WR-1065. The selective protection of non-malignant tissues is believed to be due to higher alkaline phosphatase activity, higher pH, and vascular permeation of normal tissues. Amifostine can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously after reconstitution with normal saline. Infusions lasting less than 15 minutes decrease the risk of adverse effects. The patient should be well-hydrated prior to administration. == Mechanism of action == Inside cells, amifostine detoxifies reactive metabolites of platinum and alkylating agents, as well as scavenges free radicals. Other possible effects include accelerated DNA repair, induction of cellular hypoxia, inhibition of apoptosis, alteration of gene expression and modification of enzyme activity. Amifostine is believed to radioprotect normal tissue via Warburg-type effects. == Adverse effects == Common side effects of amifostine include hypocalcemia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, sneezing, somnolence, and hiccups. Serious side effects include: hypotension (found in 62% of patients), erythema multiforme, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, immune hypersensitivity syndrome, erythroderma, anaphylaxis, and loss of consciousness (rare). == Contraindications == Contraindications to receiving amifostine include hypersensitivity to amifostine and aminothiol compounds like WR-1065.

2032,"('Nicotinamide riboside (chloride)', 'Nicotinamide riboside', 'Nicotinamide ribose', 'N-ribosylnicotinamide', 'Nicotinamide-beta-riboside')","Endogenous, Medical","Nicotinamide riboside (NR, SR647) is a pyridine-nucleoside and a form of vitamin B3. It functions as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD+, through a two-step and a three-step pathway. == Chemistry == While the molecular weight of nicotinamide riboside is 255.25 g/mol, that of its chloride salt is 290.70 g/mol. As such, 100 mg of nicotinamide riboside chloride provides 88 mg of nicotinamide riboside. === Stability and degradation === NRCl is susceptible to degradation through both thermal decomposition and base-catalyzed hydrolysis: Thermal degradation: Decomposition occurs rapidly at temperatures above 130°C, producing nicotinamide (NAM) and ribose. Degradation kinetics: NRCl degradation follows pseudo-first-order kinetics, with the degradation rate doubling for every 10°C increase in temperature. At pH 7.4, degradation is significantly faster than in acidic conditions, highlighting the importance of pH control for formulation stability. These properties emphasize the need for careful formulation strategies to ensure NRCl's stability during storage, processing, and delivery. == History == Nicotinamide riboside (NR) has been identified as an NAD precursor, involved in salvage NAD synthesis in both bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, it was first described in 1944 as a necessary growth factor for the culture of Haemophilus influenza, H. influenza was identified as requiring both X factor (hemin) and V factor (NAD) to grow. V factor, purified from blood, was shown to exist in three forms: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), NMN and NR. NR was the compound that led to the most rapid growth of the H. influenza bacterium. H. influenza cannot grow on nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), or amino acids such as tryptophan (Trp) or aspartic acid (Asp), which were the previously known precursors of NAD+. H. influenza depends entirely on salvage of NAD precursors from other cells in its environment. The identification of Nicotinamide riboside (NR) as an NAD precursor in eukaryotes developed out of the study of pellagra. Pellagra was the first disease to be associated with NAD+ deficiency. It was linked to nutritional deficiency by Joseph Goldberger in 1914, and to deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3) by Conrad Elvehjem in 1937. NAD+ (then called coenzyme I) was shown to be extremely low in cases of pellagra, and NA and NAM were identified as molecular precursors in rebuilding NAD+ levels. Pellagra is now understood as a severe, chronic depletion of NAD+, which can be treated through diet. Subsequent studies of NAD+ metabolism have identified regulatory pathways used by cells and tissues to maintain NAD+ availability. NAD+ and its precursors nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (NAM) have been shown to be vital cofactors in cellular oxidation/reduction reactions and ATP synthesis. Classic NAD+ synthesis pathways characterized in eukaryotes include an eight-step de novo pathway from Trp and two pathways using the NAD+ precursors NA and NAM: a three-step NA-based pathway known as the Preiss-Handler pathway; and an NAM-based pathway involving the enzyme Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and the formation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In 2004, a previously unknown pathway was reported when nicotinamide riboside (NR) was identified as an additional NAD+ precursor in eukaryotes. NR is now recognized as a form of vitamin B3 which can be found in both cow and human milk. Once internalized into a cell, NR is rapidly phosphorylated by the activity of nicotinamide riboside kinase enzymes (NRK1 and NRK2) to form nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), bypassing the previously known biosynthetic routes to NAD+ production. NMN is then converted to NAD+ by NMN-adenylyltransferase (NMNAT). Research in mammals indicates that NRK1 is a cytosolic protein, encoded by the Nmrk1 gene. It is found in most tissues but predominantly in the liver and kidney. The NRK2 protein may be related to muscle tissue including cardiac muscle. It is encoded by the Nmrk2 gene and appears to be more highly expressed in cases of metabolic stress or cellular damage. Since different types of tissues display differing concentrations of NR and NRKs, it is likely that NR utilization will vary in different tissues. Metabolic studies indicate that NAD+, once considered a stable molecule, is continuously turned over and used, requiring tight regulation to maintain metabolic homeostasis. NR utilization in mammals may involve both exogenous dietary sources and endogenous salvage processes that recycle intermediates. NR metabolism and the interactions of different NAD+ pathways continue to be studied. The NAM and NR pathways involve an amide group and are referred to as 'amidated' pathways. The pathways for de novo synthesis from tryptophan and from NA salvage are 'deamidated' pathways, which share a rate-limiting amidation enzyme NADsynthase1 (NADSYN). Disruptions or imbalances in NAD+ metabolism have been observed in many disease conditions, and the possibility of restoring NAD+ levels by administering NAD+ precursors is an area of interest for researchers. == Biosynthesis == Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is now known to be an NAD+ precursor, involved in the biosynthetic pathways that convert B3 vitamins into NAD+. NAD+ is primarily synthesized in mammals de novo from tryptophan, through the Priess-Handler pathway from nicotinic acid (NA) or via a salvage pathway from nicotinamide (NAM). Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is utilized through an additional pathway involving phosphorylation by the nicotinamide riboside kinase enzymes (NRK1 and NRK2). In yeasts, NR has also been shown to be degraded by the nucleosidases Pnp1, Urh1 and Meu1, before being converted to NAD⁺ via the Preiss-Handler pathway and the action of the nicotinamidase Pnc1. == Commercialization == ChromaDex licensed patents for nicotinamide riboside from Dartmouth College, Cornell University, and Washington University in St. Louis in July 2012. The company developed a commercial production process for nicotinamide riboside chloride under the trademark Niagen. Following the acquisition, ChromaDex continued to expand the Tru Niagen brand globally while also supplying Niagen as an ingredient to other manufacturers. ChromaDex has been in a patent dispute with Elysium Health over the rights to nicotinamide riboside supplements since 2016. == Safety designations == In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted nicotinamide riboside chloride (NRC, Niagen) as Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as described in the dossier prepared by ChromaDex, Inc. It was designated a new dietary ingredient (NDI) for use in dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 and 2017. It was listed in Health Canada's Licensed Natural Health Products Database (LNHPD) in 2018. The European Union has granted NRC a ""New dietary ingredient"" designation as a novel food pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283, as of 2019. It was authorized for use in food supplements by the EU in 2020. The EFSA Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) considered it as safe as pure nicotinamide for use in food for special medical purposes (FSMP) and total diet replacement for weight control (TDRWC) in adults as of 2021 but noted that further investigation would be required to establish safety for some other types of use. The Australian government has given nicotinamide riboside chloride a positive listing under the compositional guidelines of its Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The above regulatory acceptances were all in relation to the safety and manufacturing information provided by ChromaDex, Inc. for Niagen. ChromaDex holds several patents related to nicotinamide riboside, including manufacturing methods, compositions, and uses.

ABA functions in many plant developmental processes, including seed and bud dormancy, the control of organ size and stomatal closure. It is especially important for plants in the response to environmental stresses, including drought, soil salinity, cold tolerance, freezing tolerance, heat stress and heavy metal ion tolerance. == Discovery == In the 1940s, Torsten Hemberg, while working at the University of Stockholm, found evidence that a positive correlation exists between the rest period and the occurrence of an acidic ether soluble growth inhibitor in potato tubers. In 1963, abscisic acid was first identified and characterized as a plant hormone by Frederick T. Addicott and Larry A. Davis. They were studying compounds that cause abscission (shedding) of cotton fruits (bolls). Two compounds were isolated and called abscisin I and abscisin II. Abscisin II is presently called abscisic acid (ABA). == In plants == === Function === ABA was originally believed to be involved in abscission, which is how it received its name. This is now known to be the case only in a small number of plants. ABA-mediated signaling also plays an important part in plant responses to environmental stress and plant pathogens. The plant genes for ABA biosynthesis and sequence of the pathway have been elucidated. ABA is also produced by some plant pathogenic fungi via a biosynthetic route different from ABA biosynthesis in plants. In preparation for winter, ABA is produced in terminal buds. This slows plant growth and directs leaf primordia to develop scales to protect the dormant buds during the cold season. ABA also inhibits the division of cells in the vascular cambium, adjusting to cold conditions in the winter by suspending primary and secondary growth. Abscisic acid is also produced in the roots in response to decreased soil water potential (which is associated with dry soil) and other situations in which the plant may be under stress. ABA then translocates to the leaves, where it rapidly alters the osmotic potential of stomatal guard cells, causing them to shrink and stomata to close. The ABA-induced stomatal closure reduces transpiration (evaporation of water out of the stomata), thus preventing further water loss from the leaves in times of low water availability. A close linear correlation was found between the ABA content of the leaves and their conductance (stomatal resistance) on a leaf area basis. Seed germination is inhibited by ABA in antagonism with gibberellin. ABA also prevents loss of seed dormancy. Several ABA-mutant Arabidopsis thaliana plants have been identified and are available from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre - both those deficient in ABA production and those with altered sensitivity to its action. Plants that are hypersensitive or insensitive to ABA show phenotypes in seed dormancy, germination, stomatal regulation, and some mutants show stunted growth and brown/yellow leaves. These mutants reflect the importance of ABA in seed germination and early embryo development. Pyrabactin (a pyridyl containing ABA activator) is a naphthalene sulfonamide hypocotyl cell expansion inhibitor, which is an agonist of the seed ABA signaling pathway. It is the first agonist of the ABA pathway that is not structurally related to ABA. === Homeostasis === ==== Biosynthesis ==== Abscisic acid (ABA) is an isoprenoid plant hormone, which is synthesized in the plastidal 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway; unlike the structurally related sesquiterpenes, which are formed from the mevalonic acid-derived precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), the C15 backbone of ABA is formed after cleavage of C40 carotenoids in MEP. Zeaxanthin is the first committed ABA precursor; a series of enzyme-catalyzed epoxidations and isomerizations via violaxanthin, and final cleavage of the C40 carotenoid by a dioxygenation reaction yields the proximal ABA precursor, xanthoxin, which is then further oxidized to ABA. via abscisic aldehyde. Abamine has been designed, synthesized, developed and then patented as the first specific ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, which makes it possible to regulate endogenous levels of ABA. ==== Locations and timing of ABA biosynthesis ==== Synthesized in nearly all plant tissues, e.g., roots, flowers, leaves and stems Stored in mesophyll (chlorenchyma) cells where it is conjugated to glucose via uridine diphosphate-glucosyltransferase resulting in the inactivated form, ABA-glucose-ester Activated and released from the chlorenchyma in response to environmental stress, such as heat stress, water stress, salt stress Released during desiccation of the vegetative tissues and when roots encounter soil compaction. Synthesized in green fruits at the beginning of the winter period Synthesized in maturing seeds, establishing dormancy Mobile within the leaf and can be rapidly translocated from the leaves to the roots (opposite of previous belief) in the phloem Accumulation in the roots modifies lateral root development, improving the stress response ABA is synthesized in almost all cells that contain chloroplasts or amyloplasts ==== Inactivation ==== ABA can be catabolized to phaseic acid via CYP707A (a group of P450 enzymes) or inactivated by glucose conjugation (ABA-glucose ester) via the enzyme uridine diphosphate-glucosyltransferase (UDP-glucosyltransferase). Catabolism via the CYP707As is very important for ABA homeostasis, and mutants in those genes generally accumulate higher levels of ABA than lines overexpressing ABA biosynthetic genes. In soil bacteria, an alternative catabolic pathway leading to dehydrovomifoliol via the enzyme vomifoliol dehydrogenase has been reported. === Effects === Antitranspirant - Induces stomatal closure, decreasing transpiration to prevent water loss. Promotes root growth during periods of low humidity. Inhibits fruit ripening Responsible for seed dormancy by inhibiting cell growth – inhibits seed germination Inhibits the synthesis of Kinetin nucleotide Downregulates enzymes needed for photosynthesis. Acts on endodermis to prevent growth of roots when exposed to salty conditions Promotion of plant antiviral immunity === Signal cascade === In the absence of ABA, the phosphatase ABA-INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1) inhibits the action of SNF1-related protein kinases (subfamily 2) (SnRK2s). ABA is perceived by the PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 (PYR1) and PYR1-like membrane proteins. On ABA binding, PYR1 binds to and inhibits ABI1. When SnRK2s are released from inhibition, they activate several transcription factors from the ABA RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR (ABF) family. ABFs then go on to cause changes in the expression of a large number of genes. Around 10% of plant genes are thought to be regulated by ABA. == In fungi == Like plants, some fungal species (for example Cercospora rosicola, Botrytis cinerea and Magnaporthe oryzae) have an endogenous biosynthesis pathway for ABA. In fungi, it seems to be the MVA biosynthetic pathway that is predominant (rather than the MEP pathway that is responsible for ABA biosynthesis in plants). One role of ABA produced by these pathogens seems to be to suppress the plant immune responses. == In animals == ABA has also been found to be present in metazoans, from sponges up to mammals including humans. Currently, its biosynthesis and biological role in animals is poorly known. ABA elicits potent anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects in mouse models of diabetes/obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis and influenza infection. Many biological effects in animals have been studied using ABA as a nutraceutical or pharmacognostic drug, but ABA is also generated endogenously by some cells (like macrophages) when stimulated. There are also conflicting conclusions from different studies, where some claim that ABA is essential for pro-inflammatory responses whereas other show anti-inflammatory effects. Like with many natural substances with medical properties, ABA has become popular also in naturopathy. While ABA clearly has beneficial biological activities and many naturopathic remedies will contain high levels of ABA (such as wheatgrass juice, fruits and vegetables), some of the health claims made may be exaggerated or overly optimistic. In mammalian cells ABA targets a protein known as lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), triggering an alternative mechanism of activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). LANCL2 is conserved in plants and was originally suggested to be an ABA receptor also in plants, which was later challenged. == Measurement of ABA concentration == Several methods can help to quantify the concentration of abscisic acid in a variety of plant tissue. The quantitative methods used are based on HPLC and ELISA. Two independent FRET probes can measure intracellular ABA concentrations in real time in vivo. == References ==",Abscisic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00877139251679182)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3139585852622986), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0018857807153835893)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.04858759790658951), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abscisic_acid ', [])"
2034,"('Sulfamethoxazole', 'Ro 4-2130', 'Gantanol', 'Sulphamethoxazole', 'Sulfisomezole')",Medical,"Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ or SMX) is an antibiotic. It is used for bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and prostatitis and is effective against both gram negative and positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and skin rashes. It is a sulfonamide and bacteriostatic. It resembles a component of folic acid. It prevents folic acid synthesis in the bacteria that must synthesize their own folic acid. Mammalian cells, and some bacteria, do not synthesize but require preformed folic acid (vitamin B9); they are therefore insensitive to sulfamethoxazole. It was introduced to the United States in 1961. It is now mostly used in combination with trimethoprim (abbreviated SMX-TMP). The SMX-TMP combination is on the WHO Model List of Essential medicines as a first-choice treatment for urinary tract infections. Other names include: sulfamethalazole and sulfisomezole. == Side effects == The most common side effects of sulfamethoxazole are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). There have been rare instances where severe adverse reactions have resulted in fatalities. These include Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Allergic reactions to Sulfonamides have been shown to include the entire Gel-Coombs spectrum of hyperactivity reactions. Type 1 reactions include immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. In contrast, non-type 1 hypersensitivities are believed to be caused by metabolites of sulfonamides. Therefore, the liver and kidney are the determining factors of these other hypersensitivity reactions; alterations in kidney or liver functions may increase or decrease the frequencies of these reactions. One study has shown the allergic reaction rate to be about 3.0% over 359 courses of therapy. Of the allergic reactions, skin rashes, eosinophilia and drug fever were the most common, while serious reactions were less common. Sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated in people with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides. == Mechanism of action == Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfanilamide, is a structural analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). They compete with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. Inhibiting the production of dihydrofolate intermediate interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate). Folate is an essential metabolite for bacterial growth and replication because it is used in DNA synthesis, primarily at thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, and amino acids synthesis, including serine, glycine and methionine. Hence, blockage of folate production inhibits the folate-dependent metabolic processes for bacterial growth. Since it inhibits bacterial growth, sulfamethoxazole is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic. Sulfonamides are selective against bacteria because they interfere with the synthesis of folate, a process which does not occur in humans. Humans do not synthesize folate, and must acquire it through diet. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption Sulfamethoxazole is well-absorbed when administered topically. It is rapidly absorbed when it is orally administered. Distribution Sulfamethoxazole distributes into most body tissues as well as into sputum, vaginal fluid, and middle ear fluid. It also crosses the placenta. About 70% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Its Tmax (or time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma) occurs 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-life of sulfamethoxazole is 10 hours. However, the half-life of the drug noticeably increases in people with creatinine clearance rates equal to or less than 30 mL/minute. A half-life of 22–50 hours has been reported for people with creatinine clearances of less than 10 mL/minute. Metabolism Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in the human liver to at least 5 metabolites. These metabolites are the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy-sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The CYP2C9 enzyme is responsible for the formation of the N4-hydroxy metabolite. In vitro studies suggest sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of the P-glycoprotein transporter. Excretion Sulfamethoxazole is primarily renally excreted via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. About 20% of the sulfamethoxazole in urine is the unchanged drug, about 15–20% is the N-glucuronide conjugate, and about 50–70 % is the acetylated metabolite. Sulfamethoxazole is also excreted in human milk. == See also == Sulfisoxazole List of cytochrome P450 modulators == Notes == == External links ==",Sulfisomezole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007788485381752253), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011125553399324417)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/bacteria-and-antibacterial-medications/sulfonamides,https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/infections/antibiotics/sulfonamides,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sulfisoxazole-oral-route/description/drg-20072998 ', [])"
2035,"('Oleandrin', 'Foliandrin', 'Folinerin', 'Neriolin', 'Neriostene')",Medical,"Oleandrin is a cardiac glycoside found in the poisonous plant oleander (Nerium oleander L.). As a main phytochemical of oleander, oleandrin is associated with the toxicity of oleander sap, and has similar properties to digoxin. Oleander has been used in traditional medicine for its presumed therapeutic purposes, such as for treating cardiac insufficiency. There is no clinical evidence that oleander or its constituents, including oleandrin, are safe or effective. Oleandrin is not approved by regulatory agencies as a prescription drug or dietary supplement. == Structure and reactivity == The structure of oleandrin contains a central steroid nucleus with an unsaturated lactone ring structure on C17 and a dideoxy arabinose group on C3. In addition, the steroid ring has a substitute of an acetyloxy group on C16. The sugar forming the glycoside is L-oleandrose. Oleandrin resembles very much other glycosides like ouabain and digoxin but has less effect than digoxin. It is however, just like its derivate oleandrigenin, a more potent glycoside than ouabain. == Synthesis == Oleandrin and its derivate oleandrigenin are formed in the N. oleander plant. The oleandrin itself can be won out of the leaves and other parts of the plant but can also be produced in the lab by using cell cultures. Here, the oleandrin synthesis (along with other metabolites) can be stimulated in untransformed plant cell cultures with supplementation of phytohormone. However, this is not enough to produce large quantities because of early cell death. Transgenic cultures of Agrobacteria are able to synthesize great quantities of oleandrin and other metabolites of the oleander plants, fit for pharmaceutical purposes. === Related substances === Oleandrin is, apart from its pure form, also closely related to structural similar glycosides and alkaloids, which all have more or less the same characteristics as oleandrin: Oleandrigenin is a deglycosylated metabolite of oleandrin. It has however a more mild effect. Conessine Neritaloside Odorside == Metabolism == Although oleandrigenin is not formed in human plasma, it was found in the volunteers injected with oleandrin, suggesting that it is formed in other human tissues. Because of its lipophilic properties, oleandrin can be easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral dosing. The clearance is slow. The plasma concentration obtains its maximum at twenty minutes after oral intake (half-life of about 2 hours, but half-life after IV administration is half an hour). It is excreted mostly in feces, but also in urine. Because the main route of excretion is through biliary excretion into the feces, it is mainly the liver that is exposed to oleandrin. As excretion in urine is only a smaller route, the kidneys are less exposed. There is also accumulation in the heart, which explains its potential for cardiac toxicity. == Mechanism of action == Because of its properties as a cardiac glycoside, oleandrin interferes in some essential processes within the cell, the most important of these being the inhibition of the Na-K ATPase. This protein enables the cell to exchange the cations Na+ and K+ between the intercellular and extracellular spaces by which, for instance, electric signaling is made possible in nerve cells. Oleandrin binds to specific amino acids in the protein, causing it to lose its function. Apart from being a potent toxic compound, there are no results on oleandrin from human clinical research that support its use as a treatment for cancer or any disease. == Toxicity == Due to its considerable toxicity, use of oleander or its constituents, such as oleandrin, is regarded as unsafe and potentially lethal. Use of oleander may cause contact dermatitis, headache, nausea, lethargy, and high blood levels of potassium, with symptoms appearing within a few hours of ingestion. In one fatality, the blood concentration of oleandrin and a related cardiac glycoside from the oleander plant was estimated at 20 ng/ml. In practice, there have been adult cases wherein 14–20 oleander leaves (of unknown oleandrin concentration) proved not to be fatal, but also a lethal case of a child that consumed only one leaf. === Symptoms === Symptoms of oleandrin poisoning can cause both gastrointestinal and cardiac effects. The gastrointestinal effects can consist of nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, as well as higher salivation and diarrhea (which may contain blood). After these first symptoms, the heart may be affected by tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, premature ventricular contractions, or atrioventricular blockage. Also, xanthopsia (yellow vision), a burning sensation of the mucous membranes of the eyes, and gastrointestinal tract and respiratory paralysis can occur. Reactions to poisonings from this plant can also affect the central nervous system. These symptoms can include drowsiness, tremors, or shaking of the muscles, seizures, collapse, and even coma that can lead to death. Oleander sap can cause skin irritations, severe eye inflammation and irritation, and allergy reactions characterized by dermatitis when administered topically. === Diagnosis === Diagnosis of oleandrin poisoning is mainly based on description of the plant, how much of it was ingested, time since ingestion, and symptoms. Three methods are used for detecting oleandrin in the blood. Fluorescence polarization immunoassay is widely used. This test is slower and has a lower sensitivity than digoxin immunoassay (Digoxin III). A direct analytic technique like liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry is used when there are medical or legal issues. == Treatment == Oleander toxicity should be treated aggressively, including as needed gastric lavage or induced emesis. Onset of symptoms may vary with the way of intake. Teas made of leaves or root of N. oleander give rise to a more acute onset, while eating raw leaves causes a slower onset of symptoms. Management of oleandrin poisoning is done in the following steps: There is a lack of evidence that weighs efficacy versus harm. Activated charcoal is still used, since it binds toxins in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce absorption. It is uncertain whether repeated administration of activated charcoal is effective, in theory interrupting enterohepatic cycling. This treatment is used for digoxin poisoning, another cardiac glycoside. Supportive care like monitoring vitals and electrolyte and fluid balance is important. Patients may present hypovolemic due to vomiting and diarrhea, but severely elevated potassium can also occur. Electrolyte balance is vital, since patients with low cardiac glycoside levels can still die after adequate digoxin Fab antibody treatment if they have disturbed electrolyte levels. Treatment of slow heart rate and heart rhythm irregularities may require intravenous isoprenaline or atropine. In moderate cases, prolonging of the PR interval and progression to AV dissociation, cardiac pacing is used. The effectiveness of all these interventions is unknown and are associated with side-effects. Therefore, consultation with a cardiologist is recommended when managing significant N. Oleander induced arrhythmias. The use of anti-digoxin Fab IV has proven successful in cases of oleandrin poisoning A dose of 400 mg is used in digoxin poisoning, but a dose of 800 mg is recommended for oleandrin poisoning due to the lower binding affinity of the antibody to oleandrin. Patients receiving an adequate dose of anti-digoxin Fab show a good response, resolving serious arrhythmias in two hours in fifty percent of the cases. Treated patients showed a rapid increase in heart rate and a significant decline in serum potassium levels. The reason anti-digoxin Fab is sparingly used in developing countries is its high cost, even though it is such an effective treatment. == Traditional medicine == Although oleander has been used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, there is no evidence that it is safe or effective for any medicinal purpose. == Political controversy == During the COVID-19 pandemic, Donald Trump's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a major Trump booster and an investor in a company that develops oleandrin, promoted oleandrin as a potential treatment of the disease in a July 2020 Oval Office meeting with Trump, who expressed enthusiasm for the substance. These claims were widely regarded by scientists as dubious, misleading, and alarming, as well as having no clinical proof of safety or effectiveness. The unproven claims of benefit further caused concern among scientists that the Trump administration might force unwarranted FDA approval of oleandrin as a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 infection. However, on 14 August 2020, the FDA rejected the application for marketing an oleandrin dietary supplement by Phoenix Biotechnology, Inc. – the manufacturer of the product – due to concerns that oleandrin would not be safe to consume. == Effects on animals == Oleandrin poisoning by eating oleander leaves can be lethal at low dosages. Cases of sheep lethality have been reported to only one leaf of oleander. Symptoms present in poisoned animals include bloody diarrhea and colic, the latter especially in horses. Because the leaf itself is quite bitter, only starving animals will be likely to eat the plant. The lethal dosage for animals is estimated to be about 0.5 mg/kg. == References ==",Oleandrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3698350191116333)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.33628973364830017), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005293756723403931)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleandrin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Oleandrin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleandrin?utm_source=openai')])"
2036,"('Lecithin', 'Soybean lecithin', 'Soybean phospholipid', 'Phosphatidylcholine(16:0/18:2w6)', 'Pc(16:0/18:2n6)')","Food, Medical","Lecithin ( LESS-ith-in; from the Ancient Greek λέκιθος lékithos ""yolk"") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials. Lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist Théodore Gobley. In 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine lécithine. Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological materials, including venous blood, human lungs, bile, roe, and brains of humans, sheep and chicken. Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically. Common sources include egg yolk, marine foods, soybeans, milk, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower oil. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in non-stick cooking spray. == Production == Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. A major source of lecithin is soybean oil. Because of the EU requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding genetically modified crops, a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (such as sunflower lecithin) is taking place. The main phospholipids in lecithin from soy and sunflower are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. They are often abbreviated to PC, PI, PE, PS and PA, respectively. Purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially. === Hydrolysed lecithin === To modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction. === Genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin === As described above, lecithin is highly processed. Therefore, genetically modified (GM) protein or DNA from the original GM crop from which it is derived often is undetectable – in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from GM food, such as lecithin. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the EU in 2000, when Commission Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (IP). == Properties and applications == Lecithins have emulsification and lubricant properties, and are a surfactant. They can be completely metabolized (see inositol) by humans, so are well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested. The major components of commercial soybean-derived lecithin are: 33–35% soybean oil 20–21% phosphatidylinositols 19–21% phosphatidylcholine 8–20% phosphatidylethanolamine 5–11% other phosphatides including phosphatidylserine 5% free carbohydrates 2–5% sterols 1% moisture Lecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications. Applications include: In the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting agent, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsification and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use. In animal feed, it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization. In the paint industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and printing ink, helps as a rust inhibitor, is a colour intensifying agent, catalyst, conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and wetting agent, helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several pigments, helps in grinding of metal oxide pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates foam in water-based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of latex-based paints. Lecithin also may be used as a release agent for plastics, an anti-sludge additive in motor lubricants, an anti-gumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries. === Food additive === The nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as a food additive or in food preparation. It is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant. In confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high fat content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering (splashing and scattering of oil droplets) during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release. In doughs and baking, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even out distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (such as low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (such as cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It can be used as a component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent. In the EU Lecithin is designated at food additive E322. === Dietary supplement === Lecithin contains dietary precursors to choline, an essential nutrient, which was formerly classified as a B vitamin (vitamin B4). Lecithin is a mixture of fats that contains phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, and the human body can convert phosphatidylcholine into choline. The choline content in lecithin can vary, but it's found that phosphatidylcholine makes up about 25 to 35 percent of lecithin. Furthermore, only about 12 percent of phosphatidylcholine is actually choline. This adds up to a choline content of approximately 4 percent for lecithin. For example, 10 grams of lecithin has 2,500mg of phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is approximately 13.7% choline; as such, about 342mg of choline is present per 10 grams of lecithin. Therefore, 10 grams of lecithin can be a source for the body to produce about the same amount of choline (342mg) as can be produced by the body from 2 egg yolks. The recommended intake of choline varies depending on age, sex, and physiological conditions, and is roughly 500 mg per day for adults. Lecithin is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. There is no robust, scientifically validated clinical research investigating the safety and effectiveness of high-dose lecithin supplementation in lactating women and their infants. A meta-analysis found no evidence that high doses of lecithin improved milk flow in breast-feeding mothers or infants, though concluded that ""higher maternal choline intake was likely to be associated with better child neurocognition and neurodevelopment."" Soy lecithin does not contain enough allergenic proteins for most people allergic to soy, although the US FDA only exempts a few soy lecithin products from its mandatory requirements for allergenic source labeling. An alternative source of lecithin, derived from sunflowers, is available as a dietary supplement for those with concerns about soy-based foods. A 2003 review of randomized trials found no benefit of lecithin in people with dementia. === Religious restrictions === Soy-derived lecithin is considered by some to be kitniyot and prohibited on Passover for Ashkenazi Jews when many grain-based foods are forbidden, but not at other times. This does not necessarily affect Sephardi Jews, who do not have the same restrictions on rice and kitniyot during Passover. Muslims are not forbidden to eat lecithin per se; however, since it may be derived from animal as well as plant sources, care must be taken to ensure the source is halal. Lecithin derived from plants and egg yolks is permissible, as is that derived from animals slaughtered according to the rules of dhabihah. Sunflower lecithin, sourced from the seeds of sunflowers, is entirely plant-based and may be an option for those with religious or cultural concerns regarding food intake. == See also == Phytosome == References == == External links == Introduction to Lecithin Archived 2020-11-27 at the Wayback Machine (University of Erlangen) FDA Industry guideline for soy lecithin labeling European Lecithin Manufacturers Association official website Shurtleff W, Aoyagi A (2016).

2037,"('Tolbutamide', 'Orinase', 'Arkozal', 'Artosin', 'Diabetamid')",Medical,"Tolbutamide is a first-generation potassium channel blocker, sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic medication. This drug may be used in the management of type 2 diabetes if diet alone is not effective. Tolbutamide stimulates the secretion of insulin by the pancreas. It is not routinely used due to a higher incidence of adverse effects compared to newer, second-generation sulfonylureas, such as Glibenclamide. It generally has a short duration of action due to its rapid metabolism, so is safe for use in older people. It was discovered in 1956. == Side effects == Side effects include: Hypoglycemia Weight gain Hypersensitivity: cross-allergicity with sulfonamides Drug interactions (especially first-generation drugs): Increased hypoglycemia with cimetidine, insulin, salicylates, and sulfonamides Salicylates displace tolbutamide from its binding site on plasma binding proteins which lead to increase in free tolbutamide concentration, thus hypoglycemic shock. == History == Orinase was developed by Upjohn Co. at a time when the primary medical treatment for diabetes was insulin injections. Eli Lilly had a lock on the market for insulin production at the time. The practical applicability of Orinase, like that of other treatments for disease states detected by paraclinical signs (such as lab test results) rather than clinically observable signs or patient-reported symptoms, benefited from increased sensitivity and availability of testing (in this instance, urinary glucose testing and later also fingerstick blood glucose testing). Milton Moskowitz (editor in 1961 of Drug and Cosmetic Industry) claimed that the introduction of Orinase, ""expanded the total market by bringing under medical care diabetics who were formerly not treated."" It did this by changing the mindset about diabetes even more than insulin had. Treatment of this chronic disease was no longer seen as a mere slowing of ""inexorable degeneration"", but instead viewed through ""a model of surveillance and early detection."": 84 Orinase and other sulfonylureas emerged from European pharmaceutical research into antibiotics, specifically from attempts to develop sulfa compounds. One of the contenders for a new sulfa antibiotic had serious side effects during clinical trials at the University of Montpellier including blackouts, convulsions, and coma, side effects not observed with any other drugs in the sulfa cohort. An insulin researcher at the same university heard of these side effects and recognized them as common results of hypoglycemia. The resulting class of drugs for lowering blood sugar came to be known as the sulfonylureas, starting with Orinase and still in use today in other forms. Unfortunately for diabetics dependent on insulin as a treatment for their condition, this research at Montpellier occurred in the early 1940s and was significantly disrupted by the German occupation of France during World War II. Development of these compounds was taken over by German pharmaceutical companies, which were obviously disinclined to share their bounty with nations upon which they were waging war. The German research was, in turn, disrupted by Germany's defeat in 1945 and the partition of Germany into East and West Germany. The sulfonylureas were trapped in East Germany. In 1952, someone smuggled a sample to a West German pharmaceutical company and research resumed. Clinical trials in diabetics began in 1954 in Berlin. In 1956, two different sulfonylureas were brought to market in Germany under the trade names Nadisan and Rastinon. American pharmaceutical companies in the postwar period had been seeking to establish business relations with the remnants of German pharmaceutical giants weakened by the war and partition of Germany. Upjohn (based in Kalamazoo until its purchase by Pharmacia in the 1990s) made deals with Hoechst, maker of Rastinon. The result was a cross-licensing agreement which produced Orinase. Upjohn stood to open up a whole new arena of treatment for diabetes, one with a built-in and sustainable market, i.e. patient population. Just as two German companies brought sulfonylureas to market within the same year, Upjohn discovered Eli Lilly had begun clinical trials for carbutamide, another oral hypoglycemic. Upjohn pushed for large-scale clinical trials from 1955–1957, enrolling over 5,000 patients at multiple sites. Upjohn's formulation was preferred when the Lilly formulation demonstrated evidence of toxicity in parallel trials at the Joslin Clinic. Lilly pulled carbutamide and halted development, leaving the field open for Upjohn to market its new treatment. In 1956, Upjohn filed for approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Jeremy A. Greene found the application's size – 10,580 pages in 23 volumes with 5,786 cases reports – was necessary to ""render visible the relatively small improvements provided in less severe forms of diabetes."" Indeed, Orinase was marketed by Upjohn not as a cure-all for all diabetics, but specifically as a treatment that was ""not an oral insulin"" and ""did not work in all diabetics"". Those were the instructions for marketing given to Upjohn's salespeople. As indicated by the FDA application, Orinase had been demonstrated ""not to be effective in severe diabetes, but only in milder cases of the disease."": 93 Orinase was one of a new class of drugs (including treatments for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) aimed at providing marginal benefits over existing treatments for patients who had not previously been a target market for pharmaceuticals. As blood sugar testing for diagnosis of diabetes became more widespread, a curious side effect occurred: because blood sugar testing is not absolutely definitive in diagnoses of diabetes, more people were receiving borderline tests regarding their glycemic status. These borderline persons could be considered as being at risk for diabetes – prediabetic. Prediabetic patients have elevated blood sugar, but normal levels of sugar in their urine (glycosuria). Upjohn saw an opportunity to benefit and definitely market to a yet-greater expansion of the diabetic population, beyond even the ""hidden diabetics"" revealed by earlier public health campaigns. Upjohn also found a new use for Orinase: as a diagnostic. Orinase Diagnostic was added to the Orinase product line and, by 1962, was being sold as means of detecting prediabetes in that an abnormal response to Orinase following administration of cortisone in a ""stress test"" could be taken to indicate prediabetes. Orinase thus not only served to detect a previously hidden patient population, but also detected a patient population most likely to be interested in Orinase as a treatment for their newly diagnosed prediabetes. By the late 1960s, Orinase Diagnostic was withdrawn and the drug reverted to its therapeutic purpose. By that point, prediabetes had become a diagnosable and treatable condition which had dramatically increased the market for Orinase. Orinase began to fall out of favor in May 1970 when asymptomatic prediabetics on long-term regimens of Orinase began to see news reports (beginning with the Washington Post) that Orinase may have serious side effects including death from cardiovascular problems, according to a long-term study. In many cases, patients learned of this before their physicians, and also before FDA could advise relabeling the medication or suggesting alterations in appropriate usage. The question of whether Orinase did or did not increase cardiovascular problems has not been conclusively settled. The result was that Orinase and other medical treatments for prediabetes were ""rolled back"" by the FDA and practitioners in an attempt to focus on symptomatic patients for whom the risks of treatment might be balanced by the symptoms of the disease. Pharmacia and Upjohn (now merged) stopped making Orinase in 2000, though a generic is still available and occasionally used. == Historical consequences == The history of tolbutamide has had a lasting effect on medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. Patients today are still diagnosed with prediabetes, many of them managing to delay the onset of diabetes through dietary and lifestyle changes, but many also have the option to take metformin, which demonstrated a 31% reduction in three-year incidence of development of diabetes relative to placebo. While impressive, the lifestyle-modification arm of that same trial demonstrated a 58% reduction. == See also == Chlorpropamide == References ==",Diabetamid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002625948516651988), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014221861027181149)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01416350994259119)])","('MEDICAL; ([minclinic.eu](https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/D/Diabetamid.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='MIN — what is Diabetamid used for, medicine in english, dosing, side effects, generic, general information, pharmacology, interactions, contraindications, precautions, overdose, medication, treatment.', type='url_citation', url='https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/D/Diabetamid.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The permeation of a blocked tryptophan through a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) membrane is investigated to probe unassisted or physical transport. The transport rate is measured experimentally and modeled computationally. The time scale measured by parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) experiments is ~8 h. Simulations with the milestoning algorithm suggest mean first passage time (MFPT) of ~4 h and the presence of a large barrier at the center of the bilayer. A similar calculation with the solubility-diffusion model yields a MFPT of ~15 min. This permeation rate is 9 orders of magnitude slower than the permeation rate of only a tryptophan side chain (computed by us and others). This difference suggests critical dependence of transport time on permeant size and hydrophilicity. Analysis of the simulation results suggests that the permeant partially preserves hydrogen bonding of the peptide backbone to water and lipid molecules even when it is moving closer to the bilayer center. As a consequence, defects of the membrane structure are developed to assist permeation. When tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli is allowed to react with L-tryptophan and ATP-Mg in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase, the fluorescence change of the reaction mixture reveals three or four sequential processes, depending on the buffer used. Quenched-flow and stopped-flow experiments show that the first two processes, which occur in the 0.001-1.0-s time scale, can be correlated to the formation of two moles of tryptophanyl-adenylate per mole of dimeric enzyme. These two processes are reversible by adding PPi, as seen in the fluorimeter. The third process leads to a reaction product that can no longer reform ATP after addition of PPi and that represents tryptophanyl-ATP ester, as demonstrated by thin-layer chromatography. This compound has been previously shown to be formed by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from E. coli [K. H. Muench (1969) Biochemistry 8, 4872-4879]. Its formation is accompanied by a fluorescence decrease which reaches a minimum in about 30 min. The nature of the fourth process depends on the reaction conditions employed. In sodium bicarbonate or potassium phosphate buffer, the fourth process corresponds to the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of tryptophanyl-ATP ester. This spontaneous hydrolysis competes with formation of the ester and limits its concentration. Eventually, the progressive exhaustion of ATP brings the fluorescence intensity of the reaction mixture back to its initial value. In contrast, in ammonium bicarbonate buffer the previous third process is no longer visible, as evidenced by the absence of a fluorescence decrease beyond the fast initial quenching linked to the formation of tryptophanyl-adenylate. Instead, a fluorescence increase is observed. However, unlike the fourth process seen in sodium bicarbonate buffer, the fluorescence increase in ammonium bicarbonate is much larger than the initial fluorescence decrease linked to adenylate formation, the final fluorescence greatly surpassing the starting fluorescence signal. The reaction product of this process is tryptophanamide, as evidenced by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tryptophanamide formation is faster than that of tryptophanyl-ATP ester and is enzyme-catalyzed with a Km of 1 mM for ammonia and a rate constant of 5.7 min-1 at pH 8.3, 25 degrees C. The affinity of tryptophanamide for the protein is too weak to allow the formation of a significant concentration of enzyme-product complex. Tryptophanamide is therefore released in the reaction medium and its concentration reaches that of the limiting substrate. The configurational analysis of amino acids (AAs) in natural product peptides, often containing nonproteinogenic AAs, is mostly carried out by the venerable Marfey's method using a chiral derivatizing agent (CDA) 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alaninamide (l-FDAA)─Marfey's reagent─which undergoes ",Tryptophanamide,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -5.200166469876422e-06)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0019395602867007256), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002531777834519744)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/l-tryptophanamide-cas-20696-57-5,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/l-tryptophanamide-hydrochloride-cas-5022-65-1-cay35769-25,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2973001/,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04537 ', [])"

The single passed intestinal backflow method was used. Bifendate with different concentrations, bifendate with and without 2,4-dinitrophenol, verapamil, and probenecid, and solid state of bifendate in different systems were studied. Change of concentration and the presence of energy inhibitor, P-glycoprotein inhibitor and multidrug-resistant protein inhibitor did not affect the K(a) of bifendate intestinal absorption; there were obvious differences among intestinal absorption of native drug, solid dispersion, and physical mixtures. The result indicated that the intestinal absorption mechanism of bifendate is passive transport. Solid state of bifendate in different systems could affect the intestinal absorption. Some traditional Chinese medicines exert roles in the therapy of liver diseases by modulating autophagy. Bifendate (DDB), a synthetic intermediate of Schisandrin C extracted from Schisandrae chinensis, is clinically used to treat hepatitis in China. While DDB is a positive control to research some potential hepatoprotective agents, its related molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we show that DDB inhibited autophagosome-lysosome fusion, lysosome acidification and autophagic lysosome reformation. Moreover, DDB attenuated oleic acid-induced lipid droplet accumulation. These findings reveal the effects of DDB on the autophagy-related processes and lysosomal function, and also provide a possibility to understand the bioactivity mechanism of DDB in the future. Effects of bifendate, a synthetic intermediate of schisandrin C (a dibenzocyclooctadiene derivative), on liver lipid contents were investigated in experimentally-induced hypercholesterolemia in mice. Hypercholesterolemia was induced by either chronic administration of cholesterol/bile salt or feeding a high-fat diet containing cholesterol and/or bile salt. Hepatic and serum total cholesterol levels were significantly increased (42-268% and 23-124%, respectively) in cholesterol or high-fat diet-treated mice, when compared with control animals receiving vehicle or normal diet. Hepatic triglyceride level was increased (up to 108%), but serum triglyceride level was significantly reduced by 23-63% in hypercholesterolemic mice. Daily administration of bifendate (0.03-1.0 g/kg, i.g.) for 4 days decreased hepatic levels of total cholesterol (9-37%) and triglyceride (10-37%) in hypercholesterolemic mice. Supplementing the high-fat diet with bifendate (0.25%, w/w) caused decreases in hepatic total cholesterol (25-56%) and triglyceride (22-44%) levels following 7 or 14 days of experiment, respectively, when compared with animals fed with high-fat diet not supplemented with bifendate. While fenofibrate treatment decreased both hepatic and serum lipid levels in hypercholesterolemic mice, bifendate treatment did not reduce serum lipid levels. Bifendate and fenofibrate caused an increase (10-41% and 59-98%, respectively) in hepatic index of hypercholesterolemic mice.

The RG group was matched 1:1 with the LG group by using propensity score matching. The primary outcome was postoperative complications. After propensity score matching, a well-balanced cohort of 3552 patients was included for further analysis. The occurrence of overall complications (12.6% vs 15.2%, P = 0.023) was lower in the RG group than in the LG group.

Research was conducted in both Russia and western nations into potential applications as a neuroprotective drug to treat Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, as a nootropic, as well. After a major phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment failed to show any benefit, three other AD trials continued. Major industry-based development in this indication essentially stopped after another Phase III trial suffered the same fate in 2012. Latrepirdine failed in the phase III trial for Huntington disease. == Uses == Latrepirdine is an orally active, small molecule compound that has been shown to inhibit brain cell death in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Research suggests it may also have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals, in the absence of neurodegenerative disease pathology. However, because of negative results in human clinical trials, the drug remains unlicensed for any neurodegenerative condition. == Clinical trials == === Alzheimer's disease === Latrepirdine attracted renewed interest in 2009 after being shown in small preclinical trials to have positive effects on persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies showing potential beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease models were shown in Russian research in 2000. Preliminary results from human trials have also been promising. In an initial six-month phase II trial, results have shown significant improvement over placebo at 12 months. Latrepirdine showed promising results in a phase III-equivalent, double-blind trial in Russia with mild–moderate stage patients. In April 2009, Pfizer and Medivation initiated a phase III trial (CONCERT study) aiming for FDA approval. In March 2010, Pfizer announced that this clinical trial failed to show any benefit for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients. Numerous phase III trials for AD were recruiting in 2009. In July 2009, Pfizer and Medivation announced that ""latrepirdine"" was to be the proposed international nonproprietary name for latrepirdine for the treatment of Alzheimer's. In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Pfizer had paid $225 million after bidding against several pharmaceutical companies to purchase the rights to Dimebon. With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for latrepirdine in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication. A Cochrane meta-analysis of the three pivotal phase III efficacy trials found no significant effect of latrepirdine on cognition and function in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients, though there appears to be a modest benefit for overall behavior disturbances.

The trial was sponsored by Medivation Inc. and Pfizer. == Pharmacology == Latrepirdine appears to operate through multiple mechanisms of action, both blocking the action of neurotoxic beta-amyloid proteins and inhibiting L-type calcium channels, modulating the action of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, and may exert a neuroprotective effect by blocking a novel target that involves mitochondrial pores, which are believed to play a role in the cell death that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and the aging process. It also blocks a number of other receptors, including α-adrenergic, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT6. Notably, latrepirdine lacks any anticholinergic effects. == See also == Cerlapirdine Idalopirdine List of Russian drugs == References ==",Dimebon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5769333839416504), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.30981186684221e-05), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02326035499572754)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrepirdine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21031168/,https://drugstorenews.com/pharmacy/pfizer-medivation-discontinue-dimebon-development-following-late-stage-trial-results ', [])"
2046,"('Penciclovir',)",Medical,"Penciclovir is a guanosine analogue antiviral drug used for the treatment of various herpesvirus infections. It is a nucleoside analogue which exhibits low toxicity and good selectivity. Because penciclovir is absorbed poorly when given orally (by mouth) it is more often used as a topical treatment. It is the active ingredient in the cold sore medications Denavir (NDC 0135-0315-52), Vectavir and Fenivir. Famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability. Penciclovir was approved for medical use in 1996. == Medical use == In herpes labialis, the duration of healing, pain and detectable virus is reduced by up to one day, compared with the total duration of 2–3 weeks of disease presentation. == Mechanism of action == Penciclovir is inactive in its initial form. Within a virally infected cell a viral thymidine kinase adds a phosphate group to the penciclovir molecule; this is the rate-limiting step in the activation of penciclovir. Cellular (human) kinases then add two more phosphate groups, producing the active penciclovir triphosphate. This activated form inhibits viral DNA polymerase, thus impairing the ability of the virus to replicate within the cell. The selectivity of penciclovir may be attributed to two factors. First, cellular thymidine kinases phosphorylate the parent form significantly less rapidly than does the viral thymidine kinase, so the active triphosphate is present at much higher concentrations in virally infected cells than in uninfected cells. Second, the activated drug binds to viral DNA polymerase with a much higher affinity than to human DNA polymerases. As a result, penciclovir exhibits negligible cytotoxicity to healthy cells. The structure and mode of action of penciclovir are very similar to that of other nucleoside analogues, such as the more widely used aciclovir. A difference between aciclovir and penciclovir is that the active triphosphate form of penciclovir persists within the cell for a much longer time than the activated form of aciclovir, so the concentration within the cell of penciclovir will be higher given equivalent cellular doses. == See also == Nucleoside analogue Famciclovir == References ==",Penciclovir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.529942543740617e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009188005933538079)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/penciclovir-topical-route/description/drg-20065362?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=142, start_index=9, title='Penciclovir (topical route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/penciclovir-topical-route/description/drg-20065362?utm_source=openai')])"

Similar to the oxygen effect, in which DNA bases modified by reactive oxygen species prevent repair of the cellular radiation damage, these compounds in general magnify free radical formation, leading to the permanent ""fixation"" of the resultant chemical change in the DNA structure. The purpose of this review is to present the origin story of the radiosensitizer, RRx-001, which emerged from the aerospace industry. The activity of RRx-001 as a chemosensitizer in multiple tumor types and disease states including malaria, hemorrhagic shock and sickle cell anemia, are the subject of future reviews. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a crucial role in innate immune-mediated inflammation and contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple autoinflammatory, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, but medications targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome are not available for clinical use. RRx-001 is a well-tolerated anticancer agent currently being investigated in phase III clinical trials, but its effects on inflammatory diseases are not known. Here, we show that RRx-001 is a highly selective and potent NLRP3 inhibitor that has strong beneficial effects on NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases. RRx-001 inhibits the activation of the canonical, noncanonical, and alternative NLRP3 inflammasomes but not the AIM2, NLRC4 or Pyrin inflammasomes. Mechanistically, RRx-001 covalently binds to cysteine 409 of NLRP3 via its bromoacetyl group and therefore blocks the NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, which is critical for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. More importantly, RRx-001 treatment attenuates the symptoms of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Thus, our study identifies RRx-001 as a new potential therapeutic agent for NLRP3-driven diseases. RRx-001 is a shape shifting small molecule with Fast Track designation for the prevention/amelioration of chemoradiation-induced severe oral mucositis (SOM) in newly diagnosed Head and Neck cancer. It has been intentionally developed or ""engineered"" as a chimeric single molecular entity that targets multiple redox-based mechanisms. Like an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), RRx-001 contains, at one end a ""targeting"" moiety, which binds to the NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibits it as well as Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), the negative regulator of Nrf2, and, at the other end, a conformationally constrained, dinitro containing 4 membered ring, which fragments under conditions of hypoxia and reduction to release therapeutically active metabolites i.e., the payload. This ""payload"", which is delivered specifically to hypoperfused and inflamed areas, includes nitric oxide, nitric oxide related species and carbon-centered radicals.

Its pharmacological action is mediated primarily through stimulation of central nervous system muscarinic M1 and M4 receptor subtypes. Xanomeline is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist with similar high affinity for all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes but has greater agonistic activity at the M1 and M4 subtypes. Xanomeline/trospium, sold under the brand name Cobenfy, is an approved combination drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Trospium chloride is a peripherally selective non-selective muscarinic antagonist to quell peripheral muscarinic agonist-dependent side effects. Xanomeline's mechanism of action in this context is hypothesized to be via modulating certain neurotransmitter circuits, including acetylcholine, dopamine, and glutamate, which can provide therapeutic benefits in schizophrenia and related diseases. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist ==== Xanomeline is an agonist that primarily targets the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family of five muscarinic receptor subtypes, which are designated M1-M5. While it binds with near identical affinity to all five of the muscarinic receptor subtypes as measured by displacement of a muscarinic radioligand, the preponderance of evidence suggests that xanomeline acts preferentially in the central nervous system as a functionally selective partial agonist at the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors. It has more modest partial agonist pharmacology at the M2, M3 and M5 receptors. In addition to its muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M4 receptor agonism, xanomeline has been found to act as an antagonist or partial agonist of the M5 receptor. ==== Other actions ==== Aside from its actions at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, xanomeline has relatively high affinity for certain other targets, such as various serotonin receptors. It acts specifically as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor, and as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. Xanomeline may inhibit CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein locally in the intestines, but does not inhibit them systemically. ==== Mechanism of action ==== Xanomeline modulates certain dopaminergic and glutamatergic circuits in the brain that can provide therapeutic benefits in patients suffering from neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease through stimulation primarily of central M1 and M4 muscarinic receptor subtypes. Muscarinic M1 and M4 receptors have been shown in preclinical studies to be expressed in areas important for dopamine and glutamate neural circuit regulation (e.g. frontal cortex and dorsal and ventral striatum). Xanomeline has shown antipsychotic-like effects in various preclinical behavioral models, such as attenuation of amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity, effects that are dependent on M1 and M4 receptor activation. === Pharmacokinetics === CYP2D6 significantly contributes to the metabolism of xanomeline. As a result, CYP2D6 polymorphisms are expected to affect the patient's exposure to xanomeline. == Chemistry == Xanomeline has structural and pharmacological similarities to the main psychoactive ingredient in betel nut, arecoline, and the natural muscarinic receptor neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Xanomeline is an achiral and lipophilic small molecule with a molecular weight of 281.4 (also known as hexyloxy-TZTP, LY246708, Lumeron, Memcor - Eli Lilly; NNC 11-0232 - Novo Nordisk; Kar-XT, Karuna Therapeutics). Xanomeline's physical chemical properties, including low molecular weight, lipophilicity, and absence of hydrogen bond donors, favor its entry into the brain with a high brain to plasma ratio (> 10:1). == Clinical development == Xanomeline was first discovered in a therapeutic development collaboration between Eli Lilly & Co. and Novo Nordisk pharmaceutical companies in the early 1990s. Eli Lilly led the first clinical development effort of xanomeline through a phase 2 clinical trial to test the hypothesis that it would improve cognition in patients suffering from cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer's disease, with positive results for cognitive decline and an unexpected effect against delusions and hallucination. A small placebo-controlled study in treatment-resistant schizophrenia followed, demonstrating its antipsychotic-like action. Xanomeline's development was discontinued primarily due to cholinergic side effects observed in clinical studies . Further development was enabled through a novel co-formulation strategy, xanomeline/trospium (developmental name KarXT), with the peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist, trospium, to quell the peripheral cholinergic side effects. In March 2023, Karuna Therapeutics announced that KarXT had met its primary endpoint in a phase III trial, EMERGENT-3, and that it was submitting the drug for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is classified as a keto acid. This white crystalline solid is soluble in water and polar organic solvents. It is derived from degradation of cellulose and is a potential precursor to biofuels, such as ethyl levulinate. == Synthesis == Levulinic acid was first prepared in 1840 by Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder by heating fructose with hydrochloric acid. The first commercial production of levulinic acid began as a batchwise process in an autoclave by starch manufacturer A. E. Staley in the 1940s. In 1953 Quaker Oats developed a continuous process for the production of levulinic acid. In 1956 it was identified as a platform chemical with high potential. and in 2004 the US Department of Energy (U.S. DoE) identified levulinic acid as one of the 12 potential platform chemicals in the biorefinery concept. The synthesis of levulinic acid from hexoses (glucose, fructose) or starch in dilute hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. In addition to formic acid further, partly insoluble, by-products are produced. These are deeply colored and their complete removal is a challenge for most technologies. Many concepts for the commercial production of levulinic acid are based on a strong acid technology. The processes are conducted in a continuous manner at high pressures and temperatures. Lignocellulose is an inexpensive starting material. Levulinic acid is separated from the mineral acid catalyst by extraction. Levulinic acid is purified by distillation. == Reactions and applications == Levulinic acid is used as a precursor for pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, and various other additives. The largest application of levulinic acid is its use in the production of aminolevulinic acid, a biodegradable herbicide used in South Asia. Another key application is the use of levulinic acid in cosmetics. Ethyl levulinate, a primary derivative of levulinic acid, is extensively used in fragrances and perfumes. Levulinic acid is a chemical building block or starting material for a wide variety of other compounds including γ-valerolactone and 2-methyl-THF. === Other occurrence and niche uses === Levulinic acid is used in cigarettes to increase nicotine delivery in smoke and binding of nicotine to neural receptors.

A drug screen in gemcitabine-treated DIPG cells revealed that fimepinostat, a dual inhibitor of HDAC and PI3K, effectively suppressed the gemcitabine-induced NF-κB signaling in addition to blocking PI3K/AKT activation. Combination therapy comprising gemcitabine and fimepinostat elicited synergistic antitumor effects in vitro and in orthotopic H3.3K27M DIPG xenograft models. Collectively, p53 activation using gemcitabine and suppression of RELB-mediated NF-κB activation and PI3K/AKT signaling using fimepinostat is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating H3.3K27M DIPG. Gemcitabine activates p53 and induces apoptosis to elicit antitumor effects in H3.3K27M DIPG, which can be enhanced by blocking NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling with fimepinostat, providing a synergistic combination therapy for DIPG. To test the potential of fimepinostat (CUDC-907), a dual inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDAC) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K), to reverse human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latency in infected cell lines and in CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-infected donors on long-term combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Latently HIV-1-infected J-lat Tat-GFP and ACH-2 cell lines were stimulated with clinically relevant concentrations of fimepinostat using the HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) panobinostat and romidepsin for comparison. Next, CD4+ T cells from donors living with HIV-1 on long-term cART were stimulated  We found fimepinostat to be a potent latency-reversing agent. This was true in two latently infected cell lines as well as  At therapeutic concentration, the dual HDAC and PI3K inhibitor fimepinostat was a potent HIV-1 latency-reversing agent and it did not induce T cell activation and proliferation. The potential of fimepinostat as a latency-reversing agent warrants further investigation. Fimepinostat (CUDC-907), a first-in-class oral small-molecule inhibitor of histone deacetylase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, demonstrated efficacy in a phase 1 study of patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large and high-grade B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL/HGBL), particularly those with increased MYC protein expression and/or MYC gene rearrangement/copy number gain (MYC-altered disease). Therefore, a phase 2 study of fimepinostat was conducted in this patient population with 66 eligible patients treated. The primary end-point of overall response (OR) rate for patients with MYC-IHC ≥40% (n = 46) was 15%. Subsequently, exploratory pooled analyses were performed including patients treated on both the phase 1 and 2 studies based upon the presence of MYC-altered disease as well as a biomarker identified by Virtual Inference of Protein activity by Enriched Regulon analysis (VIPER). For these patients with MYC-altered disease (n = 63), the overall response (OR) rate was 22% with seven responding patients remaining on treatment for approximately two years or longer, and VIPER yielded a three-protein biomarker classification with positive and negative predictive values of ≥85%. Prolonged durations of response were achieved by patients with MYC-altered R/R DLBCL/HGBL treated with single-agent fimepinostat. Combination therapies and/or biomarker-based patient selection strategies may lead to higher response rates in future clinical trials.",Fimepinostat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00029404606902971864), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006730742286890745)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34341990/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Fimepinostat (CUDC-907) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell and high-grade B-cell lymphoma: report of a phase 2 trial and exploratory biomarker analyses - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34341990/?utm_source=openai')])"
2055,"('Bretylium (tosylate)', 'P-toluenesulfonic acid', 'P-toluenesulphonic acid', 'Toluene-4-sulfonic acid', 'Tosic acid')",Medical,"p-Toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA, pTSA, or pTsOH) or tosylic acid (TsOH) is an organic compound with the formula CH3C6H4SO3H. It is a white extremely hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water, alcohols, and other polar organic solvents. The CH3C6H4SO2 group is known as the tosyl group and is often abbreviated as Ts or Tos. Most often, TsOH refers to the monohydrate, TsOH.H2O. As with other aryl sulfonic acids, TsOH is a strong organic acid. It is about one million times stronger than benzoic acid. It is one of the few strong acids that is solid and therefore is conveniently weighed and stored. == Preparation and uses == TsOH is prepared on an industrial scale by the sulfonation of toluene. Common impurities include benzenesulfonic acid and sulfuric acid. TsOH is most often supplied as the monohydrate, and it may be necessary to remove the complexed water before use. Impurities can be removed by recrystallization from its concentrated aqueous solution followed by azeotropic drying with toluene. TsOH finds use in organic synthesis as an ""organic-soluble"" strong acid. Examples of uses include: Acetalization of an aldehyde. Fischer–Speier esterification Transesterification reactions == Tosylates == Alkyl tosylates are alkylating agents because tosylate is electron-withdrawing as well as a good leaving group. Tosylate is a pseudohalide. Toluenesulfonate esters undergo nucleophilic attack or elimination. Reduction of tosylate esters gives the hydrocarbon. Thus, tosylation followed by reduction allows for the deoxygenation of alcohols. In a famous and illustrative use of tosylate as a leaving group, the 2-norbornyl cation was formed by an elimination reaction of 7-norbornenyl tosylate. The elimination occurs 1011 times faster than the solvolysis of anti-7-norbornyl p-toluenesulfonate. Tosylates are also protecting groups for alcohols. They are prepared by combining the alcohol with 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base. These reactions are usually performed in an aprotic solvent, often pyridine, which additionally acts as a base. == Reactions == TsOH may be converted to p-toluenesulfonic anhydride by heating with phosphorus pentoxide. When heated with acid and water, TsOH undergoes hydrolysis to toluene: CH3C6H4SO3H + H2O → C6H5CH3 + H2SO4 This reaction is general for aryl sulfonic acids. == See also == Tosyl Collidinium p-toluenesulfonate == References ==",Tosic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.011136045679450035), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018220314756035805)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3868710398674011)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB00123600.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=122, start_index=12, title='Tosic Acid | 104-15-4', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB00123600.htm?utm_source=openai')])"
2056,"('Urethane', 'Ethyl carbamate', 'Carbamic acid ethyl ester', 'Ethylurethane', 'Urethan')","Food, Medical","Ethyl carbamate (also called urethane) is an organic compound with the formula CH3CH2OC(O)NH2. It is an ester of carbamic acid and a white solid. Despite its name, it is not a component of polyurethanes. Because it is a carcinogen, it is rarely used, but naturally forms in low quantities in many types of fermented foods and drinks. == Synthesis == It is produced by organically heating urea and ethyl alcohol. It also arises by the action of ammonia on ethyl chloroformate. == Uses == === Biomedical applications === Ethyl carbamate has been used as an antineoplastic agent and for other medicinal purposes, but this application ended after it was discovered to be carcinogenic in 1943. However, Japanese usage in medical injections continued and from 1950 to 1975 an estimated 100 million 2 ml ampules of 7-to-15% solutions of ethyl carbamate were injected into patients as a co-solvent in water for dissolving water-insoluble analgesics used for post-operation pain. These doses were estimated to be at levels that are carcinogenic in mice. This practice was stopped in 1975. ""This regrettable medical situation appears to have involved the largest number (millions) of humans exposed to the largest doses of a pure carcinogen that is on record"". The author, U.S. cancer researcher James A. Miller, called for studies to determine the effects on Japanese cancer rates to be performed but apparently none were ever done. Prior to World War II, ethyl carbamate saw relatively heavy use in the treatment of multiple myeloma before it was found to be toxic, carcinogenic, and largely ineffective. By US FDA regulations, ethyl carbamate has been withdrawn from pharmaceutical use. However, small quantities of ethyl carbamate are also used in laboratories as an anesthetic for animals. Ethyl carbamate was reclassified as a Group 2A carcinogen by IARC in 2007. Ethyl carbamate is used as an anaesthetic in animal experiments, with more than 100 animal studies using ethyl carbamate published each year. One advantage of using ethyl carbamate is that it has a very long duration of action, with some adult rats remaining anaesthetised 24 hours after administration of the drug. It also does not depress neuronal activity in the cortex to the same extent as isoflurane. === Other uses === Formerly, ethyl carbamate was used as a chemical intermediate in the preparation of amino resins, that were in turn used as crosslinking agents for permanent-press textile treatments to create ""wash-and-wear"" fabrics. Other uses included as solvent or intermediary in the manufacture of pesticides, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. == Occurrence in beverages and food == The widespread presence of ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages was discovered during the mid-1980s. To raise public awareness of this issue, the U.S. Center for Science in the Public Interest published, in 1987, Tainted Booze: The Consumer's Guide to Urethane in Alcoholic Beverages. Studies have shown that most, if not all, yeast-fermented alcoholic beverages contain traces of ethyl carbamate (15 ppb to 12 ppm). Other foods and beverages prepared by means of fermentation also contain ethyl carbamate. For example, bread has been found to contain 2 ppb; as much as 20 ppb has been found in some samples of soy sauce. Amounts of both ethyl carbamate and methyl carbamate have also been found in wines, sake, beer, brandy, whiskey and other fermented alcoholic beverages. It has been shown that ethyl carbamate forms from the reaction of ethanol with urea: This reaction occurs much faster at higher temperatures, and therefore higher concentrations of ethyl carbamate are found in beverages that are heated during processing, such as brandy, whiskey, and other distilled beverages. Additionally, heating after bottling either during shipping or in preparation will cause ethyl carbamate levels to rise further. The urea in wines results from the metabolism of arginine or citrulline by yeast or other organisms. The urea waste product is initially metabolised inside the yeast cell until it builds up to a certain level. At that point, it is excreted externally where it is able to react with the alcohol to create ethyl carbamate. In 1988, wine and other alcoholic beverage manufacturers in the United States agreed to control the level of ethyl carbamate in wine to less than 15 ppb (parts per billion), and in stronger alcoholic drinks to less than 125 ppb. Although the urea cannot be eliminated, it can be minimized by controlling the fertilization of grape vines, minimizing their heat exposure, using self-cloning yeast and other actions. Furthermore, some strains of yeast have been developed to help reduce ethyl carbamate during commercial production of alcoholic beverages. Another important mechanism for ethyl carbamate formation in alcoholic beverages is the reaction from cyanide as precursor, which causes comparably high levels in spirits derived from cyanogenic plants, such as rhum agricole. == Hazards == Ethyl carbamate is not acutely toxic to humans, as reflected by its use as a medicine. Acute toxicity studies show that the lowest fatal dose in rats, mice, and rabbits equals 1.2 g/kg or more. When ethyl carbamate was used medicinally, about 50% of the patients exhibited nausea and vomiting, and long-time use led to gastroenteric hemorrhages. The compound has almost no odor and a cooling, saline, bitter taste. Studies with rats, mice, and hamsters have shown that ethyl carbamate causes cancer when administered orally, injected, or applied to the skin, but no adequate studies of cancer in humans caused by ethyl carbamate has been reported due to the ethical considerations of such studies. However, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer raised ethyl carbamate to a Group 2A carcinogen that is ""probably carcinogenic to humans"", one level below fully carcinogenic to humans. IARC has stated that ethyl carbamate can be ""reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals"". In 2006, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario in Canada rejected imported cases of sherry due to excessive levels of ethyl carbamate. Studies in Hong Kong (2009) and Korea (2015) outline the extent of the accumulative exposure to ethyl carbamate in daily life. Fermented foods such as soy sauce, kimchi, soybean paste, breads, rolls, buns, crackers and bean curd, along with wine, sake and plum wine, were found to be the foods with the highest ethyl carbamate levels in traditional Asian diets. In 2005, the JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee On Food Additives) risk-assessment evaluation of ethyl carbamate concluded that the MOE intake of ethyl carbamate from daily food and alcoholic beverages combined is of concern, and mitigation measures to reduce ethyl carbamate in some alcoholic beverages should continue. There is little doubt that ethyl carbamate in alcoholic beverages is very important to health authorities, while the cumulative daily exposure in the typical diet is also an issue of rising concern that merits closer observation. The Korean study concluded: ""It would be desirable to closely monitor ethyl carbamate levels in Korean foods and find ways to reduce the daily intake."" The IARC evaluation has led to the following US regulatory actions: NESHAP: Listed as a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act: Reportable Quantity (RQ) = 100 lb Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, EPA's Toxics Release Inventory: A listed substance subject to RCRA reporting requirements RCRA Listed Hazardous Waste: substance - U238 == Detection in alcoholic beverages == The concerns raised by the toxicological aspects of EC together with the low concentration levels (μg/L) found in wines, as well as the occurrence of interferences on detection, has motivated several researchers to develop new methods to determine it in wines. Several extraction and chromatographic techniques have been used, including continuous liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with Soxhlet apparatus, derivatization with 9-xanthydrol followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and even LLE after derivatization, followed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS). On the other hand, the reference method set by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) uses solid phase extraction (SPE) preceding GC–MS quantification. Other methods also make use of SPE, but use gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (MDGC/MS) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for detection. Most of the methodologies found in the literature to quantify EC use gas chromatography, using LLE and SPE as extraction techniques. Nevertheless, several efforts have also been done to develop new methodologies to determine EC without using long procedures and hard-working analyses, combining precision to high sensitivity. In this regard, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) has been gaining great highlighting and alternative methodologies has been proposed using the most recent identification and quantification technology, such as gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (GC–MS/MS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC–ToFMS). Microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) is also feasible. MEPS/GC–MS methodology has been applied to quantify EC in wines. Miniaturized liquid-liquid extraction (mLLE) followed by LC-MS/MS can be used to determine EC in wine, without using derivatizing agents. == Related compounds == Other carbamates include methyl carbamate, butyl carbamate, and phenyl carbamate (m. p. 149–152 °C), which can also be prepared from the corresponding chloroformate and ammonia. These esters are white, crystalline solids at room temperature. Except for the phenyl carbamate, they sublime at moderate temperatures; methyl carbamate sublimes at room temperatures. The first two and ethyl carbamate are very soluble in water, benzene, and ether. These other carbamates (methyl, butyl, and phenyl) are only used in small quantities for research purposes. == See also == Carbamate Methyl carbamate == References == == External links == NLM Hazardous Substances Databank – Ethyl carbamate",Ethyl carbamate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.013271166943013668), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0011709370883181691), (' INDUSTR', -0.0013855935540050268), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.9978508949279785), ('DU', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -7.998623186722398e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.39321643114089966), (',', -0.03810177743434906), ('ĠMED', -0.02775106206536293), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07906390726566315)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.001191775663755834), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.fda.gov/food/process-contaminants-food/ethyl-carbamate,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37893709/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017216/ ', [])"
2057,"('Eniluracil', 'Compound 776c', 'Eniluracil [usan:inn:ban]', 'Eniluracil (usan/inn)')",Medical," One of the most widely used drugs in cancer chemotherapy is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is optimally delivered via continuous iv. infusion, which is both cumbersome and expensive. Prolonged oral dosing of 5-FU could mimic continuous infusion with less inconvenience and cost. However, oral administration of 5-FU has been hampered by incomplete and erratic bioavailability due to substantial variability in the activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-FU catabolism. Eniluracil (ethynyluracil, GlaxoWellcome, USA), a uracil analogue, which irreversibly inhibits DPD, increases the oral bioavailability of 5-FU to 100%, facilitating uniform absorption and predictable toxicity. Cytotoxicity is enhanced one- to five-fold in cell lines treated with eniluracil plus 5-FU compared with 5-FU alone. Though eniluracil is neither toxic nor active as a single agent in animals, it improves the antitumour efficacy and therapeutic index of 5-FU. In Phase I trials, eniluracil markedly reduced the maximum tolerated dose of oral 5-FU, increased the half-life 20-fold and decreased the clearance 22-fold. DPD is completely inactivated within 1 h of eniluracil administration. Two dosing schedules have been evaluated in combination with oral 5-FU: a 5-day schedule every 28 days and a 28-day schedule every 35 days. The dose-limiting toxicity on the first schedule is myelosuppression with diarrhoea being dose-limiting on the 28-day schedule. Phase II trials employing the 28-day schedule have been completed in cancers of the colon, breast, liver and pancreas. Phase III trials in colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma have been completed and await analysis. Eniluracil is a promising drug, which permits reliable and safe administration of oral 5-FU and has the potential to overcome 5-FU resistance mediated by overexpression of DPD. Eniluracil (5-ethynyluracil, GW 776, 776C85) is being developed as a novel modulator of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of cancer. Eniluracil is an effective mechanism-based inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the first enzyme in the catabolic pathway of 5-FU. By temporarily eliminating this prevalent enzyme, eniluracil provides predictable dosing of 5-FU and enables oral administration of 5-FU to replace intravenous bolus and continuously infused dosing. New DPD is synthesized with a half-life of 2.6 days. It also eliminates the formation of problematic 5-FU catabolites. Most importantly, in laboratory animals, eniluracil increases the therapeutic index and absolute efficacy of 5-FU. Accompanying reports in this journal indicate that eniluracil has promising clinical potential. The pharmacological inactivation of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) represents one strategy to improve 5-FU therapy, which historically has been associated with unpredictable pharmacological behavior and toxicity. This is principally due to high interpatient differences in the activity of DPD, the enzyme that mediates the initial and rate-limiting step in 5-FU catabolism. By inactivating DPD and suppressing the catabolism of 5-FU, eniluracil has dramatically altered the pharmacological profile of 5-FU. The maximum tolerated dose of oral 5-FU given with oral eniluracil (1.0 to 25 mg/m2) is substantially lower than conventional 5-FU doses. In the presence of eniluracil, bioavailability of 5-FU has increased to approximately 100%, the half-life is prolonged to 4 to 6 hours, and systemic clearance is reduced > 20-fold to values comparable the glomerular filtration rate (46 to 58 mL/min/m2). Renal excretion (approximately 45% to 75%), instead of DPD-related catabolism, is the principal route of elimination of oral 5-FU given with eniluracil. Chronic daily administration of oral 5-FU 1.0 mg/m2 twice daily with eniluracil 20 mg twice daily produces 5-FU steady-state concentrations (8-38 ng/mL) similar to those achieved with protracted intravenous administration on clinically relevant dose-schedules. On a daily x 5 regimen, higher 5-FU AUC values are related to neutropenia, whereas elevated 5-FU AUC and steady-state concentrations are related to diarrhea when oral 5-FU is given daily with eniluracil on a chronic schedule. The pharmacokinetic behavior of oral eniluracil is similar to that for oral 5-FU. Administration of eniluracil 10 to 20 mg twice daily completely inactivates DPD activity both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in colorectal tumor tissue, and prolonged inhibition of DPD after discontinuation of eniluracil treatment has been noted. In the presence of eniluracil, oral administration of 5-FU is feasible and variation in 5-FU exposure is reduced, with the anticipation of further reduction in variation as dosing guidelines based on renal function are formulated.",Eniluracil,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.119095193454996e-05), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024813597556203604)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03516?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=6, title='Eniluracil: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03516?utm_source=openai')])"

It has also been used in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women and in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. Although widely used in the past, estradiol dipropionate has largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer available today. It appears to remain in use only in Japan, Macedonia, and Australia. Estradiol dipropionate is given by injection into muscle at intervals ranging from once or twice a week to once every week and a half to two weeks. Side effects of estradiol dipropionate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol dipropionate is an estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol dipropionate was patented in 1937 and was introduced for medical use by 1940. It was one of the earliest estradiol esters to be used. Along with estradiol benzoate, estradiol dipropionate was among the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years following its introduction. == Medical uses == The medical uses of estradiol dipropionate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Estradiol dipropionate is used in hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty due to hypogonadism or other causes in women. It is also used in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. Aside from hormone therapy, estradiol dipropionate is used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as menstrual disorders, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and breast engorgement. In addition, it is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol dipropionate has typically been used at a dosage of 1 to 5 mg once or twice per week by intramuscular injection for relevant indications. It has been used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms at a dosage of 1 to 5 mg initially for two to three injections and 1 to 2.5 mg for maintenance once every 10 to 14 days, and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty at a dosage of 2.5 to 5 mg once per week. As a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, estradiol dipropionate has been used at dosages of 2 to 10 mg once per week or 5 to 20 mg once every 2 weeks. In the treatment of prostate cancer, estradiol dipropionate has been used at a dosage of 5 mg once per week. === Available forms === Estradiol dipropionate was previously available by itself as an oil solution for intramuscular injection provided as vials and ampoules at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL. The medication has largely been discontinued, with most of these formulations no longer being available. Estradiol dipropionate remains available at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in combination with 50 mg/mL hydroxyprogesterone caproate under the brand name EP Hormone Depot (Teikoku Zoki Pharmaceutical Company) in Japan. == Contraindications == Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. == Side effects == The side effects of estradiol dipropionate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. == Overdose == Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Estradiol dipropionate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. Estradiol dipropionate is of about 41% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 and C17β propionate esters. Because estradiol dipropionate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. === Pharmacokinetics === Compared to estradiol benzoate, a related estradiol ester, estradiol dipropionate has enhanced and prolonged effects. Whereas the duration of action of estradiol benzoate is said to be 2 to 3 days, the duration of estradiol dipropionate has been said to be 1 to 2 weeks. However, newer estradiol esters have longer durations than either estradiol benzoate or estradiol dipropionate; the duration of estradiol valerate has been said to be 1 to 3 weeks, and the duration of estradiol cypionate has been said to be 3 to 4 weeks. A single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol dipropionate has a duration of about 5 to 8 days. A single intramuscular injection of 50 μg/kg estradiol dipropionate in oil in 15 pubertal girls (about 1 mg for a 50-kg (110-lb) girl) was found to produce peak estradiol levels of about 215 pg/mL after 1.5 days. Estradiol levels declined to about 90 pg/mL after 4 days. == Chemistry == Estradiol dipropionate, also known as estradiol 3,17β-dipropionate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, it is the C3,17β dipropionate ester of estradiol. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol dipropionate is 4.9. == History == Estradiol dipropionate was first synthesized and patented in 1937. It was assessed in clinical studies by 1939 and was introduced by Ciba as an oil solution for use by intramuscular injection under the brand name Di-Ovocylin by the same year. Other formulations such as Ovocyclin P by Ciba, Progynon DP by Schering and Dimenformon Dipropionate by Roche-Organon were also marketed by the early 1940s. Later in the 1940s the brand name Di-Ovocylin was changed by Ciba to Ovocylin Dipropionate. Along with estradiol benzoate, which was introduced in 1933, estradiol dipropionate was one of the first estradiol esters to be introduced for medical use. Prior to the development and introduction of longer-acting estradiol esters like estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s, estradiol dipropionate and estradiol benzoate were the most widely used estradiol esters. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Estradiol dipropionate is the generic name of the drug and its INNMTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Approved Name. === Brand names === Estradiol dipropionate has been marketed under a variety of brand names, including Agofollin, Akrofolline, Dihidrofolina ""Kével"", Dimenformon, Dimenformon Dipropionate, Diovocylin, Di-Ovocylin, Diprostron, Diprovex, Endofollicolina D.P., EP Hormone Depot (in combination with hydroxyprogesterone caproate), Estroici, Estronex, Follicyclin, Follicyclin P, Follikelmon Depot, Horiken-Depot, Nacyclyl, Oestradiol Galenika, Oestradiol Streuli, Orofollina, Ovacrin, Ovahormon Depot, Ovocylin, Ovocylin Dipropionate, Ovocylin P, and Progynon DP, among others. Agofollin was an oil solution of estradiol dipropionate that was previously marketed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. === Availability === Estradiol dipropionate has been discontinued in most countries, but remains available in Japan and Macedonia alone under the brand names Ovahormon and Oestradiol Galenika and/or in combination with hydroxyprogesterone caproate under the brand name EP Hormone Depot. It is also marketed for use in veterinary medicine in combination with hydroxyprogesterone caproate and nandrolone decanoate under the brand name Reepair in Australia. == See also == Estradiol dipropionate/hydroxyprogesterone caproate == References ==",Estroici,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011467275908216834), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860697314143181)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.wikigenes.org/e/chem/e/8225.html ', [])"

Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) is an orally-administered novel small molecule that covalently links two bioactive compounds (salicylic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) that inhibit NF-κB. This placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept phase 2 study with open-label extension in boys ≥4-<8 years old with any dystrophin mutation examined the effect of edasalonexent (67 or 100 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo or off-treatment control. Endpoints were safety/tolerability, change from baseline in MRI T In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), NF-κB is activated in skeletal muscle from infancy regardless of the underlying dystrophin mutation and drives inflammation and muscle degeneration while inhibiting muscle regeneration. Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) is a bifunctional orally administered small molecule that covalently links 2 compounds known to inhibit NF-κB, salicylic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Edasalonexent is designed to inhibit activated NF-κB upon intracellular cleavage to these bioactive components. Preclinical data demonstrate disease-modifying activity in DMD animal models. Three placebo-controlled studies in adult subjects assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single or multiple edasalonexent doses up to 6000 mg. Seventy-nine adult subjects received edasalonexent, and 25 received placebo. Pharmacokinetic results were consistent with the intracellular cleavage of edasalonexent to its active components. Food increased plasma exposures of edasalonexent and salicyluric acid, an intracellularly formed metabolite of salicylic acid. The NF-κB pathway and proteosome gene expression profiles in peripheral mononuclear cells were significantly decreased (P = .02 and P = .002, respectively) after 2 weeks of edasalonexent treatment. NF-κB activity was inhibited following a single dose of edasalonexent but not by equimolar doses of salicylic acid and DHA. Edasalonexent was well tolerated, and the most common adverse events were mild diarrhea and headache. In first-in-human studies, edasalonexent was safe, well tolerated, and inhibited activated NF-κB pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic utility in DMD regardless of the causative dystrophin mutation, as well as other NF-κB-mediated diseases. Edasalonexent (CAT-1004) is an orally-administered novel small molecule drug designed to inhibit NF-κB and potentially reduce inflammation and fibrosis to improve muscle function and thereby slow disease progression and muscle decline in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This international, randomized 2 : 1, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients ≥4 - < 8 years old with DMD due to any dystrophin mutation examined the effect of edasalonexent (100 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo over 52 weeks. Endpoints were changes in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA; primary) and timed function tests (TFTs; secondary). Assessment of health-related function used the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection tool (PODCI). One hundred thirty one patients received edasalonexent (n = 88) and placebo (n = 43). At week 52, differences between edasalonexent and placebo for NSAA total score and TFTs were not statistically significant, although there were consistently less functional declines in the edasalonexent group. A pre-specified analysis by age demonstrated that younger patients (≤6.0 years) showed more robust and statistically significant differences between edasalonexent and placebo for some assessments. Treatment was well-tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild, and most commonly involved the gastrointestinal system (primarily diarrhea). Edasalonexent was generally well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile at the dose of 100 mg/kg/day. Although edasalonexent did not achieve statistical significance for improvement in primary and secondary functional endpoints for assessment of DMD, subgroup analysis suggested that edasalonexent may slow disease progression if initiated before 6 years of age.

2062,"('Varenicline', 'Cp 526555', 'Varenicline (inn)', 'Cp 526555; champix; chantix', 'S6985')",Medical,"Varenicline, sold under the brand names Chantix and Champix among others, is a medication used for smoking cessation and for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. It is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist. When activated, this receptor leads to the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, the brain's reward center, thereby reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms with smoking cessation, although less pronounced than a full agonist (e.g. nicotine). Common side effects include nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, headache, and nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat). Despite these potential adverse effects, varenicline has proven efficacy in helping individuals quit smoking. It is estimated that approximately one in eleven smokers who use varenicline successfully remain abstinent from tobacco at six months. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The medication is available as a generic medication. In the United States, varenicline was prescribed over 1 million times in 2020, ranking as the 275th most commonly prescribed medication. == Medical uses == Varenicline is indicated for use as an aid to smoking cessation treatment and for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Varenicline is used to help people stop smoking tobacco (smoking cessation). A meta-analysis found that 20% of people treated with varenicline remain abstinent from smoking at one year. In a 2009 meta-analysis, varenicline was found to be more effective than bupropion (odds ratio 1.40) and nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) (odds ratio 1.56). A 2013 Cochrane overview and network meta-analysis concluded that varenicline is the most effective medication for tobacco cessation and that smokers were nearly three times more likely to quit tobacco use while on varenicline than with placebo treatment. Varenicline was more efficacious than bupropion or NRT and as effective as combination NRT for cessation of tobacco smoking. == Side effects == Mild nausea is the most common side effect and is seen in approximately 30% of people taking varenicline, though this rarely (<3%) results in discontinuation of the medication. Other less common side effects include headache, difficulty sleeping, and vivid dreams. Rare side effects reported by people taking varenicline compared to placebo include change in taste, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, and constipation. It has been estimated that for every five subjects taking varenicline at maintenance doses, there will be one event of nausea; and for every 24 of 35 treated subjects, there will be an event of constipation or flatulence. Gastrointestinal side-effects lead to discontinuation of the drug in 2% to 8% of people using varenicline. Incidence of nausea is dose-dependent: incidence of nausea was higher in people taking a larger dose (30%) versus placebo (10%) as compared to people taking a smaller dose (16%) versus placebo (11%). === Depression and suicide === In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it had received post-marketing reports of thoughts of suicide and occasional suicidal behavior, erratic behavior, and drowsiness among people using varenicline for smoking cessation. In 2009, the FDA required varenicline to carry a boxed warning that the medication should be stopped if any of these symptoms are experienced. A 2014 systematic review (literature research) did not find evidence of an increased suicide risk. Other analyses have reached the same conclusion and found no increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects with varenicline. No evidence for increased risks of cardiovascular events, depression, or self-harm with varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy was found in one post-marketing surveillance study. In 2016, the FDA removed the black box warning. People are still advised to stop the medication if they ""notice any side effects on mood, behavior, or thinking."" === Cardiovascular disease === In June 2011, the US FDA issued a safety announcement that varenicline may be associated with ""a small, increased risk of certain cardiovascular adverse events in people who have cardiovascular disease."" A prior 2011 review had found increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo. Expert commentary in the same journal raised doubts about the methodology of the review, concerns which were echoed by the European Medicines Agency and subsequent reviews. Of specific concern were ""the low number of events seen, the types of events counted, the higher drop-out rate in people receiving placebo, the lack of information on the timing of events, and the exclusion of studies in which no-one had an event."" In contrast, multiple recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found no increase in overall or serious adverse cardiovascular events (including for individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease) associated with varenicline use. == Mechanism of action == Varenicline displays full agonism on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is a partial agonist on the α4β2, α3β4, and α6β2 subtypes. Varenicline's partial agonism on the α4β2 receptors rather than nicotine's full agonism produces less effect of dopamine release than nicotine's. This α4β2 competitive binding reduces the ability of nicotine to bind and stimulate the mesolimbic dopamine system—similar to the method of action of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid addiction. However, it is the α7-pentamer that mediates clinical efficacy at remaining abstinent from nicotine. == Pharmacokinetics == Most of the active compound is excreted by the kidneys (92–93%) via the organic cation transporter OCT2 (SCL22A2) and may inhibit it at high concentrations. A small proportion is glucuronidated, oxidised, N-formylated or conjugated to a hexose. == History == Use of Cytisus plants as a smoking substitute during World War II led to use as a cessation aid in eastern Europe and extraction of cytisine. Cytisine analogs led to varenicline at Pfizer. Varenicline received a priority review by the US FDA in February 2006, shortening the usual ten-month review period to six months because of its demonstrated effectiveness in clinical trials and perceived lack of safety issues. The agency's approval of the drug came in May 2006. In September 2006, it was approved for sale in the European Union. In September 2021, Pfizer announced a recall of ""all lots of its anti-smoking treatment, Chantix [varenicline], due to high levels of cancer-causing agents called nitrosamines in the pills"". This followed a July 2021 announcement by the FDA that it was ""alerting patients and health care professionals to Pfizer's voluntary recall of nine lots of the smoking cessation drug"" and further recalls by Pfizer on 19 July and 8 August. In June 2021, Pfizer paused distribution of Chantix worldwide; ""the distribution halt was out of an abundance of caution, pending further testing"", the company said in an email. According to the Pfizer Inc. 2020 Form 10-K Annual Report, high-revenue products by the company include[d] Chantix/Champix (varenicline) to treat nicotine addiction, which recorded direct product revenues of more than $1 billion in 2019, $919 million in 2020, and $398 million in 2021 (the lower 2021 revenue was due, in part, to the basic product patent expiration for Chantix in the US in November 2020 and in Europe in September 2021, and the aforementioned Pfizer voluntary recall across multiple markets and a global pause in shipments of Chantix.) In October 2021, the US FDA approved Oyster Point Pharma to market Tyrvaya as a new route of varenicline administration through nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT03636061 for ""Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of OC-01 Nasal Spray on Signs and Symptoms of Dry Eye Disease (The ONSET-1 Study)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT04036292 for ""Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of OC-01 (Varenicline) Nasal Spray on Dry Eye Disease"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Varenicline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5748875486897305e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016926287207752466)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varenicline,https://www.drugs.com/varenicline.html,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D08669 ', [])"
2063,"('Rifampicin', 'Rifampin', 'Rifamycin amp', 'Rifadin', 'Rimactane')",Medical,"Rifampicin, also known as rifampin, is an ansamycin antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium avium complex, leprosy, and Legionnaires' disease. It is almost always used together with other antibiotics with two notable exceptions: when given as a ""preferred treatment that is strongly recommended"" for latent TB infection; and when used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal disease in people who have been exposed to those bacteria. Before treating a person for a long period of time, measurements of liver enzymes and blood counts are recommended. Rifampicin may be given either by mouth or intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. It often turns urine, sweat, and tears a red or orange color. Liver problems or allergic reactions may occur. It is part of the recommended treatment of active tuberculosis during pregnancy, though its safety in pregnancy is not known. Rifampicin is of the rifamycin group of antibiotics. It works by decreasing the production of RNA by bacteria. Rifampicin was discovered in 1965, marketed in Italy in 1968, and approved in the United States in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies rifampicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. Rifampicin is made by the soil bacterium Amycolatopsis rifamycinica. == Medical uses == === Mycobacteria === Rifampicin is used for the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other antibiotics, such as pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol. For the treatment of tuberculosis, it is administered daily for at least six months. Combination therapy is used to prevent the development of resistance and to shorten the length of treatment. Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampicin develops quickly when it is used without another antibiotic, with laboratory estimates of resistance rates from 10−7 to 10−10 per tuberculosis bacterium per generation. Rifampicin can be used alone in patients with latent tuberculosis infections to prevent or delay the development of active disease because only small numbers of bacteria are present. A Cochrane review found no difference in efficacy between a 3- to 4-month regimen of rifampicin and a 6-month regimen of isoniazid for preventing active tuberculosis in patients not infected with HIV, and patients who received rifampicin had a lower rate of hepatotoxicity. However, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low. A shorter 2-month course of rifampicin and pyrazinamide had previously been recommended but is no longer recommended due to high rates of hepatotoxicity. Rifampicin should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water. It is generally taken either at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals. Rifampicin is also used to treat nontuberculous mycobacterial infections including leprosy (Hansen's disease) and Mycobacterium kansasii. With multidrug therapy used as the standard treatment of Hansen's disease, rifampicin is always used in combination with dapsone and clofazimine to avoid causing drug resistance. It is also used in the treatment of Mycobacterium ulcerans infections as associated with Buruli ulcer, usually in combination with clarithromycin or other antibiotics. === Other bacteria and protozoans === In 2008, tentative evidence showed rifampicin may be useful in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in combination with other antibiotics, including in difficult-to-treat infections such as osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections. As of 2012, if rifampicin combination therapy was useful for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis was unclear. A meta-analysis concluded that adding adjunctive rifampicin to a β-lactam or vancomycin may improve outcomes in staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. However, a more recent trial found no benefit from adjunctive rifampicin. It is also used as preventive treatment against Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal) infections. Rifampicin is also recommended as an alternative treatment for infections by the tick-borne pathogens Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum when treatment with doxycycline is contraindicated, such as in pregnant women or in patients with a history of allergy to tetracycline antibiotics. It is also sometimes used to treat infections by Listeria species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Legionella pneumophila. For these nonstandard indications, antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be done (if possible) before starting rifampicin therapy. The Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas species are intrinsically resistant to rifampicin. It has been used with amphotericin B in largely unsuccessful attempts to treat primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri. Rifampicin can be used as monotherapy for a few days as prophylaxis against meningitis, but resistance develops quickly during long-term treatment of active infections, so the drug is always used against active infections in combination with other antibiotics. Rifampicin is relatively ineffective against spirochetes, which has led to its use as a selective agent capable of isolating them in materials being cultured in laboratories. === Viruses === Rifampicin has some effectiveness against vaccinia virus. === Pathogen susceptibility === The minimum inhibitory concentrations of rifampicin for several medically significant pathogens are: Mycobacterium tuberculosis — 0.002 – 64 μg/mL Mycobacterium bovis — 0.125 μg/mL Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant) — ≤ 0.006–256 μg/mL Chlamydia pneumoniae — 0.005 μg/mL === Primary biliary cholangitis === Rifampicin is used to treat itchiness caused by primary biliary cholangitis. The treatment-related adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hemolysis, and interactions with other drugs. For those reasons as well as some ethical concerns regarding off-label use of antibiotics, rifampin as a very effective preventive antibiotic for meningitis, is not considered appropriate for itchiness. === Hidradenitis suppurativa === Rifampicin with clindamycin has been used to treat the skin disease hidradenitis suppurativa. == Adverse effects == The most serious adverse effect is hepatotoxicity, and people receiving it often undergo baseline and frequent liver function tests to detect early liver damage. The more common side effects include fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, rashes, and immunological reactions. Taking rifampicin usually causes certain bodily fluids, such as urine, sweat, and tears, to become orange-red in color, a benign side effect that nonetheless can be frightening if it is not expected. This may also be used to monitor effective absorption of the drug (if drug color is not seen in the urine, the patient may wish to move the drug dose farther in time from food or milk intake). The discolorization of sweat and tears is not directly noticeable, but sweat may stain light clothing orange, and tears may permanently stain soft contact lenses. Since rifampicin may be excreted in breast milk, breastfeeding should be avoided while it is being taken. Other adverse effects include: Liver toxicity—hepatitis, liver failure in severe cases Respiratory—breathlessness Cutaneous—flushing, pruritus, rash, hyperpigmentation, redness and watering of eyes Abdominal — nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea Flu-like symptoms—chills, fever, headache, arthralgia, and malaise. Rifampicin has good penetration into the brain, and this may directly explain some malaise and dysphoria in a minority of users. Allergic reaction—rashes, itching, swelling of the tongue or throat, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing == Chemical structure == Rifampicin is a polyketide belonging to the chemical class of compounds termed ansamycins, so named because of their heterocyclic structure containing a naphthoquinone core spanned by an aliphatic ansa chain. The naphthoquinonic chromophore gives rifampicin its characteristic red-orange crystalline color. The critical functional groups of rifampicin in its inhibitory binding of bacterial RNA polymerase are the four critical hydroxyl groups of the ansa bridge and the naphthol ring, which form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues on the protein. Rifampicin is the 3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-iminomethyl derivative of rifamycin SV. == Interactions == Rifampicin is the most powerful known inducer of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system, including isoenzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. It increases metabolism of many drugs and as a consequence, can make them less effective, or even ineffective, by decreasing their levels. For instance, patients undergoing long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin have to increase their dosage of warfarin and have their clotting time checked frequently because failure to do so could lead to inadequate anticoagulation, resulting in serious consequences of thromboembolism. Rifampicin can reduce the efficacy of birth control pills or other hormonal contraception by its induction of the cytochrome P450 system, to the extent that unintended pregnancies have occurred in women who use oral contraceptives and took rifampicin even for very short courses (for example, as prophylaxis against exposure to bacterial meningitis). Other interactions include decreased levels and less effectiveness of antiretroviral agents, everolimus, atorvastatin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, celecoxib, clarithromycin, caspofungin, voriconazole, and lorazepam. Rifampicin is antagonistic to the microbiologic effects of the antibiotics gentamicin and amikacin. The activity of rifampicin against some species of mycobacteria can be potentiated by isoniazid (through inhibiting mycolate synthesis) and ambroxol (through host directed effects in autophagy and pharmacokinetics). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Crystal structure data and biochemical data suggest that rifampicin binds to the pocket of the RNA polymerase β subunit within the DNA/RNA channel, but away from the active site. The inhibitor prevents RNA synthesis by physically blocking elongation, and thus preventing synthesis of host bacterial proteins. By this ""steric-occlusion"" mechanism, rifampicin blocks synthesis of the second or third phosphodiester bond between the nucleotides in the RNA backbone, preventing elongation of the 5' end of the RNA transcript past more than two or three nucleotides. In a recent study rifampicin was shown to bind to cytochrome P450 reductase and alter its conformation as well as activity towards supporting metabolism of progesterone via CYP21A2. === Mechanism of resistance === Resistance to rifampicin arises from mutations that alter residues of the rifampicin binding site on RNA polymerase, resulting in decreased affinity for rifampicin. Resistance mutations map to the rpoB gene, encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. The majority of resistance mutations in E. coli are in 3 clusters on rpoB. Cluster I is amino acids 509 to 533, cluster II is amino acids 563 to 572, and cluster III is amino acid 687. When describing mutations in rpoB in other species, the corresponding amino acid number in E. coli is usually used. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the majority of mutations leading to rifampicin resistance are in cluster I, in a 81bp hotspot core region called RRDR for ""rifampcin resistance determining region"". A change in amino acid 531 from serine to leucine arising from a change in the DNA sequence of TCG to TTG is the most common mutation. Tuberculosis resistance has also occurred due to mutations in the N-terminal region of rpoB and cluster III. An alternative mechanism of resistance is through Arr-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rifampicin. With the assistance of the enzyme Arr produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium smegmatis, ADP-ribose is added to rifampicin at one of its ansa chain hydroxy groups, thereby inactivating the drug. === Resistance in tuberculosis === Mycobacterial resistance to rifampicin may occur alone or along with resistance to other first-line antitubercular drugs. Early detection of such multidrug or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is critical in improving patient outcomes by instituting appropriate second-line treatments, and in decreasing transmission of drug-resistant TB. Traditional methods of detecting resistance involve mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing, results of which could take up to 6 weeks. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated test that can detect rifampicin resistance, and also diagnose tuberculosis. A Cochrane review updated in 2014 and 2021 concluded that for rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate, that is (95%) sensitive and (98%) specific. === Pharmacokinetics === Orally administered rifampicin results in peak plasma concentrations in about 2–4 hours. 4-Aminosalicylic acid (another antituberculosis drug) significantly reduces absorption of rifampicin, and peak concentrations may be lower. If these two drugs must be used concurrently, they must be given separately, with an interval of 8 to 12 hours between administrations. Rifampicin is easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; its ester functional group is quickly hydrolyzed in bile, and it is catalyzed by a high pH and substrate-specific esterases. After about 6 hours, almost all of the drug is deacetylated. Even in this deacetylated form, rifampicin is still a potent antibiotic; however, it can no longer be reabsorbed by the intestines and is eliminated from the body. Only about 7% of the administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine, though urinary elimination accounts for only about 30% of the drug excretion. About 60% to 65% is excreted through feces. The half-life of rifampicin ranges from 1.5 to 5.0 hours, though hepatic impairment significantly increases it. Food consumption inhibits its absorption from the GI tract, and the drug is more quickly eliminated. When rifampicin is taken with a meal, its peak blood concentration falls by 36%. Antacids do not affect its absorption. The decrease in rifampicin absorption with food is sometimes enough to noticeably affect urine color, which can be used as a marker for whether or not a dose of the drug has been effectively absorbed. Distribution of the drug is high throughout the body, and reaches effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid. Since the substance itself is red, this high distribution is the reason for the orange-red color of the saliva, tears, sweat, urine, and feces. About 60% to 90% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. == Use in biotechnology == Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, and is commonly used to inhibit the synthesis of host bacterial proteins during recombinant protein expression in bacteria. RNA encoding for the recombinant gene is usually transcribed from DNA by a viral T7 RNA polymerase, which is not affected by rifampicin. == History == In 1957, a soil sample from a pine forest on the French Riviera was brought for analysis to the Lepetit Pharmaceuticals research lab in Milan, Italy. There, a research group headed by Piero Sensi and Maria Teresa Timbal discovered a new bacterium, Nocardia mediterranei. Nocardia mediterranei produces a class of previously unknown molecules with antibiotic activity. Because Sensi, Timbal and the researchers were particularly fond of the French crime story Rififi (about a jewel heist and rival gangs), they decided to call these compounds rifamycins. Derivatives of one molecule, rifamycin B, which itself possess minimal antibiotic activity yielded several highly active antibiotics, one of the earliest which was used as a medicine being rifamycin SV, which was introduced in some countries for the parenteral and topical treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria and infections of the biliary tract. After two years of attempts to obtain more stable semisynthetic products, a new molecule with high efficacy and good tolerability was produced in 1965 and was named rifampicin. Rifampicin was first sold in Italy in 1968 and was approved by the FDA in 1971. == Society and culture == === Cancer-causing impurities === In August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of nitrosamine impurities in certain samples of rifampin. The FDA and manufacturers are investigating the origin of these impurities in rifampin, and the agency is developing testing methods for regulators and industry to detect the 1-methyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (MNP). MNP belongs to the nitrosamine class of compounds, some of which are classified as probable or possible human carcinogens (substances that could cause cancer), based on laboratory tests such as rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although there are no data available to directly evaluate the carcinogenic potential of MNP, information available on closely related nitrosamine compounds was used to calculate lifetime exposure limits for MNP. As of January 2021, the FDA continues to investigate the presence of 1-methyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (MNP) in rifampin or 1-cyclopentyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (CPNP) in rifapentine approved for sale in the US. === Names === Rifampicin is the INN and BAN, while rifampin is the USAN. Rifampicin may be abbreviated R, RMP, RA, RF, or RIF (US). Rifampicin is also known as rifaldazine, rofact, and rifampin in the United States, also as rifamycin SV. Its chemical name is 5,6,9,17,19,21-hexahydroxy-23-methoxy-2,4,12,16,18,20,22-heptamethyl-8-[N-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)formimidoyl]-2,7-(epoxypentadeca[1,11,13]trienimino)-naphtho[2,1-b]furan-1,11(2H)-dione 21-acetate.

2064,"('Entacapone', 'Comtan', 'Comtess', 'Entacaponum', 'Entacapona')",Medical,"Entacapone, sold under the brand name Comtan among others, is a medication commonly used in combination with other medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Entacapone together with levodopa and carbidopa allows levodopa to have a longer effect in the brain and reduces Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms for a greater length of time than levodopa and carbidopa therapy alone. Entacapone is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). When taken together with levodopa (L-DOPA) and carbidopa, entacapone stops COMT from breaking down levodopa, resulting in an overall increase of levodopa remaining in the brain and body. Entacapone does not cross into the brain and hence does not inhibit COMT there. Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone (Stalevo), a medication developed by Orion Pharma and marketed by Novartis, is a single tablet formulation that contains levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. == Medical uses == Entacapone is used in addition to levodopa and carbidopa for people with Parkinson's disease to treat the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose ""wearing-off."" ""Wearing-off"" is characterized by the re-appearance of both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease occurring towards the end of a previous levodopa and carbidopa dose. In clinical trials, entacapone has not been shown to slow progression or reverse Parkinson's disease. Entacapone is an orally active drug that can be taken with or without food. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Pregnancy category C: risk is not ruled out. Although there have been animal studies that showed that entacapone was excreted into maternal rat milk, there have been no studies with human breast milk. Caution is advised for mothers taking entacapone while breastfeeding or during pregnancy. === Children === Entacapone safety and efficacy have not been assessed in infants or children. === Liver problems === Biliary excretion is the major route of excretion for entacapone. People with liver dysfunction may require additional caution and more frequent liver function monitoring while taking entacapone. === Kidney problems === There are no significant considerations for people with poor kidney function taking entacapone. == Contraindications == There is a high risk for allergic reactions for people who are hypersensitive to entacapone. Potential limiting conditions to consider before starting entacapone include: History of allergic reaction to entacapone History of liver disease, liver dysfunction, or alcoholism Current or planned pregnancy Current or planned surgeries == Side effects == The following side effects have been reported by people with Parkinson's disease treated with entacapone: Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Fatigue Dry mouth Back ache === Movement problems === The most common side effect of entacapone is movement problems, which occur in 25% of people taking entacapone. This drug may cause or worsen dyskinesia for people with Parkinson's disease treated together with levodopa and carbidopa. In particular, ""peak-dose dyskinesias"" may occur when levodopa levels are at its peak concentration in the serum plasma. === Diarrhea === 10% of patients taking entacapone have been shown to experience diarrhea. Diarrhea may occur within 4–12 weeks of initial entacapone use but resolves after discontinuation of the drug. Use of entacapone in the presence of diarrhea can also be associated with weight loss, low potassium levels, and dehydration. In clinical studies, severe diarrhea was the most common reason for discontinuation of entacapone. === Urine color === 10% of people taking entacapone experience a change in urine color to orange, red, brown, or black. This side effect is due to entacapone metabolism and excretion in the urine and shown to not be harmful. === Sudden sleep onset === People have reported sudden sleep onset while engaging in daily activities without prior warning of drowsiness. In controlled studies, patients on entacapone had a 2% increased risk of somnolence compared to placebo. === Low blood pressure === Episodes of orthostatic hypotension have been shown to be more common at the start of entacapone use due to increased levels of levodopa. === Behavior problems === Post-marketing data shows that entacapone may change or worsen mental status, leading to behaviors such as delusions, agitation, confusion, and delirium. People taking entacapone may experience increased urges to participate in gambling, sexual activities, money spending, and other stimulating reward behaviors. == Interactions == In studies, entacapone has shown a low potential for interaction with other drugs. In theory, it could interact with MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors because they also increase catecholamine levels in the body, with drugs being metabolized by COMT (for example methyldopa, dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline, and isoprenaline), with iron because it could form chelates, with substances binding to the same albumin site in the blood plasma (for example diazepam and ibuprofen), and with drugs being metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C9 (for example warfarin). None of the medications tested in studies have shown clinically relevant interactions, except perhaps warfarin for which a 13% (CI90: 6–19%) increase in INR was seen when combined with entacapone. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Entacapone is a selective and reversible inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). COMT eliminates biologically active catechols present in catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. When administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT acts as the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa and metabolizes it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and in the periphery. For the treatment of Parkinson's disease, entacapone is given as an adjunct to levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa. Entacapone is peripherally selective and inhibits COMT in the body but not in the brain. As a result, entacapone inhibits the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, thus increasing plasma levels of levodopa. This causes more constant dopaminergic stimulation in order to reduce the signs and symptoms presented in the disease. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The time to highest blood plasma concentrations is approximately one hour. The substance undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Absolute oral bioavailability (F) is 35%. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution (Vd) after intravenous injection is approximately 20 liters. 98% of the circulating entacapone is bound to serum albumin, which limits its distribution into tissues. Entacapone has low lipophilicity and does not significantly cross the blood–brain barrier. As a result, it is a peripherally selective drug and does not act in the brain. ==== Metabolism and elimination ==== Entacapone is primarily metabolized to its glucuronide in the liver, and 5% are converted into the Z-isomer. It has a half-life of approximately 0.3–0.7 hours, with only 0.2% being excreted unchanged in the urine. == Research == === Restless legs syndrome === Entacapone, in conjunction with levodopa and carbidopa, was under development for use in the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS), but development was discontinued. == References ==",Comtess,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.876845170860179e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004401430196594447)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12692810595035553), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00494,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comtess,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/entacapone-oral-route/description/drg-20063621 ', [])"
2065,"('Dobutamine (hydrochloride)', 'Dobutamine', 'Racemic-dobutamine', 'Dobutamina', 'Dobutrex')",Medical,"Dobutamine is a medication used in the treatment of cardiogenic shock (as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion) and severe heart failure. It may also be used in certain types of cardiac stress tests. It is given by IV only, as an injection into a vein or intraosseous as a continuous infusion. The amount of medication needs to be adjusted to the desired effect. Onset of effects is generally seen within 2 minutes. It has a half-life of two minutes. This drug is generally only administered short term, although it may be used for longer periods to relieve symptoms of heart failure in patients awaiting heart transplantation. Common side effects include a fast heart rate, an irregular heart beat, and inflammation at the site of injection. Use is not recommended in those with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. It primarily works by direct stimulation of β1 receptors, which increases the strength of the heart's contractions, leading to a positive inotropic effect. Generally it has little effect on a person's heart rate. Dobutamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. It was initially made from isoproterenol. == Medical uses == Dobutamine is used to treat acute but potentially reversible heart failure, such as which occurs during cardiac surgery or in cases of septic or cardiogenic shock, on the basis of its positive inotropic action. Dobutamine can be used in cases of congestive heart failure to increase cardiac output. It is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility, which could be the result of either organic heart disease or cardiac surgical procedures. Higher doses are not useful with history of recent ischemic heart disease because it increases heart rate and thus increases myocardial oxygen demand. The drug is also commonly used in the hospital setting as a pharmacologic stress testing agent to identify coronary artery disease. == Adverse effects == Primary side effects include those commonly seen for β1 active sympathomimetics, such as hypertension, angina, arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Used with caution in atrial fibrillation as it has the effect of increasing the atrioventricular (AV) conduction. The most dangerous side effect of dobutamine is increased risk of arrhythmia, including fatal arrhythmias. Overall, dobutamine tends to produce less tachycardia and peripheral vascular effects than agents such as epinephrine and isoproterenol. == Pharmacology == Dobutamine is a direct-acting agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the β1-adrenoceptors of the heart, increasing contractility and cardiac output. Since it does not act on dopamine receptors to inhibit the release of norepinephrine (another α1 agonist), dobutamine is less prone to induce hypertension than is dopamine. Dobutamine is predominantly a β1-adrenergic agonist, with weak β2 activity, and α1 selective activity, although it is used clinically in cases of cardiogenic shock for its β1 inotropic effect in increasing heart contractility and cardiac output. Dobutamine is administered as a racemic mixture consisting of both (+) and (−) isomers; the (+) isomer is a potent β1 agonist and α1 antagonist, while the (−) isomer is an α1 agonist. The administration of the racemate results in the overall β1 agonism responsible for its activity. (+)-Dobutamine also has mild β2 agonist activity, which makes it useful as a vasodilator. == History == It was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at Eli Lilly and Company, as a structural analogue of isoprenaline. == References == == External links == ""Dobutamine"". Drug Information Portal.

It is a first line treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, feeling tired, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, low blood pressure, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is among a class of drugs called ACE inhibitors and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. Quinapril was patented in 1980 and came into medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 253rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure. It may be used for the treatment of hypertension by itself or in combination with thiazide diuretics, and with diuretics and digoxin for heart failure. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Pregnancy Impaired renal and liver function Patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor Hypersensitivity to Quinapril == Side effects == Side effects of Quinapril include dizziness, cough, vomiting, upset stomach, angioedema, and fatigue. == Mechanism of action == Quinapril inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, an enzyme which catalyses the formation of angiotensin II from its precursor, angiotensin I. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure through a variety of mechanisms. Due to reduced angiotensin production, plasma concentrations of aldosterone are also reduced, resulting in increased excretion of sodium in the urine and increased concentrations of potassium in the blood. == Nitrosamine controversy and voluntary recall == In April of 2022, Pfizer voluntarily recalled five batches of the drug because of the presence of a nitrosamine, N-Nitroso-quinapril. Testing found that the amount of nitrosamines was above the acceptable daily intake level (all humans are exposed to nitrosamines up to a certain daily level by cured and grilled meats, water, dairy products, and vegetables) set by the U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

2068,"('Alosetron (hydrochloride)', 'Gr 68755c', 'Gr 68755 (hydrochloride)', 'Gr 68755x (hydrochloride)', 'Alosetron')",Medical,"Alosetron, sold under the brand name Lotronex among others, is a 5-HT3 antagonist used for the management of severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in females only. It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 2002. It is currently marketed by Prometheus Laboratories Inc. (San Diego). Alosetron was withdrawn from the market in 2000 owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, but was reintroduced in 2002 with availability and use restricted. == Medical uses == Alosetron is indicated only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) who have: chronic IBS symptoms (generally lasting 6 months or longer), had anatomic or biochemical abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract excluded, and not responded adequately to conventional therapy. Severe IBS-D includes diarrhea and 1 or more of the following: frequent and severe abdominal pain/discomfort, frequent bowel urgency or fecal incontinence, disability or restriction of daily activities due to IBS. === Efficacy === The phase III trial for approval was published in 2000 as an industry-funded randomized, placebo-controlled trial (PCT). Its authors found 1 mg alosetron, taken orally twice daily for 12 weeks, was associated with a 12% (CI 4.7-19.2) improvement in relief from abdominal pain and discomfort associated with diarrhea-predominant patients. The prescription of alosetron is currently approved in the U.S. at 0.5 and 1 mg. The FDA Medical Officer's Review, dated November 4, 1999, noted: ""Patients considered by investigators to fit the diarrhea-predominant subtype had at baseline... stool consistency values that were neither loose nor watery"". The FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee referred to the drug's efficacy as ""modest"", highlighting that the placebo brought relief on the primary outcome measure to 40–50% of women. == Contraindications == Lotronex's prescribing information brochure states that alosetron should not be initiated in patients with constipation. Other contraindications are: history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation; intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions, ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state; Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; diverticulitis; severe hepatic impairment. Concomitant use of fluvoxamine is also contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Alosetron was withdrawn in 2000 following the association of alosetron with serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects. The cumulative incidence of ischaemic colitis was 2 in 1000, while serious complications arising from constipation (obstruction, perforation, impaction, toxic megacolon, secondary colonic ischaemia, death) was 1 in 1000. A 1999 review performed by FDA medical officer John Senior, indicated that 27% of patients experienced constipation. The phase III trial reported constipation occurred in 30% and 3% of patients in the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. It was cited as the most important reason for patients dropping out of the study. == Mechanism of action == Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors of the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract. While being a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron, it is not classified or approved as an antiemetic. Since stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors is positively correlated with gastrointestinal motility, alosetron's 5-HT3 antagonism slows the movement of fecal matter through the large intestine, increasing the extent to which water is absorbed, and decreasing the moisture and volume of the remaining waste products. == History == Alosetron was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2000, after a seven-month review. At the time of the initial approval U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers found that alosetron improved symptoms in 10% to 20% of patients. Shipment to pharmacies started in March, 2000. On July 17, a health professional filed a report with the FDA on the death of a 50-year-old woman who suffered mesenteric ischemia. The report identified alosetron as the ""primary suspect"" in the death. Alosetron was withdrawn from the market voluntarily by GlaxoWellcome on November 28, 2000, owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, including 5 deaths and additional bowel surgeries. The FDA said it had reports of 49 cases of ischemic colitis and 21 cases of ""severe constipation"" and that ten of the 70 patients underwent surgeries and 34 others were examined at hospitals and released without surgery. Through November 17, 2000, pharmacists had filled 474,115 prescriptions for alosetron. Severe adverse events continued to be reported, with a final total of 84 instances of ischaemic colitis, 113 of severe constipation, 143 admissions to hospital, and 7 deaths. Patient advocacy groups, most notably the Lotronex Action Group and the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) lobbied for the drug's return. Public Citizen Health Research Group, another patient advocacy group, opposed the reintroduction. On June 7, 2002, the FDA announced the approval of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) that allows restricted marketing of Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride), to treat only women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The strict prescribing guidelines initially introduced in 2002 were relaxed slightly in 2016, enabling electronic prescriptions among other benefits. It is not known whether alosetron has been filed for registration in the EU. GSK sold Lotronex to the Californian corporation Prometheus in late 2007. Since 2015, generic versions of alosetron have been available in the US, sold by a number of different companies including Actavis Pharma Company, Prometheus Laboratories and Sebela Pharmaceuticals Inc === Criticism of the FDA === In 2001, the editor of the medical journal The Lancet, Richard Horton, criticized the FDA's handling of alosetron in an unusually sharp language. Horton argued that the treatment of a non-fatal condition did not justify the use of a drug with potentially lethal side effects, and that the FDA should have revoked the approval for alosetron sooner when postmarketing surveillance revealed that many patients had suffered constipation necessitating surgical intervention and ischaemic colitis. He asserted that FDA officials were improperly motivated to maintain and reinstate the approval for alosetron because of the extent to which the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is funded by user fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers, and that the reinstatement of alosetron was negotiated in confidential meetings with representatives of GlaxoSmithKline. An article published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) noted: ""By allowing the marketing of alosetron, a drug that poses a serious and significant public health concern according to its own terms, the FDA failed in its mission."" Others have argued that the approval process of Lotronex was an example of regulatory capture. == References ==",Alosetron,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.748573807475623e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002153879904653877)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alosetron?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Alosetron', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alosetron?utm_source=openai')])"

This compound had been thought to be strictly synthetic; however, it was reported that the compound was isolated from leaves and seeds of maize and other species. In maize, IBA has been shown to be biosynthesized in vivo from IAA and other compounds as precursors. This chemical may also be extracted from any of the Salix (Willow) genus. == Plant tissue culture == In plant tissue culture IBA and other auxins are used to initiate root formation in vitro in a procedure called micropropagation. Micropropagation of plants is the process of using small samples of plants called explants and causing them to undergo growth of differentiated or undifferentiated cells. In connection with cytokinins like kinetin, auxins like IBA can be used to cause the formation of masses of undifferentiated cells called callus. Callus formation is often used as a first step process in micropropagation where the callus cells are then caused to form other tissues such as roots by exposing them to certain hormones like auxins that produce roots. The process of callus to root formation is called indirect organogenesis whereas if roots are formed from the explant directly it is called direct organogenesis. In a study of Camellia sinensis, the effect of three different auxins, IBA, IAA and NAA were examined to determine the relative effect of each auxin on root formation. According to the result for the species, IBA was shown to produce a higher yield of roots compared to the other auxins. The effect of IBA is in concurrence with other studies where IBA is the most commonly used auxin for root formation. == Mechanism == Although the exact method of how IBA works is still largely unknown, genetic evidence has been found that suggests that IBA may be converted into IAA through a similar process to β-oxidation of fatty acids. The conversion of IBA to IAA then suggests that IBA works as a storage sink for IAA in plants. There is other evidence that suggests that IBA is not converted to IAA but acts as an auxin on its own. == References == == External links == Media related to Indolebutyric acid at Wikimedia Commons",Indolebutyric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01840721070766449)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('IN', -0.38897469639778137), ('DU', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.20153096318244934), ('ĠFOOD', -0.054342884570360184), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10041200369596481)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.20145785808563232), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5759406089782715), (' PERSONAL', -0.20150640606880188), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2070,"('Lamivudine', 'Epivir', 'Zeffix', 'Heptovir', 'Epivir-hbv')",Medical,"Lamivudine, commonly called 3TC, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is also used to treat chronic hepatitis B when other options are not possible. It is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It is typically used in combination with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine, dolutegravir, and abacavir. Lamivudine may be included as part of post-exposure prevention in those who have been potentially exposed to HIV. Lamivudine is taken by mouth as a liquid or tablet. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, feeling tired, and cough. Serious side effects include liver disease, lactic acidosis, and worsening hepatitis B among those already infected. It is safe for people over three months of age and can be used during pregnancy. The medication can be taken with or without food. Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and works by blocking the HIV reverse transcriptase and hepatitis B virus polymerase. Lamivudine was patented in 1995 and approved for use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Lamivudine (Epivir) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV‑1 infection. Lamivudine (Epivir HBV) is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection associated with evidence of hepatitis B viral replication and active liver inflammation. Lamivudine has been used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B at a lower dose than for treatment of HIV/AIDS. It improves the seroconversion of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of lamivudine leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, lamivudine is still used widely as it is well tolerated. === Resistance === In HIV, high level resistance is associated with the M184V/I mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene as reported by Raymond Schinazi's group at Emory University. GlaxoSmithKline claimed that the M184V mutation reduces ""viral fitness"", because of the finding that continued lamivudine treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of lamivudine results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing lamivudine treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is ""less fit"". The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing lamivudine treatment in patients with lamivudine resistance. A better explanation of the data is that lamivudine continues to have a partial anti-viral effect even in the presence of the M184V mutation. In hepatitis B, lamivudine resistance was first described in the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate) locus of the HBV reverse transcriptase gene. The HBV reverse transcriptase gene is 344 amino acids long and occupies codons 349 to 692 on the viral genome. The most commonly encountered resistance mutations are M204V/I/S. The change in amino acid sequence from YMDD to YIDD results in a 3.2 fold reduction in the error rate of the reverse transcriptase, which correlates with a significant growth disadvantage of the virus. Other resistance mutations are L80V/I, V173L and L180M. == Side effects == Minor side effects may include nausea, fatigue, headaches, diarrhea, cough and nasal congestion. Do not prescribe lamivudine/zidovudine, abacavir/lamivudine, or abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine to patients taking emtricitabine. Long-term use of lamivudine can trigger a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. HIV or HBV-infected women on lamivudine are warned to discontinue breastfeeding as this puts the baby at risk for HIV transmission and medication side effects. Patients who are infected with HIV and HCV and are on both interferon and lamivudine can experience liver damage. The drug can trigger an inflammatory response to opportunistic infections (e.g., Mycobacterium avium complex [MAC], M. tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Pneumocystis jirovecii [formerly P. carinii). Autoimmune disorders have been reported and symptoms can occur many months after initiation of the antiretroviral therapy. Use with caution for patients with impaired renal function and do not prescribe this treatment to patients with impaired liver function. == Mechanism of action == Lamivudine is an analogue of cytidine. It can inhibit both types (1 and 2) of HIV reverse transcriptase and also the reverse transcriptase of hepatitis B virus. It is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated. Lamivudine is administered by mouth, and it is rapidly absorbed with a bio-availability of over 80%. Some research suggests that lamivudine can cross the blood–brain barrier. Lamivudine is often given in combination with zidovudine, with which it is highly synergistic. Lamivudine treatment has been shown to restore zidovudine sensitivity of previously resistant HIV. Lamivudine showed no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity in in vivo studies in mice and rats at doses from 10 to 58 times those used in humans. It has a half-life of 5–7 hours in adults and 2 hours in children. == History == Racemic BCH-189 (the minus form is known as lamivudine) was invented by Bernard Belleau while at work at McGill University and Paul Nguyen-Ba at the Montreal-based IAF BioChem International, Inc. laboratories in 1988 and the minus enantiomer isolated in 1989. Samples were first sent to Yung-Chi Cheng of Yale University for study of its toxicity. When used in combination with AZT, he discovered that lamivudine's negative form reduced side effects and increased the drug's efficiency at inhibiting reverse transcriptase. The combination of lamivudine and AZT increased the efficiency at inhibiting an enzyme HIV uses to reproduce its genetic material. As a result, lamivudine was identified as a less toxic agent to mitochondria DNA than other retroviral drugs. Lamivudine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 1995, for use with zidovudine (AZT) and again in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Formulations == Epivir tablets (GlaxoSmithKline; US and UK) for the treatment of HIV Epivir-HBV tablets (GlaxoSmithKline; US only) for the treatment of hepatitis B Zeffix tablets (GlaxoSmithKline; UK only) for the treatment of hepatitis B 3TC tablets (GlaxoSmithKline; South Africa) for the treatment of HIV 3TC-HBV tablets (GlaxoSmithKline; Indonesia) for the treatment of hepatitis B Lamivudine is available in fixed-dose combinations with other HIV drugs such as: Lamivudine/zidovudine (with zidovudine) Abacavir/lamivudine (with abacavir) Abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine (with zidovudine and abacavir) Dolutegravir/lamivudine (with dolutegravir) Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir (with doravirine) == References ==",Heptovir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002926159941125661), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005874100024811924)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3132616877555847), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medbroadcast.com](https://medbroadcast.com/drug/getdrug/heptovir?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=9, title='Heptovir - Uses, Side Effects, Interactions - MedBroadcast.com', type='url_citation', url='https://medbroadcast.com/drug/getdrug/heptovir?utm_source=openai')])"

The present study investigated the effects of Y-39983 on RhoA/ROCK expression during promotion of axonal regeneration using a rat optic nerve crush (ONC) model. Herein, we demonstrated that Y-39983 significantly enhanced the survival and axonal regeneration of RGCs after ONC. Using a pull‑down assay and affinity precipitation to examine the activity of RhoA, we detected the decreased expression of active-RhoA after using Y-39983. The expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2 was significantly decreased as demonstrated by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The downregulation of active-RhoA, ROCK1 and ROCK2 expression by Y-39983 coincided with the appearance of larger numbers of regenerating axons. In conclusion, Y-39983 downregulated the expression of active-RhoA, ROCK1 and ROCK2 during its promotion of axonal regeneration. Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) is a serine/threonine kinase and a major downstream effector of the small GTP-binding protein, Rho. Rho-ROCK triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that controls actin cytoskeleton and is essential for cell motility and adhesion, neurite outgrowth and retraction. In chronic disabling disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), demyelination and axonal damage are the major pathological changes contributing to neurological disability. We investigated the protective effect of a specific ROCK inhibitor, Y-39983, on demyelination and axonal damage in chronic EAE. Western blotting for myelin proteins, electron microscopy and solochrome cyanine staining was performed to evaluate demyelination while neurofilament proteins and cytoskeletal proteins including β-actin and β-tubulin were used to determine axonal damage in a chronic mouse model of EAE treated with Y-39983. Y-39983 significantly suppressed clinical symptoms of EAE and prevented its relapse while increasing the amount of myelin proteins. No significant changes in neurofilaments and cytoskeletal proteins were observed compared with control EAE mice. The inhibition of demyelination by Y-39983 was confirmed by solochrome cyanine staining and electron microscopy. To further study the effect of Y-39983 on demyelination in EAE, we tested three major ROCK substrates, including myosin light chain phosphorylation, LIMK2 and collapsin response mediator protein-2. The activity of these molecules was decreased in EAE animals treated with Y-39983. The inhibitory effect of Y-39983 on demyelination is probably due to the inactivation of ROCK substrates, which are important for neurite outgrowth, growth cone collapse and demyelination of oligodendrocytes. In normotensive eyes, reduced ocular blood flow can lead to glaucoma pathogenesis. Drugs that reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) often cause vasodilation of the ciliary arteries and improve blood flow to the eye. A novel class of drugs called Rho-associated coiled coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors can lower IOP. Therefore, we tested the ability of two ROCK inhibitors, Y-27632 and Y39983, to relax rabbit ciliary arteries. We measured in vitro ciliary artery smooth muscle contractions by isometric tension recordings and changes of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) by fluorescence photometry. Both Y-27632 and Y-39983 induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in rabbit ciliary arteries precontracted with a high-potassium (high-K) solution. The amplitude of relaxation induced by Y-27632 and Y-39983 was not affected by either 100 μM N (G)-nitro-L: -arginine methyl ester (L: -NAME) or 10 μM indomethacin. In Ca(2+)-free solution, Y-27632 and Y-39983 significantly inhibited the transient contraction of ciliary arteries induced by 10 μM histamine. However, neither Y-27632 nor Y-39983 affected the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) induced by high-K solution and histamine. We concluded that Y-27632 and Y-39983 relaxed isolated rabbit ciliary artery segments in vitro.

It is specifically used for hepatitis C genotype 1 and 4. Medications it is used with include sofosbuvir or ribavirin and peginterferon-alfa. Cure rates are in 80s to 90s percent. It may be used in those who also have HIV/AIDS. It is taken by mouth once daily for typically 12 weeks. Common side effects include feeling tired, headache, rash, itchiness, and sensitivity to sunlight. In those with previous hepatitis B infection, active disease may recur. It is not recommended in those with significant liver problems. During pregnancy when used with ribavirin it may cause harm to the baby while when used with sofosbuvir its safety is unclear. Simeprevir is a HCV protease inhibitor. Simeprevir was developed by Medivir AB and Janssen Pharmaceutica. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. It is not available as a generic medication as of 2015. == Medical use == Simeprevir is indicated treating chronic hepatic C (CHC) infection as a part of a triple antiviral treatment regimen consisting of two other drugs: peginterferon-alfa (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). It is primarily effective in treating Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected subjects with compensated liver disease, including cirrhosis. There are currently no studies that show Simeprevir's effectiveness as a single therapy for HCV. Simeprevir is generally used for HCV genotype 1 infected subjects, but off-label medical use has been indicated for type 4 genotype as well. === Dosing === Simeprevir is dosed along with peg-IFN and RBV as triple therapy. Appropriate dosing of Simeprevir is dependent upon the patient's liver function, kidney function, viral load, and HCV genotype. This medication is not recommended for people with moderate or severe liver impairment and people with end-stage kidney disease since Simprevir was not studied for use in these patient populations. Simeprevir might be discontinued depending on their viral load. For instance, if the patient's viral load is detectable (>25 units/mL) during the 4th week of their treatment regimen, it is considered an inadequate treatment and simeprevir must be discontinued. == Contraindications == Any contraindications that apply to peg-IFN and RBV apply to simeprevir since they must be used in combination during treatment of CHC. For example, people with sickle cell anemia are contraindicated to RBV therapy and are therefore contraindicated to simeprevir and peg-IFN combination therapy. Pregnant women and men whose female partners are pregnant are contraindicated for simeprevir since peg-IFN and RBV are known to cause birth defects. === Pregnancy === Simeprevir is avoided in pregnant women or women planning to be pregnant because it going to be taken with RBV and Peg-IFN, which have both shown to cause fetal problems in animal studies. RBV has been shown to cause birth defects and fetal deaths in animal studies. Peg-IFN has been shown to cause abortions in animal studies. People must have a negative pregnancy test prior to starting therapy, use at least two effective birth control methods during treatment, and undergo monthly pregnancy tests. If pregnant women are exposed to any medication regimen containing ribavirin, they are encouraged to report this through the ribavirin pregnancy registry. == Adverse effects == Severe itching (22%), sensitivity to sunlight (5%), and rash (25%) are some of the common adverse effects of simeprevir. Other side effects may include nausea, muscle pain, difficulty breathing and increased bilirubin. It may reactivate hepatitis B in those who have been previously infected. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting simeprevir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation. === Combination treatment === In March 2015, Gilead Sciences e-mailed warnings to health care providers about nine people that began taking its hepatitis C drugs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir along with amiodarone, daclatasvir, or simeprevir developed abnormally slow heartbeats and one died of cardiac arrest. Three required a pacemaker to be inserted. Gilead said the combinations aren't recommended and product labels will be updated. == Mechanism of action == Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor. Simeprevir is a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, thus preventing viral maturation through inhibition of protein synthesis. Simeprevir is administered as one capsule once daily with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 1 or genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C in adult people with compensated liver disease (including cirrhosis), with or without HIV-1 co-infection, who are treatment naive or who have failed previous interferon therapy. Genotype 1 is the most prevalent form of hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide. == Pharmacokinetics == Simeprevir is orally bioavailable. Its absorption increases when taken with food, and is therefore advised to be taken with food. The liver's CYP3A4 enzymes mainly break down simeprevir, but CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 enzymes can also play a role. Its half-life in the plasma is 41 hours in people with HCV. Its peak effect happens 4 to 6 hours after taking the medication. It is primarily excreted into the feces (91%). == Pharmacogenomics == According to simeprevir's prescriber information, its efficacy in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is ""substantially reduced in people with HCV genotype 1a with an NS3 Q80K polymorphism at baseline compared to people infected with HCV genotype 1a without Q80K polymorphism."" People with Q80K polymorphism are not advised to take simeprevir. == Drug interactions == Simeprevir is a CYP3A4 substrate so its plasma concentration will significantly increase if taken with medications that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e. erythromycin, ritonavir) and will significantly decrease if taken with strong CYP3A4 inducers (i.e. efavirenz, rifampin, Saint John's wort). Simeprevir also inhibits intestinal (but not liver) CYP3A. For instance, midazolam, an anticonvulsant, gets metabolized by intestinal CYP3As and taking it with simeprevir can lead to increased midazolam levels that can be toxic. Simeprevir also inhibits OATP1B1/3 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters, which are normally transporters that pump out drug out of the plasma. Thus, taking simeprevir with medications that are substrates for these transporters can lead to increased plasma concentrations of these medications. For example, calcium channel blockers (i.e. diltiazem, amlodipine) are P-gp substrates and can lead to increased concentrations of these drugs when taken with simeprevir. Taking ciclosporin, a substrate for OATP1B1/3, with simeprevir resulted in significant increase in ciclosporin concentration and are therefore not recommended to be taken together. == Approval == In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with peginterferon-alfa and ribavirin for hepatitis C. Simeprevir has been approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection, genotype 1. == Clinical study == Simeprevir has been tested in combination regimens with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin, and in interferon-free regimens with other direct-acting antiviral agents including daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Results from three phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials (C208, C216, and HPC3007) in people with chronic HCV GT1 were favourable and resulted in FDA supporting the approval of simeprevir for Hepatitis C genotype 1. Members of the FDA commented following a presentation by Johnson & Johnson (24 October 2013) that post-marketing studies in racial and ethnic minorities, people co-infected with HIV, and other underrepresented populations are needed. == SARS-CoV-2 research == Several studies have been testing if the virostatic mechanism of FDA approved direct acting agents, including simeprevir in combination with remdesivir (relevant drug during the Ebola epidemic 2014–2016), could be of use in the fight against the global pandemic of Sars-Cov-2. Paritaprevir, another molecule used to treat Hepatitis type C, also showed promising results in terms of binding energy and stability of the complex formed. The advantage of working with such compounds is that they are already FDA approved antivirals, which means that clinical trial phases can be initiated more quickly. The speed of medical response is a critical factor influencing the global consequences of the pandemic; the faster antidotes such as drugs and/ or vaccines are available on a large scale, the more promising is the containment of the disease and its (economic) consequences. Speed is a crucial factor, especially regarding the fight of viruses, which by nature have an extremely high mutation rate. For SARS-CoV-2, simeprevir acts by inhibiting Main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a non-structural protein, essential for viral RNA synthesis. Mpro belongs to the same enzyme class as NS3/4A, the serine proteases. It cleaves the translated polyprotein to form proteins elemental to viral transcription and replication. Remdesivir alone only inhibits the polymerase itself; in order to stop viral synthesis, an approved hepatitis C drug is also administered to stop the spread of the virus. In vitro, the viral infection of Sars-CoV-2 could be stopped, and in addition it could be observed that further proteases of the virus are inhibited, and the effect of the antiviral could thus be enhanced. In this regard, clinical studies proving the efficiency on the organism are still lacking at present, which are required before using the drug combination on a large scale as a form of therapy against a Sars-CoV-2 infection. The hepatitis drugs are considered potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the fight against COVID-19 infection, and the binding affinity and its mechanism, as well as the stability of the complexes formed this way, may serve as a guideline or even template when it comes to designing inhibitors that specifically target this virus. The compounds themselves may also play an important role and shall be studied further in clinical trials. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2016).

We point out the difference between phosphorus and phosphate, with an emphasis on the unit of measure. Expressing a value without the proper name or unit of measure may lead to misunderstanding and erroneous conclusions. We indicate why phosphate must be expressed as milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter and not as milliequivalents per liter. Therefore, we elucidate the distinction among the terms ""phosphorus, phosphorous, and phosphate"" and the importance of saying precisely what one really means. Phosphorus is an essential mineral that is, in the form of inorganic phosphate (Pi), required for building cell membranes, DNA and RNA molecules, energy metabolism, signal transduction and pH buffering. In bone, Pi is essential for bone stability in the form of apatite. Intestinal absorption of dietary Pi depends on its bioavailability and has two distinct modes of active transcellular and passive paracellular absorption. Active transport is transporter mediated and partly regulated, while passive absorption depends mostly on bioavailability. Renal excretion controls systemic Pi levels, depends on transporters in the proximal tubule and is highly regulated. Deposition and release of Pi into and from soft tissues and bone has to be tightly controlled. The endocrine network coordinating intestinal absorption, renal excretion and bone turnover integrates dietary intake and metabolic requirements with renal excretion and is critical for bone stability and cardiovascular health during states of hypophosphataemia or hyperphosphataemia as evident from inborn or acquired diseases.

2078,"('Eplerenone', 'Epoxymexrenone', 'Inspra', 'Selara', 'Epleremone')",Medical,"Eplerenone, sold under the brand name Inspra, is an aldosterone antagonist type of potassium-sparing diuretic that is used to treat chronic heart failure and high blood pressure, particularly for people with resistant hypertension due to elevated aldosterone. It is a steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone group and a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist (SARA). == Medical uses == === Heart failure === Eplerenone reduces risk of death in patients with heart failure, particularly in patients with recent myocardial infarction (heart attack). === Hypertension === Eplerenone lowers blood pressure in patients with primary hypertension. Eplerenone also reduces arterial stiffness and vascular endothelial dysfunction. For persons with resistant hypertension, eplerenone is safe and effective for reducing blood pressure, particularly in persons with resistant hypertension due to hyperaldosteronism. === Central serous chorioretinopathy === Eplerenone is often prescribed for people with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). However, the most recent and largest randomized controlled trial showed that eplerenone has no significant effect on chronic CSC that has been untreated for four months. There was one relatively large prospective, interventional case-control study that was tested in acute CSC that showed improved resolution of subretinal fluid in treatment group vs observational group (which is standard of care) with 45% resolution at end of 1st month, 55% at end of 2nd month, and 62% at end of 3rd month (vs 10%, 21%, and 31% in standard of care group). Study also showed faster resolution of visual acuity at the end of each month with 92% and 100% in the first two months vs 74% and 86% with resolution reaching 100% after the third month in standard of care group. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of eplerenone include: hyperkalaemia, hypotension, dizziness, and reduced renal clearance. Eplerenone may have a lower incidence than spironolactone of sexual side effects such as feminization, gynecomastia, impotence, low sex drive and reduction of size of male genitalia. This is because other antimineralocorticoids have structural elements of the progesterone molecule, causing progestogenic and antiandrogenic outcomes. When considering taking these medicines, it is important to note the variations in their ability to offset the nongenomic effects of aldosterone. Currently, there is not enough evidence available from the randomized controlled trials on side effects of eplerenone to do a benefit versus risk assessment in people with primary hypertension. === Interactions === Eplerenone is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Thus the potential exists for adverse drug interactions with other drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4. Specifically, the concomitant use of the CYP3A4 potent inhibitors ketoconazole and itraconazole is contraindicated. Other CYP3A4 inhibitors including erythromycin, saquinavir, and verapamil should be used with caution. Other drugs that increase potassium concentrations may increase the risk of hyperkalemia associated with eplerenone therapy, including salt substitutes, potassium supplements and other potassium-sparing diuretics. == Pharmacology == Eplerenone is an antimineralocorticoid, or an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Eplerenone is also known chemically as 9,11α-epoxy-7α-methoxycarbonyl-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21,17-carbolactone and ""was derived from spironolactone by the introduction of a 9α,11α-epoxy bridge and by substitution of the 17α-thoacetyl group of spironolactone with a carbomethoxy group."" The drug controls high blood pressure by blocking the binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in epithelial tissues, such as the kidney. Blocking the action of aldosterone decreases blood volume and lowers blood pressure. It has 10- to 20-fold lower affinity for the MR relative to spironolactone, and is less potent in vivo as an antimineralocorticoid. However, in contrast to spironolactone, eplerenone has little affinity for the androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors. It also has more consistently observed non-genomic antimineralocorticoid effects relative to spironolactone (see membrane mineralocorticoid receptor). Eplerenone differs from spironolactone in its extensive metabolism, with a short half-life and inactive metabolites. Eplerenone seems to be about 50 to 75% as potent as spironolactone as an antimineralocorticoid. Hence, 25 mg/day spironolactone may be equivalent to approximately 50 mg/day eplerenone. == Society and culture == Eplerenone was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. Eplerenone is approved for sale in Canada, the US, the EU, Netherlands, and Japan. === Economics === Eplerenone costs an estimated $2.93 per day when treating congestive heart failure and $5.86 per day when treating hypertension. === Brand names === In the US, Inspra is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == References ==",Inspra,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.1470757676288486e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013100242358632386)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/inspra.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eplerenone,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00700 ', [])"

2080,"('Cyclobenzaprine (hydrochloride)', 'Cyclobenzaprine', 'Proheptatriene', 'Proheptatrien', 'Proeptatriene')",Medical,"Cyclobenzaprine, sold under several brand names including, historically, Flexeril, is a muscle relaxer used for muscle spasms from musculoskeletal conditions of sudden onset. It is not useful in cerebral palsy. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, feeling tired, dizziness, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include an irregular heartbeat. There is no evidence of harm in pregnancy, but it has not been well studied in this population. It should not be used together with MAOIs. How it works is unclear. In any case, it is known to inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and to block serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Chemically, it is very similar to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline. Cyclobenzaprine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available by prescription as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 45th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. It was not available in the United Kingdom as of 2012. == Medical uses == Cyclobenzaprine is used, in conjunction with physical therapy, to treat muscle spasms that occur because of acute musculoskeletal conditions. After sustaining an injury, muscle spasms occur to stabilize the affected body part, which may increase pain to prevent further damage. Cyclobenzaprine is used to treat such muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It decreases pain in the first two weeks, peaking in the first few days, but has no proven benefit after two weeks. Since no benefit is proven beyond that, therapy should not be continued long-term. It is the best-studied muscle relaxer. It is not useful for spasticity due to neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy. It may also be used along with other treatments for tetanus. === Comparison to other medications === Cyclobenzaprine has been found not to be inferior to tizanidine, orphenadrine, and carisoprodol in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none have been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines. However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and ataxia are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics. In a study on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain treatment with cyclobenzaprine alone or in combination with ibuprofen, no significant differences in pain scores were noted among the three treatment groups. Peak benefit was found to occur on day seven of the treatment for all groups. == Side effects == Cyclobenzaprine results in increased rates of drowsiness (38%), dry mouth (24%), and dizziness (10%). Drowsiness and dry mouth appear to intensify with increasing dose. The sedative effects of cyclobenzaprine are likely due to its antagonistic effect on histamine, serotonin, and muscarinic receptors. Agitation is a common side effect observed, especially in the elderly. Some experts believe that cyclobenzaprine should be avoided in elderly patients because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment. In general, the National Committee for Quality Assurance recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects. Dysphagia, a life-threatening side-effect, may rarely occur. Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related tricyclic, such as tricyclic antidepressants. == Overdose == The most common effects of overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia. Rare but potentially critical complications are cardiac arrest, abnormal heart rhythms, severe low blood pressure, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Life-threatening overdose is rare, however, as the median lethal dose is about 338 milligrams/kilogram in mice and 425 mg/kg in rats. The potential harm is increased when central nervous system depressants and antidepressants are also used; deliberate overdose often includes other drugs. == Interactions == Cyclobenzaprine has major contraindications with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). At least one study also found increased risk of serotonin syndrome when cyclobenzaprine was taken with the serotonergic drugs duloxetine or phenelzine. These substances may interact with cyclobenzaprine: Central nervous system depressants (e.g. alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, phenothiazines, carbamates, barbiturates, major tranquilizers) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors taken within two weeks of cyclobenzaprine may result in serious, life-threatening side effects. Cyclobenzaprine may affect the medications used in surgical sedation and some surgeons request that patients temporarily discontinue its use prior to surgery. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with a chemical structure that is very similar to those of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. Its known actions include serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism, α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, histamine H1 receptor noncompetitive antagonism, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism. In terms of its antimuscarinic activity, it is said to be an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, and M3 receptors, but not of the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 or M5 receptor. The mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine as a muscle relaxant is unknown. However, it may work through modulating the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. The antihistamine activity of cyclobenzaprine is thought to play a major role in its sedative effects. Similarly to tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine shows antidepressant-like effects in animals. === Pharmacokinetics === Cyclobenzaprine has an oral bioavailability of about 55% and approximately 93% is bound to proteins in plasma. Its metabolite norcyclobenzaprine (NCBP) is active. The elimination half-life of cyclobenzaprine is 18 hours and it has a clearance of 0.7 L/min. == Chemistry == Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic compound of the dibenzocycloheptene group. It is very similar in chemical structure to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine, which are likewise dibenzocycloheptenes. Cyclobenzaprine differs from amitriptyline in structure only by the presence of a single double bond within the tricyclic ring system. == Society and culture == === Formulations === By mouth, cyclobenzaprine is marketed as Apo-Cyclobenzaprine, Fexmid, Flexeril and Novo-Cycloprine. It is available in generic form. A once-a-day, extended-release formulation, Amrix, is available. Cyclobenzaprine is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical creams. == Research == === Fibromyalgia === A 2004 review found benefit for fibromyalgia symptoms, with a reported number needed to treat of 4.8 (meaning that 1 person out of every 4.8 benefits from treatment) for pain reduction, but no change in fatigue or tender points. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to justify its use in myofascial pain syndrome. Two Phase 3 clinical trials reported that an experimental sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102 SL, was able to reduce pain and improve sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia. The RESILIENT trial reported significant reductions in daily pain and improvements in various fibromyalgia symptoms, including fatigue and depressive symptoms, compared to placebo. A separate Phase 3 clinical trial evaluated TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reported the drug did not provide a sustained, significant improvement in overall PTSD severity, but it did demonstrate improvements in sleep quality during the 12-week trial. == References == == External links ==",Proeptatriene,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.011073877103626728)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.20209650695323944), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062200531363487244)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB1116384.htm,https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/data/drug/details/d01khh ', [])"
