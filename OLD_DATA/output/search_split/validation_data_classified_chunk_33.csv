3270,"('Rizatriptan (benzoate)', 'Mk 462', 'Rizatriptan', 'Risatriptan', 'Mk 462 free base')",Medical,"Rizatriptan, sold under the brand name Maxalt among others, is a medication used for the treatment of migraine headaches. It is taken by mouth. It can also be applied on the tongue. It is a serotonin (5-HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist (triptan). Common side effects include chest pain, dizziness, dry mouth, and tingling. Other side effects may include myocardial infarction, stroke, high blood pressure, serotonin syndrome, and anaphylaxis. Excessive use may result in medication overuse headaches. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended within 24 hours after taking a dose. Rizatriptan is in the triptan class and is believed to work by activating the 5-HT1 receptor. Rizatriptan was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 190th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Rizatriptan is available in combination with meloxicam as meloxicam/rizatriptan. == Medical uses == Rizatriptan is indicated to treat acute migraine attacks with or without aura. It does not prevent future migraine attacks. A 2010 review found rizatriptan to be more efficacious and tolerable than sumatriptan. == Contraindications == Rizatriptan and other triptans can cause vasoconstriction, they are contraindicated in people with cardiovascular conditions. == Adverse effects == Frequent adverse effects (incidence less than 10%) are dizziness, drowsiness, asthenia/fatigue, and nausea. Clinical adverse experiences were typically mild and short-lasting (2–3 hours). == Interactions == Propranolol == Mechanism of action == Rizatriptan acts as an agonist at serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Like the other triptans sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, rizatriptan induces vasoconstriction—possibly by inhibiting the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory neurons in the trigeminal nerve. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Rizalt, Rizalt RPD, Rizact (India), Rizafilm, Maxalt, and Maxalt-MLT. == References ==",Rizatriptan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.986990567587782e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002101439022226259)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601109.html,https://www.drugs.com/mtm/rizatriptan.html,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/rizatriptan-oral-route/description/drg-20065868 ', [])"
3271,"('Erythromycin', 'Erythromycin a', 'E-mycin', 'Erythrocin', 'Abomacetin')",Medical,"Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis. It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn, and to improve delayed stomach emptying. It can be given intravenously and by mouth. An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn. Common side effects include abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin also appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding, its use by the mother during the first two weeks of life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family of antibiotics and works by decreasing bacterial protein production. Erythromycin was first isolated in 1952 from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 271st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Erythromycin can be used to treat bacteria responsible for causing infections of the skin and upper respiratory tract, including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus and Corynebacterium genera. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae: 0.015 to 256 μg/ml Staphylococcus aureus: 0.023 to 1024 μg/ml Streptococcus pyogenes: 0.004 to 256 μg/ml Corynebacterium minutissimum: 0.015 to 64 μg/ml It may be useful in treating gastroparesis due to this promotility effect. It has been shown to improve feeding intolerances in those who are critically ill. Intravenous erythromycin may also be used in endoscopy to help clear stomach contents to enhance endoscopic visualization, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and subsequent management. === Available forms === Erythromycin is available in enteric-coated tablets, slow-release capsules, oral suspensions, ophthalmic solutions, ointments, gels, enteric-coated capsules, non enteric-coated tablets, non enteric-coated capsules, and injections. The following erythromycin combinations are available for oral dosage: erythromycin base (capsules, tablets) erythromycin estolate (capsules, oral suspension, tablets), contraindicated during pregnancy erythromycin ethylsuccinate (oral suspension, tablets) erythromycin stearate (oral suspension, tablets) For injection, the available combinations are: erythromycin gluceptate erythromycin lactobionate For ophthalmic use: erythromycin base (ointment) == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are very common because erythromycin is a motilin agonist. More serious side effects include arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals, including torsades de pointes, and reversible deafness. Allergic reactions range from urticaria to anaphylaxis. Cholestasis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome are some other rare side effects that may occur. Studies have shown evidence both for and against the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) has been linked to an increased probability of pyloric stenosis in young infants. Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Erythromycin estolate has been associated with reversible hepatotoxicity in pregnant women in the form of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and is not recommended during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations. It can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares, and night sweats. == Interactions == Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily. The activity of the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g., dexamethasone), which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, including erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor) — are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels and the potential for rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated. Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Interactions with theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, were also shown. Erythromycin and doxycycline can have a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency than the sum of the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately. It may alter the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills because of its effect on the gut flora. A review found that when erythromycin was given with certain oral contraceptives, there was an increase in the maximum serum concentrations and AUC of estradiol and dienogest. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means it can have a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Erythromycin displays bacteriostatic activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited. Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action. Erythromycin increases gut motility by binding to motilin receptor, thus it is a motilin receptor agonist in addition to its antimicrobial properties. It can be therefore administered intravenously as a stomach emptying stimulant. === Pharmacokinetics === Erythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or esters, such as erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of erythromycin are released. === Metabolism === Most of erythromycin is metabolised by demethylation in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%–15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5–2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food. Erythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk. The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding. Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients. == Chemistry == === Composition === Standard-grade erythromycin is primarily composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can be present in varying amounts and can differ by lot. Erythromycin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity, followed by erythromycin B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as erythromycin A. Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually. === Synthesis === Over the three decades after the discovery of erythromycin A and its activity as an antimicrobial, many attempts were made to synthesize it in the laboratory. The presence of 10 stereogenic carbons and several points of distinct substitution has made the total synthesis of erythromycin A a formidable task. Complete syntheses of erythromycins’ related structures and precursors such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B have been accomplished, giving way to possible syntheses of different erythromycins and other macrolide antimicrobials. Woodward successfully completed the synthesis of erythromycin A, which was published in 1981. == History == In 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer at Eli Lilly. Aguilar managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of Streptomyces erythreus (designation changed to Saccharopolyspora erythraea) found in the samples. Aguilar received no further credit or compensation for his discovery. The scientist was allegedly promised a trip to the company's manufacturing plant in Indianapolis, but it was never fulfilled. In a letter to the company's president, Aguilar wrote: “A leave of absence is all I ask as I do not wish to sever my connection with a great company which has given me wonderful breaks in life.” The request was not granted. Aguilar reached out to Eli Lilly again in 1993, requesting royalties from sales of the drug over the years, intending to use them to put up a foundation for poor and sickly Filipinos. This request was also denied. He died in September of the same year. Lilly filed for patent protection on the compound which was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the Philippine region of Iloilo where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin. The antibiotic clarithromycin was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin. == Society and culture == === Economics === It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, in 2014, the price increased to seven dollars per 500mg tablet. The US price of erythromycin rose three times between 2010 and 2015, from 24 cents per 500mg tablet in 2010 to $8.96 in 2015. In 2017, a Kaiser Health News study found that the per-unit cost of dozens of generics doubled or even tripled from 2015 to 2016, increasing spending by the Medicaid program. Due to price increases by drug manufacturers, Medicaid paid on average $2,685,330 more for Erythromycin in 2016 compared to 2015 (not including rebates). In the US by 2018, generic drug prices had climbed another 5% on average. The UK price listed in the BNF for erythromycin 500mg tablets was £36.40 for 100 tablets (36.4 pence each) as of August 2024. This price is not paid by NHS patients: there is no NHS prescription charge in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; while NHS patients in England without an exemption are liable for a flat rate prescription charge. As of May 2024, that charge was £9.90 for each prescribed medicine. === Brand names === Brand names include Robimycin, E-Mycin, E.E.S. Granules, E.E.S.-200, E.E.S.-400, E.E.S.-400 Filmtab, Erymax, Ery-Tab, Eryc, Ranbaxy, Erypar, EryPed, Eryped 200, Eryped 400, Erythrocin Stearate Filmtab, Erythrocot, E-Base, Erythroped, Ilosone, MY-E, Pediamycin, Zineryt, Abboticin, Abboticin-ES, Erycin, PCE Dispertab, Stiemycine, Acnasol, and Tiloryth. == Veterinary uses == Erythromycin is also used in fishcare for the ""broad spectrum treatment and control of bacterial disease"". Body slime, mouth fungus, furunculosis, bacterial gill illness, and hemorrhagic septicaemia are all examples of bacterial diseases in fish that may be treated and controlled with this therapy. The usage of Erythromycin in fishcare is mainly limited to therapies targeting gram-positive bacteria. == References ==",Abomacetin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02976691536605358)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.12807849049568176), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10305195301771164)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0485873706638813)])","('MEDICAL; ([lktlabs.com](https://lktlabs.com/product/erythromycin/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Erythromycin - LKT Labs', type='url_citation', url='https://lktlabs.com/product/erythromycin/?utm_source=openai')])"

It has been shown to increase the secretion of several hormones including GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and produces sustained increases in the plasma levels of these hormones while also raising cortisol levels. == Effect on lean mass == Ibutamoren has been shown to sustain activation of the GH–IGF-1 axis, increasing growth hormone secretion by up to 97%, and to increase lean body mass with no change in total fat mass or visceral fat. It is under investigation as a potential treatment for reduced levels of these hormones, such as in children or elderly adults with growth hormone deficiency, and human studies have shown it to increase both muscle mass and bone mineral density, making it a promising potential therapy for the treatment of frailty in the elderly.

3275,"('Methylergometrine (maleate)', 'Methylergonovine maleate', 'Ryegonovin', 'Spametrin f', 'Methylergonovine')",Medical,"Methylergometrine, also known as methylergonovine and sold under the brand name Methergine, is a medication of the ergoline and lysergamide groups which is used as an oxytocic in obstetrics and as an antimigraine agent in the treatment of migraine headaches. It reportedly produces psychedelic effects similar to those of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at high doses. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Obstetric use === Methylergometrine is a smooth muscle constrictor that mostly acts on the uterus. It is most commonly used to prevent or control excessive bleeding following childbirth and spontaneous or elective abortion, and also to aid in expulsion of retained products of conception after a missed abortion (miscarriage in which all or part of the fetus remains in the uterus) and to help deliver the placenta after childbirth. It is available as tablets or injection (IM or IV) or in liquid form to be taken orally. === Migraine === Methylergometrine is sometimes used for both prevention and acute treatment of migraine. It is an active metabolite of methysergide. In the treatment of cluster headaches, methylergometrine has been initiated at a dose of 0.2 mg/day, rapidly increased to 0.2 mg three times per day, and increased to a maximum of 0.4 mg three times per day. == Contraindications == Methylergometrine is contraindicated in patients with hypertension and pre-eclampsia. It is also contraindicated in HIV positive patients taking protease inhibitors, delavirdine, and efavirenz (which is also an agonist at the 5-HT2A–mGlu2 receptor protomer and increases the chances of a patient experiencing hallucinations during methylergometrine therapy). == Side effects == Adverse effects include: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Dizziness Pulmonary hypertension Coronary artery vasoconstriction Severe systemic hypertension (especially in patients with pre-eclampsia) Convulsions In excessive doses, methylergometrine can also lead to cramping, respiratory depression and coma. == Interactions == Methylergometrine likely interacts with drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics and many HIV drugs. It can also increase constriction of blood vessels caused by sympathomimetic drugs and other ergot alkaloids. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Methylergometrine is an agonist or antagonist to serotonin, dopamine, and α-adrenergic receptors. Its specific binding and activation pattern on these receptors leads to a highly, if not completely, specific contraction of smooth uterus muscle via serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, while blood vessels are affected to a lesser extent compared to other ergot alkaloids. It has been found to interact with the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Methylergometrine is a synthetic analogue of ergometrine, a psychedelic alkaloid found in ergot, and many species of morning glory. Methylergometrine is a member of the ergoline family and chemically similar to LSD, ergine, ergometrine, and lysergic acid. According to Jonathan Ott, methylergometrine produces LSD-like psychedelic effects at doses of 2 mg and above. This can be attributed to due to its agonistic action at the 5-HT2A–mGlu2 receptor protomers. Clinical efficacy occurs around 200 μg, ten times lower than the hallucinogenic threshold. Methylergometrine is an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor and may be linked to cardiac valvulopathy. == Chemistry == Methylergometrine, also known as d-lysergic acid 1-butanolamide, is a derivative of the ergoline and lysergamide classes and is structurally related to ergometrine (d-lysergic acid β-propanolamide) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). == References ==",Methylergonovine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.079655122448457e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007165487040765584)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601077.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Methylergonovine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601077.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include pain at the area of injection, rash, nausea, fever, and trouble sleeping. Severe allergic reactions may occasionally occur. It is generally safe to use during pregnancy. It may be used by those who are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins. It is in the aminocyclitol class of drugs and works by stopping the making of protein by certain bacteria. Spectinomycin was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not available in the United States for human use. It is made from the bacterium Streptomyces spectabilis. == Medical uses == It is given by intramuscular injection to treat gonorrhea, especially in patients who are allergic to penicillins. This antibiotic is no longer available in the United States for human use, but is still available for veterinary use. == Side effects == Side effects include itching, chills, stomach ache, and red rash. == Mechanism of action == Spectinomycin binds to the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and interrupts protein synthesis. One form of resistance has emerged in the 16S ribosomal RNA in Pasteurella multocida. == Biosynthetic mechanism == Biosynthesis of spectinomycin begins similarly to the aminoglycosides, with the formation of an inositol ring. The difference is the initial modification that forms the inositol ring of spectinomycin. The process begins with a glucose-6-phosphate (1a), which is oxidized by NAD+ to form a ketone at C2 (2a). This ketone is then formed into a primary amine group through pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and glutamine transamination (3a). This process is repeated again at C4 to form a second primary amine (4a). Once these two amines are present, the glucose ring is ready to be methylated through two S-adenosyl methionine molecules (5a). With this methylation, the glucose ring is finally ready to be converted into an inositol ring through inositol cyclase (6a). This can then be hydrolyzed to get rid of the phosphate group, making the inositol ring necessary for spectinomycin (7a). While all this happens, an alternate pathway is occurring creating the sugar functional group from a similar starting product. In this pathway, glucose-1-phosphate is used as the starting product (1b). This is converted into a TDP-glucose through TDP synthase (2b). TDP glucose then has the hydroxyl removed from C6 through a hydratase enzyme (3b), which is then reduced through NADH at C4 creating a new product (4b). With this ketone present, PLP and glutamine can come in to convert it to a primary amine (5b) which can then be removed through a deaminase (6b). This conversion to 6b is also accompanied by a double reduction at C4 and C3 through two more NADH molecules, giving the final product necessary to form the aminoglycoside. With this, products 7a and 6b can come together, removing the TDP functional group and combining with the sugar molecule to form the aminoglycoside spectinomycin. === Nature === It is in aminocyclitol class, closely related to the aminoglycosides. Spectinomycin is industrially produced by fermentation of the bacterium Streptomyces spectabilis. Spectinomycin is produced in nature by many organisms including cyanobacteria and various plant species. It is present in the genome or plastome of many plastids as the spc operon, which is usually two to 10 genes long. The difference in size may be due to the elimination of obsolete genes or the takeover of its function by nuclear genes. Spectinomycin is mainly produced by organisms as a defence mechanism against predators. == History == Spectinomycin was discovered 1961.

Erythrite and annabergite, chemical formula Ni3(AsO4)2•8H2O, or nickel arsenate form a complete series with the general formula (Co,Ni)3(AsO4)2•8H2O. Erythrite crystallizes in the monoclinic system and forms prismatic crystals. The color is crimson to pink and occurs as a secondary coating known as cobalt bloom on cobalt arsenide minerals. Well-formed crystals are rare, with most of the mineral manifesting in crusts or small reniform aggregates. Erythrite was first described in 1832 for an occurrence in Grube Daniel, Schneeberg, Saxony, and takes its name from the Greek έρυθρος (erythros), meaning red. Historically, erythrite itself has not been an economically important mineral, but the prospector may use it as a guide to associated cobalt and native silver. Erythrite occurs as a secondary mineral in the oxide zone of Co–Ni–As bearing mineral deposits. It occurs in association with cobaltite, skutterudite, symplesite, roselite-beta, scorodite, pharmacosiderite, adamite, morenosite, retgersite, and malachite. Notable localities are Cobalt, Ontario; La Cobaltera, Chile, Schneeberg, Saxony, Germany; Joachimsthal, Czech Republic; Cornwall, England; Bou Azzer, Morocco; the Blackbird mine, Lemhi County, Idaho; Sara Alicia mine, near Alamos, Sonora, Mexico; Mt. Cobalt, Queensland and the Dome Rock copper mine, Mingary, South Australia. == Other varieties == The nickel variety, annabergite, occurs as a light green nickel bloom on nickel arsenides.

3281,"('Estradiol (cypionate)', 'Estradiol cypionate', 'Depofemin', 'Depoestradiol', 'Depo-estradiol')",Medical,"Estradiol cypionate (EC), sold under the brand name Depo-Estradiol among others, is an estrogen medication which is used in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low estrogen levels in women, in hormone therapy for trans women, and in hormonal birth control for women. It is given by injection into muscle once every 1 to 4 weeks. Side effects of estradiol cypionate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol cypionate is an estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. Estradiol cypionate is an estrogen ester and a long-lasting prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol cypionate was first described as well as introduced for medical use in 1952. Along with estradiol valerate, it is one of the most commonly used esters of estradiol. Estradiol cypionate has mostly been used in the United States, but is also marketed in a few other countries. The medication is not available in Europe. It is not currently available as a generic medication in the United States. == Medical uses == The medical uses of estradiol cypionate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the drug include hormone therapy and hormonal contraception. In regard to the latter, estradiol cypionate has been used in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate as a combined injectable contraceptive. Along with estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and estradiol benzoate, estradiol cypionate is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. The medication has been used to induce puberty in girls with delayed puberty due to hypogonadism. Estradiol cypionate is usually used at a dosage of 1 to 5 mg by intramuscular injection every 3 to 4 weeks in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy, at a dosage of 1.5 to 2 mg by intramuscular injection once a month in the treatment of female hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, and at a dosage of 2 to 10 mg by intramuscular injection once every 1 or 2 weeks for hormone therapy in transgender women. The doses used to induce puberty in girls are 0.2 to 2.5 mg per month, gradually increased over a period of 4 years. === Available forms === Estradiol cypionate is and has been available as an oil solution for intramuscular injection provided in vials and ampoules at concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 mg/mL (and containing 5, 10, 15, 25, or 50 mg estradiol cypionate total). The 1 and 3 mg/mL concentrations (containing 5 and 15 mg estradiol cypionate total) have been discontinued in the United States, but the 5 mg/mL concentration (containing 25 mg estradiol cypionate total) remains available. Aside from estradiol cypionate, the only other injectable estrogen formulations that remain available in the United States are estradiol valerate (10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, and 40 mg/mL in oil) and conjugated estrogens (25 mg/vial in solution). In addition to single-drug formulations, estradiol cypionate has been marketed in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension (brand name Lunelle) and in combination with testosterone cypionate as an oil solution (brand name Depo-Testadiol). == Contraindications == Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. == Side effects == The side effects of estradiol cypionate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, vomiting, bloating, edema, headache, migraine, and melasma. High-dose estrogen therapy with estradiol cypionate injections may also cause an increased risk of thromboembolism, changes in blood lipid profile, increased insulin resistance, and increased levels of prolactin. == Overdose == Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Estradiol cypionate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. The affinity of estradiol valerate for the estrogen receptor has been reported to be 50 times less than that of estradiol, and estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate have been found to possess similar affinity for the estrogen receptor. Both estradiol cypionate and estradiol valerate are rapidly cleaved into estradiol in the body, and estradiol valerate has been found to be unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance. As such, estradiol valerate is regarded as essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol, and estradiol cypionate is described as a prodrug of estradiol similarly. Estradiol cypionate is of about 46% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C17β cypionate ester, and contains about 69% of the amount of estradiol by weight. Because estradiol cypionate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. ==== Effects on liver protein synthesis ==== A study compared the combination of 5 mg estradiol cypionate and 25 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate as a combined injectable contraceptive (which has been associated with peak estradiol levels of around 300 pg/mL) with an ethinylestradiol-containing combined birth control pill and found that whereas the birth control pill produced significant changes in coagulation parameters, there were no significant prothrombotic effects of the combined injectable contraceptive on levels of fibrinogen, factors VII and X, plasminogen, or the activated prothrombin time. As such, it appears that similarly to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, combined injectable contraceptives with 5 mg estradiol cypionate and 25 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate have less or no procoagulant effect relative to combined birth control pills. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Intramuscular injection ==== In contrast to oral administration, which is associated with very low bioavailability (<10%), the bioavailability of both estradiol and estradiol esters like estradiol valerate is complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection. In addition, estradiol esters like estradiol cypionate and estradiol valerate when given as an injection of oil solution or microcrystalline aqueous suspension have a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular depot from which they are slowly released and absorbed. Upon intramuscular injection of estradiol cypionate in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary microcrystalline depot is formed within the muscle at the site of injection. In addition, a secondary depot may be formed in adipose tissue. The slow release of estradiol cypionate from the tissue depot is caused by the high lipophilicity of the estradiol ester, which in turn is due to its long fatty acid cypionic acid ester moiety. Estradiol cypionate is formulated for use alone and in combination with testosterone cypionate as an oil solution, and for use in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension. Aqueous suspensions of steroid esters generally have longer durations by intramuscular injection than oil solutions. A single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol cypionate has been found to result in peak circulating concentrations of 338 pg/mL estradiol and 145 pg/mL estrone, which occurred at about 4 and 5 days post-injection, respectively (see right table). Compared to two other commonly used estradiol esters (which were also assessed in the study), estradiol cypionate had the longest duration, at approximately 11 days, whereas estradiol benzoate and estradiol valerate were found to last for 4 to 5 days and 7 to 8 days, respectively. This is because estradiol cypionate has a more extensive fatty acid chain and in relation to this is comparatively more lipophilic. For a given estradiol ester, the longer or more extensive the fatty acid chain is, the more lipophilic, longer-lasting, and more uniform/plateau-like the resultant levels of estradiol are as well as the lower the peak/maximal levels are (and hence less spike-like). Estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate (brand names Lunelle, Cyclofem) is a combined injectable contraceptive containing 5 mg estradiol cypionate and 25 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate in microcrystalline aqueous suspension for once-monthly intramuscular administration. With this formulations, estradiol levels peak 2 to 3 days post-injection with average maximal circulating levels of about 250 pg/mL. The elimination half-life of estradiol with these formulations is 8.4 to 10.1 days, and circulating estradiol levels return to a baseline of about 50 pg/mL approximately 14 to 24 days post-injection. ==== Subcutaneous injection ==== Estradiol cypionate in a microcrystalline aqueous suspension has been found to have equivalent effectiveness and virtually identical pharmacokinetics when administered by subcutaneous injection versus intramuscular injection. However, subcutaneous injection is considered to be easier and less painful relative to intramuscular injection, and for these reasons, may result in comparatively greater satisfaction and compliance. == Chemistry == Estradiol cypionate is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C17β cyclopentylpropionate (cypionate) fatty acid ester of estradiol. It is also known as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-cyclopentylpropionate. Other common esters of estradiol in use include estradiol valerate, estradiol enantate, and estradiol acetate, the former two of which are C17β esters of estradiol similarly to estradiol cypionate and the latter of which is the C3 acetate ester of estradiol. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol cypionate is 6.9. == History == Estradiol cypionate was patented by Upjohn in 1952, with a priority date of 1951. It was first introduced for medical use by Upjohn in 1952 under the brand name Depo-Estradiol in the United States. Subsequently, it was also marketed in other countries such as European countries and Japan. The first clinical reports of estradiol cypionate were published in 1952 and thereafter. It was initially known as estradiol cyclopentylpropionate (ECP), and did not become known as estradiol cypionate until over a decade later in the mid-to-late 1960s. Along with estradiol valerate (1954) and estradiol benzoate (1933), estradiol cypionate has become one of the most commonly used esters of estradiol. When estradiol cypionate was to be combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate as a once-a-month injectable contraceptive, there was a problem in that estradiol cypionate was prepared as an oil solution while medroxyprogesterone acetate was used as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension. This issue was resolved by switching to a microcrystalline aqueous suspension in the case of estradiol cypionate, allowing it to be combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate in a single suspension. As a result, single-drug preparations of estradiol cypionate are oil solutions, while the combination of estradiol cypionate and medroxyprogesterone acetate are microcrystalline aqueous suspensions. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Estradiol cypionate is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. It is also known as estradiol cyclopentylpropionate (ECP). === Brand names === Estradiol cypionate has been marketed under the brand names Cicloestradiolo, D-Est, depGynogen, Depo-Estradiol, Depoestra, Depofemin, Depogen, Dura-Estrin, E-Cypionate, E-Ionate, Estradep, Estro-Cyp, Estrofem, Estroject, Estromed-PA, Estronol, Femovirin, Neoginon Depositum, Oestradiol-Retard, Pertradiol, Spendepiol, and T-E Cypionate, among others. === Availability === Estradiol cypionate is available in the United States. It was previously marketed in Spain and Italy, but was discontinued in these countries and is no longer available in Europe. Estradiol cypionate has mostly been used in the United States, similarly to testosterone cypionate, with both of these medications having been developed by Upjohn, an American pharmaceutical company. Besides the United States, estradiol cypionate has been marketed in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan, among other countries. Estradiol cypionate for human use is not available in Canada, although it is marketed in several veterinary formulations in this country. Estradiol cypionate is available in Taiwan in combination with testosterone cypionate. It is also available as a combined injectable contraceptive in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate in at least 18 countries, mostly in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Estradiol cypionate/testosterone cypionate and estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate were both formerly marketed in the United States, but have been discontinued in this country. == See also == Estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate Estradiol cypionate/testosterone cypionate == References ==",Depofemin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.3603161025675945e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01416744478046894)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0001234428636962548)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.iranhormone.ir](https://en.iranhormone.ir/product/depofem-255mg-0-5ml/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='Depofem 25+5mg/0.5ml - Iran Hormon Pharmaceutical Company', type='url_citation', url='https://en.iranhormone.ir/product/depofem-255mg-0-5ml/?utm_source=openai')])"

By stimulating the production of these interferons, cridanimod enhances the immune system's ability to combat viral infections and reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. == Clinical efficacy == Several studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of cridanimod in treating viral infections. In the context of respiratory infections, cridanimod has been shown to significantly reduce the duration and intensity of symptoms such as fever and to decrease the incidence of complications like pneumonia. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, cridanimod was found to increase the chances of recovery and reduce the frequency of recurrent exacerbations in otorhinolaryngologic diseases by 25%. Additionally, its use in children and adults with viral respiratory diseases has been associated with a more than five-fold increase in the probability of avoiding severe disease outcomes. == Applications in other infections == Beyond respiratory infections, cridanimod has been used effectively in the treatment of HIV and herpes infections.

Triiodothyroacetic acid is also a physiologic thyroid hormone that is present in the normal organism in low concentrations. Tiratricol is an analogue of a naturally circulating metabolite of the active thyroid hormone T3. MCT8 is a specific thyroid hormone transporter. While T3 and T4 thyroid hormones rely on MCT8 to enter several tissues such as the brain, tiratricol can enter cells independently of MCT8. Once inside cells, tiratricol activates the thyroid hormone receptor in a similar way to endogenous T3. The most common side effects are excessive sweating, irritability, anxiety and nightmares. == Medical uses == Tiratricol is indicated in the management of thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Tiratricol is not approved for sale in Canada or the United States. It was once an approved medication in Brazil, but its marketing authorization was suspended in 2003, effectively prohibiting its sale.

3284,"('Paromomycin (sulfate)', 'Aminosidine (sulfate)', 'Paromomycin', 'Aminosidin', 'Catenulin')",Medical,"Paromomycin is an antimicrobial used to treat a number of parasitic infections including amebiasis, giardiasis, leishmaniasis, and tapeworm infection. It is a first-line treatment for amebiasis or giardiasis during pregnancy. Otherwise, it is generally a second line treatment option. It is taken by mouth, applied to the skin, or by injection into a muscle. Common side effects when taken by mouth include loss of appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. When applied to the skin side effects include itchiness, redness, and blisters. When given by injection there may be fever, liver problems, or hearing loss. Use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Paromomycin is in the aminoglycoside family of medications and causes microbe death by stopping the creation of bacterial proteins. Paromomycin was discovered in the 1950s from a type of streptomyces and came into medical use in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Paromomycin is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is an antimicrobial used to treat intestinal parasitic infections such as cryptosporidiosis and amoebiasis, and other diseases such as leishmaniasis. Paromomycin was demonstrated to be effective against cutaneous leishmaniasis in clinical studies in the USSR in the 1960s, and in trials with visceral leishmaniasis in the early 1990s. The route of administration is intramuscular injection and capsule. Paromomycin topical cream with or without gentamicin is an effective treatment for ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis, according to the results of a phase-3, randomized, double-blind, parallel group–controlled trial. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === The medication is poorly absorbed. The effect it may have on the baby is still unknown. There is limited data regarding the safety of taking paromomycin while breastfeeding but because the drug is poorly absorbed minimal amounts of drug will be secreted in breastmilk. === HIV/AIDS === There is limited evidence that paromomycin can be used in persons coinfected with HIV and Cryptosporidium. A few small trials have shown a reduction in oocyst shedding after treatment with paromomycin. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects associated with paromomycin sulfate are abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Long-term use of paromomycin increases the risk for bacterial or fungal infection. Signs of overgrowth include white patches in the oral cavities. Other less common adverse events include myasthenia gravis, kidney damage, enterocolitis, malabsorption syndrome, eosinophilia, headache, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, itching, severe dizziness, and pancreatitis. == Interactions == Paromomycin belongs to the aminoglycoside drug class and therefore are toxic to the kidneys and to ears. These toxicities are additive and are more likely to occur when used with other drugs that cause ear and kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of foscarnet increases the risk of kidney toxicity. Concurrent use of colistimethate and paromomycin can cause a dangerous slowing of breathing known as respiratory depression, and should be done with extreme caution if necessary. When used with systemic antibiotics such as paromomycin, the cholera vaccine can cause an immune response. Use with strong diuretics, which can also harm hearing, should be avoided. Paromomycin may have dangerous reactions when used with the paralytic succinylcholine by increasing its neuromuscular effects. There are no known food or drink interactions with paromomycin. == Mechanism == Paromomycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor in nonresistant cells by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA. This broad-spectrum antibiotic soluble in water, is very similar in action to neomycin. Antimicrobial activity of paromomycin against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus has been shown. Paromomycin works as an antibiotic by increasing the error rate in ribosomal translation. Paromomycin binds to a RNA loop, where residues A1492 and A1493 are usually stacked, and expels these two residues. These two residues are involved in detection of correct Watson-Crick pairing between the codon and anti codon. When correct interactions are achieved, the binding provides energy to expel the two residues. Paromomycin binding provides enough energy for residue expulsion and thus results in the ribosome incorporating the incorrect amino acid into the nascent peptide chain. Recent real-time measurements of aminoglycoside effects on protein synthesis in live E. coli cells found that paromomycin's interference with protein synthesis is not only due to the misreading of mRNA but also due to a significant reduction in the overall protein elongation rate, suggesting a more comprehensive inhibition of protein synthesis. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === GI absorption is poor. Any obstructions or factors which impair GI motility may increase the absorption of the drug from the digestive tract. In addition, any structural damage, such as lesions or ulcerations, will tend to increase drug absorption. For intramuscular (IM) injection, the absorption is rapid. Paromomycin will reach peak plasma concentration within one hour following IM injection. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities parallel those of neomycin. === Elimination === Almost 100% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged via feces. Any absorbed drug will be excreted in urine. == History == Paromomycin was discovered in the 1950s amongst the secondary metabolites of a variety of Streptomyces then known as Streptomyces krestomuceticus, now known as Streptomyces rimosus. It came into medical use in 1960. == References == == External links == Media related to Paromomycin at Wikimedia Commons ""Paromomycin"". Drug Information Portal.

3287,"('Alvimopan (dihydrate)', 'Ly 246736 dihydrate', 'Alvimopan', 'Alvimopan anhydrous', 'Adl 8-2698')",Medical,"Alvimopan (trade name Entereg) is a drug which behaves as a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist. With the limited ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and reach the μ-opioid receptors of the central nervous system, the clinically undesirable effects of centrally acting opioid antagonists (like reversal of opioid-mediated analgesia) are avoided without affecting the intended blockade of μ-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. It is currently only Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of postoperative ileus which it received in May 2008. == Medical uses == Alvimopan is indicated in people to avoid postoperative ileus following partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis. Alvimopan accelerates the gastrointestinal recovery period as defined by time to first bowel movement or flatus. == Adverse effects == There is a potential risk of myocardial infarction in patients using alvimopan long-term. The most common side effects associated with alvimopan are: == Contraindications == Alvimopan is absolutely contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than seven consecutive days immediately prior to when alvimopan would be initiated because individuals with recent exposure to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of μ-opioid receptor antagonists. The peripheral site of action of alvimopan suggests that such a heightened sensitivity would precipitate gastrointestinal effects beyond dyspepsia. == Interactions == Alvimopan is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Therefore, no interactions are expected with hepatically metabolized drugs. Alvimopan is substrate for P-glycoprotein. Thus, interactions are to be expected with known P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as amiodarone, bepridil, diltiazem, ciclosporin, itraconazole, quinine, quinidine, spironolactone, and verapamil. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Alvimopan is a competitive antagonist of the μ-opioid receptors (MOR) in the gastrointestinal tract, with a Ki of 0.2 ng/mL. Activation of these receptors by endogenous or exogenous agonists reduces gastrointestinal motility, and alvimopan blocks this effect. Like most other peripherally-selective MOR antagonists, such as naloxegel and methylnaltrexone, alvimopan is selective for peripheral receptors because is effluxed by P-glycoprotein, which reduces its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the central nervous system. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of alvimopan is reached approximately 2 hours after oral dosing, while the Cmax for metabolite occurs 36 hours after an oral dose. Alvimopan's high affinity for the peripheral μ-receptor results in an absolute bioavailability less than 7%. ==== Distribution ==== 80% to 90% of systemically available alvimopan is bound to plasma protein. At steady state, the volume of distribution is approximately 30 liters. ==== Metabolism ==== Alvimopan undergoes no significant hepatic metabolism, but is metabolized by intestinal flora. Gut metabolism produces an active metabolite with no clinically significant contribution to drug effect. ==== Elimination ==== Alvimopan undergoes 35% renal excretion and greater than 50% biliary excretion. Drug metabolized by intestinal flora is excreted in the feces. Alvimopan's half-life of elimination is 10 to 17 hours, while that of the gut metabolite is 10 to 18 hours. == Dosing and administration == Alvimopan is required by the FDA to participate in Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure safe use. Alvimopan is only approved for short term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available on an inpatient basis at institutions approved by and registered with the Entereg Access Support and Education (E.A.S.E.) program.

3288,"('Tolmetin', 'Tolectin', 'Tolmetine', 'Tolmetinum', 'Tolmetina [dcit]')",Medical,"Tolmetin () is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the heterocyclic acetic acid derivative class. Tolmetin was originally approved by the US FDA in 1976. It is available internationally. It is used primarily to reduce hormones that cause pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness in conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In the United States it was marketed as Tolectin and comes as a tablet or capsule. == Clinical usage == Tolmetin is applicable in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis, pain, and ankylosing spondylitis. == Mechanism of action == Although the mechanism of action of tolmetin is unknown, research involving humans and animals has shown that tolmetin does not achieve anti-inflammatory response by stimulation of the adrenal or pituitary gland, but it has shown tolmetin restrains prostaglandin synthetase in vitro and reduces plasma levels of prostaglandin E, possibly causing the anti-inflammatory response. When tested in rats, tolmetin prevented experimentally stimulated polyarthritis and reduced inflammation. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis tolmetin was as effective as aspirin and indometacin, although the occurrence of mild gastrointestinal adverse effects and tinnitus was lower in patients treated with tolmetin than it was with aspirin-treated patients and the occurrence of adverse effects of the central nervous system was lower with tolmetin than it was with indomethacin. == Side effects == Tolmetin can increase the risk of heart or circulatory conditions such as heart attacks and strokes. It should not be taken shortly before or after coronary artery bypass surgery. Tolmetin can also increase the risk of gastrointestinal conditions such as perforation or bleeding, which can be fatal. Antacids can be taken with tolmetin to relieve stomachaches that often occur. Overdose can result in drowsiness, nausea, epigastric pain, and vomiting. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result from low amniotic fluid.

It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Versions are available as the combination olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and olmesartan/amlodipine. It is available as a prodrug, olmesartan medoxomil. Common side effects include dizziness, headaches, diarrhea, and back pain. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the fetus and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. It was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 97th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == In the United States, olmesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in people aged six years of age and older to lower blood pressure. Olmesartan is used for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. == Contraindications == Contraindications for treatment with olmesartan include biliary obstruction. Another major contraindication is pregnancy; reports in the scientific literature reveal fetal malformations for pregnant women taking sartan-derived drugs. == Adverse effects == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that the benefits of olmesartan continue to outweigh its potential risks when used for the treatment of people with high blood pressure according to the drug label. The incidence of adverse effects with olmesartan is reported as similar to placebo; the only adverse effect that occurred in >1% of patients treated with it and more frequently than placebo was dizziness (3% vs 1%). Rarely, olmesartan can cause severe gastrointestinal issues. The symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and electrolyte abnormalities, are common among those who have celiac disease. Recent studies suggested this form of sprue-like enteropathy could be caused by the inhibition of TGF-β, a polypeptide cytokine that maintains intestinal homeostasis. However, it is still unclear why this action was never observed with other ARBs. In studies of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as olmesartan, patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been reported.

It was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2002, and for medical use in the United States in July 2003. == Medical uses == Miglustat is indicated to treat adults with mild to moderate type I Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable. In the European Union, miglustat (Opfolda), in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa, is a long-term enzyme replacement therapy in adults with late-onset Pompe disease (acid α‑glucosidase [GAA] deficiency). == Contraindications == Miglustat is contraindicated for people with neurological conditions, kidney problems, women who are pregnant, and men and women planning to conceive a child. == Adverse effects == Serious side effects include pain, burning, numbness or tingling in the hands, arms, legs, or feet; shaking hands that cannot be controlled; changes in vision; and easy bruising or bleeding. Common side effects include gastrointestinal effects (including diarrhea, stomach pain or bloating, gas, loss of appetite, weight loss, upset stomach, vomiting, constipation), dry mouth, muscular effects (including weakness, muscle cramps, especially in the legs, feeling of heaviness in the arms or legs, unsteadiness when walking), back pain, dizziness, nervousness, headache, memory problems, and difficult or irregular menstruation (period). == Mechanism of action == Type I Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder; parents are generally healthy carriers with one functional and one mutated (nonfunctioning) copy of the Gaucher disease gene, GBA. People with type I Gaucher have a defect in the enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (also known as acid β-glucosidase). Glucocerebrosidase is an enzyme, and its function is to convert glucocerebroside (also known as glucosylceramide) into ceramide and glucose. When this enzyme doesn't work, glucocerebroside accumulates, which in turn causes liver and spleen enlargement, changes in the bone marrow and blood, and bone disease. Miglustat functions as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, the initial enzyme in a series of reactions which results in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. Earlier treatments on the market (imiglucerase (approved in 1995), velaglucerase (approved in 2010), taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) (approved in 2012)) are enzyme replacement therapy—they are functioning versions of the enzyme that doesn't work. Miglustat, on the other hand, prevents the formation of the substance that builds up when the enzyme doesn't work; this is called substrate reduction therapy. == Chemistry == Miglustat is an iminosugar, a synthetic analogue of D-glucose and a white to off-white crystalline solid that has a bitter taste. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Miglustat has been approved in the EU, Canada, and Japan for treating progressive neurological complications in people with Niemann–Pick disease, type C (NPC). On 26 April 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Opfolda, intended for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease) in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa. The applicant for this medicinal product is Amicus Therapeutics Europe Limited. Opfolda is a hybrid medicine of Zavesca which has been authorized in the EU since 2002. Opfolda contains the same active substance as Zavesca but in a lower strength. It is also authorized for a different indication and can only be used in combination with cipaglucosidase alfa. Miglustat (Opfolda) was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2023. == Research == In July 2004, Actelion started a clinical trial of miglustat to treat Tay–Sachs disease, particularly late-onset Tay–Sachs with an estimated enrollment of 10 subjects; the trial ended August 2007. In November 2007, Actelion initiated a clinical trial with miglustat in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have the ΔF508 in both copies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; the study ended in March 2008. The cystic fibrosis trial showed no effect. N-butyldeoxynojirimycin interferes with the secretion of hepatitis B virus and reduces the infectivity of HIV virions, in the latter case by preventing proper folding of the gp160 precursor glycoprotein to cause a conformational defect in mature gp120, which interferes with the process of fusion with host membranes. == References ==",Miglustat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8596476365928538e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002811751910485327)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miglustat?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Miglustat', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miglustat?utm_source=openai')])"

3293,"('Triacetin', 'Glyceryl triacetate', 'Glycerol triacetate', 'Glycerin triacetate', 'Enzactin')","Food, Medical","Triacetin is the organic compound with the formula C3H5(OCOCH3)3. It is classified as a triglyceride, i.e., the triester of glycerol with acetic acid. It is a colorless, viscous, and odorless liquid with a high boiling point and a low melting point. It has a mild, sweet taste in concentrations lower than 500 ppm, but may appear bitter at higher concentrations. It is one of the glycerine acetate compounds. == Uses == Triacetin is a common food additive, for instance as a solvent in flavorings, and for its humectant function, with E number E1518 and Australian approval code A1518. It is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical products, where it is used as a humectant, a plasticizer, and as a solvent. === Potential uses === The plasticizing capabilities of triacetin have been utilized in the synthesis of a biodegradable phospholipid gel system for the dissemination of the cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX). In the study, triacetin was combined with PTX, ethanol, a phospholipid and a medium chain triglyceride to form a gel-drug complex. This complex was then injected directly into the cancer cells of glioma-bearing mice. The gel slowly degraded and facilitated sustained release of PTX into the targeted glioma cells. Triacetin can also be used as a fuel additive as an antiknock agent which can reduce engine knocking in gasoline, and to improve cold and viscosity properties of biodiesel. It has been considered as a possible source of food energy in artificial food regeneration systems on long space missions. It is believed to be safe to get over half of one's dietary energy from triacetin. == Synthesis == Triacetin was first prepared in 1854 by the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot. Triacetin was prepared in the 19th century from glycerol and acetic acid. Its synthesis from acetic anhydride and glycerol is simple and inexpensive. 3 (CH3CO)2O + 1 C3H5(OH)3 → 1 C3H5(OCOCH3)3 + 3 CH3CO2H This synthesis has been conducted with catalytic sodium hydroxide and microwave irradiation to give a 99% yield of triacetin. It has also been conducted with a cobalt(II) Salen complex catalyst supported by silicon dioxide and heated to 50 °C for 55 minutes to give a 99% yield of triacetin. == Safety == The US Food and Drug Administration has approved it as generally recognized as safe food additive and included it in the database according to the opinion from the Select Committee On GRAS Substances (SCOGS). Triacetin is included in the SCOGS database since 1975. Triacetin was not toxic to animals in studies of exposure through repeated inhalation over a relatively short period. == References ==",Glycerin triacetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0299261212348938), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' MED', -0.4202348589897156), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00015872348740231246), (' INDUSTR', -4.024604277219623e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.004157115705311298), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00019691436318680644), ('ĠMED', -0.12757956981658936), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.16025365889072418), ('ĠINDU', -0.0011940023396164179), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015698263887315989)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.2586367130279541), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -2.935296834039036e-06), (' FOOD', -0.0006491714157164097), (',', -0.47407716512680054), (' PERSONAL', -1.0206720617134124e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([ataman-chemicals.com](https://www.ataman-chemicals.com/en/products/glycerin-triacetate-5700.html?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/triacetin/?utm_source=openai), [food-info.net](https://www.food-info.net/uk/e/e1518.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=320, start_index=33, title='GLYCERIN TRIACETATE | Ataman Kimya A.Ş.', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ataman-chemicals.com/en/products/glycerin-triacetate-5700.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=320, start_index=33, title='Triacetin - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/triacetin/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=320, start_index=33, title='Food-Info.net : E-numbers : E1518: Glycerol triacetate', type='url_citation', url='https://www.food-info.net/uk/e/e1518.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

3295,"('Pinocembrin', 'Pinocoembrin', 'Dihydrochrysin', 'Galangin flavanone', '(s)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-phenylchroman-4-one')","Food, Medical","Chrysin, also called 5,7-dihydroxyflavone, is a flavone found in honey, propolis, the passion flowers, Passiflora caerulea and Passiflora incarnata, and in Oroxylum indicum. It is extracted from various plants, such as the blue passion flower (Passiflora caerulea). Following oral intake by humans, chrysin has low bioavailability and rapid excretion. It is under basic research to evaluate its safety and potential biological effects. Chrysin is an ingredient in dietary supplements. As of 2016, there was no clinical use of chrysin, and no evidence for its effect on testosterone levels. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration did not recommend chrysin be included on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. == Occurrence == A component in various medicinal plants (e.g. Scutellaria baicalensis), chrysin is a dihydroxyflavone, a type of flavonoid. It is also found in honey, propolis, the passion flowers, Passiflora caerulea and Passiflora incarnata, in Oroxylum indicum, carrots, chamomile, many fruits, and in mushrooms, such as the mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. It is extracted from various plants, such as the blue passion flower (Passiflora caerulea). The amount of chrysin in honey from various plant sources is about 0.2 mg per 100 g. Chrysin is typically found at higher amounts in propolis than in honey. A 2010 study found the amount of chrysin was 0.10 mg/kg in honeydew honey, and 5.3 mg/kg in forest honeys. A 2010 study found the amount of chrysin in propolis was as much as 28 g/L. A 2013 study found the amount of chrysin in various mushrooms from the island of Lesvos, Greece, varied between 0.17 mg/kg in Lactarius deliciosus to 0.34 mg/kg in Suillus bellinii. == Bioavailability == The effects of chrysin are reliant on its bioavailability and solubility. Following oral intake by humans, chrysin has low bioavailability and rapid excretion. As a result, it is poorly absorbed. A 1998 study determined that the highest amounts in plasma was from 12 to 64 nM. As of 2015, the serum levels of chrysin have not been cited in the literature. Following oral intake by humans, the bioavailability was reported to be from 0.003% to 0.02%. == Oral and topical application == There is insufficient information to determine how long chrysin has been used in pharmacy compounding. Chrysin is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, but there is no information on systemic exposure from topical application. As of 2016, there was no evidence to support any effect of oral chrysin on testosterone levels, or an any disease-modifying activity with oral or topical formulations. == Safety == A daily consumed amount of chrysin of 0.5 to 3 g is considered safe. As of 2016, there was no toxicity attributable to chrysin in clinical trials or adverse event reporting. As of 2016, clinical safety issues have not been identified. As of 2016, nonclinical data suggest potential concerns. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration did not recommend chrysin be included on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act based on consideration of the following criteria: (1) physicochemical characterization; (2) safety; (3) effectiveness; and (4) historical use of the substance in compounding. == Research == As of 2016, there is no evidence for chrysin being used in human clinical applications. Research showed that orally administered chrysin does not have clinical activity as an aromatase inhibitor. Nanoformulations of polyphenols, including chrysin, are made using various carrier methods, such as liposomes and nanocapsules. == Bibliography == Brave M (23 June 2016). ""Chrysin"" (PDF).

3296,"('Quetiapine', 'Seroquel', 'Quetiapine fumarate', 'Ethanol, 2-[2-(4-dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepin-11-yl-1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]-', 'Co-quetiapine')",Medical,"Quetiapine, sold under the brand name Seroquel among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, and major depressive disorder. Despite being widely prescribed as a sleep aid due to its tranquillizing effects, the benefits of such use may not outweigh the risk of undesirable side effects. It is taken orally. Common side effects include sedation, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and dry mouth. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, seizures, a prolonged erection, high blood sugar, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Quetiapine is believed to work by blocking a number of receptors, including those for serotonin and dopamine. Quetiapine was developed in 1985 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the most prescribed antipsychotic and 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The drug is typically indicated to have superior efficacy over other existing antipsychotics for the treatment of bipolar disorder, followed by olanzapine and aripiprazole, in that order. Quetiapine is currently one of only two antipsychotics (the other being cariprazine) that produce equal efficacy as a standalone therapy for mixed manic-depressive mood swings as it is when used in combination with an SSRI antidepressant. However, quetiapine is less potent than clozapine, amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone, respectively, in alleviating psychotic symptoms or treating schizophrenia. == Medical uses == Quetiapine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Quetiapine targets both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. === Schizophrenia === A 2013 Cochrane review compared quetiapine to typical antipsychotics: In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, quetiapine demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine and approximately as effective as haloperidol and aripiprazole. There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are more effective. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. While quetiapine has lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, there is greater sleepiness and rates of dry mouth. A Cochrane review comparing quetiapine to other atypical antipsychotic agents tentatively concluded that it may be less efficacious than olanzapine and risperidone; produce fewer movement related side effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine; and produce weight gain similar to risperidone, clozapine and aripiprazole. They concluded that it produces suicide attempt, suicide; death; QTc prolongation, low blood pressure; tachycardia; sedation; gynaecomastia; galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and decline in white blood cell count at a rate similar to first generation antipsychotics. === Bipolar disorder === In those with bipolar disorder, quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes; acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium; valproate or lamotrigine); acute mixed episodes; and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex). === Major depressive disorder === Quetiapine is effective when used by itself and when used along with other medications in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, sedation is often an undesirable side effect. In the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (while not subsidised by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for treatment of MDD), quetiapine is licensed for use as an add-on treatment in MDD. === Alzheimer's disease === Quetiapine does not decrease agitation among people with Alzheimer's disease. Quetiapine worsens intellectual functioning in the elderly with dementia and therefore is not recommended. === Insomnia === The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. A 2022 network meta-analysis of 154 double-blind, randomized controlled trials of drug therapies vs. placebo for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine did not demonstrate any short-term benefits in sleep quality. Quetiapine, specifically, had an effect size (standardized mean difference) against placebo for treatment of insomnia of 0.05 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –1.21 to 1.11) at 4 weeks of treatment, with the certainty of evidence rated as very low. Doses of quetiapine used for insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg, with low doses of 25 to 200 mg being the most typical. Regardless of the dose used, some of the more serious adverse effects may still possibly occur at the lower dosing ranges, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia. These safety concerns at low doses are corroborated by Danish observational studies that showed use of specifically low-dose quetiapine (prescriptions filled for tablet strengths >50 mg were excluded) was associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to use of Z-drugs, with most of the risk being driven by cardiovascular death. Laboratory data from an unpublished analysis of the same cohort also support the lack of dose-dependency of metabolic side effects, as new use of low-dose quetiapine was associated with a risk of increased fasting triglycerides at 1-year follow-up. === Others === It is sometimes used off-label, often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as Tourette syndrome, musical hallucinations and anxiety disorders. Quetiapine and clozapine are the most widely used medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis due to their relatively low extrapyramidal side-effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g. agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine's use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine. == Adverse effects == Sources for incidence lists: Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects Dry mouth Dizziness Headache Somnolence (drowsiness; of 15 antipsychotics quetiapine causes the 5th most sedation. Extended release (XR) formulations tend to produce less sedation, dose-by-dose, than the immediate release formulations.) Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects Extrapyramidal disease: Quetiapine and clozapine are noted for their relative lack of extrapyramidal side effects. Weight gain: SMD 0.43 kg when compared to placebo. Produces roughly as much weight gain as risperidone, less weight gain than clozapine, olanzapine and zotepine and more weight gain than ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole and asenapine. As with many other atypical antipsychotics, this action is likely due to its actions at the H1 histamine receptor and 5-HT2C receptor. Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects Neuroleptic malignant syndrome a rare and potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. It is characterised by the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mental status changes (e.g. confusion), etc. Tardive dyskinesia. A rare and often irreversible neurological condition characterised by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips and rest of the body. Most commonly occurs after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics. It is believed to be particularly uncommon with atypical antipsychotics, especially quetiapine and clozapine Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals. Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, risperidone, thioridazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole. As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the seizure threshold, and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as bupropion. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. === Pregnancy and lactation === Placental exposure is least for quetiapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics. The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations. It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed. === Abuse potential === In contrast to most other antipsychotic drugs, which tend to be somewhat aversive and often show problems with patient compliance with prescribed medication regimes, quetiapine is sometimes associated with drug misuse and abuse potential, for its hypnotic and sedative effects. It has a limited potential for misuse, usually only in individuals with a history of polysubstance abuse and/or mental illness, and especially in those incarcerated in prisons or secure psychiatric facilities where access to alternative intoxicants is more limited. To a significantly greater extent than other atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine was found to be associated with drug-seeking behaviors, and to have standardised street prices and slang terms associated with it, either by itself or in combination with other drugs (such as ""Q-ball"" for the intravenous injection of quetiapine mixed with cocaine). The pharmacological basis for this distinction from other second generation antipsychotic drugs is unclear, though it has been suggested that quetiapine's comparatively lower dopamine receptor affinity and strong antihistamine activity might mean it could be regarded as more similar to sedating antihistamines in this context. While these issues have not been regarded as sufficient cause for placing quetiapine under increased legal controls, prescribers have been urged to show caution when prescribing quetiapine to individuals with characteristics that might place them at increased risk for drug misuse. == Overdose == Most instances of acute overdosage result in only sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrhythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10 mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25 mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases. Non-toxic levels in postmortem blood extend to around 0.8 mg/kg, but toxic levels in postmortem blood can begin at 0.35 mg/kg. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Quetiapine has the following pharmacological actions: Dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptor antagonist Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F receptor ligand α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist Histamine H1 receptor antagonist Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist This means quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist to all other serotonin receptors it has affinity for. Serial PET scans evaluating the D2 receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D2 receptor. Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in prolactin. Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually autoreceptors whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters. At very low doses, quetiapine acts primarily as a histamine receptor blocker (antihistamine) and α1-adrenergic blocker. When the dose is increased, quetiapine activates the adrenergic system and binds strongly to serotonin receptors and autoreceptors. At high doses, quetiapine starts blocking significant amounts of dopamine receptors. Due to the drug's sedating H1 activity, it is often prescribed at low doses for insomnia. While some feel that low doses of drugs with antihistamine effects like quetiapine and mirtazapine are safer than drugs associated with physical dependency or other risk factors, concern has been raised by some professionals that off-label prescribing has become too widespread due to underappreciated hazards. When treating schizophrenia, antagonism of D2 receptor by quetiapine in the mesolimbic pathway relieves positive symptoms and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor in the frontal cortex of the brain may relieve negative symptoms and reduce severity of psychotic episodes. Quetiapine has fewer extrapyramidal side effects and is less likely to cause hyperprolactinemia when compared to other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, so is used as a first line treatment. === Pharmacokinetics === Peak levels of quetiapine occur 1.5 hours after a dose. The plasma protein binding of quetiapine is 83%. The major active metabolite of quetiapine is norquetiapine (N-desalkylquetiapine). Quetiapine has an elimination half-life of 6 or 7 hours. Its metabolite, norquetiapine, has a half-life of 9 to 12 hours. Quetiapine is excreted primarily via the kidneys (73%) and in feces (20%) after hepatic metabolism, the remainder (1%) is excreted as the drug in its unmetabolized form. == Chemistry == Quetiapine is a tetracyclic compound and is closely related structurally to clozapine, olanzapine, loxapine, and other tetracyclic antipsychotics. === Synthesis === The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The lactam is first treated with phosphoryl chloride to produce a dibenzothiazepine. A nucleophilic substitution is used to introduce the sidechain. == History == === Sustained-release === AstraZeneca submitted a new drug application for a sustained-release version of quetiapine in the United States, Canada, and the European Union in the second half of 2006 for treatment of schizophrenia. In May 2007, the US FDA approved Seroquel XR for acute treatment of schizophrenia. During its 2007 Q2 earnings conference, AstraZeneca announced plans to launch Seroquel XR in the U.S. during August 2007. However, Seroquel XR has become available in U.S. pharmacies only after the FDA approved Seroquel XR for use as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, in addition to acute treatment of the illness, on 16 November 2007. The company has not provided a reason for the delay of Seroquel XR's launch. Health Canada approved sale of Seroquel XR on 27 September 2007. In October 2008, the FDA approved Seroquel XR for the treatment of bipolar depression and bipolar mania. In December 2008, Biovail announced that the FDA had accepted the company's ANDA to market its own version of sustained-release quetiapine. Biovail's sustained-release tablets will compete with AstraZeneca's Seroquel XR. In December 2008, AstraZeneca notified shareholders that the FDA had asked for additional information on the company's application to expand the use of sustained-release quetiapine for treatment of depression. == Society and culture == === Regulatory status === In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar mania) and for treatment of bipolar depression. In 2009, quetiapine XR was approved as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Quetiapine received its initial approval from the US FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in 1997. In 2004, it received its second indication for the treatment of mania-associated bipolar disorder. In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on quetiapine's efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. Patent protection for the product ended in 2012; however, in a number of regions, the long-acting version remained under patent until 2017. === Lawsuits === In April 2010, the U. S. Department of Justice fined AstraZeneca $520 million for the company's aggressive marketing of Seroquel for off-label uses. According to the Department of Justice, ""the company recruited doctors to serve as authors of articles that were ghostwritten by medical literature companies and about studies the doctors in question did not conduct. AstraZeneca then used those studies and articles as the basis for promotional messages about unapproved uses of Seroquel."" Multiple lawsuits have been filed in relation to quetiapine's side-effects, in particular, diabetes. Approximately 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against AstraZeneca, alleging that quetiapine caused problems ranging from slurred speech and chronic insomnia to deaths. === Controversy === In 2004, a young man named Dan Markingson committed suicide in a controversial Seroquel clinical trial at the University of Minnesota while under an involuntary commitment order. A group of University of Minnesota bioethicists charged that the trial involved an alarming number of ethical violations. === Nurofen Plus tampering case === In August 2011, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a class-4 drug alert following reports that some batches of Nurofen plus contained Seroquel XL tablets instead. Following the issue of the Class-4 Drug Alert, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd received further reports of rogue blister strips in cartons of two additional batches of Nurofen Plus tablets. One of the new batches contained Seroquel XL 50 mg tablets and one contained the Pfizer product Neurontin 100 mg capsules. Following discussions with the MHRA's Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC), Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd decided to recall all remaining unexpired stock of Nurofen Plus tablets in any pack size, leading to a Class-1 Drug Alert. The contamination was later traced to in-store tampering by a customer. == References == == External links ==",Quetiapine fumarate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.255681051290594e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007570500019937754)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine,https://www.drugs.com/pro/quetiapine-fumarate-tablets.html,https://www.rxlist.com/seroquel-drug.htm ', [])"

It is a newer broad-spectrum aminoglycoside most structurally related to gentamicin. Sisomicin is the most predictably active aminoglycoside against Gram-positive bacteria. Like most other aminoglycosides, sisomicin is bactericidal for sensitive clinical isolates. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) have been found to be equivalent or very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Like other aminoglycosides, most clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain susceptible to sisomicin. Resistance to sisomicin may be enzymatically or non-enzymatically mediated. Sisomicin is inactivated by the same enzymes as gentamicin, but it is active against many organisms that resist gentamicin by non-enzymatic mechanisms. Some studies show that sisomicin has been effective in the treatment of infections that either had failed to respond to other drugs or were due to microorganisms resistant in vitro to other aminoglycosides. == References ==",Sisomicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002338612830499187), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0052458494901657104)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisomicin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Sisomicin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisomicin?utm_source=openai')])"
3298,"('Dapoxetine (hydrochloride)', 'Dapoxetine', 'Dapoxetine hydrochloride', '(s)-n,n-dimethyl-3-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)-1-phenylpropan-1-amine', 'Dapoxetinum')",Medical,"Dapoxetine, sold under the brand name Priligy among others, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men ages 18 to 64 years old. Dapoxetine works by inhibiting the serotonin transporter, increasing serotonin's action at the postsynaptic cleft, and as a consequence promoting ejaculatory delay. As a member of the SSRI family, dapoxetine was initially created as an antidepressant. However, unlike other SSRIs, dapoxetine is absorbed and eliminated rapidly in the body. Its fast-acting property makes it suitable for the treatment of PE, but not as an antidepressant. Originally created by Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company, dapoxetine was sold to Johnson & Johnson in 2003 and submitted as a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PE in 2004. Dapoxetine is sold in several European and Asian countries, and in Mexico. In the US, dapoxetine has been in phase III development. In May 2012, US-based Furiex Pharmaceuticals reached an agreement with ALZA Corp and Janssen Pharmaceuticals to market dapoxetine in the United States, Japan, and Canada, while selling the rights to market the drug in Europe, most of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East to Menarini. == Medical uses == === Premature ejaculation === Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of dapoxetine for the treatment of PE. Different dosages have different impacts on different types of PE. Dapoxetine 60 mg significantly improves the mean intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) compared to that of dapoxetine 30 mg in men with lifelong PE, but no difference is seen in men with acquired PE. Dapoxetine, given 1–3 hours before sexual episode, prolongs IELT and increases the sense of control and sexual satisfaction in men of 18 to 64 years of age with PE. Since PE is associated with personal distress and interrelationship difficulty, dapoxetine provides help for men with PE to overcome this condition. With no drug approved specifically for treatment for PE in the US and some other countries, other SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and citalopram have been used off-label to treat PE. Waldinger's meta-analysis shows that the use of these conventional antidepressants increases IELT two- to nine-fold above baseline, compared to three- to eight-fold when dapoxetine is used. However, these SSRIs may need to be taken daily to achieve meaningful efficacy, and their comparatively longer half-lives increase the risk of drug accumulation and a corresponding increase of adverse effects such as reduced libido. Dapoxetine, though, is generally categorized as a fast-acting SSRI. It is more rapidly absorbed and mostly eliminated from the body within a few hours. These pharmacokinetics are more favorable in that they might minimize drug accumulation in the body, habituation, and side effects. === Depression and anxiety === Dapoxetine was initially considered unsuccessful in its intended use as an antidepressant; however, it has since been investigated as a possible aid to an approach to depression treatment focused on stress reduction, based on an animal model of depression. == Contraindications == Dapoxetine should not be used in men with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and in those receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, and telithromycin. Dapoxetine also cannot be used in patients with heart failure, permanent pacemaker, or other significant ischemic heart disease. Caution is advised in men receiving thioridazine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressants. If a patient stops taking one of these drugs, he should wait for 14 days before taking dapoxetine. If a patient stops taking dapoxetine, he should wait for 7 days before receiving these drugs. == Adverse effects == The most common effects when taking dapoxetine are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, diarrhea, and insomnia. Discontinuation rates due to adverse effects and costs are very high, as demonstrated in a study in Asia which showed that cumulative discontinuation rates within one year are as high as 87%. Unlike other SSRIs used to treat depression, which have been associated with high incidences of sexual dysfunction, dapoxetine is associated with low rates of sexual dysfunction. Taken as needed, dapoxetine has very mild adverse effects of decreased libido (<1%) and erectile dysfunction (<4%). === Overdose === No case of drug overdose has been reported during clinical trials. == Interactions == === Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors === Many men who have PE also suffer from erectile dysfunction (ED). Treatment for these patients should consider the drug–drug interaction between dapoxetine and PDE5 inhibitors such as tadalafil (Cialis) or sildenafil (Viagra). In Dresser study (2006), plasma concentration of 24 subjects was obtained. Half of the sample pool were treated with dapoxetine 60 mg plus tadalafil 20 mg; the other half were treated with dapoxetine 60 mg plus sildenafil 100 mg. These plasma samples were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that dapoxetine does not alter the pharmacokinetic of tadalafil or sildenafil. === Alcohol === Alcohol does not affect the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine when taking concurrently. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The mechanism through which dapoxetine affects premature ejaculation is still unclear, but dapoxetine is presumed to work by inhibiting serotonin transporter (SERT) and subsequently increasing serotonin's action at pre- and postsynaptic receptors. Human ejaculation is regulated by various areas in the central nervous system (CNS). The ejaculatory pathway originates from spinal reflex at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral level of spinal cord activated by stimuli from male genitalia. These signals are passed on to the brain stem, which then is influenced by a number of nuclei in the brain such as medial preoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Clement's study performed on anaesthetized male rats showed that acute administration of dapoxetine inhibits ejaculatory expulsion reflex at supraspinal level by modulating activity of lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) neurons. These effects cause an increase in pudendal motoneuron reflex discharge (PMRD) latency, though whether dapoxetine acts directly on LPGi or on the descending pathway in which LPGi located is unclear. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption Dapoxetine is a white, powdery, water-insoluble substance. Taken one to three hours before sexual activity, it is rapidly absorbed in the body. Its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached one to two hours after oral administration. The Cmax and AUC (area under the plasma vs. time curve) is dose dependent. The Cmax and Tm (time needed to obtain the maximum plasma concentration) after single doses of dapoxetine 30 mg and 60 mg are 297 and 498 ng/ml at 1.01 and 1.27 hours, respectively. A high-fat meal does reduce the Cmax slightly, but it is insignificant. In fact, food does not alter dapoxetine pharmacokinetics. It can be taken with or without food. Distribution Dapoxetine is absorbed and distributed rapidly in the body. Greater than 99% of dapoxetine is bound to the plasma protein. The mean steady-state volume is 162 L. Its initial half-life is 1.31 hours (30 mg dose) and 1.42 hours (60 mg dose), and its terminal half life is 18.7 hours (30 mg dose) and 21.9 hours (60 mg dose). Metabolism Dapoxetine is metabolized extensively in the liver and kidney by multiple enzymes such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and flavin monooxygenase 1. The major product at the end of the metabolic pathway is circulating dapoxetine N-oxide, which is a weak SSRI and contributes no clinical effect. The other products presented less than 3% in the plasma are desmethyldapoxetine and didesmethydapoxetine. Desmethyldapoxetine is roughly equipotent to dapoxetine. Excretion The metabolites of dapoxetine are eliminated rapidly in the urine with a terminal half-life of 18.7 and 21.9 hours for a single dose of 30 mg and 60 mg, respectively. == Safety and tolerability == === Cardiovascular safety === The cardiovascular safety profile of dapoxetine has been studied extensively during the drug development. Phase I trials showed that dapoxetine had neither clinically significant electrocardiographic effects nor delayed repolarization effects, with dosing up to four-fold greater than the maximum recommended dosage, which is 60 mg. Phase III studies in men with PE showed a safety and well tolerated profile of dapoxetine with dosing of 30 and 60 mg. No cardiovascular adverse had been found. === Neurocognitive safety === Studies of SSRIs in patients with major psychiatric disorders prove that SSRIs are potentially associated with certain neurocognitive adverse effects such as anxiety, akathisia, hypomania, changes in mood, or suicidal thought. No study on the effects of SSRIs in men with PE has been done. McMahon's study in 2012 showed that dapoxetine has no effect on mood and is not associated with anxiety or suicidality. === Withdrawal === The incidence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome symptoms in men using dapoxetine to treat PE has been described by reviewers as low or no different from the incidence of such symptoms in men withdrawn from placebo treatment. The lack of chronic serotonergic stimulation with on-demand dapoxetine minimizes the potentiation action of serotonin at synaptic cleft, thus decreasing the risk of discontinuation symptoms. == Synthesis == Currently, very few methods are used to synthesize (S)-dapoxetine. This novel approach consists of only six steps in which three main steps are shown above. The initial reactant is trans-cinnamyl alcohol, which is commercially available. Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and Mitsunobu reaction have been used to produce expected (S)-dapoxetine. The overall yield is 35%. This method is considered a good choice compared to the known methods due to high yield and easily obtainable reactants. == Regulatory history == Dapoxetine was created by Eli Lilly and in phase I clinical trial as an antidepressant. It never worked out well as a medication for the treatment of depression, though, and was shelved for a while before subsequently developed to treat PE. In December 2003, Eli Lilly sold the patent for dapoxetine to Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) for US$65 million. Eli Lilly may also receive royalties payment from PPD if the sale exceeds a certain amount. Research into the effectiveness of dapoxetine was revisited in 2020. ALZA is the current owner of dapoxetine, but PPD will receive milestone payments and drug royalties from ALZA. If approved, dapoxetine will be marketed in the US by Ortho McNeil pharmaceutical, Inc. Ortho McNeil and Janssen-Ortho Inc, or Janssen-Cilag are all units of Johnson & Johnson. As at 2005, dapoxetine was in phase III clinical trials, pending review by the FDA. Dapoxetine has been marketed and approved in more than 50 countries. Dapoxetine has been approved in Italy, Spain, Mexico, South Korea, and New Zealand in 2009 and 2010; marketed in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Finland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It has also been approved in France, Russia, Malaysia, Philippines, Argentina, and Uruguay. == See also == == References ==",Dapoxetine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0371154530730564e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007242917199619114)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapoxetine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Dapoxetine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapoxetine?utm_source=openai')])"
3299,"('Crisaborole', 'Eucrisa', 'An 2728', 'Crisaborole (an2728)', 'Crisaborole topical ointment 2%')",Medical,"Crisaborole, sold under the brand name Eucrisa among others, is a nonsteroidal topical medication used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and children. The most common side effects are reactions at the application site (including burning or stinging). Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, although its specific mechanism of action in atopic dermatitis is not known. == Side effects == At the site of application, crisaborole may cause burning or stinging. Rarely, there may be an allergic reaction. == Medical uses == In the US, crisaborole is indicated for topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in people three months of age and older. In the EU, crisaborole was authorized for treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in people two years of age and older with ≤ 40% body surface area (BSA) affected. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Crisaborole is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, mainly acting on phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which causes inflammation. Chemically, crisaborole is a phenoxybenzoxaborole. Inhibition of PDE4B appears to suppress the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-23 and other cytokines, proteins believed to be involved in the immune response and inflammation. People with atopic dermatitis produce high levels of cytokines, which can cause the inflammation of the skin seen in dermatitis. Crisaborole blocks the release of certain cytokines involved in the inflammation process such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins (IL‑2, IL-4, IL-5), and interferon gamma. By blocking their release, crisaborole is expected to ease the inflammation and therefore relieve symptoms of the disease. == Chemistry == Crisaborole (chemical name: 4-[(1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxaborol-5-yl)oxy]benzonitrile) is a member of the class of benzoxaboroles characterized by the presence of a boronic acid hemiester with a phenolic ether and a nitrile. Crisaborole crystallizes into two polymorphs that differ in the conformation of the oxaborole ring. A cocrystal with 4,4'-bipyridine has been prepared and studied by X-ray crystallography. == History == Crisaborole was developed by Anacor Pharmaceuticals for the topical treatment of psoriasis. During preclinical and clinical development, crisaborole was called AN2728 and PF-06930164. The drug was assumed to be potential $2bn-a-year blockbuster, when Pfizer acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals. However, the drug was commercially not successful, reaching only US$147 million in sales in 2018, and US$138 million in sales in 2019. Crisaborole was approved for use in the United States in December 2016 and for use in Canada in June 2018. The safety and efficacy of crisaborole were established in two placebo-controlled trials with a total of 1,522 participants ranging in age from two years of age to 79 years of age, with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. In both trials participants received treatment with either crisaborole or placebo twice daily for 28 days. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trials were completed. Overall, participants receiving crisaborole achieved greater response with clear or almost clear skin after 28 days of treatment. The trials were conducted in the US. Crisaborole, approved for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in the European Union, has been rapidly withdrawn from the European market (March 2020 - February 2022). == See also == Tavaborole – a structurally related topical antifungal developed by Anacor == References ==",Eucrisa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.0531076592742465e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000715833914000541)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-eucrisa-eczema?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=119, start_index=9, title='FDA approves Eucrisa for eczema | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-eucrisa-eczema?utm_source=openai')])"

Hence there is a need to prevent or reduce HCC recurrence after initial curative therapy. Peretinoin is a synthetic oral retinoid showing significant reduction in the incidence of recurrent or new HCC in patients who had received curative HCC therapy. Areas covered: Peretinoin is analysed against the background of molecular pathogenesis of the different causes of HCC. Publications related to peretinoin since 1996 are reviewed, covering clinical characteristics, safety and tolerance profile as well as the current status of clinical development. Expert commentary: Early phase studies are promising but we need to await the results of the ongoing phase III study of peretinoin in hepatitis C related HCC. Long term impact of peretinoin may be diminished by the foreseeable near eradication of hepatitis C by the direct acting antivirals. The high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after initially successful curative therapy emphasize ongoing unmet needs to prevent or reduce HCC recurrence. Retinoid acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A and its related analogues (termed retinoids) has been suggested as a promising chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment. The synthetic oral retinoid peretinoin is the only agent for the secondary chemoprevention of HCC after curative therapy that is currently well applied into clinical development. Here we present an updated summary of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and of preclinical and clinical findings with peretinoin, including its clinical characteristics, safety and tolerability profile and future perspectives for clinical use. Peretinoin is an acyclic retinoid that stimulates retinoic acid receptors (NR1Bs) and produces therapeutic effects on hepatocellular cancer. We have previously shown that NR1B agonists such as Am80 and all trans-retinoic acid suppress pathogenic events in intracerebral hemorrhage. The present study addressed the actions of peretinoin and Am80 against cytotoxicity of a blood protease thrombin on cortico-striatal slice cultures obtained from neonatal rat brains. Application of 100 U/ml thrombin to the slice cultures for 72 h caused cell death in the cortical region and tissue shrinkage in the striatal region. Peretinoin (50 μM) and Am80 (1 μM) counteracted these cytotoxic effects of thrombin, and the effect of peretinoin and Am80 was blocked by LE540, an NR1B antagonist. A broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor K252a (3 μM) attenuated the cytoprotective effect of peretinoin in the cortical region, whereas a specific protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 (1 μM) attenuated the protective effect of peretinoin in the cortical and the striatal regions. On the other hand, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitors such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (50 μM) and Bay11-7082 (10 μM) prevented thrombin-induced shrinkage of the striatal region. Peretinoin and Am80 as well as Bay11-7082 blocked thrombin-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB in striatal microglia and loss of striatal neurons. We also found that daily administration of peretinoin reduced histopathological injury and alleviated motor deficits in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage. These results indicate that NR1B agonists including peretinoin may serve as a therapeutic option for hemorrhagic brain injury.",Peretinoin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008112476789392531), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008630595169961452)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7827668/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=102, start_index=9, title='Peretinoin, an Acyclic Retinoid, for the Secondary Prevention of Hepatocellular Carcinoma - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7827668/?utm_source=openai')])"

3304,"('Betahistine', 'Vasomotal', 'N-methyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine', 'Serc base', 'Pt 9 base')",Medical,"Betahistine, sold under the brand name Serc among others, is an anti-vertigo medication. It is commonly prescribed for balance disorders or to alleviate vertigo symptoms. It was first registered in Europe in 1970 for the treatment of Ménière's disease, but current evidence does not support its efficacy in treating it. == Medical uses == Betahistine was once believed to have some positive effects in the treatment of Ménière's disease and vertigo, but more recent evidence casts doubt on its efficacy. Studies of the use of betahistine have shown a reduction in symptoms of vertigo and, to a lesser extent, tinnitus, but conclusive evidence is lacking at present. Oral betahistine has been approved for the treatment of Ménière's disease and vestibular vertigo in more than 80 countries worldwide, and has been reportedly prescribed for more than 130 million patients. However, betahistine has not been approved for marketing in the United States for the past few decades, and there is disagreement about its efficacy. The Cochrane Library concluded in 2001 that ""Most trials suggested a reduction of vertigo with betahistine and some suggested a reduction in tinnitus but all these effects may have been caused by bias in the methods. One trial with good methods showed no effect of betahistine on tinnitus compared with placebo in 35 patients. None of the trials showed any effect of betahistine on hearing loss. No serious adverse effects were found with betahistine."" An intranasal formulation of betahistine dihydrochloride received orphan drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity associated with Prader–Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Betahistine is also undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). == Contraindications == Betahistine is contraindicated for patients with pheochromocytoma. Patients with bronchial asthma or a history of peptic ulcer need to be closely monitored. == Adverse effects == Patients taking betahistine may experience the following adverse effects: Headache Low level of gastric adverse effects Nausea can be an adverse effect, but patients are often already experiencing nausea owing to vertigo, so it goes largely unnoticed. Patients taking betahistine may experience hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. In the November 2006 issue of ""Drug Safety"", Dr. Sabine Jeck-Thole and Dr. Wolfgang Wagner reported that betahistine may cause allergic and skin-related adverse effects. These include rashes in several areas of the body; itching and urticaria (hives); and swelling of the face, tongue, and mouth. Other hypersensitivity reactions reported include tingling, numbness, burning sensations, shortness of breath, and laboured breathing. The study authors suggested that hypersensitivity reactions may be a direct result of betahistine's role in increasing histamine concentrations throughout the body. Hypersensitivity reactions quickly subside after betahistine has been discontinued. === Digestive === Betahistine may also cause several digestive-related adverse effects. The package insert for Serc, a trade name for betahistine, states that patients may experience several gastrointestinal side effects. These may include nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, and stomach cramping. These symptoms are usually not serious and subside between doses. Patients experiencing chronic digestive problems may lower their dose to the minimum effective and may mitigate the effects by taking betahistine with meals. Additional digestive problems may require that patients consult their physician in order to find a possible suitable alternative. === Others === People taking betahistine may experience several other adverse effects ranging from mild to serious. The package insert for Serc states that patients may experience nervous-system side effects, including headache. Some nervous system events may also partly be attributable to the underlying condition, rather than the medication used to treat it. Jeck-Thole and Wagner also reported that patients may experience headache and liver problems, including increased liver enzymes and bile-flow disturbances. Any adverse effects that persist or outweigh the relief of symptoms of the original condition may warrant that the patient consult their physician to adjust or change the medication. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Betahistine is a weak antagonist or inverse agonist at histamine H₃ receptors and a weak partial agonist at histamine H₁ receptors. Betahistine primarily acts on histamine H₁ receptors located on blood vessels in the inner ear, leading to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. These effects help to alleviate endolymphatic hydrops, a key factor in Ménière's disease. Additionally, betahistine interacts with histamine H₃ receptors as a weak antagonist or inverse agonist. By modulating H₃ receptors, betahistine increases the release of various neurotransmitters, including histamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA from nerve endings. This mechanism contributes to improved blood flow in the inner ear and modulation of vestibular compensation. Betahistine's effects on neurotransmitter release, particularly serotonin, may also play a role in its modulation of vestibular nuclei activity in the brainstem. These combined actions help alleviate symptoms associated with vestibular disorders. === Pharmacokinetics === Betahistine comes in both a tablet form and as an oral solution, and is taken orally. It is rapidly and completely absorbed. The mean plasma elimination half-life is 3 to 4 hours, and excretion is virtually complete in the urine within 24 hours. Plasma protein binding is very low. Betahistine is converted to aminoethylpyridine and hydroxyethylpyridine and excreted in the urine as pyridylacetic acid. There is some evidence that one of these metabolites, aminoethylpyridine, may be active and have effects similar to those of betahistine on ampullar receptors. == Chemistry == Betahistine chemically is 2-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]pyridine, and is formulated as the dihydrochloride salt. Its chemical structure closely resembles those of phenethylamine and histamine. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Betahistine is marketed under a number of brand names, including Veserc, Serc, Hiserk, Betaserc, and Vergo. === Availability === Betahistine is widely used and available in over 115 countries worldwide, including in the United Kingdom. ==== United States ==== Betahistine, marketed as Serc, received initial approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 1966 for the treatment of Ménière's disease. This approval was based on a single clinical study conducted by Joseph Elia and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in April of that year. However, concerns soon arose regarding the study's methodology and the strength of its findings, with public criticism appearing in publications such as the Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics. This prompted an FDA investigation, culminating in the agency obtaining Elia's original study data in April 1967. Subsequent review of the data revealed inadequacies, leading the FDA to issue a notice of intent to withdraw approval in 1968. Instead of immediate withdrawal, the FDA engaged in discussions with Unimed, the manufacturer, regarding the design of a new clinical trial. This decision not to immediately remove betahistine from the market drew congressional scrutiny, particularly from Representative Lawrence Fountain, who cited the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's mandate for withdrawal when substantial evidence of efficacy is lacking. Internal dissent within the FDA regarding the original approval and its reliance on a single study further complicated the situation. The controversy unfolded against the backdrop of the 1962 Kefauver–Harris Amendment, which had strengthened requirements for demonstrating drug efficacy. Ultimately, the FDA terminated betahistine's new drug application on December 21, 1972, following a lawsuit filed by Consumers Union. Unimed's attempted legal challenge to maintain the drug's market presence was also unsuccessful, with the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upholding the FDA's withdrawal. Betahistine remains unapproved by the FDA, although it is available through compounding pharmacies. == See also == 2-Pyridylethylamine == References ==",Vasomotal,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.981667537620524e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008486516773700714), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008642413653433323)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1990. == Uses == It is indicated for use as a single agent in the palliative treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer following first-line therapy with cisplatin and/or alkylating agent-based combination. It is not considered a first-line treatment, but it can be useful as salvage therapy. It also has the advantage of being less toxic than other drugs used for treating refractory ovarian cancer. == Mechanism == The precise mechanism by which altretamine exerts its anti-cancer effect is unknown but it is classified by MeSH as an alkylating antineoplastic agent. This unique structure is believed to damage tumor cells through the production of the weakly alkylating species formaldehyde, a product of CYP450-mediated N-demethylation. Administered orally, altretamine is extensively metabolized on first pass, producing primarily mono- and didemethylated metabolites. Additional demethylation reactions occur in tumor cells, releasing formaldehyde in situ before the drug is excreted in the urine. The carbinolamine (methylol) intermediates of CYP450-mediated metabolism also can generate electrophilic iminium species that are capable of reacting covalently with DNA guanine and cytosine residues as well as protein. Iminium-mediated DNA cross-linking and DNA-protein interstrand cross-linking, mediated through both the iminium intermediate and formaldehyde, have been demonstrated, although the significance of DNA cross-linking on altretamine antitumor activity is uncertain. == Side effects == Side effects include nausea, vomiting, anemia and peripheral sensory neuropathy. == Interactions == Combination with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) decreases neurotoxicity but has been found to reduce the effectiveness of an altretamine/cisplatin regime.

Specifically it is used together with a corticosteroid for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). It should either be used following removal of the testicles or along with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include tiredness, vomiting, headache, joint pain, high blood pressure, swelling, low blood potassium, high blood sugar, hot flashes, diarrhea, and cough. Other severe side effects may include liver failure and adrenocortical insufficiency. In males whose partners can become pregnant, birth control is recommended. Supplied as abiraterone acetate it is converted in the body to abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate works by suppressing the production of androgens – specifically it inhibits CYP17A1 – and thereby decreases the production of testosterone. In doing so, it prevents the effects of these hormones in prostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate was described in 1995, and approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 2011. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Abiraterone acetate is used in combination with prednisone, a corticosteroid, as a treatment for mCRPC (previously called hormone-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer). This is a form of prostate cancer that is not responding to first-line androgen deprivation therapy or treatment with androgen receptor antagonists. Abiraterone acetate has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (28 April 2011), European Medicines Agency (EMA) (23 September 2011), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (5 September 2011) and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) (1 March 2012) approval for this indication. In Australia it is covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme when being used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer and given in combination with prednisone/prednisolone (subject to the conditions that the patient is not currently receiving chemotherapy, is either resistant or intolerant of docetaxel, has a WHO performance status of <2, and his disease has not since become progressive since treatment with PBS-subsidised abiraterone acetate has commenced). Abiraterone acetate/methylprednisolone, sold under the brand name Yonsa Mpred, is a composite package that contains both abiraterone acetate (Yonsa) and methylprednisolone. It was approved for medical use in Australia in March 2022. == Contraindications == Contraindications include hypersensitivity to abiraterone acetate. Although documents state that it should not be taken by women who are or who may become pregnant, there is no medical reason that any woman should take it. Women who are pregnant should not even touch the pills unless they are wearing gloves. Other cautions include severe baseline hepatic impairment, mineralocorticoid excess, cardiovascular disease including heart failure and hypertension, uncorrected hypokalemia, and adrenocorticoid insufficiency. == Side effects == Side effects by frequency: Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1-10% frequency): Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency): Adrenal insufficiency Myopathy Rhabdomyolysis Rare (<0.1% frequency): Allergic alveolitis == Overdose == Experience with overdose of abiraterone acetate is limited. There is no specific antidote for abiraterone acetate overdose, and treatment should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of cardiac and liver function. == Interactions == Abiraterone acetate is a CYP3A4 substrate and hence should not be administered concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) or inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital. It also inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 and likewise should not be taken concurrently with substrates of any of these enzymes that have a narrow therapeutic index. Spironolactone generally exerts anti-androgenic effects, but experimental evidence exists that it acts as an androgen receptor agonist in an androgen-depleted environment, capable of inducing prostate cancer proliferation. This is supported by the observations described in several case reports. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Abiraterone, the active metabolite of abiraterone acetate, inhibits CYP17A1, which manifests as two enzymes, 17α-hydroxylase (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 2.5 nM) and 17,20-lyase (IC50 = 15 nM) (approximately 6-fold more selective for inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase over 17,20-lyase) that are expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues. CYP17A1 catalyzes two sequential reactions: (a) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivatives by its 17α-hydroxylase activity, and (b) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by its 17,20-lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17A1 activity by abiraterone acetate thus decreases circulating levels of androgens such as DHEA, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Abiraterone acetate, via abiraterone, has the capacity to lower circulating testosterone levels to less than 1 ng/dL (i.e., undetectable) when added to castration. These concentrations are considerably lower than those achieved by castration alone (~20 ng/dL). The addition of abiraterone acetate to castration was found to reduce levels of DHT by 85%, DHEA by 97 to 98%, and androstenedione by 77 to 78% relative to castration alone. In accordance with its antiandrogenic action, abiraterone acetate decreases the weights of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and testes. Abiraterone also acts as a partial antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), and as an inhibitor of the enzymes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), CYP11B1 (steroid 11β-hydroxylase), CYP21A2 (Steroid 21-hydroxylase), and other CYP450s (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4). In addition to abiraterone itself, part of the activity of the drug has been found to be due to a more potent active metabolite, δ4-abiraterone (D4A), which is formed from abiraterone by 3β-HSD. D4A is an inhibitor of CYP17A1, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase, and 5α-reductase, and has also been found to act as a competitive antagonist of the AR reportedly comparable to the potent antagonist enzalutamide. However, the initial 5α-reduced metabolite of D4A, 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is an agonist of the AR, and promotes prostate cancer progression. Its formation can be blocked by the coadministration of dutasteride, a potent and selective 5α-reductase inhibitor. ==== Estrogenic activity ==== There has been interest in the use of abiraterone acetate for the treatment of breast cancer due to its ability to lower estrogen levels. However, abiraterone has been found to act as a direct agonist of the estrogen receptor, and induces proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. If abiraterone acetate is used in the treatment of breast cancer, it should be combined with an estrogen receptor antagonist like fulvestrant. In spite of its antiandrogenic and estrogenic properties, abiraterone acetate does not appear to produce gynecomastia as a side effect. ==== Other activities ==== Due to inhibition of glucocorticoid biosynthesis, abiraterone acetate can cause glucocorticoid deficiency, mineralocorticoid excess, and associated adverse effects. This is why the medication is combined with prednisone, a corticosteroid, which serves as a means of glucocorticoid replacement and prevents mineralocorticoid excess. Abiraterone acetate, along with galeterone, has been identified as an inhibitor of sulfotransferases (SULT2A1, SULT2B1b, SULT1E1), which are involved in the sulfation of DHEA and other endogenous steroids and compounds, with Ki values in the sub-micromolar range. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, abiraterone acetate, the prodrug form in the commercial preparation, is converted into the active form, abiraterone. This conversion is likely to be esterase-mediated and not CYP-mediated. Administration with food increases absorption of the drug and thus has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures; the drug should be consumed on an empty stomach at least one hour before or two hours after food. The drug is highly protein bound (>99%), and is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 to inactive metabolites. The drug is excreted in feces (~88%) and urine (~5%), and has a terminal half-life of 12 ± 5 hours. == Chemistry == Abiraterone acetate, also known as 17-(3-pyridinyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3β-ol acetate, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of androstadienol (androsta-5,16-dien-3β-ol), an endogenous androstane pheromone. It is specifically a derivative of androstadienol with a pyridine ring attached at the C17 position and an acetate ester attached to the C3β hydroxyl group. Abiraterone acetate is the C3β acetate ester of abiraterone. == History == In the early 1990s, Mike Jarman, Elaine Barrie, and Gerry Potter of the Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics in the Institute of Cancer Research in London set out to develop drug treatments for prostate cancer. With the nonsteroidal androgen synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole as a model, they developed abiraterone acetate, filing a patent in 1993 and publishing the first paper describing it the following year. Rights for commercialization of the drug were assigned to BTG, a UK-based specialist healthcare company. BTG then licensed the product to Cougar Biotechnology, which began development of the commercial product. In 2009, Cougar was acquired by Johnson & Johnson, which developed and sells the commercial product, and is conducting ongoing clinical trials to expand its clinical uses. Abiraterone acetate was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on 28 April 2011 for mCRPC. The FDA press release made reference to a phase III clinical trial in which abiraterone acetate use was associated with a median survival of 14.8 months versus 10.9 months with placebo; the study was stopped early because of the successful outcome. Abiraterone acetate was also licensed by the European Medicines Agency. Until May 2012 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) did not recommend use of the drug within the NHS on cost-effectiveness grounds. This position was reversed when the manufacturer submitted revised costs. The use is currently limited to men who have already received one docetaxel-containing chemotherapy regimen. It was subsequently approved for the treatment of mCSPC in 2018. == Society and culture == === Names === Abiraterone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name of abiraterone acetate's major active metabolite abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate is the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name Modified, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of abiraterone acetate. It is also known by its developmental code names CB-7630 and JNJ-212082, while CB-7598 was the developmental code name of abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate is marketed by Janssen Biotech (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) under the brand name Zytiga, and by Sun Pharmaceutical under the brand name Yonsa. Generic versions of abiraterone acetate have been approved in the United States. Generic versions of Yonsa are not available as of November 2019. In May 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision invalidating a patent by Johnson & Johnson on abiraterone acetate. Intas Pharmaceuticals markets the drug under the brand name Abiratas, Cadila Pharmaceuticals markets the drug as Abretone, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals as Abirapro. It is marketed as Yonsa by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (licensed from Churchill Pharmaceuticals). === Brand names === Abiraterone acetate is marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, and Israel. === Economics === A generic version is available in India at a price of $238 a month as of 2019. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics initially found abiraterone acetate to not be cost effective based on prices in 2012, however following an agreement to supply at a lower price it was accepted in 2014. A generic Zytiga version is available in India at a price of under $230 a month as of 2020. == Research == Abiraterone acetate is under development for the treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer and as of March 2018, is in phase II clinical trials for these indications. It was also under investigation for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but no further development has been reported for this potential use. == Prostate cancer == In people previously treated with docetaxel survival is increased by 3.9 months (14.8 months versus 10.9 months for placebo). In people with castration-refractory prostate cancer but who had not received chemotherapy those who received abiraterone acetate had a progression-free survival of 16.5 months rather than 8.3 months with placebo. After a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, overall survival was better with abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate may be useful for prevention of the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. == References ==",Zytiga,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.033323527139146e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002051381452474743)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/zytiga.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=75, start_index=9, title='Zytiga: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/zytiga.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3311,"('Pomalidomide', 'Actimid', 'Pomalyst', 'Imnovid', 'Cc 4047')",Medical,"Pomalidomide, sold under the brand names Pomalyst and Imnovid, is an anti-cancer medication used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. Pomalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2013, and in the European Union in August 2013. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == In the European Union, pomalidomide, in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone, is indicated in the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior treatment regimen including lenalidomide; and in combination with dexamethasone is indicated in the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior treatment regimens, including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. In the United States, pomalidomide is indicated, in combination with dexamethasone, for people with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy; and is indicated for people with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma after failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or in people with Kaposi sarcoma who are HIV-negative. == Origin and development == The parent compound of pomalidomide, thalidomide, was originally discovered to inhibit angiogenesis in 1994. Based upon this discovery, thalidomide was taken into clinical trials for cancer, leading to its ultimate FDA approval for multiple myeloma. Structure-activity studies revealed that amino substituted thalidomide had improved antitumor activity, which was due to its ability to directly inhibit both the tumor cell and vascular compartments of myeloma cancers. This dual activity of pomalidomide makes it more efficacious than thalidomide in vitro and in vivo. == Mechanism of action == Pomalidomide directly inhibits angiogenesis and myeloma cell growth. This dual effect is central to its activity in myeloma, rather than other pathways such as TNF alpha inhibition, since potent TNF inhibitors including rolipram and pentoxifylline do not inhibit myeloma cell growth or angiogenesis. Upregulation of interferon gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 as well as downregulation of IL-6 have been reported for pomalidomide. These changes may contribute to pomalidomide's anti-angiogenic and anti-myeloma activities. Like thalidomide, pomalidomide works as a cereblon E3 ligase modulator. == Side effects == Pomalidomide can cause harm to unborn babies when administered during pregnancy. Pomalidomide is present in the semen of people receiving the drug. == Clinical trials == Phase I trial results showed tolerable side effects. Phase II clinical trials for multiple myeloma and myelofibrosis reported 'promising results'. Phase III results showed significant extension of progression-free survival, and overall survival (median 11.9 months vs. 7.8 months; p = 0.0002) in patients taking pomalidomide and dexamethasone vs. dexamethasone alone. == References ==",Imnovid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.038458114839159e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034600470098666847)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomalidomide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Pomalidomide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomalidomide?utm_source=openai')])"
3312,"('Cutamesine dihydrochloride', 'Cutamesine', '[11c]sa4503', 'Cutamesine [inn]', ""N-phenylpropyl-n''''-3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl piperazine"")",Medical,"Cutamesine (SA 4503) is a synthetic sigma receptor agonist which is selective for the σ1 receptor, a chaperone protein mainly found in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells in the central nervous system. These σ1 receptors play a key role in the modulation of Ca2+ release and apoptosis. Cutamesine's activation of the σ1 receptor is tied to a variety of physiological phenomena in the CNS, including activation of dopamine-releasing neurons and repression of the MAPK/ERK pathway. == Structure == The molecular formula for cutamesine is C23H32N2O2. This particular agonist is a piperazine, meaning that its core functional group is a six-membered heterocycle with two oppositely-placed nitrogen atoms. Two phenalkyl groups act as substituents for the two nitrogen atoms. The phenethyl group has methoxy groups on the 3 and 4 locations of the aromatic ring, while the phenpropyl group has no additional functional groups attached. == Affinity == === Causes of Affinity === The 3,4-methoxy groups located on the phenethyl group play an important role in σ receptor binding affinity, with alterations made to these groups leading to changes in affinity to σ1. Replacement side groups that possess the most steric bulk have the lowest binding affinity for the σ1 receptor. The nitrogen atoms in the molecule play a central role in its affinity, as removal of these nitrogen atoms results in a lack of affinity to σ1. N(b) - the nitrogen in the piperazine attached to the longest substituent - plays a much greater role in binding affinity than N(a). Sigma receptors are defined by the presence of one amine binding site and three hydrophobic binding sites nearby in the ligand-binding region. Thus, the N(b) atom in the central piperazine ring serves to interact with the amine binding site and the two phenethyl groups serve to fill two out of the three hydrophobic pockets. === Binding Trends === Cutamesine exhibits high binding affinity for the σ1 receptor, with greatly reduced affinity for the σ2 receptor. It acts as a competitive inhibitor for (+)-[3H]pentazocine. Haloperidol and NE-100 antagonize cutamesine-induced cholinergic (acetylcholine) facilitation. Cutamesine likely does not interact directly with cholinergic receptors, as its binding affinity for them is nearly non-existent. It can also bind to vertebral emopamil binding protein (EBP). Although EBP exists at a lower density in the brain than σ1 receptors, cutamesine exhibits higher affinity for the former. == Physiological Effects == === Memory and Amnesia === It has been shown that cutamesine has anti-amnesic properties and could be used to reduce the effects of amnesia caused by REM sleep deprivation. Decreases in the memory function of rats caused by the presence of scopolamine has been shown to be mitigated by the introduction of SA 4503. The activation of the MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway in neurons is repressed by SA 4503, which in turn leads to reduced stress-related cell death. The presence of SA 4503 has a positive impact on the number of active dopaminergic neurons in the frontal cortex, which is linked to improved memory function. === Depression === σ1 receptors are of interest to scientists studying the neurology of depression, as certain antidepressants (ADs) exhibit high affinity for these receptors and σ1 receptor agonists such as SA 4503 have displayed activity similar to that of ADs in non-human trials. The function of dopaminergic systems has been linked to the effectiveness of ADs, and many experiments involving cutamesine have revolved around dopamine. The presence of SA 4503 has been linked to increases in the concentration of dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (a metabolite of dopamine) in the frontal cortex. Cutamesine may assist with the release of dopamine from presynaptic neurons in the frontal cortex. For rodents, there was a negative correlation between SA 4503 levels and immobility time during a forced swimming test. === Heart === The administration of cutamesine has been shown to mitigate the effects of cardiac hypertrophy. Angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy results in lower ATP production and smaller mitochondrial size in cardiomyocytes, and introduction of SA 4503 returns both ATP production and mitochondrial size to baseline. === Hearing === The presence of cutamesine is positively correlated with the presence of hippocampal brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Due to the relationship between the presence of BDNF and ciliary neurotrophic factor and the preservation of auditory nerves, it is thought that cutamesine may have a positive effect on the health of the cochlea. Despite the apparent auditory benefits of cutamesine treatment, it does not prevent hearing loss that is a result of aging. == References == == External links == SA+4503 at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Cutamesine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011703446507453918), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02662423811852932), ('ICAL', -1.0967194612021558e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16026391088962555)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006715370807796717), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutamesine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Cutamesine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutamesine?utm_source=openai')])"
3313,"('Disopyramide', 'Dicorantil', 'Rythmodan', 'Ritmodan', 'Disopiramida')",Medical,"Disopyramide (INN, trade names Norpace and Rythmodan) is an antiarrhythmic medication used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. It is a sodium channel blocker and is classified as a Class 1a anti-arrhythmic agent. Disopyramide has a negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium, significantly decreasing the contractility. Disopyramide also has general anticholinergic effects which contribute to unwanted adverse effects. Disopyramide is available in both oral and intravenous forms. In 1972, when it was one of the only alternatives to quinidine, it was praised for being more potent and somewhat less toxic. However, a 2012 review of antiarrhythmic drugs noted that disopyramide is among the most toxic agents, with a high burden of side effects and increased mortality (compared to placebo) when used to treat atrial fibrillation. == Mechanism of action == Disopyramide's Class 1a activity is similar to that of quinidine in that it targets sodium channels to inhibit conduction. Disopyramide depresses the increase in sodium permeability of the cardiac myocyte during Phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, in turn decreasing the inward sodium current. This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity. Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration. This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium. Anesthetized dogs treated with disopyramide (1 mg/kg) had reduced contractile force of 42%, and the decrease in contractile force from 1 mg/kg of disopyramide was roughly double the decrease seen with quinidine in much higher doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg. Levites proposed a possible secondary mode of action for disopyramide, against reentrant arrhythmias after an ischemic insult. Disopyramide decreases the inhomogeneity between infarcted and normal myocardium refractory periods; in addition to lengthening the refractory period. This decreases the chance of re-entry depolarization, because signals are more likely to encounter tissue in a refractory state which cannot be excited. This provides a possible treatment for atrial and ventricular fibrillation, as it restores pacemaker control of the tissue to the SA and AV nodes. == Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy == Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease, occurring in 1:500 individuals in the general population. It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) intracavitary obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not reduce resting LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that disopyramide controlled release is the most potent agent available for reducing resting pressure gradients and improving symptoms. Disopyramide has been actively used for more than 30 years. Disopyramide administration for obstructive HCM has a IB recommendation in the 2020 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guidelines for treatment of obstructive HCM. A IB treatment recommendation indicates that a treatment is recommended, and may be useful, and beneficial. Negative inotropes improve left ventricular (LV) obstruction by decreasing LV ejection acceleration and hydrodynamic forces on the mitral valve. Disopyramide's particular efficacy is due to its potent negative inotropic effects; in head-to-head comparison, it is more effective for gradient reduction than either beta-blocker or verapamil. Disopyramide is most often administered with beta-blockade. When used in patients resistant to beta-blockade, disopyramide is effective in 60% of cases, reducing symptoms and gradient to the extent that invasive procedures such as surgical septal myectomy are not required. Disopyramide, despite its efficacy, has one main side effect that has limited its use in the US, though it has seen wider application in Canada, UK and Japan. Vagal blockade predictably causes dry mouth, and in men with prostatism, may cause urinary retention. Teichman et al. showed that pyridostigmine used in combination with disopyramide substantially alleviates vagolytic side effects without compromising antiarrhythmic efficacy. This combination has also been shown to be effective and safe in obstructive HCM in a large cohort of patients. Some clinicians prescribe pyridostigmine sustained release (marketed in the US as Mestinon Timespan) to every patient begun on disopyramide. This combination increases acceptance of higher disopyramide dosing, important since there is a dose-response correlation in obstructive HCM, higher doses yielding lower gradients. Another concern about disopyramide has been the hypothetical potential for inducing sudden death from its type 1 anti-arrhythmic effects. However, a multicenter registry and two recent cohort registries have largely reduced this concern, by showing sudden death rates lower than that observed from the disease itself. These concerns about the drug must be viewed from the clinical perspective that disopyramide is generally the last agent that is tried for patients before they are referred for invasive septal reduction with surgical septal myectomy (an open-heart operation) or alcohol septal ablation (a controlled heart attack). Both of these invasive procedures have risk of morbidity and mortality. For selected patients, a trial of oral disopyramide is a reasonable approach before proceeding to invasive septal reduction. Patients who respond to disopyramide are continued on the drug. Those who continue to have disabling symptoms or who experience side effects are promptly referred for septal reduction. Using such a stepped strategy, investigators have reported that survival does not differ from that observed in the age-matched normal United States population. == Side effects == Disopyramide has the following side effects: Mild side effects Dry mouth Polyuria (frequent urination) Constipation Blurred vision Rash Bloating Dizziness Fatigue Serious side effects Breathlessness Chest pain Weight gain == Adverse effects == === Cardiac adverse effects === Acute decompensated heart failure: Disopyramide should not be given to patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function and low ejection fraction. Heart failure is not seen when disopyramide is used in patients with normal or supernormal LV systolic function. Severe hypotension – Disopyramide should not be given to patients with impaired LV systolic function and low ejection fraction. Hypotension is not seen in patients with normal or supernormal LV systolic function. === Extracardiac adverse effects === Disopyramide has atropine-like anticholinergic effects. Urinary retention – Disopyramide should not be given to patients with symptomatic prostatism. Glaucoma Agranulocytosis Additionally, disopyramide may enhance the hypoglycemic effect of gliclazide, insulin, and metformin. == See also == Actisomide == References == == External links == Disopyramide on RxList",Ritmodan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.878139538457617e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015143604250624776)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002613358374219388), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([catalog.md](https://www.catalog.md/drugs/ritmodan.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Ritmodan.

It is the predominant kind of trans-fatty acid found in human milk, in the fat of ruminants, and in dairy products such as milk, butter, and yogurt. Trans fat in human milk may depend on trans fat content in food. Vaccenic acid was discovered in 1928 in animal fats and butter. Mammals convert it into rumenic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid, where it shows anticarcinogenic properties. Cows milk had highest trans-vaccenic acid content in the first few days of the cows being milked, indicating that it is stockpiled similarly to omega-3 fatty acids. Its IUPAC name is (11E)-11-octadecenoic acid, and its lipid shorthand name is 18:1 trans-11. The name was derived from the Latin vacca (cow). Its stereoisomer, cis-vaccenic acid, is found in Sea Buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) oil. Its IUPAC name is (11Z)-11-octadecenoic acid, and its lipid shorthand name is 18:1 cis-11. == Health effects == Obese rats fed a diet enriched with vaccenic acid for 16 weeks had a reduction in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels, with an effect comparable to CLA. This effect was not seen in lean rats. Vaccenic acid accumulates in the orbitofrontal cortex to a higher extent in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Oxidation of omega-7 unsaturated fatty acids on the skin surface, such as palmitoleic acid and vaccenic acid, may be the cause of the phenomenon commonly known as old person smell. Alkaline phosphatase was inhibited 25% by vaccenic acid in osteoblasts. A 2023 University of Chicago study found that trans-vaccenic acid enhances anti-tumor immunity by activating CD8+ T cells.

For colon cancer it is used either alone or with fluorouracil. For small cell lung cancer it is used with cisplatin. It is given intravenously. Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, hair loss, shortness of breath, and fever. Other severe side effects include blood clots, colon inflammation, and allergic reactions. Those with two copies of the UGT1A1*28 gene variant are at higher risk for side effects. Use during pregnancy can result in harm to the baby. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor—it blocks the topoisomerase I enzyme, resulting in DNA damage and cell death. Irinotecan was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is made from the natural compound camptothecin which is found in the Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. == Medical uses == Its main use is in colon cancer, in particular, in combination with other chemotherapy agents. This includes the regimen FOLFIRI, which consists of infusional 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan. The regimen XELIRI consists of capecitabine and irinotecan. It may also be used together with fluorouracil and folinic acid for pancreatic cancer following failure of initial treatment. In February 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved irinotecan liposome, in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin, for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. == Side effects == The most significant adverse effects of irinotecan include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, neutropenia and fever, infections of blood or lungs (sepsis, pneumonia), shock, dehydration, kidney failure and thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets). === Diarrhea === Early diarrhea occurs during or shortly after the infusion of Irinotecan, and is usually transient and infrequently severe. Late diarrhea occurs more than 24 hours after administration of Irinotecan and can be life threatening, sometimes leading to severe dehydration requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit admission. This side-effect is managed with the aggressive use of antidiarrheals such as loperamide or atropine with the first loose bowel movement. === Immunosuppression === The immune system is adversely impacted by irinotecan. This is reflected in lowered white blood cell counts in the blood, in particular the neutrophils. == Mechanism of action == Camptothecin, one of the four major structural classifications of plant-derived anti-cancerous compounds, is a cytotoxic alkaloid which consists of a pentacyclic ring structure containing a pyrrole (3, 4 β) quinoline moiety, an S-configured lactone form, and a carboxylate form. Camptothecin is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I. Its analogue, irinotecan, is activated by hydrolysis to SN-38, and is then inactivated by glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). The inhibition of topoisomerase I by the active metabolite SN-38 eventually leads to inhibition of both DNA replication and transcription. The molecular action of irinotecan occurs by trapping a subset of topoisomerase-1-DNA cleavage complexes, those with a guanine +1 in the DNA sequence. One irinotecan molecule stacks against the base pairs flanking the topoisomerase-induced cleavage site and poisons (inactivates) the topoisomerase 1 enzyme. === Interactive pathway === Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == Pharmacokinetics == === Administration === Irinotecan can be administered by 30- or 90-minute intravenous infusions of either 125 mg/m2 weekly for four of every six weeks or 350 mg/m2 every three weeks. === Distribution === Irinotecan is a hydrophilic compound with a large volume of distribution (400 L/m2). At physiological pH, irinotecan and its active metabolite ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38) are present in two pH-dependent equilibrium isoforms; the anti tumor active lactone ring which hydrolyzed to the carboxylate isoform. In plasma, the majority of irinotecan and SN-38 are bound to albumin, which stabilizes their lactone forms. In blood, irinotecan and SN-38 are bound to platelets and red blood cells. Irinotecan has a linear pharmacokinetic. Population pharmacokinetic models assumed a three-compartmental model for irinotecan and a two-compartmental model for SN-38. SN-38 has a short distribution half-life (approximately 8 min). It reached its peak plasma concentration within 2 h after infusion. Also SN-38 exhibit a second peak in the plasma concentration because of its enterohepatic re-circulation and its release from erythrocytes. === Metabolism === ==== Activation by carboxylesterases and butyrylcholinesteras ==== About 2–5% of the pro-drug irinotecan is hydrolyzed into its active metabolite SN-38 in the liver by two carboxylesterase converting enzymes (CES1 and CES2) and in plasma by butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE). CES2 has a 12.5-fold higher affinity for irinotecan than CES1. While, butyrylcholinesterase has a 6-fold higher activity for irinotecan than CES. After conversion, SN-38 is actively transported to the liver by the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 transporter. ==== Inactivation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases ==== SN-38 is inactivated by glucuronidation to SN-38G (β-glucuronide conjugate) by several uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) in the liver (UGT1A1, UGT1A9) and extra-hepatic (UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A10) and excreted into the bile. Several UGT polymorphisms affects irinotecan pharmacokinetics, for example, the decreased UGT1 activity, may lead to severe toxicity. Also, UGT1A1 conjugates bilirubin and bilirubin glucuronidation is another risk factor for increased toxicity ==== De-conjugation by β-glucuronidases ==== The intestinal bacteria produced β-glucuronidases that de-conjugate SN-38G to SN-38 resulting in entero-hepatic re-circulation of SN-38. ==== Metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes ==== Irinotecan is metabolized by intrahepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 into inactive metabolites APC (7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin) and NPC (7-ethyl-10-[4-amino-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin). NPC can be further converted by CES1 and CES2 in the liver to SN-38. Induction or inhibition of CYP3A enzymes by smoking, some herbs and medications may result in interactions with irinotecan. === Transport to bile === Irinotecan is transported to bile by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins: ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, and ABCG2. === Elimination === Irinotecan clearance is mainly biliary (66%) and estimated 12–21 L/h/m2. All metabolites, except SN-38G, are mainly excreted in feces. Irinotecan elimination half-lives were reported between 5 and 18 h. SN-38 half-lives were reported between 6 and 32 h. There is high (30%) interindividual variability in irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters which can be altered by several factors including age, sex, dose, administration timing, hepatic function, enzyme activity or hematocrit levels. == Pharmacogenomics == Irinotecan is converted by an enzyme into its active metabolite SN-38, which is in turn inactivated by the enzyme UGT1A1 by glucuronidation. === *28 variant patients === People with variants of the UGT1A1 called TA7, also known as the ""*28 variant"", express fewer UGT1A1 enzymes in their liver and often have Gilbert's syndrome. During chemotherapy, they effectively receive a larger than expected dose because their bodies are not able to clear irinotecan as fast as others. In studies this corresponds to higher incidences of severe neutropenia and diarrhea. In 2004, a clinical study was performed that both validated prospectively the association of the *28 variant with greater toxicity and the ability of genetic testing in predicting that toxicity before chemotherapy administration. In 2005, the FDA made changes to the labeling of irinotecan to add pharmacogenomics recommendations, such that irinotecan recipients with a homozygous (both of the two gene copies) polymorphism in UGT1A1 gene, to be specific, the *28 variant, should be considered for reduced drug doses. Irinotecan is one of the first widely used chemotherapy agents that is dosed according to the recipient's genotype. == History == In February 2024, the FDA approved irinotecan liposome, in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin, for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Efficacy was evaluated in NAPOLI 3 (NCT04083235), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial in 770 participants with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had not previously received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Randomization was stratified by region, liver metastases, and ECOG performance status. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive one of the following treatments: NALIRIFOX: irinotecan liposome 50 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, followed by oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 120 minutes, followed by leucovorin 400 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 intravenously over 46 hours, every 2 weeks; Gem+NabP: Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 35 minutes, followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The application was granted orphan drug designation. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Irinotecan received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996, and full approval in 1998. A liposome encapsulated version of irinotecan sold under the brand name Onivyde, was approved by the FDA in October 2015, to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in October 2016. === Names === During development, it was known as CPT-11. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2015).

Moexipril can be administered alone or with other antihypertensives or diuretics. It works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1995. Moexipril is available from Schwarz Pharma under the trade name Univasc. == Side effects == Moexipril is generally well tolerated in elderly patients with hypertension. Hypotension, dizziness, increased cough, diarrhea, flu syndrome, fatigue, and flushing have been found to affect less than 6% of patients who were prescribed moexipril. == Mechanism of action == As an ACE inhibitor, moexipril causes a decrease in ACE. This blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Blockage of angiotensin II limits hypertension within the vasculature. Additionally, moexipril has been found to possess cardioprotective properties. Rats given moexipril one week prior to induction of myocardial infarction, displayed decreased infarct size. The cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors are mediated through a combination of angiotensin II inhibition and bradykinin proliferation. Increased levels of bradykinin stimulate in the production of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide, which cause vasodilation and continue to exert antiproliferative effects. Inhibition of angiotensin II by moexipril decreases remodeling effects on the cardiovascular system. Indirectly, angiotensin II stimulates of the production of endothelin 1 and 3 (ET1, ET3) and the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), all of which have tissue proliferative effects that are blocked by the actions of moexipril. The antiproliferative effects of moexipril have also been demonstrated by in vitro studies where moexipril inhibits the estrogen-stimulated growth of neonatal cardiac fibroblasts in rats. Other ACE inhibitors have also been found to produce these actions, as well. == Pharmacology == Moexipril is available as a prodrug moexipril hydrochloride, and is metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active compound moexiprilat. Formation of moexiprilat is caused by hydrolysis of an ethyl ester group. Moexipril is incompletely absorbed after oral administration, and its bioavailability is low. The long pharmacokinetic half-life and persistent ACE inhibition of moexipril allows once-daily administration. Moexipril is highly lipophilic, and is in the same hydrophobic range as quinapril, benazepril, and ramipril. Lipophilic ACE inhibitors are able to penetrate membranes more readily, thus tissue ACE may be a target in addition to plasma ACE. A significant reduction in tissue ACE (lung, myocardium, aorta, and kidney) activity has been shown after moexipril use. It has additional PDE4-inhibiting effects. == Synthesis == The synthesis of the all-important dipeptide-like side chain involves alkylation of the tert-butyl ester of L-alanine (2) with ethyl 2-bromo-4-phenylbutanoate (1); the presominane of the desired isomer is attributable to asymmetric induction from the adjacent chiral center. Reaction of the product with hydrogen chloride then cleaves the tert-butyl group to give the half acid (3). Coupling of that acid to the secondary amine on tetrahydroisoquinoline (4) gives the corresponding amine. The tert-butyl ester in this product is again cleaved with hydrogen chloride to afford moexipril (5). == References ==",Univasc,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.793403761344962e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025191735476255417)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlibrary.org](https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/univasc-1/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Univasc (UCB, Inc.): FDA Package Insert', type='url_citation', url='https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/univasc-1/?utm_source=openai')])"

It was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1962. == Medical uses == Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It is similar to methicillin, and has replaced methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are nafcillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA can be treated with vancomycin or other new antibiotics. == Contraindications == The use of oxacillin is contraindicated in individuals that have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to any medication in the penicillin family of antibiotics. Cross-allergenicity has been documented in individuals taking oxacillin that experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction when given cephalosporins and cephamycins. == Adverse effects == Commonly reported adverse effects associated with the use of oxacillin include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, acute interstitial nephritis, and fever. High doses of oxacillin have been reported to cause renal, hepatic, and nervous system toxicity. Common to all members of the penicillin class of drugs, oxacillin may cause acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. As an injection, oxacillin may cause injection site reactions, which may be characterized by redness, swelling, and itching. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of Action === Oxacillin, through its β-lactam ring, covalently binds to penicillin-binding proteins, which are enzymes involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This binding interaction interferes with the transpeptidation reaction and inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a prominent component of the cell wall. By decreasing the integrity of the bacterial cell wall, it is thought that oxacillin and other penicillins kill actively growing bacteria through cell autolysis. == Chemistry == As with other members of the penicillin family, the chemical structure of oxacillin features a 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus with a substituent attached to the amino group. The 6-aminopenicillanic acid nucleus consists of a thiazolidine ring attached to a β-lactam ring, which is the active moiety responsible for the antibacterial activity of the penicillin family. The substituent present on oxacillin is thought to impart resistance to degradation via bacterial β-lactamases. == History == Oxacillin, a derivative of methicillin, was first synthesized in the early 1960s as part of a research initiative led by Peter Doyle and John Naylor of Beecham, in consort with Bristol-Myers. Members of the isoxazolyl penicillin family, which includes cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and oxacillin, were synthesized to counter the increasing prevalence of infections caused by penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. While methicillin could only be administered via injection, the isoxazolyl penicillins, including oxacillin, could be given orally or by injection. Following the synthesis of cloxacillin and oxacillin, Beecham retained the right to commercially develop cloxacillin in the United Kingdom while Bristol-Myers was given the marketing rights for oxacillin in the United States. == Society and Culture == === FDA Approval History === April 8, 1971: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Sandoz July 27, 1973: Bactocill Capsule Applicant: GlaxoSmithKline March 10, 1980: Oxacillin Sodium Capsule Applicant: Ani Pharms Inc May 15, 1980: Oxacillin Sodium for Solution Applicant: TEVA June 2, 1981: Bactocill for Solution Applicant: GlaxoSmithKline December 23, 1986: Oxacillin Sodium Powder Applicant: Sandoz September 29, 1988: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Watson Labs Inc October 26, 1988: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Watson Labs Inc October 26, 1989: Bactocill in Plastic Container Injectable Applicant: Baxter Healthcare March 30, 2012: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Sagent Pharms January 18, 2013: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Aurobindo Pharma LTD August 25, 2014: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Mylan Labs LTD December 11, 2015: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Hospira Inc July 31, 2017: Oxacillin Sodium Injectable Applicant: Wockhardt Bio/Ag === Pricing === The average wholesale price (AWP) for oxacillin products are provided as follows.

CC-90010-ST-001 (NCT03220347) is an open-label phase I study of trotabresib, an oral BET inhibitor, in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Primary endpoints were the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and RP2D of trotabresib. Secondary endpoints were clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD] of ≥4 months' duration), objective response rate (CR + PR), duration of response or SD, progression-free survival, overall survival, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of trotabresib. In addition, part C assessed the effects of food on the PK of trotabresib as a secondary endpoint. The dose escalation (part A) showed that trotabresib was well tolerated, had single-agent activity, and determined the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule for the expansion study. Here, we report long-term follow-up results from part A (N = 69) and data from patients treated with the RP2D of 45 mg/day 4 days on/24 days off or an alternate RP2D of 30 mg/day 3 days on/11 days off in the dose-expansion cohorts (parts B [N = 25] and C [N = 41]). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are reported in almost all patients. The most common severe TRAEs are hematological. Toxicities are generally manageable, allowing some patients to remain on treatment for ≥2 years, with two patients receiving ≥3 years of treatment. Trotabresib monotherapy shows antitumor activity, with an ORR of 13.0% (95% CI, 2.8-33.6) in patients with R/R DLBCL (part B) and an ORR of 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0-8.6) and a CBR of 31.7% (95% CI, 18.1-48.1) in patients with advanced solid tumors (part C). These results support further investigation of trotabresib in combination with other anticancer agents. The bromodomain and extraterminal protein (BET) inhibitor trotabresib has demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors, including high-grade gliomas. CC-90010-GBM-001 (NCT04047303) is a phase I study investigating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and CNS penetration of trotabresib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas scheduled for salvage resection. Patients received trotabresib 30 mg/day on days 1-4 before surgery, followed by maintenance trotabresib 45 mg/day 4 days on/24 days off after surgery. Primary endpoints were plasma pharmacokinetics and trotabresib concentrations in resected tissue. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity. Twenty patients received preoperative trotabresib and underwent resection with no delays or cancelations of surgery; 16 patients received maintenance trotabresib after recovery from surgery. Trotabresib plasma pharmacokinetics were consistent with previous data. Mean trotabresib brain tumor tissue:plasma ratio was 0.84 (estimated unbound partition coefficient [KPUU] 0.37), and modulation of pharmacodynamic markers was observed in blood and brain tumor tissue. Trotabresib was well tolerated; the most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event during maintenance treatment was thrombocytopenia (5/16 patients). Six-month progression-free survival was 12%. Two patients remain on treatment with stable disease at cycles 25 and 30. Trotabresib penetrates the blood-brain-tumor barrier in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma and demonstrates target engagement in resected tumor tissue. Plasma pharmacokinetics, blood pharmacodynamics, and safety were comparable with previous results for trotabresib in patients with advanced solid tumors. Investigation of adjuvant trotabresib + temozolomide and concomitant trotabresib + temozolomide + radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is ongoing (NCT04324840). Standard-of-care treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM), consisting of surgery followed by radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), has improved outcomes compared with RT alone; however, prognosis remains poor. Trotabresib, a novel bromodomain and extraterminal inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with high-grade gliomas. In this phase Ib, dose-escalation study (NCT04324840), we investigated trotabresib 15, 30, and 45 mg combined with TMZ in the adjuvant setting and trotabresib 15 and 30 mg combined with TMZ+RT in the concomitant setting in patients with ndGBM. Primary endpoints were to determine safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of trotabresib. Secondary endpoints were assessment of preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics were investigated as an exploratory endpoint. The adjuvant and concomitant cohorts enrolled 18 and 14 patients, respectively. Trotabresib in combination with TMZ or TMZ+RT was well tolerated; most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate. Trotabresib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in both settings were consistent with previous data for trotabresib monotherapy. The RP2D of trotabresib was selected as 30 mg 4 days on/24 days off in both settings. At last follow-up, 5 (28%) and 6 (43%) patients remain on treatment in the adjuvant and concomitant settings, respectively, with 1 patient in the adjuvant cohort achieving complete response. Trotabresib combined with TMZ in the adjuvant setting and with TMZ+RT in the concomitant setting was safe and well tolerated in patients with ndGBM, with encouraging treatment durations.

3319,"('Aliskiren', 'Rasilez', 'Aliskiren(cgp 60536)', 'Enviage', 'Riprazo')",Medical,"Aliskiren (brand names Tekturna and Rasilez) is the first in a class of drugs called direct renin inhibitors. It is used for essential (primary) hypertension. While used for high blood pressure, other better studied medications are typically recommended due to concerns of higher side effects and less evidence of benefit. In December 2011, Novartis halted a trial of the drug after discovering increased nonfatal stroke, kidney complications, high blood potassium, and low blood pressure in people with diabetes and kidney problems. As a result, in 2012: A new contraindication was added to the product label concerning the use of aliskiren with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in patients with diabetes because of the risk of kidney impairment, low blood pressure, and high levels of potassium in the blood. A warning to avoid use of aliskiren with ARBs or ACEIs was also added for patients with moderate to severe kidney impairment (i.e., where glomerular filtration rate is less than 60 ml/min). Novartis decided to stop marketing Valturna (aliskiren/valsartan). Aliskiren was co-developed by the Swiss pharmaceutical companies Novartis and Speedel. == Medical uses == While used for high blood pressure, other better-studied medications are typically recommended. Prescrire has stated that aliskiren is potentially more harmful than beneficial and thus list it as a drug to avoid (as of 2014). == Adverse effects == Angioedema - The ADE of angioedema found in patients using Aliskiren is due to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation which occurs within the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAAS) High blood potassium level (particularly when used with ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients) Low blood pressure (particularly in volume-depleted patients) Diarrhea and other GI symptoms Headache Dizziness Cough == Contraindications == Pregnancy: Other drugs such as ACE inhibitors, also acting on the renin–angiotensin system, have been associated with fetal malformations and neonatal death. Angiotensin cannot be used in patients who are pregnant because it will result in disruption of normal fetal kidney development. Breastfeeding: During animal studies, the drug has been found present in milk. Aliskiren has been shown to increase the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes and kidney or heart disease. == Drug interactions == Aliskiren is a minor inhibitor of substrate CYP3A4 and, more importantly, P-glycoprotein: It reduces furosemide blood concentration. Atorvastatin may increase aliskiren's blood concentration, but no dose adjustment is needed. Due to possible interaction with ciclosporin, the use of ciclosporin and aliskiren at the same time is contraindicated. Caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole and other moderate P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, or amiodarone. Recommendations have been made to stop prescribing aliskiren-containing medicines to patients with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) or with moderate to severe kidney impairment who are also taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Such patients should consider alternative antihypertensive treatment as necessary. == Mechanism of action == Aliskiren is an inhibitor of renin. Renin, the first enzyme in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, plays a role in blood pressure control. It cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is in turn converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II has both direct and indirect effects on blood pressure. It directly causes arterial smooth muscle to contract, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which causes the tubules of the kidneys to increase reabsorption of sodium, with water following, thereby increasing plasma volume, and thus blood pressure. Aliskiren binds to the S3bp binding site of renin, essential for its activity. Binding to this pocket prevents the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Aliskiren is also available as combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. == Chemistry == The chemical name for aliskiren is (2 S,4S,5S,7S)-5-amino-N-(2-carbamoyl-2-methylpropyl)-4-hydroxy-2-isopropyl-7-[ 4-methoxy-3-(3-methoxypropoxy)benzyl]-8-methylnonanamide. == Rationale for design == Many drugs control blood pressure by interfering with angiotensin or aldosterone. However, when these drugs are used chronically, the body increases renin production, which drives blood pressure up again. Therefore, pharmacologists have been looking for a drug to inhibit renin directly. Aliskiren is the first drug to do so. == References == == External links == ""Aliskiren"". Drug Information Portal.

Aberrant c-Kit activation protects cells from apoptosis and enhances invasion of colon carcinoma cells. Tandutinib is a novel quinazoline-based inhibitor of the type III receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Kit. We determined the effect of tandutinib on colon cancer growth and identified a mechanism of action. Tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of c-Kit, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6 kinase. In addition, tandutinib significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of colon cancer cell lines but did not affect normal colonic epithelial cells. There were increased levels of activated caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio, coupled with a reduction in cyclin D1, suggesting apoptosis. There was also a downregulation of COX-2, VEGF, and interleukin-8 expression, suggesting effects on cancer-promoting genes. In addition, overexpressing constitutively active Akt partially suppressed tandutinib-mediated colon cancer cell growth. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of tandutinib significantly suppressed growth of colon cancer tumor xenografts. There was a reduction in CD31-positive blood vessels, suggesting that there was an effect on angiogenesis. Tandutinib treatment also inhibited the expression of cancer-promoting genes COX-2 and VEGF and suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling proteins in the xenograft tissues. Together, these data suggest that tandutinib is a novel potent therapeutic agent that can target the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis. A Phase II trial of bevacizumab plus tandutinib. We enrolled 41 recurrent, bevacizumab-naive glioblastoma patients for a trial of bevacizumab plus tandutinib. Median age was 55 and 71% were male. Treatment consisted of tandutinib 500 mg two-times a day (b.i.d.) and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks starting day 15. Of 37 (90%) evaluable, nine (24%) had partial response. Median overall and progression-free survival was 11 and 4.1 months; progression-free survival at 6 months was 23%. All patients suffered treatment-related toxicities; common grade ≥3 toxicities were hypertension (17.1%), muscle weakness (17.1%), lymphopenia (14.6%) and hypophosphatemia (9.8%). Four of six with grade ≥3 tandutinib-related myasthenic-like muscle weakness had electromyography-proven neuromuscular junction pathology. Tandutinib with bevacizumab was as effective but more toxic than bevacizumab monotherapy. Tandutinib is a novel inhibitor of tyrosine kinases FLT3, PDGFR and KIT. Our study was to explore the capability of tandutinib to reverse ABC transporter-mediated multidrug resistance. Tandutinib reversed ABCG2-mediated drug resistance in ABCG2-482-R2, ABCG2-482-G2, ABCG2-482-T7 and S1-M1-80 cells and increased the accumulation of doxorubicin, rhodamine 123 and [H(3)] mitoxantrone in ABCG2-overexpressing cells.

3323,"('Estradiol benzoate', 'Œ≤-estradiol 3-benzoate', 'Benzhormovarine', 'Benzoestrofol', 'Benovocylin')",Medical,"Estradiol benzoate (EB), sold under the brand name Progynon-B among others, is an estrogen medication which is used in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low estrogen levels in women, in hormone therapy for transgender women, and in the treatment of gynecological disorders. It is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol benzoate is used in veterinary medicine as well. When used clinically, the medication is given by injection into muscle usually two to three times per week. Side effects of estradiol benzoate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol benzoate is an estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol benzoate was discovered in 1933 and was introduced for medical use that same year. It was the first estradiol ester to be discovered or marketed, and was one of the first estrogens to be used in medicine. Along with estradiol dipropionate, estradiol benzoate was among the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years following its introduction. However, in the 1950s, longer-acting estradiol esters that necessitated less frequent injections, such as estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate, were developed, and have since largely superseded estradiol benzoate. Nonetheless, estradiol benzoate remains widely available throughout the world. It is not available for medical use in the United States, but is available there for use in veterinary medicine. == Medical uses == The medical uses of estradiol benzoate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Estradiol benzoate is used in hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty due to hypogonadism or other causes in women. It is also used in hormone therapy for transgender women. Aside from hormone therapy, estradiol benzoate is used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as menstrual disorders, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and breast engorgement. In addition, it is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol benzoate has a relatively short duration of action, and is administered by intramuscular injection usually two to three times per week. It is used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms at a dosage of 1 to 1.66 mg initially and 0.33 to 1 mg for maintenance two times per week, and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty at a dosage of 1.66 mg two to three times per week. The dosage used in hormone therapy for transgender women is 0.5 to 1.5 mg two to three times per week. In the treatment of prostate cancer, estradiol benzoate is used at a dosage of 1.66 mg three times per week (for a total of 5 mg per week). === Available forms === Estradiol benzoate is and has been available as an oil solution for intramuscular injection provided as vials and ampoules at concentrations of 0.167, 0.2, 0.33, 1, 1.67, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 25 mg/mL. It is also available as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection under the brand name Agofollin Depot. Sistocyclin was the brand name of a product containing 10 mg microcrystalline estradiol benzoate and 200 mg microcrystalline progesterone in an aqueous suspension. Follivirin (and previously Femandren M) is the brand name of a product containing 2.5 mg microcrystalline estradiol benzoate and 25 to 50 mg microcrystalline testosterone isobutyrate in aqueous suspension. A vaginal tablet formulation containing 0.125 mg estradiol benzoate and 10 mg monalazone sodium (a vaginal disinfectant and spermicidal contraceptive) has been marketed under the brand name Malun 25. Estradiol benzoate was also formerly available as 50 and 100 mg pellets for subcutaneous implantation and as a 2 mg/g ointment. == Contraindications == Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. == Side effects == The side effects of estradiol benzoate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. == Overdose == Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Estradiol benzoate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. Estradiol benzoate has very low affinity for the ERs, on the order of 100-fold less than that of estradiol. As such, estradiol benzoate is regarded as essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol. Estradiol benzoate is of about 38% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 benzoate ester. Because estradiol benzoate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. ==== Estrogenic potency ==== In the case of intramuscular injections of either estradiol benzoate or estradiol valerate in oil solution, the maturation dosage for the vaginal epithelium is 5 to 7 mg once per week and the endometrial proliferation dosage is 7 to 10 mg once per week. The total endometrial proliferation dosage of estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection over 14 days is 25 to 35 mg. The full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in oil solution is 1 to 2 mg estradiol benzoate and 20 to 25 mg progesterone by intramuscular injection daily for 10 to 14 days, whereas the full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension is a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 mg progesterone. For comparison, the full endometrial transformation dosage of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution (brand name Gravibinon) is a single intramuscular injection of 10 mg estradiol valerate and 250 to 375 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Endometrial transformation normally occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; it is induced by endogenous progesterone following adequate priming by endogenous estradiol. The decidua (pregnancy-type endometrium) induction dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in oil solution is 2 to 5 mg estradiol benzoate and 20 to 100 mg progesterone by intramuscular injection daily for 5 to 7 weeks, whereas the decidua induction dosage of estradiol benzoate/progesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension is 10 to 20 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 to 250 mg progesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection once per week for about 6 weeks. For comparison, the decidua induction dosage of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution is about the same as that of microcrystalline estradiol benzoate/progesterone in aqueous suspension. The decidua induction dosages of estrogen and progestogen combinations are pseudopregnancy dosages. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== As with other estrogens and forms of estradiol, estradiol benzoate dose-dependently suppresses gonadotropin and testosterone levels in men and transgender women. In a study that administered estradiol benzoate twice-daily to transgender women at a dose that resulted in measured estradiol levels of about 200 to 250 pg/mL, testosterone levels decreased from around 530 ng/dL at baseline to about 55 ng/dL (–90%) within approximately 3 days of treatment. === Pharmacokinetics === Following administration, estradiol benzoate acts as a prodrug of estradiol via cleavage by esterases into estradiol and the natural fatty acid benzoic acid. This cleavage occurs not only in the liver, but also in the blood and in tissues. Esters of estradiol like estradiol benzoate are readily hydrolyzed to estradiol, but have an extended duration when administered in via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection due to a depot effect afforded by their fatty acid ester moiety and consequent high lipophilicity. A long-lasting local tissue depot is formed by the injection that slowly releases estradiol benzoate into the circulation. ==== Intramuscular injection ==== ===== Oil solution ===== The duration of action of estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection at typical clinical doses (e.g., 0.33–1.66 mg) is said to be 2 to 3 days. A single dose of 2.5 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection was found to produce plasma estradiol levels of greater than 400 pg/mL, measured 24 hours post-injection, in a group of patients with minimal baseline levels of estradiol (due to GnRH analogue therapy with triptorelin). The elimination half-life of estradiol benzoate in oil solution by intramuscular injection has been reported to be 48 to 120 hours (2 to 5 days). A single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution has been found to result in peak circulating concentrations of 940 pg/mL estradiol and 343 pg/mL estrone, which occurred at about 2 days post-injection. Compared to two other commonly used estradiol esters, estradiol benzoate had the shortest duration, at approximately 4 to 5 days, whereas estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate were found to last for 7 to 8 days and 11 days, respectively. This is because estradiol benzoate has a shorter and less bulky fatty acid chain, and in relation to this, is comparatively less lipophilic. For a given estradiol ester, the shorter or less bulky the fatty acid chain is, the less lipophilic, shorter-lasting, and less uniform/plateau-like the resultant levels of estradiol are as well as the higher (and hence more spike-like) the peak/maximal levels are. Daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution have been found to produce estradiol excretion rates almost double those of the normal luteal phase. This is in accordance with known production rates of estradiol in women (e.g., 300 μg/day in the luteal phase). ===== Aqueous suspension ===== Microcrystalline estradiol benzoate in aqueous suspension (brand names Agofollin Depot and Ovocyclin M alone and Follivirin in combination with testosterone isobutyrate) has been found to have a longer duration of action than amorphous estradiol benzoate in oil solution when administered via intramuscular injection.: 310 Whereas the duration of a single intramuscular injection of estradiol benzoate in oil solution is 6 days, the duration of a single intramuscular injection of microcrystalline estradiol benzoate in aqueous suspension is 16 to 21 days. Its duration also surpasses that of estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate. The duration of microcrystalline aqueous suspensions administered by intramuscular injection is dependent both on concentration and on crystal size. ==== Other routes ==== The duration of estradiol benzoate is not prolonged if it is administered directly into the circulation via intravenous injection, in contrast to intramuscular injection. Estradiol benzoate is active with oral and sublingual administration, similarly to estradiol valerate and estradiol acetate.: 310 However, it is not marketed in any formulation for use by these routes. Oral estradiol benzoate has been reported to possess about one-third to half the potency of intramuscular injection of estradiol benzoate. This level of oral potency has been described as remarkably high. The sublingual potency of estradiol benzoate is similar to that of estradiol.: 310 A study found that the total dose of estradiol benzoate needed for endometrial proliferation in women was 60 to 140 mg, relative to 60 to 180 mg for estradiol.: 310 Both estradiol and estradiol benzoate has a persistence of estrogenic effect with single administration of one day.: 310 Subcutaneous implantation of crystalline estradiol benzoate pellets has been studied, but no estradiol benzoate pellet implants have been marketed. == Chemistry == Estradiol benzoate is a synthetic estrane steroid and the C3 benzoate (benzenecarboxylate) ester of estradiol. It is also known as estradiol 3-benzoate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 3-benzoate. Two estradiol esters that are related to estradiol benzoate are estradiol dipropionate, the C3,17β dipropionate ester of estradiol, and estradiol acetate, the C3 acetate ester of estradiol. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol benzoate is 4.7. == History == Estradiol benzoate was one of the first estrogens to be developed and marketed. In 1932, Adolf Butenandt described estrone benzoate and reported that it had a prolonged duration of action. Schwenk and Hildebrant at Schering discovered estradiol via reduction of estrone in 1933, and they proceeded to synthesize estradiol benzoate from estradiol the same year. Estradiol benzoate was patented by Schering in 1933 and was introduced in an oil solution for use by intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon B that year as well. By 1936, multiple formulations of estradiol benzoate in oil solution had been marketed, including under the brand names Progynon B by Schering, Dimenformon Benzoate by Roche-Organon, and Oestroform B by British Drug Houses. By the early 1940s, Ben-Ovocylin had been introduced by Ciba as well. In the late 1940s, the brand name Ben-Ovocylin was changed by Ciba to Ovocylin Benzoate. Following their introduction, estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate were the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years. However, estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate, which are longer-acting esters that require less frequent administration, were developed and introduced in the 1950s, and have since largely superseded estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Estradiol benzoate is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while oestradiol benzoate was formerly its BANMTooltip British Approved Name. === Brand names === The major brand name of estradiol benzoate is Progynon-B. It has also been sold under a variety of other brand names including Agofollin Depot, Ben-Ovocylin, Benzhormovarine, Benzoestrofol, Benzofoline, Benzo-Ginestryl, Benzo-Ginoestril, Benzo-Gynoestryl, Benzoate d'oestradiol P.A.

It was previously available for medical use in the United States, but is no longer marketed in this country. However, it is approved and marketed in the United States for veterinary use as a subdermal implant both alone and in combination with the androgen/anabolic steroid trenbolone acetate (brand names Celerin and Synovex, respectively). Outside of the United States, estradiol benzoate is also marketed in combination with progesterone for use as an intramuscular injection. Microcrystalline estradiol benzoate in aqueous suspension is available in the Czech Republic and Slovakia alone under the brand name Agofollin Depot and in combination with microcrystalline testosterone isobutyrate under the brand name Folivirin. == Research == Estradiol benzoate has been studied in combination with norethisterone enanthate as a once-a-month combined injectable contraceptive, but ultimately did not complete development for this indication. == References ==",Estradiol benzoate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.2066785934148356e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38689401745796204)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol_benzoate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Estradiol benzoate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol_benzoate?utm_source=openai')])"
3324,"('Pj-34', 'N~2~,n~2~-dimethyl-n~1~-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)glycinamide', 'Acetamide, n-(5,6-dihydro-6-oxo-2-phenanthridinyl)-2-(dimethylamino)-', 'Pj 34', 'Ibrutinib (pci32765 pound(c)')",Medical," Inhibitors of PARP-1(Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1) act by competing with NAD(+), the enzyme physiological substrate, which play a protective role in many pathological conditions characterized by PARP-1 overactivation. It has been shown that PARP-1 also promotes tumor growth and progression through its DNA repair activity. Since angiogenesis is an essential requirement for these activities, we sought to determine whether PARP inhibition might affect rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (GP8.3) migration, stimulated by C6-glioma conditioned medium (CM). Through wound-healing experiments and MTT analysis, we demonstrated that PARP-1 inhibitor PJ-34 [N-(6-Oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide] abolishes the migratory response of GP8.3 cells and reduces their viability. PARP-1 also acts in a DNA independent way within the Extracellular-Regulated-Kinase (ERK) signaling cascade, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. By western analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM), we analyzed the effects of PJ-34 on PARP-1 expression, phospho-ERK and phospho-Elk-1 activation. The effect of MEK (mitogen-activated-protein-kinase-kinase) inhibitor PD98059 (2-(2-Amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4 H-1-benzopyran-4-one) on PARP-1 expression in unstimulated and in CM-stimulated GP8.3 cells was analyzed by RT-PCR. PARP-1 expression and phospho-ERK activation were significantly reduced by treatment of GP8.3 cells with PJ-34 or PD98059. By LSM, we further demonstrated that PARP-1 and phospho-ERK are coexpressed and share the same subcellular localization in GP8.3 cells, in the cytoplasm as well as in nucleoplasm. Based on these data, we propose that PARP-1 and phospho-ERK interact in the cytosol and then translocate to the nucleus, where they trigger a proliferative response. We also propose that PARP-1 inhibition blocks CM-induced endothelial migration by interfering with ERK signal-transduction pathway. The majority of the clinical trials with poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibitors were conducted or are ongoing in patients with solid tumors, while trials with leukemia patients are less frequent. Surprisingly scarce data is available on the combinatory effects of PARP inhibitors with DNA damaging antitumor drugs in leukemic cells (primary cells or established lines). The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of PJ-34 (PARP-1 inhibitor) on the cytotoxicity of different antileukemic drugs with different DNA damaging mechanisms and potency (doxorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine and chlorambucil) in human leukemic Jurkat and HL-60 cells. Different exposure scenarios were applied: 1) 72 h simultaneous incubation with PJ-34 (2.5 or 5 μM for Jurkat and HL-60 cells, respectively) and a drug used at a wide concentration range; 2) preincubation of the cells with PJ-34 for 24 h and then with a combination of PJ-34 + drug for an additional 48 h; 3) preincubation of the cells with the drug for 24 h with a subsequent incubation with a combination of PJ-34 + drug for an additional 48 h. Cytotoxicity was assessed using a WST-1 reduction test. It was determined that PJ-34, when used in all 3 scenarios, did not induce any significant enhancement of cytotoxicity of the drugs either in Jurkat or in HL-60 cells. Although the results do not confirm the beneficial effects of PARP inhibition in combination treatment of the leukemic cells, we propose that future studies including an additional step with the inhibition of DNA repair by homologous recombination should provide promising results. A combination of a photosensitizer with light of matching wavelength is a common treatment modality in various diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and tumors. DNA damage and production of reactive oxygen intermediates may impact pathological cellular functions and viability. Here we set out to investigate the role of the nuclear DNA nick sensor enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in photochemical treatment (PCT)-induced tumor cell killing. We found that silencing PARP-1 or inhibition of its enzymatic activity with Veliparib had no significant effect on the viability of A431 cells exposed to 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UVA (2.5J/cm(2)) indicating that PARP-1 is not likely to be a key player in either cell survival or cell death of PCT-exposed cells. Interestingly, however, another commonly used PARP inhibitor PJ-34 proved to be a photosensitizer with potency equal to 8-MOP. Irradiation of PJ-34 with UVA caused changes both in the UV absorption and in the 1H NMR spectra of the compound with the latter suggesting UVA-induced formation of tautomeric forms of the compound. Characterization of the photosensitizing effect revealed that PJ-34+UVA triggers overproduction of reactive oxygen species, induces DNA damage, activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8 and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Cell death in this model could not be prevented by antioxidants (ascorbic acid, trolox, glutathione, gallotannin or cell permeable superoxide dismutase or catalase) but could be suppressed by inhibitors of caspase-3 and -8. In conclusion, PJ-34 is a photosensitizer and PJ-34+UVA causes DNA damage and caspase-mediated cell death independently of PARP-1 inhibition.",Pj-34,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.023246990516781807), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06309506297111511), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3869282603263855)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -2.935296834039036e-06)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31692907/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26497583/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=182, start_index=6, title='The phenanthrene derivative PJ34 exclusively eradicates human pancreatic cancer cells in xenografts - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31692907/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=182, start_index=6, title='Small PARP inhibitor PJ-34 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of adult T-cell leukemia cells', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26497583/?utm_source=openai')])"

3326,"('Maltotetraose', 'Amylotetraose', 'Fujioligo 450', 'Œ±-1,4-tetraglucose', 'S9195')","Food, Medical","Maltodextrin is a name shared by two different families of chemicals. Both families are glucose polymers (also called dextrose polymers or dextrins), but have little chemical or nutritional similarity. The digestible maltodextrins (or simply maltodextrins) are manufactured as white solids derived from chemical processing of plant starches. They are used as food additives, which are digested rapidly, providing glucose as food energy. They are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for food and beverage manufacturing in numerous products. Due to their rapid production of glucose, digestible maltodextrins are potential risks for people with diabetes. The digestion-resistant maltodextrins (also called resistant maltodextrins) are defined as nutritional food additives due to their ability upon fermentation in the colon to yield short-chain fatty acids, which contribute to gastrointestinal health. Digestion-resistant maltodextrins are also white solids resulting from the chemical processing of plant starches, but are processed using methods specifically to be resistant to digestion. They are used as ingredients in many consumer products, such as low-calorie sweeteners, and are considered GRAS. Consumers may find the shared name for different maltodextrin food additives to be confusing. == Definition == Digestible maltodextrins are well-defined chemically, understood, and documented. By contrast, digestion-resistant maltodextrins – being the newer and more complex chemical family – are less defined chemically, researched and documented. Maltodextrins are classified by a dextrose equivalent (DE), a number between 3 and 20 that corresponds to the number of free chain ends in a certain sample. A lower DE value means the polymer chains are longer (contain more glucose units) whereas a higher DE value means the chains are shorter. This is an inverse concept compared with the degree of polymerization of the chain. A high-DE maltodextrin is sweeter, more soluble, and has lower heat resistance. Above DE 20, the European Union's CN code calls it glucose syrup; at DE 10 or lower, the customs CN code nomenclature classifies maltodextrins as dextrins. === Digestible maltodextrin === Maltodextrins consist of D-glucose units connected in chains of variable length. The glucose units are primarily linked with α(1→4) glycosidic bonds, like those seen in the linear derivative of glycogen (after the removal of α1,6- branching). Commercial maltodextrin is typically composed of a mixture of chains that vary from three to 17 glucose units long. Properties of maltodextrin, such as sweetness, viscosity, and texture, can be manipulated during manufacturing by altering the extent of starch hydrolysis. Maltodextrins are digested into glucose units, contributing a food energy value of 4 calories per gram (or 16 kiloJoules per gram). Maltodextrin manufacturing produces a high-purity product with microbiological safety, making it applicable to varied food, beverage, sports, and baked products. === Digestion-resistant maltodextrin === Digestion-resistant maltodextrins are a chemical family much larger than the family of digestible maltodextrins. A definition of a digestion-resistant maltodextrin is: ""Resistant maltodextrin/dextrin is a glucose oligosaccharide. Resistant maltodextrin and dextrin products are composed of non-digestible oligosaccharides of glucose molecules that are joined by digestible linkages and non-digestible α-1,2 and α-1,3 linkages."" The chemical is of greater structural complexity than a digestible maltodextrin. The two families of maltodextrins have little in common chemically or nutritionally. Names used to identify digestion-resistant maltodextrin as an ingredient in foods for regulatory purposes include soluble fiber, resistant dextrin, or dextrin. Names may include the food starch used to fabricate the ingredient. The chemical family has had a history of changes in classification. As of 2023, a digestion-resistant maltodextrin is considered a resistant dextrin and a resistant starch of type 5. Another study contrasted resistant dextrins and resistant maltodextrins, finding them to differ chemically and functionally. In that study, the final maltodextrin product required further processing of the resistant dextrin. The chemical family is effectively defined by the food starch and the manufacturing process, both of which may vary according to manufacturing preferences. The digestion-resistant maltodextrin ingredient has several properties exploited in food or beverage manufacturing: it is a low-moisture (5% water), free-flowing, fine white powder that disperses readily in water; it is clear in solution with low viscosity; it is odorless, slightly acidic, and has a bland flavor; it is 90% dietary fiber. The average molecular mass of the digestion-resistant maltodextrin molecule is 2,000 daltons. Digestion-resistant maltodextrin is a soluble (fermentable) dietary fiber with numerous non-starch glycosidic bonds, allowing it to pass through the digestive tract unchanged in physical properties without undergoing digestion, supplying no food energy. In the colon, it is a prebiotic fiber fermented by gut microbiota, resulting in the formation of short-chain fatty acids contributing to gastrointestinal health. == History == After development of food ingredients from starch sources around 1950, digestible maltodextrins were first produced between 1967 and 1973. Digestion-resistant maltodextrins were developed in the 1990s from studies of starch nutrition, leading to the definition of resistant starch. This was accompanied by the detection of digestion-resistant components in food products and manufacturing methods. Some sources typically referred to digestible maltodextrin when describing maltodextrin without further definition of which maltodextrin was used. == Manufacturing == === Digestible maltodextrin production === Maltodextrin can be enzymatically derived from any starch, such as corn, potato, rice or cassava. In the United States, this starch is usually corn; in Europe, it is common to use wheat. A food starch is boiled. The resulting paste is treated with a combination of acid and enzymes to produce maltodextrins. === Digestion-resistant maltodextrin production === Digestion-resistant maltodextrins are manufactured by a process superficially similar to that for digestible maltodextrins. A food starch is exposed to a combination of heat, acid and enzymes before purification. Part of the process deliberately resembles human digestion – thus, the result is digestion-resistant by design. Neither the food starch source nor the process is standardized. A list of 14 preparation methods included three to four different methods, including microwave heating. Similar methods differed in detail, possibly because methods are optimized for the plant starch source. One study provided a detailed description of a laboratory method for producing digestion-resistant maltodextrins, combining several of the listed preparation methods. A step in one method of preparing digestion-resistant maltodextrins is roasting the plant starch in acid conditions. The process breaks the starch molecules into small units, which then recombine with different, more digestion-resistant bonds. Enzymes can be used to break starches apart as an alternative to roasting. A 2023 review found that use of different starch sources and different manufacturing techniques may produce digestion-resistant maltodextrins with varied properties, concluding that manufacturing methods for digestion-resistant maltodextrin lacked standardization. Another 2023 review of methods examined digestion-resistant maltodextrins from three different starch sources (potato, cassava, and sweet potato) using identical manufacturing techniques. The resulting digestion-resistant maltodextrins were measured to have small physical and chemical differences, such as in formation of dextrin crystals and surface porosity, digestion resistance (80-85%), thermal stabilities, solubility, and formation of pastes. The significance of such differences to the quality of processed foods and health is unknown. A third 2023 study showed maltodextrin digestion rates to be a function of molecular structure. == Food uses == In the European Union, wheat-derived maltodextrin is exempt from wheat allergen labeling, as set out in Annex II of EC Regulation No 1169/2011. In the United States, however, it is not exempt from allergen declaration per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, and its effect on a voluntary gluten-free claim must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis per the applicable FDA policy. === Digestible maltodextrin === Maltodextrin has varied applications for food and beverage processing, including medical food, baby food, hospital food, and sports supplement products. It is also used as a substitute for lactose. Maltodextrin is used to improve the texture and mouthfeel of food and beverage products, such as potato chips and ""light"" peanut butter to reduce the fat content. It is an effective flavorant, bulking agent, and sugar substitute. Maltodextrin is easily digestible and can provide a quick source of food energy. Due to its rapid absorption, maltodextrin is used by athletes as an ingredient in sports drinks or recovery supplements to replenish glycogen stores and enhance performance during prolonged exercise. It can be taken as a dietary supplement in powder form, gel packets, energy drinks or oral rinse. Maltodextrin has a high glycemic index of 110, compared to glucose (100) and table sugar (80). In the United States, maltodextrin is considered a safe ingredient (GRAS) for food manufacturing. === Digestion-resistant maltodextrin === Digestion-resistant maltodextrin is included among other sources as functional fiber, meaning its use in foods may provide improved function of the gastrointestinal system. The low molecular weight, low viscosity, high water solubility, and resistance to enzymatic activity allow digestion-resistant maltodextrin to avoid digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. Such properties may be advantageous to add digestion-resistant maltodextrin as a source of fermentable dietary fiber in food manufacturing, while maintaining the sensory qualities of processed foods. Digestion-resistant maltodextrins, as prebiotic dietary fiber, are additives used in processed foods primarily as bulking agents or with the intent to confer a health effect. The characteristics of digestion-resistant maltodextrins allow them to be added to diverse kinds of food products, such as beverages, dairy products, and desserts. They are also relatively low-calorie, colorless, odorless and tasteless. They are nontoxic, chemically stable, and nonreactive with other food ingredients over the range of temperatures required for food preparation and storage. In Europe, the United States, and Canada, industrial digestion-resistant maltodextrin is recognized as a safe ingredient for food manufacturing. == Health research == === Digestible maltodextrin === Due to its liberation of glucose molecules when digested, maltodextrin can cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels when consumed in large quantities, especially for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. As maltodextrin is quickly digested and absorbed, excessive consumption may contribute to weight gain, impaired insulin sensitivity, and elevated blood lipids, if not balanced with an appropriate lifestyle or diet. === Digestion-resistant maltodextrin === Digestion-resistant maltodextrin is a fermentable dietary fiber under research for its potential to lower the risk of hypoglycemia, obesity, and associated disorders of metabolic syndrome. While traversing the colon, digestion-resistant maltodextrin is a substrate for producing short-chain fatty acids – the main energy source of cells lining the colon, thereby contributing to health of the gastrointestinal system. Consumption of foods containing digestion-resistant maltodextrin increases the frequency and volume of bowel movements, potentially relieving constipation. Reviews have concluded that digestion-resistant maltodextrin is classified as a type 5 resistant starch (RS5), a prebiotic dietary fiber having properties that may improve management of diabetes and other disorders of metabolic syndrome. Consumption of food or beverage products containing fermentable dietary fibers, such as digestion-resistant maltodextrin, may cause abdominal discomfort, bloating, and flatulence. === Health claim regulation === In 2014, a scientific panel for the European Food Safety Authority concluded that manufactured foods containing a commercial digestion-resistant dextrin were eligible for a health claim of reducing post-meal blood glucose levels. In 2017, Health Canada included digestion-resistant maltodextrin among manufactured sources of dietary fiber having desirable physiological effects eligible for product labeling. In 2018, the United States FDA issued an industry guidance document stating that foods made with digestion-resistant maltodextrin could be advertised as providing a health benefit from fermentable dietary fiber. == Other uses == Maltodextrin is used to coat pills and tablets, and to formulate powders, in the manufacturing of prescription drugs and dietary supplement products. It is also used as a horticultural insecticide both in the field and in greenhouses. Having no biochemical action, its efficacy is based upon spraying a dilute solution upon the pest insects, whereupon the solution dries, blocks insect spiracles, and causes death by asphyxiation. == See also == Icodextrin Maltose Maltotriose == Notes == == References == == External links == Media related to Maltodextrin at Wikimedia Commons",Maltotetraose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.011360915377736092), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.07932987809181213), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.313506156206131)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.2014441341161728), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.25192946195602417), (' END', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Its major appeal over TEMPO is that it is less expensive, being produced from triacetone amine, which is itself made via the condensation of acetone and ammonia. This makes it economically viable on an industrial scale. In biochemical research, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO has been investigated as an agent for limiting reactive oxygen species. It catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide, facilitates hydrogen peroxide metabolism, and inhibits Fenton chemistry. 4-Hydroxy-TEMPO, along with related nitroxides, are being studied for their potential antioxidant properties.

3331,"('Metronidazole', 'Flagyl', 'Metronidazol', 'Anagiardil', 'Gineflavir')",Medical,"Metronidazole, sold under the brand name Flagyl among others, is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is an option for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridioides difficile colitis if vancomycin or fidaxomicin is unavailable. Metronidazole is available orally (by mouth), as a cream or gel, and by slow intravenous infusion (injection into a vein). Common side effects include nausea, a metallic taste, loss of appetite, and headaches. Occasionally seizures or allergies to the medication may occur. Some state that metronidazole should not be used in early pregnancy, while others state doses for trichomoniasis are safe. Metronidazole is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. Metronidazole began to be commercially used in 1960 in France. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available in most areas of the world. In 2022, it was the 133rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Metronidazole has activity against some protozoans and most anaerobic bacteria (both Gram-negative and Gram-positive classes) but not the aerobic bacteria. Metronidazole is primarily used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontal disease, amoebiasis, oral infections, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery. Metronidazole is bitter and so the liquid suspension contains metronidazole benzoate. This may require hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract and some sources speculate that it may be unsuitable in people with diarrhea or feeding-tubes in the duodenum or jejunum. === Bacterial vaginosis === Drugs of choice for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and clindamycin. An effective treatment option for mixed infectious vaginitis is a combination of clotrimazole and metronidazole. === Trichomoniasis === The 5-nitroimidazole drugs (metronidazole and tinidazole) are the mainstay of treatment for infection with Trichomonas vaginalis. Treatment for both the infected patient and the patient's sexual partner is recommended, even if asymptomatic. Therapy other than 5-nitroimidazole drugs is also an option, but cure rates are much lower. === Giardiasis === Oral metronidazole is a treatment option for giardiasis, however, the increasing incidence of nitroimidazole resistance is leading to the increased use of other compound classes. === Dracunculus === In the case of Dracunculus medinensis (Guinea worm), metronidazole merely facilitates worm extraction rather than killing the worm. === C. difficile colitis === Initial antibiotic therapy for less-severe Clostridioides difficile infection colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin by mouth. In 2017, the IDSA generally recommended vancomycin and fidaxomicin over metronidazole. Vancomycin by mouth has been shown to be more effective in treating people with severe C. difficile colitis. === E. histolytica === Entamoeba histolytica invasive amebiasis is treated with metronidazole for eradication, in combination with diloxanide to prevent recurrence. Although it is generally a standard treatment it is associated with some side effects. === Preterm births === Metronidazole has also been used in women to prevent preterm birth associated with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was found to be higher in women treated with metronidazole. === Hypoxic radiosensitizer === In addition to its anti-biotic properties, attempts were also made to use a possible radiation-sensitizing effect of metronidazole in the context of radiation therapy against hypoxic tumors. However, the neurotoxic side effects occurring at the required dosages have prevented the widespread use of metronidazole as an adjuvant agent in radiation therapy. However, other nitroimidazoles derived from metronidazole such as nimorazole with reduced electron affinity showed less serious neuronal side effects and have found their way into radio-onological practice for head and neck tumors in some countries. === Perioral dermatitis === Canadian Family Physician has recommended topical metronidazole as a third-line treatment for the perioral dermatitis either along with or without oral tetracycline or oral erythromycin as first and second line treatment respectively. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of those treated with the drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with thrombophlebitis. Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and paraesthesia. High doses and long-term systemic treatment with metronidazole are associated with the development of leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system toxicity. Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies. In rare cases, it can also cause temporary hearing loss that reverses after cessation of the treatment. Some evidence from studies in rats indicates the possibility it may contribute to serotonin syndrome, although no case reports documenting this have been published to date. === Mutagenesis and carcinogenesis === In 2016 metronidazole was listed by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Although some of the testing methods have been questioned, oral exposure has been shown to cause cancer in experimental animals and has also demonstrated some mutagenic effects in bacterial cultures. The relationship between exposure to metronidazole and human cancer is unclear. One study found an excess in lung cancer among women (even after adjusting for smoking), while other studies found either no increased risk, or a statistically insignificant risk. Metronidazole is listed as a possible carcinogen according to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A study in those with Crohn's disease also found chromosomal abnormalities in circulating lymphocytes in people treated with metronidazole. === Stevens–Johnson syndrome === Metronidazole alone rarely causes Stevens–Johnson syndrome, but is reported to occur at high rates when combined with mebendazole. === Neurotoxicity === Several studies in the human and animal models have recorded the neurotoxicity of metronidazole. One possible mechanism underlying this toxicity is that metronidazole may interference with postsynaptic central monoaminergic neurotransmission and immunomodulation. Additionally other research suggests that the role of nitric oxide isoforms and inflammatory cytokines may also play a role. == Drug interactions == === Alcohol === Consuming alcohol while taking metronidazole has been suspected in case reports to cause a disulfiram-like reaction with effects that can include nausea, vomiting, flushing of the skin, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. People are often advised not to drink alcohol during systemic metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours after completion of treatment. However, some studies call into question the mechanism of the interaction of alcohol and metronidazole, and a possible central toxic serotonin reaction for the alcohol intolerance is suggested. Metronidazole is also generally thought to inhibit the liver metabolism of propylene glycol (found in some foods, medicines, and in many electronic cigarette e-liquids), thus propylene glycol may potentially have similar interaction effects with metronidazole. === Other drug interactions === Metronidazole is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C9 belonging to the cytochrome P450 family. As a result, metronidazole may interact with medications metabolized by this enzyme. Examples of such medications are lomitapide and warfarin, to name a few. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Metronidazole is of the nitroimidazole class. It is a prodrug that inhibits nucleic acid synthesis by forming nitroso radicals, which disrupt the DNA of microbial cells. Metronidazole activates by receiving an electron from the reduced ferredoxin produced by pyruvate synthase (PFOR) in anaerobic organisms, equivalent to pyruvate dehydrogenase in aerobic organisms, thus turning into a highly reactive radical anion. After the radical loses the electron to its target, it recycles back to the unactivated form of metronidazole, ready to be activated again. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because oxygen competes with metronidazole for the electron, this reduction requires a local environment with low oxygen concentration that usually happens only in anaerobic bacteria and protozoans. Therefore, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria. Elevation of oxygen level in the organism will decrease its rate of generating the activated metronidazole, but also increase the rate of recycling back to the unactivated metronidazole. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral metronidazole is approximately 80% bioavailable via the gut and peak blood plasma concentrations occur after one to two hours. Food may slow down absorption but does not diminish it. Of the circulating substance, about 20% is bound to plasma proteins. It penetrates well into tissues, the cerebrospinal fluid, the amniotic fluid and breast milk, as well as into abscess cavities. About 60% of the metronidazole is metabolized by oxidation to the main metabolite hydroxymetronidazole and a carboxylic acid derivative, and by glucuronidation. The metabolites show antibiotic and antiprotozoal activity in vitro. Metronidazole and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys (77%) and to a lesser extent via the faeces (14%). The biological half-life of metronidazole in healthy adults is eight hours, in infants during the first two months of their lives about 23 hours, and in premature babies up to 100 hours. The biological activity of hydroxymetronidazole is 30% to 65%, and the elimination half-life is longer than that of the parent compound. The serum half-life of hydroxymetronidazole after suppository was 10 hours, 19 hours after intravenous infusion, and 11 hours after a tablet. === Resistance === Resistance in parasites is found in T. vaginilis, and G. lamblia, but not E. histolytica, and two major methods are observed. The first method involves an impaired oxygen scavenging capability that increase the local concentration of oxygen, leading to the decreased activation and increased recycling of metronidazole. The second method is associated with lowered levels of pyruvate synthase and ferredoxin, the latter due to the lowered transcription of the ferredoxin gene. Strains employing the second method will still respond to a higher dosage of metronidazole. Resistance in bacteria is documented in Bacteriodes spp. that resistant to nitroimidazoles including metronidazole. In the resistant strains, 5-nitroimidazole reductase is identified as the culprit that actively reduces metronidazole to inactive forms. Currently eleven types are identified which are encoded by nimA through nimK respectively. The gene is encoded either in the chromosome or the episome. Other mechanisms may include reduced drug activation, efflux pumps, altered redox potential and biofilm formation. In the recent years it is observed that the resistance to metronidazole is increasingly common, complicating its clinical effectiveness. == History == The drug was initially developed by Rhône-Poulenc in the 1950s and licensed to G.D. Searle. Searle was acquired by Pfizer in 2003. The original patent expired in 1982, but evergreening reformulation occurred thereafter. == Brand name == In India, it is sold under the brand name Metrogyl and Flagyl. In Bangladesh, it is available as Amodis, Amotrex, Dirozyl, Filmet, Flagyl, Flamyd, Metra, Metrodol, Metryl, etc. In Pakistan, it is sold under the brand name of Flagyl and Metrozine. In the United States it is sold under the brand name Noritate. == Synthesis == 2-Methylimidazole (1) may be prepared via the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, or from ethylenediamine and acetic acid, followed by treatment with lime, then Raney nickel. 2-Methylimidazole is nitrated to give 2-methyl-4(5)-nitroimidazole (2), which is in turn alkylated with ethylene oxide or 2-chloroethanol to give metronidazole (3): == Research == Metronidazole is researched for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Studies have shown that metronidazole can decrease the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide by activated immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. Metronidazole's immunomodulatory properties are thought to be related to its ability to decrease the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Chemokines are a type of cytokines that act as chemoattractants, meaning they attract and guide immune cells to specific sites in the body where they are needed. Cell adhesion molecules play an important role in the immune response by facilitating the interaction between immune cells and other cells in the body, such as endothelial cells, which form the lining of blood vessels. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, metronidazole can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β. Metronidazole has been studied in various immunological disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, periodontitis, and rosacea. In these conditions, metronidazole has been suspected to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that could be beneficial in the treatment of these conditions. Despite the success in treating rosacea with metronidazole, the exact mechanism of why metronidazole in rosacea is efficient is not precisely known, i.e., which properties of metronidazole help treat rosacea: antibacterial or immunomodulatory or both, or other mechanism is involved. Increased ROS production in rosacea is thought to contribute to the inflammatory process and skin damage, so metronidazole's ability to decrease ROS may explain the mechanism of action in this disease, but this remains speculation. Metronidazole is also researched as a potential anti-inflammatory agent in periodontitis treatment. == Veterinary use == Metronidazole is used to treat infections of Giardia in dogs, cats, and other companion animals, but it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by fenbendazole for this purpose in dogs and cats. It is also used for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal infections, periodontal disease, and systemic infections in cats and dogs. Another common usage is the treatment of systemic and/or gastrointestinal clostridial infections in horses. Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat ornamental fish and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests it only be used when necessary because it has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as to prevent antimicrobial resistance. The appropriate dosage of metronidazole varies based on the animal species, the condition being treated and the specific formulation of the product. == References == == External links == ""Metronidazole and Tinidazole"".

It is taken by mouth. Epristeride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor and works by decreasing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), an androgen sex hormone, in certain parts of the body like the prostate gland. It inhibits two of the three forms of 5α-reductase but is of relatively low efficacy and can decrease DHT levels in the blood only by about 25 to 54%. Epristeride was under development for the treatment of enlarged prostate, scalp hair loss, and acne in the United States and other countries in the 1990s but did not complete development in these countries. Instead, it was developed and introduced for the treatment of enlarged prostate in China in 2000. == Medical uses == Epristeride is used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), otherwise known as enlarged prostate. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Epristeride is a selective, transition-state, non-competitive or uncompetitive, irreversible inhibitor of 5α-reductase, and is specific to the type II isoform of the enzyme similarly to finasteride and turosteride but unlike dutasteride. Epristeride is unique in its mechanism of action relative to finasteride and dutasteride in that it binds irreversibly to 5α-reductase and results in the formation of an unproductive complex of the 5α-reductase enzyme, the substrate testosterone, and the cofactor NADPH. For this reason, testosterone is caught in a trap, and it was initially speculated that the reciprocal increase in intraprostatic levels of testosterone seen with finasteride and dutasteride should not happen with epristeride. However, subsequent clinical data have not supported this hypothesis. Moreover, in spite of the fact that epristeride is a very potent inhibitor of 5α-reductase type II (0.18–2 nM), it has been found to reduce circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by only 25 to 54% following 8 days of therapy over a dosage range of 0.4 to 160 mg/day. For this reason, relative to other 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride, the degree of DHT suppression with epristeride falls short of that desirable for full clinical benefit. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of epristeride is 93%. It has an elimination half-life of 26 hours. == Chemistry == Epristeride, also known as 17β-(tert-butylcarbamoyl)androsta-3,5-diene-3-carboxylic acid, is a synthetic androstane steroid. === Synthesis === Oxidation of the acetyl group in progesterone gives the carboxylic acid (1). Halogenation with phosphorus tribromide converts the enone to the enol bromide and the acid to the acyl halide; mild base hydrolyzes the latter back to the free acid, giving (2). Halogenation with oxalyl chloride and a Schotten–Baumann reaction with tert-butylamine yields the amide (3). Epristeride is formed when the bromine atom in this compound is converted to a carboxylic acid via the organolithium intermediate (4). == History == Epristeride was under development for the treatment of BPH, androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss), and acne vulgaris by SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline) in the 1990s and reached phase III clinical trials in the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan, but ultimately was never marketed in these countries. Instead, epristeride was developed by Ono Pharmaceutical and introduced for the treatment of BPH in China in 2000. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Epristeride is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Epristeride is marketed under the brand names Aipuliete and Chuanliu in China. == References == == External links == Epristeride - AdisInsight",Epristeride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.634490556374658e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000341476290486753)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epristeride,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479047/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8142295/ ', [])"

It has been approved for use in the European Union and the United Kingdom since 2010. The US Food and Drug Administration denied approval in 2008 and 2019. == Medical uses == The drug is used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation lasting up to three days in adults after heart surgery, or lasting up to seven days in other adults, as an intravenous infusion. == Contraindications == Vernakalant is contraindicated in a number of heart conditions: severe aortic stenosis, low blood pressure (systolic pressure under 100 mmHg), heart failure (NYHA class III–IV), prolonged QT time, severe bradycardia (slow heart rate), sinus node dysfunction, second or third-degree atrioventricular block, acute coronary syndrome, including heart attack. Vernakalant and other intravenous rhythm control drugs (class I and class III antiarrhythmics) must not be given within four hours of each other. == Side effects == The most common adverse effects in studies were dysgeusia (taste disturbance, in 18% of patients), sneezing (13%) and paraesthesia (abnormal skin sensations, 7%); they were transient and rarely led to an abortion of the treatment. Potentially serious side effects included low blood pressure and conversion of the heart rhythm to atrial flutter instead of a normal sinus rhythm; flutter mostly responded to a second dose of vernakalant. == Overdose == There is a single case report of a person receiving an infusion of the full vernakalant dose in half the recommended time, resulting in tachycardia (fast heartbeat) without lasting adverse effects. == Interactions == Drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP2D6 might theoretically increase vernakalant concentrations in the body, as the latter is metabolized by this enzyme; but this has been found to be of no clinical significance. While the drug itself is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, it is not expected to have a relevant impact on other pharmaceuticals that are broken down by this enzyme, because it only remains in the body for a short time. Vernakalant probably interacts with other antiarrhythmic drugs, although no formal studies have been done. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like other class III antiarrhythmics, vernakalant blocks atrial potassium channels, thereby prolonging repolarization. It differs from typical class III agents by blocking a certain type of potassium channel, the cardiac transient outward potassium current, with increased potency as the heart rate increases. This means that it is more effective at high heart rates, while other class III agents tend to lose effectiveness under these circumstances. It also slightly blocks the hERG potassium channel, leading to a prolonged QT interval. This may theoretically increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia, though this does not seem to be clinically relevant. The drug also blocks atrial sodium channels. === Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics === After infusion, the substance is rapidly distributed in the body. In the blood serum, 53–56% are circulating freely and are not bound to plasma proteins. In people with normal CYP2D6 function, the main route of degradation is by O-demethylation via this enzyme. In 2D6 poor metabolizers, vernakalant is mainly inactivated by glucuronidation and excreted by the kidney. Elimination half-life is three hours in 2D6 extensive (normal) metabolizers and 5.5 hours in poor metabolizers. The differences between poor and extensive metabolizers regarding peak concentrations, AUC and half-life are not clinically relevant. Vernakalant does not inhibit the enzymes CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, nor the transporter protein P-gp. == Chemistry == The molecule has three asymmetric carbon atoms, allowing for 23 = 8 stereomers. The trans stereomers are known to be pharmacologically active, but only the RRR-form is contained in the marketed formulation. The SRR-form (with the hydroxyl group in S configuration) is a minor metabolite that is formed in the human body, mainly in poor metabolizers. The infusion contains vernakalant hydrochloride, which is highly water-soluble. == History == Vernakalant was initially developed by Cardiome Pharma, and the intravenous formulation was bought for further development by Merck in April 2009. In September 2012, Merck terminated its agreements with Cardiome and has consequently returned all rights of the drug back to Cardiome, which as of 2018 is known as Correvio Pharma. In December 2007, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted to recommend the approval of vernakalant, but in August 2008, the FDA judged that additional information was necessary for approval. In the European Union, the medication was approved under the brand name Brinavess in September 2010. An oral formulation underwent phase II clinical trials between 2005 and 2008. In December 2019, the resubmitted New Drug Application for vernakalant was discussed by the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee.

This compound was isolated first from this plant in 2000. A gel formulation of the drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis. Two different strengths of the gel have been approved for use on either the face and scalp (0.015%) or the trunk and extremities (0.05%), respectively. In 2020 the drug was withdrawn from the market in the EU. == Adverse effects == Irritation of the application site is very common. The various types of irritation include redness, scaling, crusting, pain, severe itching, and sometimes infection. Additional possible side effects include eye irritation, such as periorbital edema (3% of patients in studies), headaches (2%) and nasopharyngitis (running nose, 2%). Allergic reactions, shingles, changes in pigmentation at application site, chemical conjunctivitis, and corneal burns may also occur. The European Medicines Agency recommended suspending the marketing authorisation of ingenol mebutate due to concerns regarding increased incidence of skin cancer in patients treated with topical ingenol mebutate compared to vehicle or imiquimod. Physicians were advised to refrain from prescribing ingenol and to use different treatment options. Subsequently, the marketing authorization holder requested withdrawal of the manufacturing authorization for commercial reasons. The withdrawal was granted and therefore, ingenol mebutate is no longer registered in the EU. == Interactions == As ingenol mebutate is not effectively absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream, interactions with oral drugs are unlikely. == Chemistry == The substance is an ester of the diterpene ingenol and angelic acid. A 3-step semisynthesis of ingenol mebutate starting from ingenol was described by a chemical research group in Denmark in 2012. A 14-step synthesis of (+)-ingenol from (+)-3-carene, which is a relatively inexpensive constituent of turpentine, was published in July 2013. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism by which ingenol mebutate causes cell death is still not fully understood. One study on squamous cell carcinoma, the precursor of which is actinic keratosis, cultures found that the PKC/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is involved in causing cell death after treatment with ingenol mebutate. In addition, the interleukin decoy receptors IL1R2 and IL13RA2 were induced, resulting in a reduction in the long-term viability of the cells, which could help prevent recurrence. == Studies == Results from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies have shown that ingenol mebutate gel applied topically, for 2 to the trunk or 3 days to the face or scalp, is effective for field treatment of actinic keratoses. A twelve-month follow-up study was performed on actinic keratosis patients who had been treated with ingenol mebutate, 108 of which had been treated for face or scalp and 71 for trunk or extremities and the study found that of those treated for the face or scalp 46.1% had sustained clearance, and of those treated for the trunk 44.0% had sustained clearance for the period of the study. == Research == === HIV === Ingenol mebutate has also been found to be useful for reactivating latent HIV virus in cells taken from individuals who have tested negative for signs of the disease following extended courses of anti-retroviral drugs, raising the possibility that this drug may be used to expose the last traces of virus, and thus potentially provide a permanent cure for HIV infection. Research is ongoing to determine whether the effects observed in vitro are also seen in animal models, with a view to eventual human trials for this application. === Tattoo removal === A placebo-controlled study on hairless mice found that 0.1% ingenol mebutate gel was able to remove two-week-old tattoos consistently. It was observed that the microspheres within the skin containing the dye would exude into the scab intact and slough off as the skin healed about 20 days after treatment began. This mechanism appears to be independent of ink color, unlike laser tattoo removal, which is less effective for certain colors. There are no reports of human trials having been conducted. === Skin cancer risk === Health Canada assessed twelve studies published in scientific and medical literature in order to determine the link between the use of ingenol mebutate and skin cancer. Health Canada's review found that six of the twelve studies had evidence of skin cancer with the use of ingenol mebutate. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also reviewed this safety issue. In April 2020, it concluded that ingenol mebutate may increase the risk of skin cancer and that its risks outweigh its benefits.

The marketing authorization of cinoxacin has been suspended throughout the EU. Cinoxacin was an older synthetic antimicrobial related to the quinolone class of antibiotics with activity similar to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. It was commonly used thirty years ago to treat urinary tract infections in adults. There are reports that cinoxacin had also been used to treat initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and bacterial prostatitis in dogs. however this veterinary use was never approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In complicated UTI, the older gyrase-inhibitors such as cinoxacin are no longer indicated. == History == Cinoxacin is one of the original quinolone drugs, which were introduced in the 1970s. Commonly referred to as the first generation quinolones. This first generation also included other quinolone drugs such as pipemidic acid, and oxolinic acid, but this first generation proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid. Cinoxacin is similar chemically (and in antimicrobial activity) to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. Relative to nalidixic acid, cinoxacin was found to have a slightly greater inhibitory and bactericidal activity. Cinoxacin was patented in 1972 and assigned to Eli Lilly. Eli Lilly obtained approval from the FDA to market cinoxacin in the United States as Cinobac on June 13, 1980. Prior to this cinobac was marketed in the U.K. and Switzerland in 1979. Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (Oclassen Dermatologics) commenced sales of Cinobac in the United States and Canada back in September 1992, under an agreement with Eli Lilly which granted Oclassen exclusive United States and Canadian distribution rights. Oclassen promoted Cinobac primarily to urologists for the outpatient treatment of initial and recurrent urinary tract infections and prophylaxis. Oclassen Pharmaceuticals was a privately held pharmaceutical company founded in 1985 until acquired by Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in 1997. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (also incorporated in 1985), having acquired Oclassen Pharmaceuticals (Oclassen Dermatologics) also acquired the marketing rights contained within the agreement with Eli Lilly to market Cinobac. == Licensed uses == Urinary tract infections only == Availability == 250 mg, capsules (prescription only) == Mode of action == Cinoxacin mode of action involves the inhibiting of DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase iv, which is an enzyme necessary to separate replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. == Contraindications == Within the most recent package insert (c. 1999) Cinobac is listed as being contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cinoxacin or other quinolones. == Adverse reactions == The safety profile of cinoxacin appears to be rather unremarkable. Adverse drug reactions appear to be limited to the gastrointestinal system and the central nervous system. Hypersensitivity resulting in an anaphylactic reactions (as seen with all drugs found within this class) has also been reported in association with cinoxacin. Animal studies have shown that Cinoxacin is associated with renal damage. Such damage appears to be due to the physical trauma resulting from deposition of cinoxacin crystals in the urinary tract. Such crystaluria has also been reported with other drugs in this class. A review of the literature indicates that patients treated with cinoxacin reported fewer adverse drug reactions than those treated with nalidixic acid, furadantin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Although phototoxicity and photoallergenicity is well demonstrated experimentally, phototoxicity does not appear to be an issue with cinoxacin As a result of this safety profile the manufacturer, Eli Lilley states that ""cinoxacin perhaps should be reserved only for those patients with organisms resistant to usual first-line agents or those who fail to respond to therapy with these agents."" == Overdose == Symptoms following an overdose of cinoxacin may include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and diarrhea. The severity of the epigastric distress and the diarrhea are dose related. Patients who have ingested an overdose of cinoxacin should be kept well hydrated to prevent crystalluria. Forced diuresis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of cinoxacin. == Pharmacokinetics == Biotransformation is mainly hepatic, with approximately 30-40% metabolized to inactive metabolites. Protein Binding ranges from 60 to 80%. Cinoxacin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The presence of food delays absorption but does not affect total absorption. The mean serum half-life is 1.5 hours. Half-life in patients with impaired renal function may exceed 10 hours. == Dosing == The usual adult dosage for the treatment of urinary tract infections is 1 gram daily, administered orally in two or four divided doses (500 mg b.i.d. or 250 mg q.i.d. respectively) for seven to 14 days. === Impaired renal function === When renal function is impaired, a reduced dosage must be employed. == Susceptible bacteria == Gram-negative aerobes: Enterobacter species Escherichia coli Klebsiella species Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus species are resistant. == References == == External links == Cinobac Package Insert",Cinobac,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009151478880085051), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000863774970639497), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014168502762913704)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cinoxacin-oral-route/description/drg-20062909?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=137, start_index=9, title='Cinoxacin (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cinoxacin-oral-route/description/drg-20062909?utm_source=openai')])"

While it predates the term, it is often classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Phenazone was one of the earliest synthetic medications — when it was patented in 1883, the only synthetic medical chemicals on the market were chloral hydrate, a sedative (as well as at least one derivative of that chemical), trimethylamine, and iodol (tetraiodopyrrol), an early antiseptic. One of the earliest widely used analgesics and antipyretics, phenazone was gradually replaced in common use by other medications including phenacetin (itself later withdrawn because of safety concerns), aspirin, paracetamol and modern NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. However, it is still available in several countries either as an over-the-counter or prescribed drug. == History == Ludwig Knorr was the first to synthesize phenazone, then called antipyrine, in the early 1880s.

3345,"('Hydroxyamine (hydrochloride)', 'Hydrochloric acid', 'Hydrogen chloride', 'Muriatic acid', 'Chlorohydric acid')","Medical, Industrial","Hydrochloric acid, also known as muriatic acid or spirits of salt, is an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl). It is a colorless solution with a distinctive pungent smell. It is classified as a strong acid. It is a component of the gastric acid in the digestive systems of most animal species, including humans. Hydrochloric acid is an important laboratory reagent and industrial chemical. == Etymology == Because it was produced from rock salt according to the methods of Johann Rudolph Glauber, hydrochloric acid was historically called by European alchemists spirits of salt or acidum salis (salt acid). Both names are still used, especially in other languages, such as German: Salzsäure, Dutch: Zoutzuur, Afrikaans: Soutsuur, Swedish: Saltsyra, Finnish: Suolahappo, Spanish: Salfumán, Turkish: Tuz Ruhu, Polish: kwas solny, Hungarian: sósav, Czech: kyselina solná, Japanese: 塩酸 (ensan), Chinese: 盐酸 (yánsuān), and Korean: 염산 (yeomsan). Gaseous HCl was called marine acid air. The name muriatic acid has the same origin (muriatic means ""pertaining to brine or salt"", hence muriate means hydrochloride), and this name is still sometimes used. The name hydrochloric acid was coined by the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1814. == History == === 9th–10th century === In the early tenth century, the Persian physician and alchemist Abu Bakr al-Razi (c. 865–925, Latin: Rhazes) conducted experiments with sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) and vitriol (hydrated sulfates of various metals), which he distilled together, thus producing the gas hydrogen chloride. In doing so, al-Razi may have stumbled upon a primitive method for producing hydrochloric acid, as perhaps manifested in the following recipe from his Kitāb al-Asrār (""The Book of Secrets""): Take equal parts of sweet salt, Bitter salt, Ṭabarzad salt, Andarānī salt, Indian salt, salt of Al-Qilī, and salt of Urine. After adding an equal weight of good crystallised Sal-ammoniac, dissolve by moisture, and distil (the mixture). There will distil over a strong water, which will cleave stone (sakhr) instantly. However, it appears that in most of his experiments al-Razi disregarded the gaseous products, concentrating instead on the color changes that could be effected in the residue. According to Robert P. Multhauf, hydrogen chloride was produced many times without clear recognition that, by dissolving it in water, hydrochloric acid may be produced. === 11th–13th century === Drawing on al-Razi's experiments, the De aluminibus et salibus (""On Alums and Salts""), an eleventh- or twelfth-century Arabic text falsely attributed to al-Razi and translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (1144–1187), described the heating of metals with various salts, which in the case of mercury resulted in the production of mercury(II) chloride (corrosive sublimate). In this process, hydrochloric acid actually started to form, but it immediately reacted with the mercury to produce corrosive sublimate. Thirteenth-century Latin alchemists, for whom the De aluminibus et salibus was one of the main reference works, were fascinated by the chlorinating properties of corrosive sublimate, and they soon discovered that when the metals are eliminated from the process of heating vitriols, alums, and salts, strong mineral acids can directly be distilled. === 14th–15th century === ==== Aqua regia ==== One important invention that resulted from the discovery of the mineral acids is aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid in a 1:3 proportion, capable of dissolving gold. This was first described in pseudo-Geber's De inventione veritatis (""On the Discovery of Truth"", after c. 1300), where aqua regia was prepared by adding ammonium chloride to nitric acid. The fact that aqua regia typically is defined as a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid does not mean that hydrochloric acid was discovered before or simultaneously with aqua regia. The isolation of hydrochloric acid happened about 300 years later. The production of hydrochloric acid itself (i.e., as an isolated substance rather than as already mixed with nitric acid) depended on the use of more efficient cooling apparatus, which would only develop in subsequent centuries. === 16th–17th century === ==== Isolation of hydrochloric acid ==== From the point of view of Western history of chemistry, hydrochloric acid was the last of the three well-known mineral acids for which the method of its production appeared in the literature. Recipes for its production started to appear in the late sixteenth century. The earliest recipes for the production of hydrochloric acid are found in Giovanni Battista Della Porta's (1535–1615) Magiae naturalis (""Natural Magic"") and in the works of other contemporary chemists like Andreas Libavius (c. 1550–1616), Jean Beguin (1550–1620), and Oswald Croll (c. 1563–1609). Among the historians who have written about this are German chemists Hermann Franz Moritz Kopp (1845) and Edmund Oscar von Lippmann (1938), mining engineer (and future U.S. president) Herbert Hoover with his wife geologist Lou Henry Hoover (1912), Dutch chemist Robert Jacobus Forbes (1948), American chemist Mary Elvira Weeks (1956), and British chemists F. Sherwood Taylor (1957) and J. R. Partington (1960). Italian chemist Ladislao Reti have summarized the result of their efforts thus: The first clear instance of the preparation of hydrochloric acid appears in the writings of Della Porta, (1589 and 1608), Libavius (1597), pseudo-Basil (1604), van Helmont (1646) and Glauber (1648). Less convincing earlier references are found in the Plichto of Rosetti (1540) and in Agricola (1558). As for the first practical method of preparation from vitriol and common salt, there is no doubt that pseudo-Basil precedes Glauber, but the latter has the unquestionable merit of having indicated the way of producing the acid later to be adopted by the chemical industry for large-scale operations. ==== Dissolving metals ==== The knowledge of mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid would be of key importance to seventeenth-century chemists like Daniel Sennert (1572–1637) and Robert Boyle (1627–1691), who used their capability to rapidly dissolve metals in their demonstrations of the composite nature of bodies. === Industrial developments === During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, demand for alkaline substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoudun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt is converted to soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was often vented into the air. An early exception was the Bonnington Chemical Works where, in 1830, the HCl began to be captured and the hydrochloric acid produced was used in making sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride). After the passage of the act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale. In the 20th century, the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the Solvay process without a hydrochloric acid by-product. Since hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications, the commercial interest initiated other production methods, some of which are still used today. After 2000, hydrochloric acid is mostly made by absorbing by-product hydrogen chloride from industrial organic compounds production. == Chemical properties == Gaseous hydrogen chloride is a molecular compound with a covalent bond between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms. In aqueous solutions dissociation is complete, with the formation of chloride ions and hydrated hydrogen ions (hydronium ions). A combined IR, Raman, X-ray, and neutron diffraction study of concentrated hydrochloric acid showed that the hydronium ion forms hydrogen bonded complexes with other water molecules. (See Hydronium for further discussion of this issue.) The pKa value of hydrochloric acid in aqueous solution is estimated theoretically to be −5.9. A solution of hydrogen chloride in water behaves as a strong acid: the concentration of HCl molecules is effectively zero. == Physical properties == Physical properties of hydrochloric acid, such as boiling and melting points, density, and pH, depend on the concentration or molarity of HCl in the aqueous solution. They range from those of water at very low concentrations approaching 0% HCl to values for fuming hydrochloric acid at over 40% HCl. Hydrochloric acid as the binary (two-component) mixture of HCl and H2O has a constant-boiling azeotrope at 20.2% HCl and 108.6 °C (381.8 K; 227.5 °F). There are four constant-crystallization eutectic points for hydrochloric acid, between the crystal form of [H3O]Cl (68% HCl), [H5O2]Cl (51% HCl), [H7O3]Cl (41% HCl), [H3O]Cl·5H2O (25% HCl), and ice (0% HCl). There is also a metastable eutectic point at 24.8% between ice and the [H7O3]Cl crystallization. They are all hydronium salts. == Production == Hydrochloric acid is usually prepared industrially by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride can be generated in many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist. The large-scale production of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals, such as in the chloralkali process which produces hydroxide, hydrogen, and chlorine, the latter of which can be combined to produce HCl. Hydrogen chloride is produced by combining chlorine and hydrogen: Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl As the reaction is exothermic, the installation is called an HCl oven or HCl burner. The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is absorbed in deionized water, resulting in chemically pure hydrochloric acid. This reaction can give a very pure product, e.g. for use in the food industry. === Industrial market === Hydrochloric acid is produced in solutions up to 38% HCl (concentrated grade). Higher concentrations up to just over 40% are chemically possible, but the evaporation rate is then so high that storage and handling require extra precautions, such as pressurization and cooling. Bulk industrial-grade is therefore 30% to 35%, optimized to balance transport efficiency and product loss through evaporation. In the United States, solutions of between 20% and 32% are sold as muriatic acid. Solutions for household purposes in the US, mostly cleaning, are typically 10% to 12%, with strong recommendations to dilute before use. In the United Kingdom, where it is sold as ""Spirits of Salt"" for domestic cleaning, the potency is the same as the US industrial grade. In other countries, such as Italy, hydrochloric acid for domestic or industrial cleaning is sold as ""Acido Muriatico"", and its concentration ranges from 5% to 32%. Major producers worldwide include Dow Chemical at 2 million tonnes annually (Mt/year), calculated as HCl gas, Georgia Gulf Corporation, Tosoh Corporation, Akzo Nobel, and Tessenderlo at 0.5 to 1.5 Mt/year each. Total world production, for comparison purposes expressed as HCl, is estimated at 20 Mt/year, with 3 Mt/year from direct synthesis, and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses. By far, most hydrochloric acid is consumed captively by the producer. The open world market size is estimated at 5 Mt/year. == Applications == Hydrochloric acid is a strong inorganic acid that is used in many industrial processes such as refining metal. The application often determines the required product quality. Hydrogen chloride, not hydrochloric acid, is used more widely in industrial organic chemistry, e.g. for vinyl chloride and dichloroethane. === Pickling of steel === One of the most important applications of hydrochloric acid is in the pickling of steel, to remove rust or iron oxide scale from iron or steel before subsequent processing, such as extrusion, rolling, galvanizing, and other techniques. Technical quality HCl at typically 18% concentration is the most commonly used pickling agent for the pickling of carbon steel grades. Fe3O4 + Fe + 8 HCl → 4 FeCl2 + 4 H2O The spent acid has long been reused as iron(II) chloride (also known as ferrous chloride) solutions, but high heavy-metal levels in the pickling liquor have decreased this practice. The steel pickling industry has developed hydrochloric acid regeneration processes, such as the spray roaster or the fluidized bed HCl regeneration process, which allow the recovery of HCl from spent pickling liquor. The most common regeneration process is the pyrohydrolysis process, applying the following formula: 4 FeCl2 + 4 H2O + O2 → 8 HCl + 2 Fe2O3 By recuperation of the spent acid, a closed acid loop is established. The iron(III) oxide by-product of the regeneration process is valuable, used in a variety of secondary industries. === Production of inorganic compounds === Akin to its use for pickling, hydrochloric acid is used to dissolve many metals, metal oxides and metal carbonates. The conversions are often depicted in simplified equations: Zn + 2 HCl → ZnCl2 + H2 NiO + 2 HCl → NiCl2 + H2O CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O These processes are used to produce metal chlorides for analysis or further production. === pH control and neutralization === Hydrochloric acid can be used to regulate the acidity (pH) of solutions. HO− + HCl → H2O + Cl− In industry demanding purity (food, pharmaceutical, drinking water), high-quality hydrochloric acid is used to control the pH of process water streams. In less-demanding industry, technical quality hydrochloric acid suffices for neutralizing waste streams and swimming pool pH control. === Regeneration of ion exchangers === High-quality hydrochloric acid is used in the regeneration of ion exchange resins. Cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing demineralized water. The acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins. Na+ is replaced with H+ and Ca2+ with 2 H+. Ion exchangers and demineralized water are used in all chemical industries, drinking water production, and many food industries. === Laboratory use === Of the common strong mineral acids in chemistry, hydrochloric acid is the monoprotic acid least likely to undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It is one of the least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it contains the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus the fact that it is available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent. It is also inexpensive. Hydrochloric acid is the preferred acid in titration for determining the amount of bases. Strong acid titrants give more precise results due to a more distinct endpoint. Azeotropic, or ""constant-boiling"", hydrochloric acid (roughly 20.2%) can be used as a primary standard in quantitative analysis, although its exact concentration depends on the atmospheric pressure when it is prepared. === Other === Hydrochloric acid is used for a large number of small-scale applications, such as leather processing, household cleaning, and building construction. Oil production may be stimulated by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry. Hydrochloric acid has been used for dissolving calcium carbonate, e.g. such things as de-scaling kettles and for cleaning mortar off brickwork. When used on brickwork the reaction with the mortar only continues until the acid has all been converted, producing calcium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water: CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O Many chemical reactions involving hydrochloric acid are applied in the production of food, food ingredients, and food additives. Typical products include aspartame, fructose, citric acid, lysine, hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer, and in gelatin production. Food-grade (extra-pure) hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product. == Presence in living organisms == Gastric acid is one of the main secretions of the stomach. It consists mainly of hydrochloric acid and acidifies the stomach content to a pH of 1 to 2. Chloride (Cl−) and hydrogen (H+) ions are secreted separately in the stomach fundus region at the top of the stomach by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa into a secretory network called canaliculi before it enters the stomach lumen. Gastric acid acts as a barrier against microorganisms to prevent infections and is important for the digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by bicarbonate. The stomach itself is protected from the strong acid by the secretion of a thick mucus layer, and by secretin induced buffering with sodium bicarbonate. Heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop when these mechanisms fail. Drugs of the antihistaminic and proton pump inhibitor classes can inhibit the production of acid in the stomach, and antacids are used to neutralize excessive existing acid. Hydrochloric acid is also used by osteoclasts alongside proteases for bone resorption. == Safety == Being a strong acid, hydrochloric acid is corrosive to living tissue and to many materials, but not to rubber. Typically, rubber protective gloves and related protective gear are used when handling concentrated solutions. Vapors or mists are a respiratory hazard, which can be partially mitigated by use of a respirator equipped with cartridges specifically designed to capture hydrochloric acid. Airborne acid is an irritant to the eyes, and may require the use of protective goggles or a facemask. == Legal status == Hydrochloric acid has been listed as a Table II precursor under the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances because of its use in the production of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. == See also == Chloride, inorganic salts of hydrochloric acid Hydrochloride, organic salts of hydrochloric acid from sodium hydroxide Aqua regia == References == == External links == NIST WebBook, general link Hydrochloric Acid – Part One and Hydrochloric Acid – Part Two at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham) Calculators: surface tensions, and densities, molarities and molalities of aqueous HCl === General safety information === EPA Hazard Summary Hydrochloric acid MSDS by Georgia Institute of Technology NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards === Pollution information === National Pollutant Inventory – Hydrochloric Acid Fact Sheet",Chlorohydric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('END', -0.4829298257827759), ('OG', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.8624639324116288e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.38722217082977295), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.16037553548812866), (' FOOD', -0.0012013008818030357)])","('INDUSTRIAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('IN', -0.43329721689224243), ('DU', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -7.795983401592821e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.058950699865818024), ('OG', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.47428977489471436), ('ĠFOOD', -0.06493154913187027), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1604144126176834)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0485873706638813), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([dcceew.gov.au](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/npi/substances/fact-sheets/hydrochloric-acid?utm_source=openai), [chemicalsafetyfacts.org](https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/chemicals/hydrochloric-acid?utm_source=openai), [chemi.co.za](https://chemi.co.za/industrial-uses-of-hydrochloric-acid/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=365, start_index=33, title='Hydrochloric acid - DCCEEW', type='url_citation', url='https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/npi/substances/fact-sheets/hydrochloric-acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=365, start_index=33, title='Hydrochloric Acid - Chemical Safety Facts', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/chemicals/hydrochloric-acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=365, start_index=33, title='The Industrial Uses of Hydrochloric Acid 🎖️ - Chemi', type='url_citation', url='https://chemi.co.za/industrial-uses-of-hydrochloric-acid/?utm_source=openai')])"
3346,"('Malachite green (oxalate)', 'Malachite green', 'Malachite green(1+)', '[4-[[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-phenylmethylidene]cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]-dimethylazanium', 'N-(4-{[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl](phenyl)methylidene}cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene)-n-methylmethanaminium')",Medical,"Malachite green is an organic compound that is used as a dyestuff and controversially as an antimicrobial in aquaculture. Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye for materials such as silk, leather, and paper. Despite its name the dye is not prepared from the mineral malachite; the name just comes from the similarity of color. == Structures and properties == Malachite green is classified in the dyestuff industry as a triarylmethane dye and also using in pigment industry. Formally, malachite green refers to the chloride salt [C6H5C(C6H4N(CH3)2)2]Cl, although the term malachite green is used loosely and often just refers to the colored cation. The oxalate salt is also marketed. The anions have no effect on the color. The intense green color of the cation results from a strong absorption band at 621 nm (extinction coefficient of 105 M−1 cm−1). Malachite green is prepared by the condensation of benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline to give leuco malachite green (LMG): C6H5CHO + C6H5N(CH3)2 → (C6H5N(CH3)2)2C6H5 + H2O Second, this colorless leuco compound, a relative of triphenylmethane, is oxidized to the cation that is MG: C6H5CH(C6H4N(CH3)2)2 + HCl + ½ O2 → [C6H5C(C6H4N(CH3)2)2]Cl + H2O A typical oxidizing agent is manganese dioxide. Hydrolysis of MG gives an alcohol: [C6H5C(C6H4N(CH3)2)2]Cl + H2O → C6H5C(OH)(C6H4N(CH3)2)2 + HCl This alcohol is important because it, not MG, traverses cell membranes. Once inside the cell, it is metabolized into LMG. Only the cation MG is deeply colored, whereas the leuco and alcohol derivatives are not. This difference arises because only the cationic form has extended pi-delocalization, which allows the molecule to absorb visible light. == Preparation == The leuco form of malachite green was first prepared by Hermann Fischer in 1877 by condensing benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline in the molecular ratio 1:2 in the presence of sulfuric acid. == Uses == Malachite green is traditionally used as a dye. Kilotonnes of MG and related triarylmethane dyes are produced annually for this purpose. MG is active against the oomycete Saprolegnia, which infects fish eggs in commercial aquaculture, MG has been used to treat Saprolegnia and is used as an antibacterial. It is a very popular treatment against Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in freshwater aquaria. The principal metabolite, leuco-malachite green (LMG), is found in fish treated with malachite green, and this finding is the basis of controversy and government regulation. See also Antimicrobials in aquaculture. MG has frequently been used to catch thieves and pilferers. The bait, usually money, is sprinkled with the anhydrous powder. Anyone handling the contaminated money will find that on upon washing the hands, a green stain on the skin that lasts for several days will result. === Niche uses === Numerous niche applications exploit the intense color of MG. It is used as a biological stain for microscopic analysis of cell biology and tissue samples. In the Gimenez staining method, basic fuchsin stains bacteria red or magenta, and malachite green is used as a blue-green counterstain. Malachite green is also used in endospore staining, since it can directly stain endospores within bacterial cells; here a safranin counterstain is often used. Malachite green is a part of Alexander's pollen stain. Malachite green can also be used as a saturable absorber in dye lasers, or as a pH indicator between pH 0.2–1.8. However, this use is relatively rare. Leuco-malachite green (LMG) is used as a detection method for latent blood in forensic science. Hemoglobin catalyzes the reaction between LMG and hydrogen peroxide, converting the colorless LMG into malachite green. Therefore, the appearance of a green color indicates the presence of blood. A set of malachite green derivatives is also a key component in a fluorescence microscopy tool called the fluorogen activating protein/fluorogen system. Malachite green is in a class of molecules called fluorophores. When malachite green's rotational freedom is restricted, it transforms from a non fluorescent molecule to a highly fluorescent molecule. In the fluorogen activating protein tool, established by a group at Carnegie Mellon University, Malachite green binds a specific fluorogen activating protein to become highly fluorescent. Expression of the fluorogen activating protein as fusions of targeting domains can impart subcellular localization. Its use is similar to that of GFP but has the added benefit of having a 'dark state' before the malachite green fluorophore is added. This is especially useful for FRET studies. == Regulation == In 1992, Canadian authorities determined that eating fish contaminated with malachite green posed a significant health risk. Malachite green was classified a Class II Health Hazard. Due to its low manufacturing cost, malachite green is still used in certain countries with less restrictive laws for non aquaculture purposes. In 2005, analysts in Hong Kong found traces of malachite green in eels and fish imported from China. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) detected malachite green in seafood from China, among others, where the substance is also banned for use in aquaculture. In June 2007, the FDA blocked the importation of several varieties of seafood due to continued malachite green contamination. Malachite green has been banned in the United States since 1983 in food-related applications. The substance is also banned in the United Kingdom. It is prohibited from the use in food in Macao. Animals metabolize malachite green to its leuco form. Being lipophillic (the leuco form has a log P of 5.70), the metabolite is retained in catfish muscle longer (HL = 10 days) than is the parent molecule (HL = 2.8 days). == Toxicity == The LD50 (oral, mouse) is 80 mg/kg. Rats fed malachite green experience ""a dose-related increase in liver DNA adducts"" along with lung adenomas. Leucomalachite green causes an ""increase in the number and severity of changes"". As leucomalachite green is the primary metabolite of malachite green and is retained in fish muscle much longer, most human dietary intake of malachite green from eating fish would be in the leuco form. During the experiment, rats were fed up to 543 ppm of leucomalachite green, an extreme amount compared to the average 5 ppb discovered in fish. After a period of two years, an increase in lung adenomas in male rats was discovered but no incidences of liver tumors. Therefore, it could be concluded that malachite green caused carcinogenic symptoms, but a direct link between malachite green and liver tumor was not established. == Detection == Although malachite green has almost no fluorescence in aqueous solution (quantum yield 7.9x10−5), several research groups have developed technologies to detect malachite green. For example, Zhao et al., demonstrated the use of malachite green aptamer in microcantilever based sensors to detect low concentration of malachite green. == References == == Further reading == Cho, Bongsup P.; Yang, Tianle; Blankenship, Lonnie R.; et al.

3347,"('Curcumin', 'Diferuloylmethane', 'Natural yellow 3', 'Turmeric yellow', 'Turmeric')","Food, Medical","Turmeric (), or Curcuma longa (), is a flowering plant in the ginger family Zingiberaceae. It is a perennial, rhizomatous, herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia that requires temperatures between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F) and high annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered each year for their rhizomes, some for propagation in the following season and some for consumption. The rhizomes are used fresh or boiled in water and dried, after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries, as well as for the dyeing characteristics imparted by the principal turmeric constituent, curcumin. Turmeric powder has a warm, bitter, black pepper-like flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma. Curcumin, a bright yellow chemical produced by the turmeric plant, is approved as a food additive by the World Health Organization, European Parliament, and United States Food and Drug Administration. Although long used in Ayurvedic medicine, there is no high-quality clinical evidence that consuming turmeric or curcumin is effective for treating any disease. == Origin and distribution == The greatest diversity of Curcuma species by number alone is in India, at around 40 to 45 species. Thailand has a comparable 30 to 40 species... Other countries in tropical Asia also have numerous wild species of Curcuma. Recent studies have also shown that the taxonomy of C. longa is problematic, with only the specimens from South India being identifiable as C. longa. The phylogeny, relationships, intraspecific and interspecific variation, and even identity of other species and cultivars in other parts of the world still need to be established and validated. Various species currently utilized and sold as ""turmeric"" in other parts of Asia have been shown to belong to several physically similar taxa, with overlapping local names. == History == Turmeric has been used in Asia for centuries and is a major part of Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani, and the animistic rituals of Austronesian peoples. It was first used as a dye, and then later for its supposed properties in folk medicine. In India, it spread with Hinduism and Buddhism, as the yellow dye is used to color the robes of monks and priests. In Island Southeast Asia, there is linguistic and circumstantial evidence of the ancient use of turmeric among the Austronesian peoples soon after dispersal from Taiwan (starting c. 3000 BCE), before contact with India. In Indonesia and the Philippines, turmeric was used for food, dyeing textiles, medicine, as well as body painting. It was commonly an important ingredient in various animistic rituals. Kikusawa and Reid (2007) have concluded that *kunij, the oldest reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian form for ""turmeric"" in the Austronesian languages, is primarily associated with the importance of its use as a dye. Other members of the genus Curcuma native to Southeast Asia (like Curcuma zedoaria) were also used for food and spice, but not as dyes. Turmeric (along with Curcuma zedoaria) was also spread with the Lapita people of the Austronesian expansion into Oceania. Turmeric can only be propagated with rhizomes, thus its pre-contact distribution into the Pacific Islands can only be via human introduction. The populations in Micronesia, Island Melanesia, and Polynesia (including as far as Hawaii and Easter Island) use turmeric widely for both food and dye before European contact. In Micronesia, it was an important trade item in the sawei maritime exchange between Yap and further atolls in the Carolines, where it couldn't grow. In some smaller islands, the dye was extracted from the leaves, since the rhizomes remained too small in sandy soils. It was also carried by the Austronesian migrations to Madagascar. Turmeric was found in Farmana, dating to between 2600 and 2200 BCE, and in a merchant's tomb in Megiddo, Israel, dating from the second millennium BCE. It was noted as a dye plant in the Assyrians' Cuneiform medical texts from Ashurbanipal’s library at Nineveh from 7th century BCE. In Medieval Europe, turmeric was called ""Indian saffron."" == Etymology == The name possibly derives from Middle English or Early Modern English as turmeryte or tarmaret. It may be of Latin origin, terra merita (""meritorious earth""). The Latin specific epithet longa means long. == Description == Turmeric is a perennial herbaceous plant that reaches up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall. It has highly branched, yellow to orange, cylindrical, aromatic rhizomes. The leaves are alternate and arranged in two rows. They are divided into leaf sheath, petiole, and leaf blade. From the leaf sheaths, a false stem is formed. The petiole is 50 to 115 cm (20–45 in) long. The simple leaf blades are usually 76 to 115 cm (30–45 in) long and rarely up to 230 cm (7 ft 7 in). They have a width of 38 to 45 cm (15 to 17+1⁄2 in) and are oblong to elliptical, narrowing at the tip. === Inflorescence, flower, and fruit === At the top of the inflorescence, stem bracts are present on which no flowers occur; these are white to green and sometimes tinged reddish-purple, and the upper ends are tapered. The hermaphrodite flowers are zygomorphic and threefold. The three sepals are 0.8 to 1.2 cm (3⁄8 to 1⁄2 in) long, fused, and white, and have fluffy hairs; the three calyx teeth are unequal. The three bright-yellow petals are fused into a corolla tube up to 3 cm (1+1⁄4 in) long. The three corolla lobes have a length of 1.0 to 1.5 cm (3⁄8–5⁄8 in) and are triangular with soft-spiny upper ends. While the average corolla lobe is larger than the two lateral, only the median stamen of the inner circle is fertile. The dust bag is spurred at its base. All other stamens are converted to staminodes. The outer staminodes are shorter than the labellum. The labellum is yellowish, with a yellow ribbon in its center and it is obovate, with a length from 1.2 to 2.0 cm (1⁄2 to 3⁄4 in). Three carpels are under a constant, trilobed ovary adherent, which is sparsely hairy. The fruit capsule opens with three compartments. In East Asia, the flowering time is usually in August. Terminally on the false stem is an inflorescence stem, 12 to 20 cm (4+1⁄2 to 8 in) long, containing many flowers. The bracts are light green and ovate to oblong with a blunt upper end with a length of 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in). == Phytochemistry == Turmeric powder is about 60–70% carbohydrates, 6–13% water, 6–8% protein, 5–10% fat, 3–7% dietary minerals, 3–7% essential oils, 2–7% dietary fiber, and 1–6% curcuminoids. The golden yellow color of turmeric is due to curcumin. Phytochemical components of turmeric include diarylheptanoids, a class including numerous curcuminoids, such as curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Curcumin constitutes up to 3.14% of assayed commercial samples of turmeric powder (the average was 1.51%); curry powder contains much less (an average of 0.29%). Some 34 essential oils are present in turmeric, among which turmerone, germacrone, atlantone, and zingiberene are major constituents. == Uses == === Culinary === Turmeric is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes, imparting a mustard-like, earthy aroma and pungent, slightly bitter flavor to foods. It is used mostly in savory dishes, but also is used in some sweet dishes, such as the cake sfouf. In India, turmeric leaf is used to prepare special sweet dishes, patoleo, by layering rice flour and coconut-jaggery mixture on the leaf, then closing and steaming it in a special utensil (chondrõ). Most turmeric is used in the form of rhizome powder to impart a golden yellow color. It is used in many products such as canned beverages, baked products, dairy products, ice cream, yogurt, yellow cakes, orange juice, biscuits, popcorn, cereals and sauces. It is a principal ingredient in curry powders. Although typically used in its dried, powdered form, turmeric also is used fresh, like ginger. Turmeric is used widely as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking. Various Iranian khoresh recipes begin with onions caramelized in oil and turmeric. The Moroccan spice mix ras el hanout typically includes turmeric. In South Africa, turmeric is used to give boiled white rice a golden color, known as geelrys (yellow rice) traditionally served with bobotie. In Vietnamese cuisine, turmeric powder is used to color and enhance the flavors of certain dishes, such as bánh xèo, bánh khọt, and mì Quảng. The staple Cambodian curry paste, kroeung, used in many dishes, including fish amok, typically contains fresh turmeric. In Indonesia, turmeric leaves are used for Minang or Padang curry base of Sumatra, such as rendang, sate padang, and many other varieties. In the Philippines, turmeric is used in the preparation and cooking of kuning, satti, and some variants of adobo. In Thailand, fresh turmeric rhizomes are used widely in many dishes, in particular in the southern Thai cuisine, such as yellow curry and turmeric soup. Turmeric is used in a hot drink called ""turmeric latte"" or ""golden milk"" that is made with milk, frequently coconut milk. The turmeric milk drink known as haldī dūdh (haldī [हलदी] means turmeric in Hindi) is a traditional Indian recipe. Sold in the US and UK, the drink known as ""golden milk"" uses nondairy milk and sweetener, and sometimes black pepper after the traditional recipe (which may also use ghee). Turmeric is approved for use as a food color, assigned the code E100. The oleoresin is used for oil-containing products. In combination with annatto (E160b), turmeric has been used to color numerous food products. Turmeric is used to give a yellow color to some prepared mustards, canned chicken broths, and other foods—often as a much cheaper replacement for saffron. === Traditional uses === In 2019, the European Medicines Agency concluded that turmeric herbal teas, or other forms taken by mouth, on the basis of their long-standing traditional use, could be used to relieve mild digestive problems, such as feelings of fullness and flatulence. Turmeric grows wild in the forests of South and Southeast Asia, where it is collected for use in classical Indian medicine (Siddha or Ayurveda). In Eastern India, the plant is used as one of the nine components of nabapatrika along with young plantain or banana plant, taro leaves, barley (jayanti), wood apple (bilva), pomegranate (darimba), Saraca indica, manaka (Arum), or manakochu, and rice paddy. The Haldi ceremony called gaye holud in Bengal (literally ""yellow on the body"") is a ceremony observed during wedding celebrations of people of Indian culture all throughout the Indian subcontinent. In Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, as a part of the Tamil–Telugu marriage ritual, a dried turmeric tuber tied with a string is used to create a Thali necklace. In western and coastal India, during weddings of the Marathi and Konkani people, Kannada Brahmins, turmeric tubers are tied with strings by the couple to their wrists during a ceremony, Kankana Bandhana. In many Hindu communities, turmeric paste is applied to the bride and groom as part of pre-wedding festivities known as the haldi ceremony. Turmeric makes a poor fabric dye, as it is not light fast, but is commonly used in Indian clothing, such as saris and Buddhist monks' robes. During the late Edo period (1603–1867), turmeric was used to dilute or substitute more expensive safflower dyestuff in the production of beni itajime shibori.: 1 Friedrich Ratzel reported in The History of Mankind during 1896, that in Micronesia, turmeric powder was applied for embellishment of body, clothing, utensils, and ceremonial uses. Native Hawaiians who introduced it to Hawaii (Hawaiian: ʻōlena) make a bright yellow dye out of it. === Indicator === Turmeric paper, also called curcuma paper or in German literature, Curcumapapier, is paper steeped in a tincture of turmeric and allowed to dry. It is used in chemical analysis as an indicator for acidity and alkalinity. The paper is yellow in acidic and neutral solutions and turns brown to reddish-brown in alkaline solutions, with transition between pH of 7.4 and 9.2. == Adulteration == As turmeric and other spices are commonly sold by weight, the potential exists for powders of toxic, cheaper agents with a similar color to be added, such as lead(II,IV) oxide (""red lead""). These additives give turmeric an orange-red color instead of its native gold-yellow, and such conditions led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue import alerts from 2013 to 2019 on turmeric originating in India and Bangladesh. Imported into the United States in 2014 were approximately 5.4 million kilograms (12 million pounds) of turmeric, some of which was used for food coloring, traditional medicine, or dietary supplement. Lead detection in turmeric products led to recalls across the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the United Kingdom through 2016. Lead chromate, a bright yellow chemical compound, was found as an adulterant of turmeric in Bangladesh, where turmeric is used commonly in foods and the contamination levels were up to 500 times higher than the national limit. Researchers identified a chain of sources adulterating the turmeric with lead chromate: from farmers to merchants selling low-grade turmeric roots to ""polishers"" who added lead chromate for yellow color enhancement, to wholesalers for market distribution, all unaware of the potential consequences of lead toxicity. Another common adulterant in turmeric, metanil yellow (also known as acid yellow 36), is considered by the British Food Standards Agency as an illegal dye for use in foods. == Medical research == Turmeric and curcumin have been studied in numerous clinical trials for various human diseases and conditions, with no high-quality evidence of any anti-disease effect or health benefit. There is no scientific evidence that curcumin reduces inflammation, as of 2020. There is weak evidence that turmeric extracts may be beneficial for relieving symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, as well as for reducing pain and muscle damage following physical exercise. There is good evidence that turmeric is an allergen. == See also == == References == == External links == The dictionary definition of turmeric at Wiktionary Turmeric at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject",Turmeric,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.00010068230039905757), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0007786102942191064), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.693213701248169)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7522354/?utm_source=openai), [ijdvl.com](https://ijdvl.com/turmeric-a-condiment-cosmetic-and-cure/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=204, start_index=21, title='Turmeric and Its Major Compound Curcumin on Health: Bioactive Effects and Safety Profiles for Food, Pharmaceutical, Biotechnological and Medicinal Applications - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7522354/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=204, start_index=21, title='Turmeric: A condiment, cosmetic and cure - Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology', type='url_citation', url='https://ijdvl.com/turmeric-a-condiment-cosmetic-and-cure/?utm_source=openai')])"

This dianion is very common in cells as the majority of glucose entering a cell will become phosphorylated in this way. Because of its prominent position in cellular chemistry, glucose 6-phosphate has many possible fates within the cell. It lies at the start of two major metabolic pathways: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to these two metabolic pathways, glucose 6-phosphate may also be converted to glycogen or starch for storage. This storage is in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen for most multicellular animals, and in intracellular starch or glycogen granules for most other organisms. == Production == === From glucose === Within a cell, glucose 6-phosphate is produced by phosphorylation of glucose on the sixth carbon. This is catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase in most cells, and, in higher animals, glucokinase in certain cells, most notably liver cells. One equivalent of ATP is consumed in this reaction. Compound C00031 at KEGG Pathway Database. Enzyme 2.7.1.1 at KEGG Pathway Database. Compound C00668 at KEGG Pathway Database. Reaction R01786 at KEGG Pathway Database. The major reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent diffusion out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged phosphate group so the glucose 6-phosphate cannot easily cross the cell membrane. === From glycogen === Glucose 6-phosphate is also produced during glycogenolysis from glucose 1-phosphate, the first product of the breakdown of glycogen polymers. == Pentose phosphate pathway == When the ratio of NADP+ to NADPH increases, the body needs to produce more NADPH (a reducing agent for several reactions like fatty acid synthesis and glutathione reduction in erythrocytes). This will cause the G6P to be dehydrogenated to 6-phosphogluconate by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This irreversible reaction is the initial step of the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates the useful cofactor NADPH as well as ribulose-5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules. Also, if the body needs nucleotide precursors of DNA for growth and synthesis, G6P will also be dehydrogenated and enter the pentose phosphate pathway. == Glycolysis == If the cell needs energy or carbon skeletons for synthesis, then glucose 6-phosphate is targeted for glycolysis. Glucose 6-phosphate is first isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase, which uses magnesium as a cofactor. Compound C00668 at KEGG Pathway Database. Enzyme 5.3.1.9 at KEGG Pathway Database. Compound C05345 at KEGG Pathway Database. Reaction R00771 at KEGG Pathway Database. This reaction converts glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in preparation for phosphorylation to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The addition of the second phosphoryl group to produce fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is an irreversible step, and so is used to irreversibly target the glucose 6-phosphate breakdown to provide energy for ATP production via glycolysis. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == Storage as glycogen == If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way to store the excess glucose. After being converted to G6P, the molecule can be turned into glucose 1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. Glucose 1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose, driven by the hydrolysis of UTP, releasing phosphate. Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It is important to note that glucose 6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline. When the body needs glucose for energy, glycogen phosphorylase, with the help of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a molecule from the glycogen chain. The cleaved molecule is in the form of glucose 1-phosphate, which can be converted into G6P by phosphoglucomutase. Next, the phosphoryl group on G6P can be cleaved by glucose 6-phosphatase so that a free glucose can be formed. This free glucose can pass through membranes and can enter the bloodstream to travel to other places in the body. == Dephosphorylation and release into bloodstream == Liver cells express the transmembrane enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum. The catalytic site is found on the lumenal face of the membrane, and removes the phosphate group from glucose 6-phosphate produced during glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Free glucose is transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum via GLUT7 and released into the bloodstream via GLUT2 for uptake by other cells. Muscle cells lack this enzyme, so myofibers use glucose 6-phosphate in their own metabolic pathways such as glycolysis. Importantly, this prevents myocytes from releasing glycogen stores they have obtained into the blood. == See also == Glucose Glucose 1-phosphate Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Glycogen Pentose phosphate pathway == References == === Bibliography === Berg, Jeremy M.; Tymoczko, Stryer (2002).

In contrast to most trypsin inhibitors, those from garden four o'clock (Mirabilis jalapa) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) do not share sequence similarity and have been proposed to form the new Mirabilis serine protease inhibitor family. These 30-40-amino-acid inhibitors possess a defined disulfide-bridge topology and belong to the cystine-knot miniproteins (knottins). To date, no atomic structure of this inhibitor family has been solved. Here, the first structure of S. oleracea trypsin inhibitor III (SOTI-III), in complex with bovine pancreatic trypsin, is reported. The inhibitor was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis on a multi-milligram scale and was assayed to test its inhibitory activity and binding properties. The structure confirmed the proposed cystine-bridge topology. The structural features of SOTI-III suggest that it belongs to a new canonical serine protease inhibitor family with promising properties for use in protein-engineering and medical applications. Deregulation in the ras oncogene is a common event in many types of human cancer. Our previous study clearly demonstrated that genetic alterations of ras oncogene are frequently found in human epithelial ovarian cancer. Recent reports have indicated that farnesyltransferase is involved in the regulation of post-translational modification and biological function of Ras proteins. Here, we report that a newly synthesized farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FPT inhibitor III, upregulates Bax and Bcl-xs expression and induces apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. This is a critical finding that farnesyltransferase inhibitors may directly activate apoptotic signaling pathways in cancer cells and may help to provide a new strategy in the treatment of human cancer.

HepG2 cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cells) were cultured with KW-2478, at different doses and for different times, in vitro. The MTT assay was used to detect the effect of KW-2478 on proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of KW-2478 on the cell cycle and apoptosis of HepG2 cells. The Transwell assay was used to determine the effect of KW-2478 on cell invasion. The β-galactosidase assay tested the effect of low-dose KW-2478 on the senescence of HepG2 cells. Western blotting and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used respectively to assess changes in protein and mRNA levels of related factors in HepG2 cells after the KW-2478 treatment.

KW-2478 affected the expression of related factors in the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling and cell cycle-related regulatory pathways. KW-2478 downregulated the expression of STAT3, which is a key factor in the JAK-STAT pathway, indicating that KW-2478 may affect the function of HepG2 cells by downregulating STAT3. KW-2478 is a promising anti-cancer lead compound targeting to the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90  With the widespread clinical application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), an increasing number of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients have developed resistance or intolerance to TKIs. BCR/ABL is the oncoprotein of CML. HSP90 is an essential chaperone of BCR/ABL and plays an important role in protein folding and the function of BCR/ABL. Therefore, inhibiting the chaperone function of HSP90 may be an effective strategy for CML treatment and to overcome TKI resistance. The effect of KW-2478 on CML cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle progression was detected by CCK-8 assay or flow cytometry. The levels of BCR/ABL, HSP90 and other signalling proteins were detected by western blots. The mitochondrial membrane potential was detected by flow cytometry combined with JC-1 staining. The interaction between BCR/ABL and HSP90α was detected by coimmunoprecipitation. The effect of KW-2478 on BCR/ABL carcinogenesis in vivo was investigated in CML-like mouse models. KW-2478 inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of CML cells. KW-2478 inhibited the chaperone function of HSP90α and then weakened the BCR/ABL and MAPK signalling pathways. This treatment also caused an increase in p27 and p21 expression and a decrease in cyclin B1 expression, which led to G2/M phase arrest. The mitochondrial pathway was primarily responsible for KW-2478-induced apoptosis. KW-2478 had a synergistic effect with imatinib in growth inhibition. Notably, KW-2478 had a stronger effect on growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest of K562/G01 cells than K562 cells. KW-2478 could effectively prolong the mouse lifespan and alleviate disease symptoms in CML-like mouse models. This finding demonstrated that KW-2478 had anticancer properties in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells and illustrated the possible mechanisms. This study provides an alternative choice for CML treatment, especially for TKI-resistant patients with BCR/ABL amplification and TKI-intolerant patients.",Kw 2478,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.493430894101039e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02987850457429886), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02325546368956566)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([scbt.com](https://www.scbt.com/de/p/kw-2478-819812-04-9?utm_source=openai), [ehoonline.biomedcentral.com](https://ehoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40164-022-00287-w?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3346683/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=298, start_index=6, title='KW-2478 | CAS 819812-04-9 | SCBT - Santa Cruz Biotechnology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.scbt.com/de/p/kw-2478-819812-04-9?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=298, start_index=6, title='The HSP90 inhibitor KW-2478 depletes the malignancy of BCR/ABL and overcomes the imatinib-resistance caused by BCR/ABL amplification | Experimental Hematology & Oncology | Full Text', type='url_citation', url='https://ehoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40164-022-00287-w?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=298, start_index=6, title='Anti-tumor activity against multiple myeloma by combination of KW-2478, an Hsp90 inhibitor, with bortezomib - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3346683/?utm_source=openai')])"

Concerns about drug-drug interactions (DDIs) have meant patients receiving drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 were ineligible for acumapimod trials. We report on how 2 acumapimod clinical DDI studies and a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model assessing how co-administration of a weak (azithromycin) and strong (itraconazole) CYP3A4 inhibitor affected acumapimod systemic exposure, informed decision making and supported concomitant use of CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors.

3359,"('Atomoxetine (hydrochloride)', 'Tomoxetine hydrochloride', 'Ly 139603', '(r)-tomoxetine hydrochloride', 'Atomoxetine')",Medical,"Atomoxetine, formerly sold under the brand name Strattera, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (sNRI) medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, to a lesser extent, cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS). It may be used alone or along with stimulant medication. It enhances the executive functions of self-motivation, sustained attention, inhibition, working memory, reaction time, and emotional self-regulation. Use of atomoxetine is only recommended for those who are at least six years old. It is taken orally. The effectiveness of atomoxetine is comparable to the commonly prescribed stimulant medication methylphenidate. Common side effects of atomoxetine include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, feeling tired, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include angioedema, liver problems, stroke, psychosis, heart problems, suicide, and aggression. There is a lack of data regarding its safety during pregnancy; as of 2019, its safety during pregnancy and for use during breastfeeding is not certain. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. In 2022, it was the 213th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Atomoxetine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Atomoxetine is approved for use in children, adolescents, and adults. However, its efficacy has not been studied in children under six years old. One of the primary differences with the standard stimulant treatments for ADHD is that it has little known abuse potential. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have found that atomoxetine has comparable efficacy and equal tolerability to methylphenidate in children and adolescents. In adults, efficacy and tolerability are equivalent. While its efficacy may be less than that of lisdexamphetamine, there is some evidence that it may be used in combination with stimulants. Doctors may prescribe non-stimulants including atomoxetine when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants; when a stimulant was not effective; in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness; when the cost of stimulants is prohibitive; or when there is concern about the abuse potential of stimulants in a patient with a history of substance use disorder. Atomoxetine alleviates ADHD symptoms through norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and by indirectly increasing dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, sharing 70-80% of the brain regions with stimulants in their produced effects. Unlike α2-adrenergic receptor agonists such as guanfacine and clonidine, atomoxetine's use can be abruptly stopped without significant withdrawal symptoms being observed. The initial therapeutic effects of atomoxetine usually take 1 to 4 weeks to become apparent. A further 2 to 4 weeks may be required for the full therapeutic effects to be seen. Incrementally increasing response may occur up to 1 year or longer. The maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents is 70 mg and adults is 100 mg. === Other uses === ==== Cognitive disengagement syndrome ==== Atomoxetine may be used to cognitive disengagement syndrome (CDS), as multiple randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have found that it is an effective treatment. In contrast, multiple RCTs have shown that it responds poorly to the stimulant medication methylphenidate. ==== Traumatic brain injury ==== Atomoxetine is sometimes used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and frontal lobe symptoms due to conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is used to treat ADHD-like symptoms such as sustained attentional problems, disinhibition, lack of arousal, fatigue, and depression, including symptoms from cognitive disengagement syndrome. A 2015 Cochrane review identified only one study of atomoxetine for TBI and found no positive effects. Aside from TBI, atomoxetine was found to be effective in the treatment of akinetic mutism following subarachnoid hemorrhage in a case report. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Any cardiovascular disease including: Moderate to severe hypertension Atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter Ventricular tachycardia Ventricular fibrillation Ventricular flutter Advanced arteriosclerosis Severe cardiovascular disorders Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism Pheochromocytoma Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Narrow-angle glaucoma == Adverse effects == Common side effects include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea, feeling tired, dizziness and urinary retention. Serious side effects may include angioedema, liver problems, stroke, psychosis, heart problems, suicide, and aggression. A 2020 meta-analysis found that atomoxetine was associated with anorexia, weight loss, and hypertension, rating it as a ""potentially least preferred agent based on safety"" for treating ADHD. As of 2019, safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not clear; a 2018 review stated that, ""because of lack of data, the treating physician should consider stopping atomoxetine treatment in women with ADHD during pregnancy."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning for suicidal behavior/ideation. Similar warnings have been issued in Australia. Unlike stimulant medications, atomoxetine does not have abuse liability or the potential to cause withdrawal effects on abrupt discontinuation. == Overdose == Atomoxetine can lead to cardiac complications, with severe overdose requiring intensive medical care to avoid death. == Interactions == Atomoxetine is a substrate for CYP2D6. Concurrent treatment with a CYP2D6 inhibitor such as bupropion, fluoxetine, or paroxetine has been shown to increase plasma atomoxetine by 100% or more, as well as increase N-desmethylatomoxetine levels and decrease plasma 4-hydroxyatomoxetine levels by a similar degree. Atomoxetine has been found to directly inhibit hERG potassium currents with an IC50 of 6.3 μM, which has the potential to cause arrhythmia. QT prolongation has been reported with atomoxetine at therapeutic doses and in overdose; it is suggested that atomoxetine not be used with other medications that may prolong the QT interval, concomitantly with CYP2D6 inhibitors, and caution to be used in poor metabolizers. Other notable drug interactions include: Antihypertensive agents, due to atomoxetine acting as an indirect sympathomimetic Indirect-acting sympathomimetics, such as pseudoephedrine, other norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), or MAOIs Direct-acting sympathomimetics, such as phenylephrine or other α1-adrenergic receptor agonists, including vasopressors such as dobutamine or isoprenaline and β2-adrenergic receptor agonists Highly plasma protein-bound drugs: atomoxetine has the potential to displace these drugs from plasma proteins which may potentiate their adverse or toxic effects. In vitro, atomoxetine does not affect the plasma protein binding of aspirin, desipramine, diazepam, paroxetine, phenytoin, or warfarin Atomoxetine prevents norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and has been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Atomoxetine inhibits the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter (NET), preventing the reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain along with inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine in specific brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, where dopamine transporter (DAT) expression is minimal. In rats, atomoxetine increased prefrontal cortex catecholamine concentrations without altering dopamine levels in the striatum or nucleus accumbens; in contrast, methylphenidate, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was found to increase prefrontal, striatal, and accumbal dopamine levels to the same degree. In addition to rats, atomoxetine has also been found to induce similar region-specific catecholamine level alteration in mice. Atomoxetine's status as a serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor at clinical doses in humans is uncertain. A PET imaging study on rhesus monkeys found that atomoxetine occupied >90% and >85% of neural NET and SERT, respectively. However, both mouse and rat microdialysis studies have failed to find an increase in extracellular serotonin in the prefrontal cortex following acute or chronic atomoxetine treatment. Supporting atomoxetine's selectivity, a human study found no effects on platelet serotonin uptake (a marker of SERT inhibition) and inhibition of the pressor effects of tyramine (a marker of NET inhibition). Atomoxetine has been found to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist in rat cortical neurons at therapeutic concentrations. It causes a use-dependent open-channel block and its binding site overlaps with the Mg2+ binding site. Atomoxetine's ability to increase prefrontal cortex firing rate in anesthetized rats could not be blocked by D1 or α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, but could be potentiated by NMDA or an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, suggesting a glutaminergic mechanism. In Sprague Dawley rats, atomoxetine reduces NR2B protein content without altering transcript levels. Aberrant glutamate and NMDA receptor function have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. Atomoxetine also reversibly inhibits GIRK currents in Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent, voltage-independent, and time-independent manner. Kir3.1/3.2 ion channels are opened downstream of M2, α2, D2, and A1 stimulation, as well as other Gi-coupled receptors. Therapeutic concentrations of atomoxetine are within range of interacting with GIRKs, especially in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. It is not known whether this contributes to the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine, the major active metabolite of atomoxetine in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, has been found to have sub-micromolar affinity for opioid receptors, acting as an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors and a partial agonist at κ-opioid receptors. It is not known whether this action at the kappa-opioid receptor leads to CNS-related adverse effects. === Pharmacokinetics === Orally administered atomoxetine is rapidly and completely absorbed. First-pass metabolism by the liver is dependent on CYP2D6 activity, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of 63% for extensive metabolizers and 94% for poor metabolizers. Maximum plasma concentration is reached in 1–2 hours. If taken with food, the maximum plasma concentration decreases by 10–40% and delays the tmax by 3 hours. Drugs affecting gastric pH have no effect on oral bioavailability. Following intravenous delivery, atomoxetine has a volume of distribution of 0.85 L/kg (indicating distribution primarily in total body water), with limited partitioning into red blood cells. It is highly bound to plasma proteins (98.7%), mainly albumin, along with α1-acid glycoprotein (77%) and IgG (15%). Its metabolite N-desmethylatomoxetine is 99.1% bound to plasma proteins, while 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is only 66.6% bound. The half-life of atomoxetine varies widely between individuals, with an average range of 4.5 to 19 hours. As atomoxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6, exposure may be increased 10-fold in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Among CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, the half-life of atomoxetine averaged 5.34 hours and the half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethylatomoxetine was 8.9 hours. By contrast, among CYP2D6 poor metabolizers the half-life of atomoxetine averaged 20.0 hours and the half-life of N-desmethylatomoxetine averaged 33.3 hours. Steady-state levels of atomoxetine are typically achieved at or around day 10 of regular dosing, with trough plasma concentrations (Ctrough) residing around 30–40°ng/mL; however, both the time to steady-state levels and Ctrough are expected to vary based on a patient's CYP2D6 profile. Atomoxetine, N-desmethylatomoxetine, and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine produce minimal to no inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, but inhibit CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes at concentrations between 3.6 and 17 μmol/L. Plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine and N-desmethylatomoxetine at steady state are 1% and 5% that of atomoxetine in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, and 0.1% and 45% that of atomoxetine in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, respectively. Atomoxetine is excreted unchanged in urine at <3% in both extensive and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, with >96% and 80% of a total dose being excreted in urine, respectively. The fractions excreted in urine as 4-hydroxyatomoxetine and its glucuronide account for 86% of a given dose in extensive metabolizers, but only 40% in poor metabolizers. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers excrete greater amounts of minor metabolites, namely N-desmethylatomoxetine and 2-hydroxymethylatomoxetine and their conjugates. ==== Pharmacogenomics ==== Chinese adults homozygous for the hypoactive CYP2D6*10 allele have been found to exhibit two-fold higher area-under-the-curve (AUCs) and 1.5-fold higher maximum plasma concentrations compared to extensive metabolizers. Japanese men homozygous for CYP2D6*10 have similarly been found to experience two-fold higher AUCs compared to extensive metabolizers. == Chemistry == Atomoxetine, or (−)-methyl[(3R)-3-(2-methylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine, is a white, granular powder that is highly soluble in water. === Synthesis === === Detection in biological fluids === Atomoxetine may be quantitated in plasma, serum, or whole blood to distinguish extensive versus poor metabolizers in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. == History == Atomoxetine is manufactured, marketed, and sold in the United States as the hydrochloride salt (atomoxetine HCl) under the brand name Strattera by Eli Lilly and Company, the original patent-filing company and current U.S. patent owner. Atomoxetine was initially intended to be developed as an antidepressant, but it was found to be insufficiently efficacious for treating depression. It was, however, found to be effective for ADHD and was approved by the FDA in 2002, for the treatment of ADHD. Its patent expired in May 2017. On 12 August 2010, Lilly lost a lawsuit that challenged its patent on Strattera, increasing the likelihood of an earlier entry of a generic into the US market. On 1 September 2010, Sun Pharmaceuticals announced it would begin manufacturing a generic in the United States. In a 29 July 2011 conference call, however, Sun Pharmaceutical's Chairman stated ""Lilly won that litigation on appeal so I think [generic Strattera]'s deferred."" In 2017 the FDA approved the generic production of atomoxetine by four pharmaceutical companies. == Society and culture == The drug was originally known as tomoxetine. It was renamed to avoid medication errors, as the name may be confused with tamoxifen. === Brand names === In India, atomoxetine is sold under brand names including Axetra, Axepta, Attera, Tomoxetin, and Attentin. In Australia, Canada, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and the US, atomoxetine is sold under the brand name Strattera. In France, hospitals dispense atomoxetine under the brand name Strattera (it is not marketed in France). In the Czech Republic, it is sold under brand names including Mylan. In Poland, it is sold under the brand name Auroxetyn. In Iran, atomoxetine is sold under brand names including Stramox. In Brazil, it is sold under the brand name Atentah. In Turkey, it is sold under the brand names Attex, Setinox, and Atominex. In 2017, a generic version was approved in the United States. == Research == There has been some suggestion that atomoxetine might be a helpful adjunct in people with major depression, particularly in cases with concomitant ADHD. Atomoxetine may be used in those with ADHD and bipolar disorder although such use has not been well established. Some benefit has also been seen in people with ADHD and autism. As with other norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors it appears to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, although research has focused mainly on specific patient groups such as those with concurrent ADHD or methamphetamine dependence. == References == == Further reading ==",Atomoxetine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4927710657939315e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002656822034623474)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/atomoxetine-marketed-strattera-information?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=166, start_index=9, title='Atomoxetine (marketed as Strattera) Information | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/atomoxetine-marketed-strattera-information?utm_source=openai')])"

It is an epimer of dithiothreitol (DTT). The molecular formula for DTE is C4H10O2S2. == Chemical properties == DTE is a crystalline solid soluble in water and alcohols. == Applications == Like DTT, DTE makes an excellent reducing agent, which can be used for reduction of disulfide bonds. The reduction potential of DTE is the same as for DTT, about –0.331 mV. The pKa values of the thiol groups of DTE are 9.0 and 9.9, which is higher than the corresponding values for DTT (9.3 and 9.5). Since reduction of disulfide bonds requires thiolate (ionized thiol), DTE is less efficient at lower pH compared to DTT. Reduction with DTE is slower than with DTT. This is presumably because the orientation of the OH groups in its cyclic disulfide-bonded form (oxidized form) is less stable due to greater steric repulsion than their orientation in the disulfide-bonded form of DTT. In the disulfide-bonded form of DTT, these hydroxyl groups are trans to each other, whereas they are cis to each other in DTE. == References == == External links == Media related to Dithioerythritol at Wikimedia Commons","Erythro-1,4-dimercapto-2,3-butanediol",WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0001234428636962548), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.387246698141098), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001007287879474461)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01692,https://www.chemblink.com/products/6892-68-8.htm,https://cymitquimica.com/products/7W-GE5960/6892-68-8/14-dithioerythritol/ ', [])"

A colorless compound, it is classified as a dithiol and a diol. DTT is redox reagent also known as Cleland's reagent, after W. Wallace Cleland. The reagent is commonly used in its racemic form. Its name derives from the four-carbon sugar, threose. DTT has an epimeric ('sister') compound, dithioerythritol (DTE). == Synthesis == The traditional route to dithiothreitol (and its isomer dithioerythritol) is sulfidation of the extremely lachrymatory 1,4-Dibromobut-2-ene. Modern industrial syntheses instead use related epoxides and hydrogen sulfide. == Reducing agent == DTT is a reducing agent; once oxidized, it forms a stable six-membered ring with an internal disulfide bond. It has a redox potential of −0.33 V at pH 7. The reduction of a typical disulfide bond proceeds by two sequential thiol-disulfide exchange reactions and is illustrated below. The reduction usually does not stop at the mixed-disulfide species because the second thiol of DTT has a high propensity to close the ring, forming oxidized DTT and leaving behind a reduced disulfide bond. The reducing power of DTT is limited to pH values above 7, since only the negatively charged thiolate form -S− is reactive (the protonated thiol form -SH is not); the pKa of the thiol groups is 9.2 and 10.1. == Applications == DTT is used as a reducing or ""deprotecting"" agent for thiolated DNA. The terminal sulfur atoms of thiolated DNA have a tendency to form dimers in solution, especially in the presence of oxygen. Dimerization greatly lowers the efficiency of subsequent coupling reactions such as DNA immobilization on gold in biosensors. Typically DTT is mixed with a DNA solution and allowed to react, and then is removed by filtration (for the solid catalyst) or by chromatography (for the liquid form). The DTT removal procedure is often called ""desalting."" Generally, DTT is used as a protecting agent that prevents oxidation of thiol groups. DTT is frequently used to reduce the disulfide bonds of proteins and, more generally, to prevent intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds from forming between cysteine residues of proteins. However, even DTT cannot reduce buried (solvent-inaccessible) disulfide bonds, so reduction of disulfide bonds is sometimes carried out under denaturing conditions (e.g., at high temperatures, or in the presence of a strong denaturant such as 6 M guanidinium chloride, 8 M urea, or 1% sodium dodecylsulfate). DTT is oftentimes used along with sodium dodecylsulfate in SDS-PAGE to further denature proteins by reducing their disulfide bonds to allow for better separation of proteins during electrophoresis. Because of the ability to reduce disulfide bonds, DTT can be used to denature CD38 on red blood cells. DTT will also denature antigens in the Kell, Lutheran, Dombrock, Cromer, Cartwright, LW and Knops blood group systems. Conversely, the solvent exposure of different disulfide bonds can be assayed by their rate of reduction in the presence of DTT. DTT can also be used as an oxidizing agent. Its principal advantage is that effectively no mixed-disulfide species are populated, in contrast to other agents such as glutathione. In very rare cases, a DTT adduct may be formed, i.e., the two sulfur atoms of DTT may form disulfide bonds to different sulfur atoms; in such cases, DTT cannot cyclize since it has no such remaining free thiols. == Properties == DTT is oxidized by air. So it is normally stored and handled under inert atmosphere to minimize oxidation. The rate of air-oxidation is slower at low temperatures. Oxidized DTT exhibits a strong absorbance peak at 280 nm. Since thiols are less nucleophilic than their conjugate bases, thiolates, DTT becomes a less potent nucleophile as the pH falls. (2S)-2-Amino-1,4-dimercaptobutane (dithiobutylamine or DTBA), a related dithiol reducing agent, somewhat overcomes this limitation of DTT. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) is an alternative reducing agent that is more stable and effective at low pH, but it is bulky and reduces cystines in folded proteins only slowly. DTT's half-life is 40 hours at pH 6.5 and 1.4 hours at pH 8.5 and 20 °C; its half-life decreases further as temperature increases. The presence of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) to chelate divalent metal ions considerably extends the half-life of DTT in solution. == See also == Dithiobutylamine (DTBA) 2-Mercaptoethanol (BME) TCEP == References == == External links == Media related to Dithiothreitol at Wikimedia Commons",Dithiothreitol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.10088931769132614), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47417205572128296)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithiothreitol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=12, title='Dithiothreitol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithiothreitol?utm_source=openai')])"

3363,"('Methylprednisolone', 'U 7532', 'Medrol', 'Metilprednisolone', 'Medrone')",Medical,"Methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol, Medrol, Solu-Medrol) is a synthetic glucocorticoid, primarily prescribed for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. It is either used at low doses for chronic illnesses or used at high doses during acute flares. Methylprednisolone and its derivatives can be administered orally or parenterally. Regardless of the route of administration, methylprednisolone integrates systemically as exhibited by its effectiveness to quickly reduce inflammation during acute flares. It is associated with many adverse reactions that require tapering off the drug as soon as the disease is under control. Serious side effects include iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome, hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes, infection, psychosis, and skin atrophy. Chemically, methylprednisolone is a synthetic pregnane steroid hormone derived from hydrocortisone and prednisolone. It belongs to a class of synthetic glucocorticoids and more generally, corticosteroids. It acts as a mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor agonist. In comparison to other exogenous glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone has a higher affinity to glucocorticoid receptors than to mineralocorticoid receptors. Glucocorticoid's name was derived after the discovery of their involvement in regulating carbohydrate metabolism. The cellular functions of glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone, are now understood to regulate homeostasis, metabolism, development, cognition, and inflammation. They play a critical role in adapting and responding to environmental, physical and emotional stress. Methylprednisolone was first synthesized and manufactured by The Upjohn Company (now Viatris) and FDA approved in the United States in October 1957. In 2022, it was the 153rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == The primary use of methylprednisolone is to suppress inflammatory and immune responses. Methylprednisolone achieves this primarily by regulating the number and function of leukocytes, cytokines, and chemokines. Its widespread inflammatory control is conducive in use across multiple disorders regardless of pathology. Methylprednisolone is commonly prescribed as short-term therapy for acute flares, as seen with acute gouty arthritis. It can be prescribed during on-going therapy in lower doses contingent upon monitorization of adverse effects. Dosage strength and formulation are optimized per medical use. === Asthma === In 2001–2002, 11.4% of patients diagnosed with asthma and seen at an outpatient visit were prescribed oral corticosteroids as a long-term control therapy. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) indicates systemic methylprednisolone in both short and long-term therapies to quickly control and to suppress persistent asthma, respectively. For exacerbations that result in a visit to the Emergency Department (ED), oral methylprednisolone is preferred over intravenous administration, unless there are issues with adherence or vomiting. Oral methylprednisolone is less invasive and studies have shown that equivalent efficacy compared to intravenous methylprednisolone. Dosage above 60–80 mg/day or 2 mg/kg/day is not recommended as it has not been shown to alter pulmonary function, rate of admission, or length of stay in the hospital compared to lower doses. Following ED discharge, it is advised to prescribe a five-day course of methylprednisolone to decrease the probability of relapse or withdrawal symptoms. === Rheumatic diseases === Methylprednisolone is used to treat several rheumatic diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Methylprednisolone dosage and administration for these diseases is highly variable due to varied pathophysiology between the diseases and within patients diagnosed with a given disease. In Lupus Nephritis, a common manifestation of SLE, patients are often prescribed methylprednisolone concomitantly with immunosuppressants. Severe manifestations are often treated with Cyclophosphamide or Rituximab and three doses of methylprednisolone IV-pulse treatment (as recommended by ACR guidelines) before switching to oral prednisolone and azathioprine for maintenance. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACI) are a second-line therapy to relieve joint pain resulting from rheumatoid arthritis. It is most commonly injected into the joints of the knees and shoulders. Although the injection is local, studies have shown systemic absorption as evidenced by beneficial effects on distant joints. In an attempt to minimize HPA suppression, FDA guidelines have restricted IACIs to three per year, with a minimum of 30 days in between injections. === Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency === Methylprednisolone is not typically recommended for primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency compared to other corticosteroids which have a higher affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors and salt-retaining properties. === Labeled indications === The labeled indications below are categorized by route of administration and then by medical discipline. ==== Oral methylprednisolone ==== Allergy and immunology: angioneurotic edema, asthma, urticaria, seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, and serum sickness. Dermatology: toxic epidermal necrolysis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, pemphigus, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, severe seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, and severe psoriasis. Endocrinology: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, nonsuppurative thyroiditis, and primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Gastroenterology: inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. Hematology: acquired (autoimmune) hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, secondary thrombocytopenia, erythroblastopenia, leukemia, lymphoma and congenital (erythroid) hypoplastic anemia. Pulmonary: aspiration pneumonitis, chronic beryllium disease, eosinophilic pneumonia, symptomatic sarcoidosis, and pulmonary tuberculosis in conjunction with antituberculosis chemotherapy. Nephrology: nephrotic syndrome, idiopathic type or secondary to lupus nephritis. Neurology: multiple sclerosis. Ophthalmology: scleritis, retinal vasculitis, uveitis, choroiditis, iritis, iridocyclitis, keratitis, optic neuritis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic corneal marginal ulcers, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, sympathetic ophthalmia, and chorioretinitis. Rheumatology: rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic carditis, acute gouty arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, acute and subacute bursitis, synovitis of osteoarthritis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, and epicondylitis. Miscellaneous: trichinosis with neurologic or myocardial involvement. ==== Parenteral methylprednisolone ==== Intra-articular or soft tissue injections: acute gouty arthritis, acute and subacute bursitis, acute tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, and synovitis of osteoarthritis. Intralesional injections: alopecia areata, discoid lupus erythematosus, keloids, granuloma annulare, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, psoriatic plaques, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. Intramuscular injections are prescribed to treat many of the same conditions indicated for oral administration. Intramuscular injections are administered as an alternative to oral therapy. === Off-label indications === Some of the off-label indications of methylprednisolone include acute spinal cord injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, alcoholic hepatitis, hormonal resuscitation in cadaveric organ recovery, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. === Available forms === Footnotes: 1Signifies varying strengths of available forms. Is not indicative of frequency nor daily cumulative dose; varies per patient and condition. 2Benzyl alcohol should not be used on neonates 3Preservative free formulation == Contraindications == Methylprednisolone should not be taken orally by people who have systemic fungal infections, except for Depo-Medrol when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions. Methylprednisolone is contraindicated in those with known hypersensitivity to methylprednisolone or its components Steroids should be used with caution in patients with ulcerative colitis, heart disease or hypertension, peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, osteoporosis, myasthenia gravis, glaucoma, and diabetes. Psychic manifestations may appear while taking methylprednisolone, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, personality changes to depression. Caution is required for patients with predisposed psychoses, as psychotic tendencies may be exacerbated while taking corticosteroids. Solu-Medrol 40 mg dosage contains lactose monohydrate produced from cow's milk; It should not be taken by anyone with known hypersensitivity to dairy products or its components. Severe medical events have been associated with epidural administration of Solu-Medrol and Depo-Medrol, including spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness and stroke. Intramuscular injections should not be administered to those with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Formulations of Solu-Medrol and Depo-Medrol containing benzyl alcohol are contraindicated for use in premature infants. Exposure of neural tissue to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity and in rare events has resulted in death. == Adverse effects == Adverse reactions may overshadow the therapeutic effects of methylprednisolone. === Central nervous system === There is minimal clinical diagnostic criteria to define the psychic adverse effects (PAE) associated with methylprednisolone use in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The prevalence varies from 1.3 to 62% of adult treated patients. The type and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms also varies significantly between patients, with 33% of patients reporting mild to moderate PAE and 5-10% reporting severe PAE. Methylprednisolone dose and duration have been implicated in PAE development. 20 mg/day of prednisone (16 mg/day of methylprednisolone) is the threshold dosage for PAE development agreed upon by many studies. Short-term pulse IV therapy at high doses is associated with rapid onset of manic and hypomanic symptoms, whereas long-term therapy gives rise to depressive symptoms (suicide attempts infrequent). PAE are reversible with treatment reduction or discontinuation. === Metabolic and endocrine === Iatrogenic Cushing's Syndrome is a direct complication of glucocorticoid therapy, and the most common cause of exogenous Cushing's Syndrome. Clinical features of Cushing's Syndrome are inclusive of many adverse effects in glucocorticoid therapy. Traditional symptoms include weight gain, myopathy, osteoporosis, increased risk of infection, hypertension, and psychological effects. Fat deposition is centralized on the trunk, in between shoulders (""buffalo hump""), and on the face (""moon face""). Patient education and provider monitoring is the first step in recognizing and diagnosing Iatrogenic Cushing's Syndrome. Exogenous glucocorticoids suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone (ATCH) production, which can be verified by AM biochemical analysis. The onset of side effects varies; neuropsychiatric symptoms can arise within a few hours, while osteoporosis takes months to develop. The metabolic effects of taking methylprednisolone involve the continuous breakdown of proteins for gluconeogenesis increasing the necessity for insulin. This results in hyperlipidemia, weight gain, and myopathy that may prompt a patient to cease treatment. === Infections === The Immunodeficiency section tabulates known pathogens of concern in glucocorticoid-induced immunodeficiency. === Musculoskeletal === Osteoporosis is a type of bone disease characterized by a loss of bone density, mass, and architecture that leaves a patient susceptible to fractures. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines osteoporosis in caucasian postmenopausal women as a bone mineral density (BMD) and a T-score of -2.5 or less. The prevalence of osteoporosis in patients with SLE varies geographically and some attribute it to BMD and T-score diagnostic appropriateness. British 10.3%, Chinese 21.7%The Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines and The American College of Rheumatology have switched to using a Z-score as a diagnostic marker for osteoporosis but have failed to find a clinical diagnostic threshold. Additionally, a UK-based study showed that BMD may underrepresent a patient with SLE, as their risk for fractures is 22% higher than the healthy individual. Exogenous corticosteroids induce osteoporosis by increasing bone resorption and reducing bone formation. Bone loss can be pronounced within the first few months of initiating methylprednisolone with a steady decrease with chronic use. Trabecular bone loss in the lumbar spine precedes cortical bone loss in the femoral neck. === Exhaustive list === Allergic: allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, and urticaria. Cardiovascular: hypertension, congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, premature atherosclerotic disease, arrhythmias, and possible hyperlipidemia. Dermatologic: impaired wound healing, petechiae, and ecchymoses, thinning of the skin, facial erythema, and increased sweating. Endocrine: Cushingoid features, growth suppression in children, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, menstrual irregularities, decreased carbohydrate intolerance, and latent diabetes mellitus. In patients with diabetes, increased requirements of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: sodium retention, fluid retention, potassium loss, hypokalemic alkalosis, or congestive heart failure in susceptible patients. Gastrointestinal: peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, abdominal distention, and ulcerative esophagitis. Metabolic: protein catabolism which causes negative nitrogen balance. Musculoskeletal: muscle weakness, loss of muscle mass, steroid myopathy, osteoporosis, tendon rupture (especially Achilles), vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, and pathologic fracture of long bones. Neurological: increased intracranial pressure with papilledema, convulsions, vertigo, and headache. Ophthalmic: posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and exophthalmos. === Withdrawal === Feedback of the exogenous glucocorticoids at the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis inhibits the secretion of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ATCH) at the hypothalamus and pituitary glands, respectively. Prolonged suppression leads to inadequate responses to physical and emotional stresses, such as illness and trauma. Suppression of ATCH may result in adrenal hypoplasia or secondary adrenal gland atrophy within 6 weeks of methylprednisolone therapy, leaving a patient at risk for developing a life-threatening adrenal insufficiency crisis. Factors that contribute to the extent of HPA axis suppression include steroid hormone potency (type of compound and route of administration), cumulative dose, duration of treatment and concomitant drug use. Any individual who has taken steroid hormones for 2+ weeks is at risk for developing HPA axis suppression. Systemic methylprednisolone risk has been marked as moderate within the class of synthetic glucocorticoids. Consult with your physician before discontinuing methylprednisolone for any reason. Abrupt termination of the drug commonly causes transient non-specific symptoms such as loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, headache, fever, joint and muscle pain, peeling skin, and weight loss. These symptoms can be attributed to steroid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, or disease relapse. Those who have been taking methylprednisolone as a long-term treatment may be gradually tapered off to minimize withdrawal symptoms and the potential for relapse. If symptoms are exacerbated, temporarily increasing methylprednisolone dosage has shown clinical relevancy. Studies retesting patients upon methylprednisolone withdrawal showed persistent adrenal insufficiency, with one study showing 15% after 3 years. However, there was a wide range of prevalence and lack of uniformity in the follow-up timeline. == Drug interactions == Caution is advised when taking methylprednisolone concurrently with the medications described below. === Enzyme inducers === All drugs that fall within the class of enzyme inducers increase the clearance and decrease the half-life of methylprednisolone when co-administered. Phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine and barbiturates, increase hepatic enzymes and rate of elimination, thus reducing the immunosuppressive effect of methylprednisolone. Increased dosages may be required to achieve desired effect of methylprednisolone. === Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors === Troleandomycin, ketoconazole, and Clarithromycin inhibit metabolism; and may decrease the rate of elimination and increase the half-life of methylprednisolone. Dosages should be decreased accordingly to avoid side effects. Another CYP 3A4 inhibitor, grapefruit juice, prolongs the half-life of oral methylprednisolone. === Oral contraceptives === Oral contraceptives inhibit oxidative processes, as highlighted by their ability to decrease methylprednisolone clearance. === P-glycoprotein inhibitors === Methylprednisolone is shown to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein; its inhibition is thought to increase methylprednisone absorption and distribution. No clinical relevance has been linked. === Ciclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus (Rapamycin) === Methylprednisolone and cyclosporin inhibit metabolism and therefore increase the likelihood of experiencing side effects associated with either of the individual drugs. In addition to known individual side effects, convulsions have been reported. === Cox1 inhibitors === Methylprednisolone may increase the rate of elimination with chronic high doses of aspirin. Patients are susceptible to increased salicylate serum levels or salicylate toxicity upon termination of methylprednisolone. Excessive caution should be taken when prescribing methylprednisolone and aspirin to patients with hypoprothrombinemia. === Anticoagulants === Anticoagulants exhibit variable interactions; monitoring coagulation indices is recommended to achieve the desired effect. == Pharmacology == Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid (GCs) that exhibits pleiotropic effects on a variety of physiological mechanisms. However, they have been prescribed extensively for their effects on inflammation and immunity. The effects of synthetic glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone, are dependent on its association with intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and to a lesser extent, mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). GRs are widely distributed in contrast to MRs that show a restricted tissue distribution. By this mechanism, the ligand-bound receptor translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene expression. === Signal transduction === In the absence of endogenous or synthetic GCs, monomeric GRs are located in the cytoplasm and form multiprotein complexes with heat shock proteins (HSPs), immunophilins, and other chaperones such as src, and p23. The GR acts in a ligand-dependent manner, with the complex holding the GR in an inactive form with high specificity for the ligand. When methylprednisolone from the plasma or interstitial fluid diffuses passively across the cell membrane, it binds to the GR inducing a conformational change and GC-GR dimerization. It was previously thought that this conformational change was necessary to dissociate the multiprotein complex to allow the ligand-bound receptor to translocate to the nucleus. However, recent studies have indicated that chaperones play a role in nuclear import. The now active methylprednisolone-GR complex can either transduce non-genomic changes in the cytoplasm or translocate to the nucleus and regulate the transcriptional activity of target genes by direct, tethering or composite mechanisms. === Genomic signaling === Genomic mechanisms, regardless of which type, elicit responses with a slow onset and a slow dissipation. This is attributed to the duration of mRNA transcription and translation. Glucocorticoids can regulate roughly 100 to 1000 genes with specificity to cell type. Three major mechanisms have described how the MP-GR complex alters gene expression by either binding to DNA or transcription modulators. One mechanism of genomic signaling occurs when the MP-GR complex directly binds to DNA sequences called glucocorticoid response elements (GREs). GREs are located in regulatory regions of target genes and mediate their transactivation or transrepression. For example, the activation of lipocortin 1 (ANAX1) negatively interferes with the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, known pro-inflammatory signals. Likewise, negative GREs (nGREs) are responsible for repressing genes involved in immune cell activation. === Post-transcriptional modifications === Post-translational modifications (PTMs) also contribute to methylprednisolone signaling and can produce genomic and non-genomic effects. The GR contains several sites for phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation that primarily occurs after intracellular methylprednisolone binding to the GR. PTMs modulate many functions including nuclear translocation, strength and duration of receptor signaling and cofactor interaction. A specific example is the deacetylation by histone deacetylase 2 (HDACe) was necessary for transrepression of NF-κB. === Non-genomic signaling === The mechanisms of non-genomic signaling are distinct from genomic signaling, yet mediate similar pathways and provide therapeutic relevance. These mechanisms are characterized as having a rapid onset (less than 15 minutes) because they do not rely on time-consuming transcription or translation and are not modified by inhibitors of transcription. Methylprednisolone-induced non-genomic signaling is classified by three mechanisms: (1) cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (cGR)-mediated non-genomic effects, (2) membrane-bound glucocorticoid receptor (mGR) non-genomic effects, and (3) physiochemical interactions with cellular membranes (non-specific non-genomic effects). Proteins that dissociate from the activated GC-cGR complex, initiate intracellular transcription-independent mechanisms. It is evidence that dissociated SRC is responsible for inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from cell membrane phospholipids. AA is required for the synthesis of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) and thus AA inhibition mediates several important pathways such as cellular growth, metabolism and inflammation. Previous studies identified mGRs in lymphoma cells, but it wasn't until 2004 that mGRs were identified in human peripheral mononuclear cells. The prevalence of mGRs ranges per cell type, with the highest concentration in B lymphocytes at up to 12.3%, up to 9.2% in monocytes, and absent from T lymphocytes. Studies have shown a positive correlation between the mGR-positive cells and disease-related activity. There are no proven signaling pathways associated with mGR at this time. Some researchers hypothesize that high disease activity activates mGR expression and upon administering methylprednisolone, creates a negative feedback loop by inducing apoptosis. High concentrations of methylprednisolone intercalate in plasma and mitochondrial cellular membranes. This association changes the physiochemical properties of the membrane; activating membrane proteins, altering cellular functions and ultimately influencing cation transport through the plasma membrane and stimulating the proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Hindered oxidative phosphorylation compromises ATP production, a major energy source for cellular energy metabolism and immune function. In vivo, studies of Con-A stimulated thymocytes (in rats) and human immune cells that were administered high doses of methylprednisolone have been shown to inhibit respiration in a dose-dependent manner, inhibit plasma calcium and sodium uptake, and increase cytoplasmic calcium concentration. The summative process is as follows: Methylprednisolone intercalates in the plasma membrane, causes physiochemical changes, and activates membrane proteins that inhibit plasma calcium and sodium uptake (mimicking an energy deficit state). ATP consumption drops (resembled by inhibited respiration), resulting in protein permeability at the inner mitochondrial membrane and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Of notable importance, DNA/RNA synthesis was not hindered. The dependency of housekeeping cells and immune cells on ATP, results in immunosuppression during ATP deficit. Specific immune functions affected by this process are cytokinesis, migration, phagocytosis, antigen processing and presenting, antibody synthesis, cytotoxicity, and regulation. === The HPA === The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) stimulates the production of endogenous glucocorticoids within the adrenal cortex. The HPA interprets stimuli (stress, inflammation, and circadian cues) and transduces a corresponding physiochemical response. Glucocorticoids released in the blood, serve as a messenger by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in a wide distribution across the body, including the HPA itself. Thus, the physiological range of GCs is monitored by the negative feedback loop GCs exert on any portion of the HPA. === Pharmacokinetics === Methylprednisolone is approved for oral and parenteral administration. Methylprednisolone (Medrol) for oral administration is available in a tablet formulation in 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg or 32 mg strengths. Both methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) and methylprednisolone succinate (Solu-Medrol) are approved for intramuscular injection. Depo-Medrol is additionally approved for intralesional, intra-articular, and soft tissue injections. Depo-Medrol is available as sterile aqueous solution in 20 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, or 80 mg/mL strengths. Solu-Medrol is the only derivative of methylprednisolone that is approved for intravenous infusion, as the sterile powder is soluble in water and can be mixed with a diluent. Strengths vary from 40 mg to 2 g. Synthetic glucocorticoids are similar to endogenous steroids in metabolism but differ in affinity for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, affinity for protein-binding, rate of elimination, and metabolic products. Oral methylprednisolone is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 89.9%. In contrast to endogenous GCs, methylprednisolone does not bind to the glycoprotein transcortin (corticosteroid-binding globulin, CBG) but does have moderate protein binding to albumin. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone are linear and show no dose dependency. Patients exhibiting low albumin concentrations are at risk for adverse effects during glucocorticoid therapy. Oral methylprednisolone has a moderate distribution into tissue at 1.38L/kg. Methylprednisolone is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of metabolites; with renal excretion of unchanged methylprednisolone at only 1.3–9.2%. Methylprednisolone can be interconverted with methylprednisone. Hepatic metabolism is mediated by 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11[beta]-HSD) and 20-ketosteroid reductases. Methylprednisolone undergoes renal excretion of hydrophilic inactive metabolites, including 20-carboxymelthylprednisolone and 6[beta]-hydroxy-20[alpha]-hydroxymethylprednisolone. == Physical properties == Oral methylprednisolone (Medrol) and its derivatives are a white, odorless crystalline powder. Its solubility ranges from practically insoluble in water, very slightly soluble in ether, slightly soluble in acetone and chloroform to sparingly soluble in alcohol, dioxane, and methanol. Methylprednisolone acetate suspension (Depo-Medrol) is a 6-methyl derivative of prednisolone that melts at 215 degrees Celsius with some decomposition. Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol) is the sodium succinate ester of methylprednisolone. Contrary to the solubilities above, methylprednisolone sodium succinate is soluble in water and alcohol, slightly soluble in acetone and insoluble in chloroform == Chemistry == Methylprednisolone, or 6α-methylprednisolone, also known as 11β,17,21-trihydroxy-6α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of hydrocortisone (11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) and prednisolone (11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-1,4-diene-3,20-dione). A variety of methylprednisolone esters with differing characteristics exist and have been marketed for medical use. They include methylprednisolone aceponate (Advantan), methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol), methylprednisolone succinate (Solu-Medrol), and methylprednisolone suleptanate (Medrosol, Promedrol). === Synthesis === Synthetic steroids are synthesized from cholic acid and sapogenins obtained from cattle and plants, respectively. == History == Methylprednisolone was first synthesized and manufactured by The Upjohn Company (later Pfizer and now Viatris) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in the United States in October 1957. The patent has expired, and generics are available. In 2022, it was the 153rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Research == Methylprednisolone has been a prescribed therapy amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is no evidence it is either safe or effective for this purpose. == References ==",Medrone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.066266385256313e-05), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008640403859317303)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicines.org.uk](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/1087/smpc?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='Medrone 100mg Tablets - Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) - (emc) | 1087', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/1087/smpc?utm_source=openai')])"

The anti-tumor effects of Z-360 and/or gemcitabine were monitored using a MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model. The effect of Z-360 on apoptosis in the model was examined by TUNEL staining and real-time PCR analysis and the effect in MIA PaCa-2 cells stably expressing human CCK2R was also evaluated by caspase-3/7 activity. In this xenograft model, Z-360 significantly reduced the tumor weight, increased TUNEL-positive cells and suppressed the expression of anti-apoptosis factors such as survivin, XIAP and Mcl-1, and these effects of Z-360 combined with gemcitabine were more effective. Furthermore, gastrin-17 and gastrin-34 inhibited apoptosis in vitro and Z-360 dose-dependently abrogated this effect. These results suggest that Z-360 exerts an anti-tumor effect through a reduction in anti-apoptosis factors by blocking CCK2R. Z-360 is an orally active cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2)/gastrin receptor antagonist currently under development as a therapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer. It was previously reported that Z-360 treatment in combination with gemcitabine prolonged the survival period in a lethal pancreatic cancer xenograft model in mice. In a phase Ib/IIa clinical study, Z-360 treatment displayed a trend of reduced pain in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine including analgesics such as opioids. Here, we investigated the mechanism of analgesic action of Z-360 in a severe cancer-induced pain model in mice, which is considered to be opioid-resistant, by examining ephrin B1 gene expression, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit phosphorylation, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production. In a mouse model of cancer-induced pain, ephrin B1 gene expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the phosphorylation of NR2B in the spinal cord were induced. Z-360 treatment inhibited both ephrin B1 gene expression and the phosphorylation of NR2B. In addition, IL-1β production increased in the cancer-inoculated hind paw of mice, but could be suppressed by treatment with Z-360. Moreover, we observed that the CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide similarly suppressed up-regulation of ephrin B1 gene expression and IL-1β production, and that the intraperitoneal injection of sulfated CCK-8 induced the production of IL-1β in the cancer-inoculated region. We have identified a novel pain cascade, in which IL-1β production in cancer-inoculated regions induces ephrin B1 gene expression in DRGs and then ephrin B1 enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B via Eph B receptor in the spinal cord. Notably, Z-360 relieves cancer-induced pain by preventing this pain cascade through the suppression of IL-1β production, likely via the blockade of CCK1 receptor. The pre-clinical results presented here support the analgesic action of Z-360 in pancreatic cancer patients with severe, opioid-resistant pain. Pre-clinical and clinical results have demonstrated that Z-360 combined with gemcitabine represents a promising pancreatic cancer therapy approach with characteristic analgesic effects in addition to the prolongation of survival. The cholecystokinin type 2 receptor (CCK2-R) represents an ideal target for cancer therapy since it is overexpressed in several tumors and is associated with poor prognosis. Nastorazepide (Z-360), a selective CCK2-R antagonist, has been widely investigated as a CCK2-R ligand for targeted therapy; however, its high hydrophobicity may represent a limit to cell selectivity and optimal in vivo biodistribution.

3366,"('Norethindrone', 'Norethisterone', 'Micronor', 'Norethisteron', 'Norcolut')",Medical,"Norethisterone, also known as norethindrone and sold under the brand name Norlutin among others, is a progestin medication used in birth control pills, menopausal hormone therapy, and for the treatment of gynecological disorders. The medication is available in both low-dose and high-dose formulations and both alone and in combination with an estrogen. It is used by mouth or, as norethisterone enanthate, by injection into muscle. Side effects of norethisterone include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth. Norethisterone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity, mostly at high dosages, and no other important hormonal activity. Norethisterone was discovered in 1951 and was one of the first progestins to be developed. It was first introduced for medical use on its own in 1957 and was introduced in combination with an estrogen for use as a birth control pill in 1963. It is sometimes referred to as a ""first-generation"" progestin. Like desogestrel and Norgestrel, Norethisterone is available as a progestogen-only ""mini pill"" for birth control. Norethisterone is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 135th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Norethisterone is used as a hormonal contraceptive in combination with an estrogen – usually ethinylestradiol (EE) – in combined oral contraceptive pills and alone in progestogen-only pills. Another medical use of norethisterone is to alleviate endometriosis related pain. In fact, 50% of patients who received medical or surgical treatment for endometriosis-related pelvic pain have benefited from progestin therapy. This could be due to the fact that norethisterone induces endometrial proliferation during secretory phase, which has been shown to alleviate endometrial pain complaints. Another way in which norethisterone may be acting to reduce endometrial pain is via inhibition of ovulation. Endometriosis pain and discomfort is worse during ovulation. == Contraindications == High-dose (10 mg/day) norethisterone has been associated with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and because of this adverse effect, norethisterone should not be given to patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, as it has been associated with substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation. == Side effects == At contraceptive and hormone replacement dosages (0.35 to 1 mg/day), norethisterone has essentially progestogenic side effects only. In most clinical studies of norethisterone for contraception or menopausal hormone therapy, the drug has been combined with an estrogen, and for this reason, it is difficult to determine which of the side effects were caused by norethisterone and which of them were caused by estrogen in such research. However, norethisterone enanthate, an intramuscularly administered prodrug of norethisterone which is used as a long-acting contraceptive, is used without an estrogen, and hence can be employed as a surrogate for norethisterone in terms of understanding its effects and tolerability. In clinical studies, the most common side effect with norethisterone enanthate has been menstrual disturbances, including prolonged bleeding or spotting and amenorrhea.: 253 Other side effects have included periodic abdominal bloating and breast tenderness, both of which are thought to be due to water retention and can be relieved with diuretics.: 253 There has been no association with weight gain, and blood pressure, blood clotting, and glucose tolerance have all remained normal.: 253 However, a decrease in HDL cholesterol has been observed.: 253 At high doses (5 to 60 mg/day), for instance those used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, norethisterone can cause hypogonadism due to its antigonadotropic effects and can have estrogenic and weak androgenic side effects. High doses of norethisterone acetate (10 mg/day) have been associated with abnormal liver function tests, including significant elevations in liver enzymes. These liver enzymes included lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase. Although they were described as having no clinical relevance, the elevated liver enzymes associated with norethisterone acetate may have precluded its further development for male hormonal contraception. === Androgenic === Due to its weak androgenic activity, norethisterone can produce androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice changes of slight severity in some women at high dosages (e.g., 10 to 40 mg/day). This is notably not the case with combined oral contraceptives that contain norethisterone and EE, however. Such formulations contain low dosages of norethisterone (0.35 to 1 mg/day) in combination with estrogen and are actually associated with improvement in acne symptoms. In accordance, they are in fact approved by the FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in women in the United States. The improvement in acne symptoms is believed to be due to a 2- to 3-fold increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and a consequent decrease in free testosterone levels caused by EE, which results in an overall decrease in androgenic signaling in the body. The sebaceous glands are highly androgen-sensitive and their size and activity are potential markers of androgenic effect. A high dosage of 20 mg/day norethisterone or norethisterone acetate has been found to significantly stimulate the sebaceous glands, whereas lower dosages of 5 mg/day and 2.5 mg/day norethisterone and norethisterone acetate, respectively, did not significantly stimulate sebum production and were consequently regarded as devoid of significant androgenicity. Conversely, dosages of norethisterone of 0.5 to 3 mg/day have been found to dose-dependently decrease SHBG levels (and hence to suppress hepatic SHBG production), which is another highly sensitive marker of androgenicity. A large clinical study of high to very high oral dosages of norethisterone (10 to 40 mg/day) administered for prolonged periods of time (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent miscarriage in pregnant women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild voice changes (hoarseness), acne, and hirsutism and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, virilization of the genitals. Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of norethisterone of 30 mg/day or more for a period of 15 weeks or longer. In the female infants who experienced virilization of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris. In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds occurred. The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40 mg/day. In a letter to the editor on the topic of virilization caused by high dosages of norethisterone acetate in women, a physician expressed that they had not observed the ""slightest evidence of virilization"" and that there had ""certainly been no hirsutism nor any voice changes"" in 55 women with advanced breast cancer that they had treated with 30 to 60 mg/day norethisterone for up to six months. High-dosage norethisterone has been used to suppress menstruation in women with severe intellectual disability who were incapable of handling their own menses. A study of 118 nulliparous women treated with 5 mg/day norethisterone for a period of 2 to 30 months found that the drug was effective in producing amenorrhea in 86% of the women, with breakthrough bleeding occurring in the remaining 14%. Side effects including weight gain, hirsutism, acne, headache, nausea, and vomiting all did not appear to increase in incidence and no ""disturbing side effects"" were noted in any of the women. Another study of 5 mg/day norethisterone in 132 women also made no mention of androgenic side effects. These findings suggest little to no risk of androgenic side effects with norethisterone at a dosage of 5 mg/day. A study of 194 women treated with 5 to 15 mg/day norethisterone acetate for a median duration of 13 months of therapy to suppress symptoms of endometriosis observed no side effects in 55.2% of patients, weight gain in 16.1%, acne in 9.9%, mood lability in 8.9%, hot flashes in 8.3%, and voice deepening in two women (1.0%). === Estrogenic === Norethisterone is weakly estrogenic (via conversion into its metabolite EE), and for this reason, it has been found at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high dosages (e.g., 40 mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of norethisterone acetate (and by extension norethisterone) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to high dosages (above 50 μg/day) of EE, and that even doses of norethisterone acetate of 10 to 20 mg, which correspond to EE doses of approximately 20 to 30 μg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk. A study also found that ethinylestradiol and norethisterone had a greater influence on coagulation factors when the dose of norethisterone was 3 or 4 mg than when it was 1 mg. This might have been due to additional ethinylestradiol generated by higher doses of norethisterone. == Overdose == There have been no reports of serious side effects with overdose of norethisterone, even in small children. As such, overdose usually does not require treatment. High dosages of as much as 60 mg/day norethisterone have been studied for extended treatment durations without serious adverse effects described. == Interactions == 5α-Reductase plays an important role in the metabolism of norethisterone, and 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride can inhibit its metabolism. Norethisterone is partially metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly alter circulating levels of norethisterone. For instance, the CYP3A4 inducers rifampicin and bosentan have been found to decrease norethisterone exposure by 42% and 23%, respectively, and the CYP3A4 inducers carbamazepine and St. John's wort have also been found to accelerate norethisterone clearance. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Norethisterone is a potent progestogen and a weak androgen and estrogen. That is, it is a potent agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) and a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). Norethisterone itself has insignificant affinity for the ER; its estrogenic activity is from an active metabolite that is formed in very small amounts, ethinylestradiol (EE), which is a very potent estrogen. Norethisterone and its metabolites have negligible affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and hence have no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== Norethisterone is a potent progestogen and binds to the PR with approximately 150% of the affinity of progesterone. In contrast, its parent compounds, testosterone, nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), have 2%, 22%, and 44% of the relative binding affinity of progesterone for the PR. Unlike norethisterone, its major active metabolite 5α-dihydronorethisterone (5α-DHNET), which is formed by transformation via 5α-reductase, has been found to possess both progestogenic and marked antiprogestogenic activity, although its affinity for the PR is greatly reduced relative to norethisterone at only 25% of that of progesterone. Norethisterone produces similar changes in the endometrium and vagina, such as endometrial transformation, and is similarly antigonadotropic, ovulation-inhibiting, and thermogenic in women compared to progesterone, which is in accordance with its progestogenic activity. ==== Androgenic activity ==== Norethisterone has approximately 15% of the affinity of the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) metribolone (R-1881) for the AR, and in accordance, is weakly androgenic. In contrast to norethisterone, 5α-DHNET, the major metabolite of norethisterone, shows higher affinity for the AR, with approximately 27% of the affinity of metribolone. However, although 5α-DHNET has higher affinity for the AR than norethisterone, it has significantly diminished and in fact almost abolished androgenic potency in comparison to norethisterone in rodent bioassays. Similar findings were observed for ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and its 5α-reduced metabolite, whereas 5α-reduction enhanced both the AR affinity and androgenic potency of testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in rodent bioassays. As such, it appears that the ethynyl group of norethisterone at the C17α position is responsible for its loss of androgenicity upon 5α-reduction. Norethisterone (0.5 to 3 mg/day) has been found to dose-dependently decrease circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production. The drug also has estrogenic activity, and estrogens are known to increase SHBG hepatic production and circulating levels, so it would appear that the androgenic activity of norethisterone overpowers its estrogenic activity in this regard. Norethisterone is bound to a considerable extent (36%) to SHBG in circulation. Although it has lower affinity for SHBG than endogenous androgens and estrogens, Norethisterone may displace testosterone from SHBG and thereby increase free testosterone levels, and this action may contribute to its weak androgenic effects. ==== Estrogenic activity ==== Norethisterone binds to the ERs, the ERα and the ERβ, with 0.07% and 0.01% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol. Due to these very low relative affinities, it is essentially inactive itself as a ligand of the ERs at clinical concentrations. However, norethisterone has been found to be a substrate for aromatase and is converted in the liver to a small extent (0.35%) to the highly potent estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE), and for this reason, unlike most other progestins, norethisterone has some estrogenic activity. However, with typical dosages of norethisterone used in oral contraceptives (0.5 to 1 mg), the levels of EE produced are low, and it has been said that they are probably without clinical relevance. Conversely, doses of 5 and 10 mg of norethisterone, which are used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, are converted at rates of 0.7% and 1.0% and produce levels of EE that correspond to those produced by 30 and 60 μg dosages of EE, respectively. The levels of EE formed by 0.5 and 1 mg of norethisterone have been estimated based on higher dosages as corresponding to 2 and 10 μg dosages of EE, respectively. At high doses, norethisterone may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism due to metabolism into EE. ==== Neurosteroid activity ==== Like progesterone and testosterone, norethisterone is metabolized into 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites. Whether these metabolites of norethisterone interact with the GABAA receptor similarly to the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of progesterone and testosterone like allopregnanolone and 3α-androstanediol, respectively, is a topic that does not appear to have been studied and hence requires clarification. ==== Steroidogenesis inhibition ==== Norethisterone is a substrate for and is known to be an inhibitor of 5α-reductase, with 4.4% and 20.1% inhibition at 0.1 and 1 μM, respectively. However, therapeutic concentrations of norethisterone are in the low nanomolar range, so this action may not be clinically relevant at typical dosages. Norethisterone and its major active metabolite 5α-DHNET have been found to act as irreversible aromatase inhibitors (Ki = 1.7 μM and 9.0 μM, respectively). However, like the case of 5α-reductase, the concentrations required are probably too high to be clinically relevant at typical dosages. 5α-DHNET specifically has been assessed and found to be selective in its inhibition of aromatase, and does not affect cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, 21-hydroxylase, or 11β-hydroxylase. Since it is not aromatized (and hence cannot be transformed into an estrogenic metabolite), unlike norethisterone, 5α-DHNET has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. ==== Other activities ==== Norethisterone is a very weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (IC50 = 46 μM and 51 μM, respectively), but these actions require very high concentrations of norethisterone that are far above therapeutic circulating levels (which are in the nanomolar range) and hence are probably not clinically relevant. Norethisterone and some of its 5α-reduced metabolites have been found to produce vasodilating effects in animals that are independent of sex steroid receptors and hence appear to be non-genomic in mechanism. Norethisterone stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins act similarly in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Due to its progestogenic activity, norethisterone suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and hence has antigonadotropic effects. The estrogenic activity of norethisterone at high doses would also be expected to contribute to its antigonadotropic effects. Due to its antigonadotropic effects, norethisterone suppresses gonadal sex hormone production, inhibits ovulation in women, and suppresses spermatogenesis in men. The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of both oral norethisterone and oral norethisterone acetate is about 0.5 mg/day in women. However, some conflicting data exist, suggesting that higher doses might be necessary for full inhibition of ovulation. An intramuscular injection of 200 mg norethisterone enanthate has been found to prevent ovulation and suppress levels of estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women. Early studies of oral norethisterone in men employing doses of 20 to 50 mg/day observed suppression of 17-ketosteroid excretion, increased estrogen excretion (due to conversion into ethinylestradiol), suppression of spermatogenesis, libido, and erectile function, and incidence of gynecomastia. A dosage of oral norethisterone of 25 mg/day for 3 weeks in men has been reported to suppress testosterone levels by about 70%, to 100 to 200 ng/dL, within 4 or 5 days, as well as to suppress sperm count and to have no effect on libido or erectile function over this short time period. In healthy young men, norethisterone acetate alone at a dose of 5 to 10 mg/day orally for 2 weeks suppressed testosterone levels from ~527 ng/dL to ~231 ng/dL (–56%). A single 200 mg intramuscular injection of norethisterone enanthate alone or in combination with 2 mg estradiol valerate has been found to produce a rapid, strong, and sustained decrease in gonadotropin and testosterone levels for up to one month in men. Intramuscular injections of 200 mg norethisterone enanthate once every 3 weeks have also been found to suppress spermatogenesis in men. Similarly, a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg norethisterone enanthate in combination with 5 mg estradiol valerate has been found to strongly suppress testosterone levels in men. Levels of testosterone decreased from ~503 ng/dL at baseline to ~30 ng/dL at the lowest point (–94%) which occurred at day 7 post-injection. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of norethisterone have been reviewed. ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of norethisterone is between 47 and 73%, with a mean oral bioavailability of 64%. Micronization has been found to significantly improve the oral bioavailability of norethisterone by increasing intestinal absorption and reducing intestinal metabolism. A single 2 mg oral dose of norethisterone has been found to result in peak circulating levels of the drug of 12 ng/mL (40 nmol/L), whereas a single 1 mg oral dose of norethisterone in combination with 2 mg estradiol resulted in peak levels of norethisterone of 8.5 ng/mL (29 nmol/L) one-hour post-administration. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of norethisterone is 97%. It is bound 61% bound to albumin and 36% bound to SHBG. ==== Metabolism ==== Norethisterone has an elimination half-life of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, with a mean elimination half-life of 8.0 hours. The metabolism of norethisterone is very similar to that of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Δ4 double bond to 5α- and 5β-dihydronorethisterone, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 keto group to the four isomers of 3,5-tetrahydronorethisterone. These transformations are catalyzed by 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase both in the liver and in extrahepatic tissues such as the pituitary gland, uterus, prostate gland, vagina, and breast. With the exception of 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-tetrahydronorethisterone, which have significant affinity for the ER and are estrogenic to some degree, the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of norethisterone are inactive in terms of affinity for sex steroid receptors (specifically, the PR, AR, and ER). A small amount of norethisterone is also converted by aromatase into EE. Norethisterone is metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation as well, mainly by CYP3A4. Some conjugation (including glucuronidation and sulfation) of norethisterone and its metabolites occurs in spite of steric hindrance by the ethynyl group at C17α. The ethynyl group of norethisterone is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites. Norethisterone is used in birth control pills, opposed to progesterone itself, because it is not metabolized as rapidly as progesterone when consumed orally. When progesterone is consumed orally it is rapidly metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and broken down into many different metabolites. Whereas, norethisterone is not as rapidly metabolized allowing norethisterone to be present in higher quantities allowing it to more effectively compete for progesterone receptor binding sites. ==== Elimination ==== Norethisterone is eliminated 33 to 81% in urine and 35 to 43% in feces. == Chemistry == Norethisterone, also known as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynylestra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of testosterone in which an ethynyl group has been added at the C17α position and the methyl group at the C19 position has been removed; hence, it is a combined derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). These modifications result in increased progestogenic activity and oral bioavailability as well as decreased androgenic/anabolic activity. === Derivatives === Norethisterone (NET) is the parent compound of a large group of progestins that includes most of the progestins known as the 19-nortestosterone derivatives. This group is divided by chemical structure into the estranes (derivatives of norethisterone) and the gonanes (18-methylgonanes or 13β-ethylestranes; derivatives of levonorgestrel) and includes the following marketed medications: Several of these act as prodrugs of norethisterone, including norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, etynodiol diacetate, lynestrenol, and quingestanol acetate. Noretynodrel may also be a prodrug of norethisterone. Norethisterone acetate is taken by mouth similarly to norethisterone, while norethisterone enanthate is given by injection into muscle. ==== Non-17α-ethynylated ==== 19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) progestins which are technically not derivatives of norethisterone (as they do not have a C17α ethynyl group) but are still closely related (with other substitutions at the C17α and/or C16β positions) include the following marketed medications: The C17α vinyl (ethenyl) derivatives norgesterone (17α-vinyl-δ5(10)-19-NT) and norvinisterone (17α-vinyl-19-NT) The C17α allyl derivatives allylestrenol (3-deketo-17α-allyl-19-NT) and altrenogest (17α-allyl-δ9,11-19-NT) The C17α alkyl derivative normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-NT) The C17α cyanomethyl derivative dienogest (17α-cyanomethyl-δ9-19-NT) The C16β ethyl derivative oxendolone (16β-ethyl-19-NT) Many anabolic steroids of the 19-nortestosterone family, like norethandrolone and ethylestrenol, are also potent progestogens, but were never marketed as such. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of norethisterone have been published. ==== Synthesis 1 ==== Estradiol 3-methyl ether (1, EME) is partially reduced to the 1,5-diene (2) as also occurs for the first step in the synthesis of nandrolone. Oppenauer oxidation then transforms the C17β hydroxyl group into a ketone functionality (3). This is then reacted with metal acetylide into the corresponding C17α ethynyl compound (4). Hydrolysis of the enol ether under mild conditions leads directly to (5), which appears to be noretynodrel (although Lednicer states that it is ""etynodrel"" in his book (which may be a synonym etynodiol); etynodrel is with a chlorine atom attached), an orally active progestin. This is the progestogen component of the first oral contraceptive to be offered for sale (i.e., Enovid). Treatment of the ethynyl enol ether with strong acid leads to norethisterone (6). In practice, these and all other combined oral contraceptives are mixtures of 1 to 2% EE or mestranol and an oral progestin. It has been speculated that the discovery of the necessity of estrogen in addition to progestin for contraceptive efficacy is due to the presence of a small amount of unreduced EME (1) in early batches of 2. This when subjected to oxidation and ethynylation, would of course lead to mestranol (3). In any event, the need for the presence of estrogen in the mixture is now well established experimentally. ==== Synthesis 2 ==== Norethisterone is made from estr-4-ene-3,17-dione (bolandione), which in turn is synthesized by partial reduction of the aromatic region of the 3-O-methyl ether of estrone with lithium in liquid ammonia, and simultaneously of the keto group at C17α to a hydroxyl group, which is then oxidized back to a keto group by chromium trioxide in acetic acid. The conjugated C4-C5 olefin and the carbonyl group at C3 is then transformed to dienol ethyl ether using ethyl orthoformate. The obtained product is ethynylated by acetylene in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide. After hydrochloride hydrolysis of the formed O-potassium derivative, during which the enol ether is also hydrolyzed, and the remaining double bond is shifted, the desired norethisterone is obtained. == History == Norethisterone was synthesized for the first time by chemists Luis Miramontes, Carl Djerassi, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City in 1951. It was derived from ethisterone, and was found to possess about 20-fold greater potency as a progestogen in comparison. Norethisterone was the first highly active oral progestogen to be synthesized, and was preceded (as a progestogen) by progesterone (1934), ethisterone (1938), 19-norprogesterone (1944), and 17α-methylprogesterone (1949) as well as by nandrolone (1950), whereas noretynodrel (1952) and norethandrolone (1953) followed the synthesis of norethisterone. The drug was introduced as Norlutin in the United States in 1957. Norethisterone was subsequently combined with mestranol and marketed as Ortho-Novum in the United States in 1963. It was the second progestin, after noretynodrel in 1960, to be used in an oral contraceptive. In 1964, additional contraceptive preparations containing norethisterone in combination with mestranol or EE, such as Norlestrin and Norinyl, were marketed in the United States. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Norethisterone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name of the drug while norethindrone is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. === Brand names === Norethisterone is available in Bangladesh as Menogia (ACI), Normens (Renata) etc. Norethisterone (NET), including as norethisterone acetate and norethisterone enanthate, has been marketed under many brand names throughout the world. === Availability === ==== United States ==== Norethisterone was previously available alone in 5 mg tablets under the brand name Norlutin in the United States, but this formulation has since been discontinued. However, norethisterone acetate remains available alone in 5 mg tablets under the brand name Aygestin in the United States. It is one of the only non-contraceptive progestogen-only drug formulations that remains available in the United States. The others include progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as well as the atypical agent danazol. Both norethisterone and norethisterone acetate are also available in the United States as contraceptives. Norethisterone is available both alone (brand names Camila, Errin, Heather, Micronor, Nor-QD, others) and in combination with EE (Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, others) or mestranol (Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, others), while norethisterone acetate is available only in combination with EE (Norlestrin, others). Norethisterone enanthate is not available in the United States in any form. == Research == Norethisterone, as norethisterone acetate and norethisterone enanthate, has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with testosterone in men. Long-acting norethisterone microspheres for intramuscular injection have been studied for potential use in birth control. == References == == Further reading ==",Norcolut,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.3854863431770355e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004108797758817673)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Phosphate concentrations have not been measured in breastmilk after large maternal doses of sodium phosphate, such a 30 gram oral dose for pre-procedural bowel evacuation. However, the added phosphate in breastmilk is likely to be only about 130 mg over 24 hours in this situation. The increase from a typical dose of a rectal enema would be considerably less than this amount. Breastmilk sodium concentration is tightly regulated, and will not be affected.

Use of a phosphate rectal enema by a nursing mother would require no special precautions. No information is available on the clinical use of sodium phenylbutyrate or the combination of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol during breastfeeding. Both sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol are highly protein bound and therefore unlikely to enter milk in clinically important amounts.
