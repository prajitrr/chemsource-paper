3468,"('Sugammadex (sodium)', 'Org25969', 'Sugammadex', 'Bridion', 'Sugammadex [usan:inn:ban]')",Medical,"Sugammadex, sold under the brand name Bridion, is a medication for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium and vecuronium in general anaesthesia. It is the first selective relaxant binding agent (SRBA). It is marketed by Merck. The most common side effects include cough, airway problems due to the anaesthesia wearing off, reduced blood pressure and other complications such as changes in heart rate. Sugammadex is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Sugammadex is indicated for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sugammadex is a modified γ-cyclodextrin, with a lipophilic core and a hydrophilic periphery. This gamma cyclodextrin has been modified from its natural state by placing eight carboxyl thio ether groups at the sixth carbon positions. These extensions extend the cavity size allowing greater encapsulation of the rocuronium molecule. These negatively charged extensions electrostatically bind to the quaternary nitrogen of the target as well as contribute to the aqueous nature of the cyclodextrin. Sugammadex's binding encapsulation of rocuronium is one of the strongest among cyclodextrins and their guest molecules. The rocuronium molecule (a modified steroid) bound within sugammadex's lipophilic core, is rendered unavailable to bind to the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Sugammadex, unlike neostigmine, does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase so cholinergic effects are not produced and co-administration of an antimuscarinic agent (glycopyrronium bromide or atropine) is not needed. Sugammadex might therefore be expected to have fewer adverse effects than the traditional reversal agents. When muscle relaxant with rapid onset and short duration of action is required, there has been little choice apart from succinylcholine but this drug has important contraindications; for example, it can trigger malignant hyperthermia in susceptible individuals, it has a prolonged duration of action in patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency and it causes an increase in plasma potassium concentration which is dangerous in some circumstances. Rocuronium has a comparably quick onset in high dose (0.6 mg kg−1 to 1 mg kg−1) and can be rapidly reversed with sugammadex (16 mg kg−1), so this drug combination offers an alternative to suxamethonium. 'Recurarisation', a phenomenon of recurrence of neuromuscular block, may occur where the reversal agents wear off before a neuromuscular blocking drug is completely cleared. This is very unusual with all but the longest acting neuromuscular blocking drugs (such as gallamine, pancuronium or tubocurarine). It has been demonstrated to occur only rarely with sugammadex, and only when insufficient doses were administered. The underlying mechanism is thought to be related to redistribution of relaxant after reversal. It may occur for a limited range of sugammadex doses which are sufficient for complex formation with relaxant in the central compartment, but insufficient for additional relaxant returning to central from peripheral compartments. Sugammadex has been shown to have affinity for two other aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents, vecuronium and pancuronium. Although sugammadex has a lower affinity for vecuronium than for rocuronium, reversal of vecuronium is still effective because fewer vecuronium molecules are present in vivo for equivalent blockade: vecuronium is approximately seven times more potent than rocuronium. Sugammadex encapsulates with a 1:1 ratio and therefore will adequately reverse vecuronium as there are fewer molecules to bind compared to rocuronium. Shallow pancuronium blockade has been successfully reversed by sugammadex in phase III clinical trials. == Efficacy == A study was carried out in Europe looking at its suitability in rapid sequence induction. It found that sugammadex provides a rapid and dose-dependent reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by high-dose rocuronium. A Cochrane review on sugammadex concluded that ""sugammadex was shown to be more effective than placebo (no medication) or neostigmine in reversing muscle relaxation caused by neuromuscular blockade during surgery and is relatively safe. Serious complications occurred in less than 1% of the patients who received sugammadex. The results of this review article (especially the safety results) need to be confirmed by future trials on larger patient populations"". The 2017 Cochrane review concluded that sugammadex has a better safety profile than neostigmine with 40% fewer adverse events. Specifically the risks of postoperative residual paralysis, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting are reduced if sugammadex is used as a reversal agent. The British Journal of Anaesthesia published an article in 2015 in which the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade could be reduced to zero if sugammadex is used as the reversal agent and the correct dosage is selected with the use of neuromuscular monitoring. Also when the reversal times of each agent were compared ""Data indicate that sugammadex was 10.22 minutes (6.6 times) faster than neostigmine (1.96 vs 12.87 minutes) in reversing moderate induced paralysis. Sugammadex was 45.78 minutes (16.8 times) faster than neostigmine (2.9 vs 48.8 minutes) in reversing deep induced paralysis."" The time saved by rapid reversal and the reduction of postoperative residual paralysis may reduce the overall hospital costs and provide significant improvements in patient safety. == Tolerability == Sugammadex was generally well tolerated in clinical trials in surgical patients or healthy volunteers. In pooled analyses, the tolerability profile of sugammadex was generally similar to that of placebo or neostigmine plus glycopyrrolate. Sugammadex may theoretically interfere with hormonal contraceptives due to evidence from in vitro binding studies which showed it may bind to progestogen. == History == Sugammadex was discovered by the pharmaceutical company Organon at the Newhouse Research Site in Scotland. Organon was acquired by Schering-Plough in 2007; Schering-Plough merged with Merck in 2009. Sugammadex is now owned and sold by Merck. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially rejected Schering-Plough's New Drug Application for sugammadex in 2008, but finally approved the medication for use in the United States in December 2015. Sugammadex was approved for use in the European Union in July 2008. == References ==",Bridion,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2874520507466514e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016664070426486433)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3469,"('(s)-glutamic acid', 'L-glutamic acid', 'Glutamic acid', '(2s)-2-aminopentanedioic acid', '(s)-2-aminopentanedioic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Glutamic acid (symbol Glu or E; known as glutamate in its anionic form) is an α-amino acid that is used by almost all living beings in the biosynthesis of proteins. It is a non-essential nutrient for humans, meaning that the human body can synthesize enough for its use. It is also the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABAergic neurons. Its molecular formula is C5H9NO4. Glutamic acid exists in two optically isomeric forms; the dextrorotatory L-form is usually obtained by hydrolysis of gluten or from the waste waters of beet-sugar manufacture or by fermentation. Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COOH, with two carboxyl groups −COOH and one amino group −NH2. However, in the solid state and mildly acidic water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. It is encoded by the codons GAA or GAG. The acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate base, the singly-negative anion glutamate −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COO−. This form of the compound is prevalent in neutral solutions. The glutamate neurotransmitter plays the principal role in neural activation. This anion creates the savory umami flavor of foods and is found in glutamate flavorings such as monosodium glutamate (MSG). In Europe, it is classified as food additive E620. In highly alkaline solutions the doubly negative anion −OOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COO− prevails. The radical corresponding to glutamate is called glutamyl. The one-letter symbol E for glutamate was assigned as the letter following D for aspartate, as glutamate is larger by one methylene –CH2– group. == Chemistry == === Ionization === When glutamic acid is dissolved in water, the amino group (−NH2) may gain a proton (H+), and/or the carboxyl groups may lose protons, depending on the acidity of the medium. In sufficiently acidic environments, both carboxyl groups are protonated and the molecule becomes a cation with a single positive charge, HOOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. At pH values between about 2.5 and 4.1, the carboxylic acid closer to the amine generally loses a proton, and the acid becomes the neutral zwitterion −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. This is also the form of the compound in the crystalline solid state. The change in protonation state is gradual; the two forms are in equal concentrations at pH 2.10. At even higher pH, the other carboxylic acid group loses its proton and the acid exists almost entirely as the glutamate anion −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COO−, with a single negative charge overall. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 4.07. This form with both carboxylates lacking protons is dominant in the physiological pH range (7.35–7.45). At even higher pH, the amino group loses the extra proton, and the prevalent species is the doubly-negative anion −OOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COO−. The change in protonation state occurs at pH 9.47. === Optical isomerism === Glutamic acid is chiral; two mirror-image enantiomers exist: d(−), and l(+). The l form is more widely occurring in nature, but the d form occurs in some special contexts, such as the bacterial capsule and cell walls of the bacteria (which produce it from the l form with the enzyme glutamate racemase) and the liver of mammals. == History == Although they occur naturally in many foods, the flavor contributions made by glutamic acid and other amino acids were only scientifically identified early in the 20th century. The substance was discovered and identified in the year 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid. In 1908, Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda of the Tokyo Imperial University identified brown crystals left behind after the evaporation of a large amount of kombu broth as glutamic acid. These crystals, when tasted, reproduced the novel flavor he detected in many foods, most especially in seaweed. Professor Ikeda termed this flavor umami. He then patented a method of mass-producing a crystalline salt of glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === === Industrial synthesis === Glutamic acid is produced on the largest scale of any amino acid, with an estimated annual production of about 1.5 million tons in 2006. Chemical synthesis was supplanted by the aerobic fermentation of sugars and ammonia in the 1950s, with the organism Corynebacterium glutamicum (also known as Brevibacterium flavum) being the most widely used for production. Isolation and purification can be achieved by concentration and crystallization; it is also widely available as its hydrochloride salt. == Function and uses == === Metabolism === Glutamate is a key compound in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serve as metabolic fuel for other functional roles in the body. A key process in amino acid degradation is transamination, in which the amino group of an amino acid is transferred to an α-ketoacid, typically catalysed by a transaminase. The reaction can be generalised as such: R1-amino acid + R2-α-ketoacid ⇌ R1-α-ketoacid + R2-amino acid A very common α-keto acid is α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Transamination of α-ketoglutarate gives glutamate. The resulting α-ketoacid product is often a useful one as well, which can contribute as fuel or as a substrate for further metabolism processes. Examples are as follows: alanine + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ pyruvate + glutamate aspartate + α-ketoglutarate ⇌ oxaloacetate + glutamate Both pyruvate and oxaloacetate are key components of cellular metabolism, contributing as substrates or intermediates in fundamental processes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. Glutamate also plays an important role in the body's disposal of excess or waste nitrogen. Glutamate undergoes deamination, an oxidative reaction catalysed by glutamate dehydrogenase, as follows: glutamate + H2O + NADP+ → α-ketoglutarate + NADPH + NH3 + H+ Ammonia (as ammonium) is then excreted predominantly as urea, synthesised in the liver. Transamination can thus be linked to deamination, effectively allowing nitrogen from the amine groups of amino acids to be removed, via glutamate as an intermediate, and finally excreted from the body in the form of urea. Glutamate is also a neurotransmitter (see below), which makes it one of the most abundant molecules in the brain. Malignant brain tumors known as glioma or glioblastoma exploit this phenomenon by using glutamate as an energy source, especially when these tumors become more dependent on glutamate due to mutations in the gene IDH1. === Neurotransmitter === Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger the release of glutamate from the presynaptic cell. Glutamate acts on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors. In the opposing postsynaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor or the AMPA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain. The form of plasticity known as long-term potentiation takes place at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, neocortex, and other parts of the brain. Glutamate works not only as a point-to-point transmitter, but also through spill-over synaptic crosstalk between synapses in which summation of glutamate released from a neighboring synapse creates extrasynaptic signaling/volume transmission. In addition, glutamate plays important roles in the regulation of growth cones and synaptogenesis during brain development as originally described by Mark Mattson. === Brain nonsynaptic glutamatergic signaling circuits === Extracellular glutamate in Drosophila brains has been found to regulate postsynaptic glutamate receptor clustering, via a process involving receptor desensitization. A gene expressed in glial cells actively transports glutamate into the extracellular space, while, in the nucleus accumbens-stimulating group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, this gene was found to reduce extracellular glutamate levels. This raises the possibility that this extracellular glutamate plays an ""endocrine-like"" role as part of a larger homeostatic system. ==== GABA precursor ==== Glutamate also serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABA-ergic neurons. This reaction is catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). GABA-ergic neurons are identified (for research purposes) by revealing its activity (with the autoradiography and immunohistochemistry methods) which is most abundant in the cerebellum and pancreas. Stiff person syndrome is a neurologic disorder caused by anti-GAD antibodies, leading to a decrease in GABA synthesis and, therefore, impaired motor function such as muscle stiffness and spasm. Since the pancreas has abundant GAD, a direct immunological destruction occurs in the pancreas and the patients will have diabetes mellitus. === Flavor enhancer === Glutamic acid, being a constituent of protein, is present in foods that contain protein, but it can only be tasted when it is present in an unbound form. Significant amounts of free glutamic acid are present in a wide variety of foods, including cheeses and soy sauce, and glutamic acid is responsible for umami, one of the five basic tastes of the human sense of taste. Glutamic acid often is used as a food additive and flavor enhancer in the form of its sodium salt, known as monosodium glutamate (MSG). === Nutrient === All meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and kombu are excellent sources of glutamic acid. Some protein-rich plant foods also serve as sources. 30% to 35% of gluten (much of the protein in wheat) is glutamic acid. Ninety-five percent of the dietary glutamate is metabolized by intestinal cells in a first pass. === Plant growth === Auxigro is a plant growth preparation that contains 30% glutamic acid. === NMR spectroscopy === In recent years, there has been much research into the use of residual dipolar coupling (RDC) in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). A glutamic acid derivative, poly-γ-benzyl-L-glutamate (PBLG), is often used as an alignment medium to control the scale of the dipolar interactions observed. === Glutamate and aging === Brain glutamate levels tend to decline with age, and may be a useful as a marker of age-related diseases of the brain. == Pharmacology == The drug phencyclidine (more commonly known as PCP or 'Angel Dust') antagonizes glutamic acid non-competitively at the NMDA receptor. For the same reasons, dextromethorphan and ketamine also have strong dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. Acute infusion of the drug eglumetad (also known as eglumegad or LY354740), an agonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3) resulted in a marked diminution of yohimbine-induced stress response in bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata); chronic oral administration of eglumetad in those animals led to markedly reduced baseline cortisol levels (approximately 50 percent) in comparison to untreated control subjects. Eglumetad has also been demonstrated to act on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) of human adrenocortical cells, downregulating aldosterone synthase, CYP11B1, and the production of adrenal steroids (i.e. aldosterone and cortisol). Glutamate does not easily pass the blood brain barrier, but, instead, is transported by a high-affinity transport system. It can also be converted into glutamine. Glutamate toxicity can be reduced by antioxidants, and the psychoactive principle of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and the non psychoactive principle cannabidiol (CBD), and other cannabinoids, is found to block glutamate neurotoxicity with a similar potency, and thereby potent antioxidants. == See also == == References == == Further reading == Nelson, David L.; Cox, Michael M.

3471,"('Levosimendan', 'Simsndan', 'Simdax', '(r)-simendan', 'Or-1259')",Medical,"Levosimendan (INN) is a calcium sensitizer used in the management of acutely decompensated congestive heart failure. It is marketed under the trade name Simdax (Orion Corporation). Overall the drug has a two fold mechanism of action. It leads to greater inotropy by increasing the calcium sensitivity as it binds to troponin and this results in a greater positive inotrophic force. Secondly, the drug is able to open ATP sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the vascular dilatory effects of the drug lead to a decreased preload and afterload, putting less work on the heart. This drug is in the process of review by the FDA but has not been approved for use in the United States yet. == Mechanism of action == Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer — it increases the sensitivity of the heart to calcium, thus increasing cardiac contractility without a rise in intracellular calcium. Levosimendan exerts its positive inotropic effect by increasing calcium sensitivity of myocytes by binding to cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner. It also has a vasodilatory effect, by opening adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle to cause smooth muscle relaxation. The combined inotropic and vasodilatory actions result in an increased force of contraction, decreased preload and decreased afterload. Moreover, by opening also the mitochondrial (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, the drug exerts a cardioprotective effect. == Clinical use == === Indications === Levosimendan is indicated for inotropic support in acutely-decompensated severe congestive heart failure in situations where conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate. Some of the Phase III studies in the extensive clinical program including the trials LIDO (200 patients), RUSSLAN (500), REVIVE-I (100), REVIVE-II (600) and SURVIVE (1350). In total, the clinical data base includes more than 3500 patients in Phase IIb and III double-blind randomized studies. In the SURVIVE study, despite a reduction in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the dobutamine group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days. However, in a retrospective subgroup analysis, Levosimendan was superior to dobutamine for treating patients with a history of CHF or those on beta-blocker therapy when they were hospitalized with acute decompensations. === Licensing status === The Orion Corporation originally developed levosimendan and applied for a new drug application in 1998 in the U.S. However the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested further trials be conducted and Orion withdrew the application in November 1999. Initially, Orion obtained the approval to market the drug in Sweden in 2000. Since then 60 countries worldwide have approved the drug for acute cardiac care, but it remains unapproved in North America, where it is currently in Phase III development by Tenax Therapeutics for reduction in morbidity in patients with Pulmonary Hypertension derived from Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Faction (PH-HFpEF). === Contraindications === The use of levosimendan is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe kidney impairment, severe liver impairment, severe ventricular filling or outflow obstruction, very low blood pressure and fast heart rate, and/or history of the abnormal heart rhythm torsades de pointes. === Adverse effects === Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with levosimendan therapy include: headache, hypotension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, extrasystoles, Atrial tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia), myocardial ischaemia, hypokalaemia and/or nausea (Rossi, 2006). === Formulations === Levosimendan is marketed as a 2.5 mg/mL concentrated solution for IV infusion. The concentrate is diluted with glucose 5% solution before infusion. == References ==",Simdax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014375607133843005), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006781065370887518)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/simdax?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='SIMDAX - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/simdax?utm_source=openai')])"

3473,"('Menadione bisulfite (sodium)', 'Menadione sodium bisulfite', 'Vitamin k3 sodium bisulfite', 'Menadione bisulfite', 'Menadione sulfonic acid')",Medical," Protein misfolding and aggregation are associated with amyloidosis. The toxic aggregation of amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ42) may disrupt cell membranes and lead to cell death and is thus regarded as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) has been shown to exhibit strong anti-aggregation effects on amyloidogenic proteins such as insulin and α-synuclein; however, its high toxicity and poor solubility limit its clinical application. Menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB, also known as vitamin K3), is used clinically in China to treat hemorrhagic diseases caused by vitamin K deficiency and globally as a vitamin K supplement. We hypothesized that MSB could inhibit amyloid formation since its backbone structure is similar to NQ. To test our hypothesis, we first investigated the effects of MSB on Aβ42 amyloid formation in vitro. We found that MSB inhibited Aβ42 amyloid formation in a dose dependent manner, delayed the secondary structural conversion of Aβ42 from random coil to ordered β-sheet, and attenuated the ability of Aβ42 aggregates to disrupt membranes; moreover, the quinone backbone rather than lipophilicity is esstial for the inhibitory effects of MSB. Next, in cells expressing a pathogenic APP mutation (Osaka mutation) that results in the formation of intraneuronal Aβ oligomers, MSB inhibited the intracellular aggregation of Aβ. Moreover, MSB treatment significantly extended the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans CL2120, a strain that expresses human Aβ42. Together, these results suggest that MSB and its derivatives may be further explored as potential therapeutic agents for the prevention or treatment of AD. Biostimulants are an interesting strategy to increase crop tolerance to water deficits, and there is an extensive bibliography on them. However, most of them need to be treated continuously to increase protection throughout the growth cycle. In this context, we chose menadione sodium bisulfite, whose protective effect against water deficit has been previously demonstrated but only for a short period of time. Nanoencapsulation seems to be an interesting way to improve the properties of biostimulants. Our results show that menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB) encapsulated in chitosan/tripolyphosphate nanoparticles can increase the system's tolerance against an imposed water deficit and delay the need for retreatment by at least 1 week, accelerating plant recovery after rehydration. This highlights the positive properties of nanoencapsulation and shows how a simple encapsulation process can significantly improve the biostimulant protective properties, opening up new possibilities to be explored under field conditions to cope with water-deficit stress.",Menadione sodium bisulfite,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.00529257720336318), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011049000546336174), (' FOOD', -0.14270760118961334), (',', -0.2015012502670288), (' INDUSTR', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.01449894905090332), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.0015197168104350567), ('ĠFOOD', -0.12824366986751556), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6932114362716675)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.005247156601399183), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.7697225252486533e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.12693272531032562), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.1mg.com/generics/menadione-sodium-bisulfite-211788,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menadione,https://www.foodsweeteners.com/vitamin-k3-msb/ ', [])"
3474,"('Thiabendazole', 'Tiabendazole', 'Mintezol', 'Equizole', 'Omnizole')",Medical,"Tiabendazole (INN, BAN), also known as thiabendazole (AAN, USAN) or TBZ and the trade names Mintezol, Tresaderm, and Arbotect, is a preservative, an antifungal agent, and an antiparasitic agent. == Uses == === Preservative === Tiabendazole is used primarily to control mold, blight, and other fungal diseases in fruits (e.g. oranges) and vegetables; it is also used as a prophylactic treatment for Dutch elm disease. Tiabendazole is also used as a food additive, a preservative with E number E233 (INS number 233). For example, it is applied to bananas to ensure freshness, and is a common ingredient in the waxes applied to the skins of citrus fruits. It is not approved as a food additive in the EU, Australia and New Zealand. Use in treatment of aspergillosis has been reported. It is also used in anti-fungal wallboards as a mixture with azoxystrobin. === Parasiticide === As an antiparasitic, tiabendazole is able to control roundworms (such as those causing strongyloidiasis), hookworms, and other helminth species which infect wild animals, livestock, and humans. First approved for use in sheep in 1961 and horses in 1962, resistance to this drug was first found in Haemonchus contortus in 1964, and then in the two other major small ruminant nematode parasites, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. === Fungicide === Tiabendazole acts as a fungicide through binding fungal tubulin. Resistant Aspergillus nidulans specimens were found to have a mutation in the gene coding for β-tubulin, which was reversible by a mutation in the gene for α-tubulin. This showed that thiabendazole binds to both α- and β-tubulin. This chemical is also used as a pesticide, including to treat Beech Leaf Disease. === Other === In dogs and cats, tiabendazole is used to treat ear infections. Tiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead, mercury, or antimony poisoning. == Research == Genes responsible for the maintenance of cell walls in yeast have been shown to be responsible for angiogenesis in vertebrates. Tiabendazole serves to block angiogenesis in both frog embryos and human cells. It has also been shown to serve as a vascular disrupting agent to reduce newly established blood vessels. Tiabendazole has been shown to effectively do this in certain cancer cells. == Pharmacodynamics == Tiabendazole works by inhibition of the mitochondrial, helminth-specific enzyme, fumarate reductase, with possible interaction with endogenous quinone. == Safety == The substance appears to have a slight toxicity in higher doses, with effects such as liver and intestinal disorders at high exposure in test animals (just below LD50 level). Some reproductive disorders and decreasing weaning weight have been observed, also at high exposure. Effects on humans from use as a drug include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, or headache; very rarely also ringing in the ears, vision changes, stomach pain, yellowing eyes and skin, dark urine, fever, fatigue, increased thirst and change in the amount of urine occur. Carcinogenic effects have been shown at higher doses. == Synthesis == Intermediate aryl amidine (2) is prepared by aluminium trichloride-catalyzed addition of aniline to the nitrile of 4-cyanothiazole (1). The amidine (2) is then converted to its N-chloro derivative 3 with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Upon treatment with base, this undergoes a nitrene insertion reaction (4) to produce tiabendazole (5). An alternative synthesis involves reacting 4-thiazolecarboxamide with o-phenylenediamine in polyphosphoric acid. === Derivatives === A number of derivatives of tiabendazole are also pharmaceutical drugs, including albendazole, cambendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, mebendazole, and flubendazole. == See also == Fungicide use in the United States List of fungicides == References == == External links == Thiabendazole, Extension Toxicology Network Medicinenet: Thiabendazole – Oral",Omnizole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.04444720223546028), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.01176663301885128), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.0024816039949655533), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.09257016330957413), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.00021789084712509066), ('ĠFOOD', -0.06212771683931351), (',', -0.20169271528720856), ('ĠINDU', -0.0009388091857545078), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01868503913283348)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01814994215965271)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Since its introduction in November 2008 it has been distributed under the commercial name Masivet. It has been available in Europe since the second part of 2009. Masitinib has been studied for several human conditions including melanoma, multiple myeloma, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mastocytosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and COVID-19. == Mechanism of action == Masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits tyrosine kinases, enzymes responsible for the activation of many proteins by signal transduction cascades. Specifically, masitinib targets the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit which is found to be overexpressed or mutated in several types of cancer. In addition to cKit, Masitinib also has additional targets, and it inhibits platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) as well as CSF1R. Masitinib has been shown to block the replication of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting its main protease, 3CLpro. Masitinib showed >200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Masitinib was under investigation for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis (Masipro) but approval was denied in the EU in 2017 due to concerns ""about the reliability of the study results"" and major changes to the study design. European approval of masitinib for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Alsitek) was also refused in 2018. In June 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency recommended the refusal of a marketing authorization for Masitinib AB Science, a medicine intended for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a rare disease of the nervous system leading to loss of muscle function and paralysis.

3476,"('Phenothiazine', 'Thiodiphenylamine', 'Dibenzo-1,4-thiazine', 'Phenosan', 'Feeno')",Medical,"Phenothiazine, abbreviated PTZ, is an organic compound that has the formula S(C6H4)2NH and is related to the thiazine-class of heterocyclic compounds. Derivatives of phenothiazine are highly bioactive and have widespread use and rich history. The derivatives chlorpromazine and promethazine revolutionized the fields of psychiatry and allergy treatment, respectively. An earlier derivative, methylene blue, was one of the first antimalarial drugs, and derivatives of phenothiazine are currently under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs. Phenothiazine is a prototypical pharmaceutical lead structure in medicinal chemistry. == Uses == Phenothiazine itself is only of theoretical interest, but derivatives of it revolutionized psychiatry, other fields of medicine, and pest management. Other derivatives have been studied for possible use in advanced batteries and fuel cells. === Phenothiazine-derived drugs === In 1876, methylene blue, a derivative of phenothiazine, was synthesized by Heinrich Caro at BASF. The structure was deduced in 1885 by Heinrich August Bernthsen. Bernthsen synthesized phenothiazine in 1883. In the mid 1880s, Paul Ehrlich began to use methylene blue in his cell staining experiments that led to pioneering discoveries about different cell types. He was awarded a Nobel Prize based in part on that work. He became particularly interested in its use to stain bacteria and parasites such as Plasmodiidae – the genus that includes the malaria pathogen – and found that it could be stained with methylene blue. He thought methylene blue could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria, tested it clinically, and by the 1890s methylene blue was being used for that purpose. For the next several decades, research on derivatives lapsed until phenothiazine itself came to market as an insecticide and deworming drug. In the 1940s, chemists working with Paul Charpentier at Rhone-Poulenc Laboratories in Paris (a precursor company to Sanofi), began making derivatives. This work led to promethazine which had no activity against infective organisms, but did have good antihistamine activity, with a strong sedative effect. It went to market as a drug for allergies and for anesthesia. As of 2012 it was still on the market. At the end of the 1940s the same lab produced chlorpromazine which had an even stronger sedative and soothing effect, and Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker attempted to use it on their psychiatric patients, publishing their results in the early 1950s. The strong effects they found opened the door of the modern field of psychiatry and led to a proliferation of work on phenothiazine derivatives. The systematic research conducted by chemists to explore phenothiazine derivatives and their activity was a pioneering example of medicinal chemistry; phenothiazine is often discussed as a prototypical example of a pharmaceutical lead structure. A number of phenothiazines other than methylene blue have been shown to have antimicrobial effects. In particular, thioridazine has been shown to make extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) drug-susceptible again and make methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. The major reason why thioridazine has not been utilized as an antimicrobial agent is due to adverse effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system (particularly QT interval prolongation). The term ""phenothiazines"" describes the largest of the five main classes of antipsychotic drugs. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, antiemetic properties, although they may also cause severe side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (including akathisia and tardive dyskinesia), hyperprolactinaemia, and the rare but potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome, as well as substantial weight gain. Use of phenothiazines has been associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, but no causal relationship has been established. Phenothiazine antipsychotics are classified into three groups that differ with respect to the substituent on nitrogen: the aliphatic compounds (bearing acyclic groups), the ""piperidines"" (bearing piperidine-derived groups), and the piperazine (bearing piperazine-derived substituents). === Nondrug applications === The synthetic dye methylene blue, containing the structure, was described in 1876. Many water-soluble phenothiazine derivatives, such as methylene blue, methylene green, thionine, and others, can be electropolymerized into conductive polymers used as electrocatalysts for NADH oxidation in enzymatic biosensors and biofuel cells. Phenothiazine is used as an anaerobic inhibitor for acrylic acid polymerization, often used as an in-process inhibitor during the purification of acrylic acid. == Trade names == Like many commercially significant compounds, phenothiazine has numerous trade names, including AFI-Tiazin, Agrazine, Antiverm, Biverm, Dibenzothiazine, Orimon, Lethelmin, Souframine, Nemazene, Vermitin, Padophene, Fenoverm, Fentiazine, Contaverm, Fenothiazine, Phenovarm, Ieeno, ENT 38, Helmetina, Helmetine, Penthazine, XL-50, Wurm-thional, Phenegic, Phenovis, Phenoxur, and Reconox. == Former uses == Phenothiazine was formerly used as an insecticide and as a drug to treat infections with parasitic worms (anthelminthic) in livestock and people, but its use for those purposes has been superseded by other chemicals. Phenothiazine was introduced by DuPont as an insecticide in 1935. About 3,500,000 pounds were sold in the US in 1944. However, because it was degraded by sunlight and air, it was difficult to determine how much to use in the field, and its use waned in the 1940s with the arrival of new pesticides like DDT that were more durable.: 161–162 As of July 2015 it is not registered for pesticide use in the US, Europe, or Australia. === As an anthelminthic === It was introduced as anthelminthic in livestock in 1940 and is considered, with thiabendazole, to be the first modern anthelminthic. The first instances of resistance were noted in 1961. Among anthelmintics, Blizzard et al. 1990 found only paraherquamide to have similar activity to phenothiazine. It is possible that they share the same mode of action. Uses for this purpose in the US are still described but it has ""virtually disappeared from the market."": 369 In the 1940s it also was introduced as antihelminthic for humans; since it was often given to children, the drug was often sold in chocolate, leading to the popular name, ""worm chocolate."" Phenothiazine was superseded by other drugs in the 1950s. == Structure and synthesis == The central C4SN ring is folded in phenothiazines. The compound was originally prepared by Bernthsen in 1883 via the reaction of diphenylamine with sulfur, but more recent syntheses rely on the cyclization of 2-substituted diphenyl sulfides. Few pharmaceutically significant phenothiazines are prepared from phenothiazine, although some of them are. Phenothiazines are electron donors, forming charge-transfer salts with many acceptors. == References == == External links == MSDS Archived 2009-01-14 at the Wayback Machine Hendricks, Christensen, J.B., and Kristiansen, Jette E.

Formulated as the hydrochloride salt, emixustat hydrochloride, it is the first synthetic medicinal compound shown to affect retinal disease processes when taken by mouth. Emixustat was invented by the British-American chemist, Ian L. Scott, and is currently in Phase 3 trials for dry, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The compound is also being investigated as a potential therapy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and Stargardt disease. In 2008, Acucela Inc. partnered with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company for the development of emixustat (ACU-4429) in an agreement totaling $263 million in cash and milestone payments. Emixustat hydrochloride is a non-retinoid small molecule inhibitor of RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65 kDa protein, also known as retinoid isomerohydrolase). It is thought to reduce visual chromophore biosynthesis and prevent the accumulation of toxic retinal byproducts. == Mechanism of action == A significant factor in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is thought to be the toxic byproduct, N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E). A2E is a major chromophore in lipofuscin and causes singlet oxygen production when exposed to high-energy light. A2E is formed from the release of all-trans-retinol within the outer segment disks of human photoreceptors. All-trans-retinol is an important component in the Visual Cycle, the mechanism by which light energy is converted into electrical energy within the eye. In the visual cycle, exposure to light causes 11-cis-retinal to isomerize to all-trans-retinal (as part of the rhodopsin complex). The isomerisation results in the release of chemical energy, which is processed into an electrical signal (by a series of different cells) that is transmitted to the brain. The all-trans-retinal is released from opsin, reduced to all-trans-retinol, then transported from the photoreceptor cells back to the RPE cells, where it is stored for recycling and future use as retinol palmitate. The transportation of all-trans-retinal back to RPE cells is not 100% efficient, and a small amount of all-trans-retinal can escape. This condenses with membrane-bound ethanolamine to form a Schiff's base. A second molecule of all-trans-retinal reacts with the Schiff's base and forms A2E. The formation of A2E is largely associated with the rod photoreceptor cells. These cells account for approximately 95% of human photoreceptors, and turn over cis to trans retinol constantly under normal lighting conditions. Emixustat hydrochloride is a synthetic small molecule non-retinoid designed to stop the Visual Cycle by inhibiting the formation of 11-cis-retinal. Stored all-trans-retinyl palmitate is simultaneously hydrolysed and isomerised to 11-cis-retinol by RPE-65. The 11-cis-retinol is oxidized to 11-cis retinal and transported to photoreceptor cells where it binds to opsin to form rhodopsin. Emixustat hydrochloride binds to RPE-65 and prevents the isomerohydrolase reaction. Without 11-cis-retinal, the rod photoreceptor cells no longer produce all-trans-retinol and production of A2E is halted. The isomerisation of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema (DME), but by a different outcome of the same mechanism. One of the consequences of diabetes is damage to blood vessels; damaged vessels are less able to carry oxygen, thus inhibiting one of the most important biological processes within the eye. Normal retinal cells require a very large amount of oxygen. When insufficient oxygen is available, vascular remodelling occurs and poorly remodelled blood vessels leak, causing edema. The conversion of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinal is a very oxygen intensive process. By blocking the isomerisation of retinol, emixustat hydrochloride may decrease the oxygen demand of the retina and therefore liberate large amounts of oxygen for other processes. In a completed Phase 1a study, the drug was ""well tolerated"" by male and female human participants, and demonstrated dose-dependent modulation of electroretinogram (ERG) signals. A Phase II study, completed in 2015, produced a dose dependent, reversible effect on rod function consistent with emixustat's planned mechanism of action. == See also == Visual phototransduction Retinol isomerase == References == == Further reading == == External links == Associated patents, ianscottmolecular.com",Emixustat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013350549852475524), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011053401976823807)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emixustat, www.biospace.com/article/releases/kubota-vision-announced-end-of-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-emixustat-in-patients-with-stargardt-disease/, www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/orphan-designations/eu-3-19-2162 ', [])"

It was patented in 1992 and approved for medical use in 2000. == Medical uses == Almotriptan is prescribed to treat the acute headache phase of migraine attacks with or without aura. Almotriptan is approved in the US for the treatment of migraine in adolescent from 12 to 17 years of age. === Efficacy === The efficacy and tolerability of almotriptan has been studied in numerous randomised, controlled trials totaling more than 4800 adults with either moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Its efficacy is significantly more effective than placebo and alleviates nausea, photophobia and phonophobia linked to migraine attacks. Almotriptan has similar efficacy as a standard dose of sumatriptan, another triptan drug, and fewer adverse effects. == Contraindications == As with other triptans, almotriptan should not be used in patients with a history, symptoms or signs of ischaemic heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, documented silent ischaemia, Prinzmetal's angina) or severe hypertension and uncontrolled mild or moderate hypertension. Other contraindications are previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, severe hepatic impairment, concomitant administration of ergotamine, ergotamine derivatives (including methysergide) and other 5-HT1B/D agonists. == Side effects == Almotriptan has proved to have an adverse effects profile similar to placebo when used following the Summary of Product Characteristics instructions (see references). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like all triptans, almotriptan has a high and specific affinity for serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Binding of the drug to the receptor leads to vasoconstriction of the cranial (brain) blood vessels and thus affects the redistribution of blood flow. Almotriptan significantly increases cerebral blood flow and reduces blood flow through extracerebral cranial vessels. Even though it affects cranial blood vessels a single standard dose of almotriptan has no clinically significant effect on blood pressure or heart rate in both young and elderly healthy volunteers. Larger doses seem to slightly increase blood pressure but not beyond clinical relevance. === Pharmacokinetics === Almotriptan has linear pharmacokinetics up to the 16-fold standard dose. Its biological half-life is 3 hours, and its bioavailability 70%. Cmax is observed 1.5–4 hours after oral administration, and approximately 50% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism is mediated through the enzymes MAO-A and CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 oxidation. Almotriptan clearance is moderately reduced in the elderly but does not require dose adjustment. Sex does not alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. People with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction are recommended to use only half the dose. == Interactions == Almotriptan is metabolized mainly by MAO-A and to lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Studies of drugs used as preventive against migraine (propranolol and verapamil), anti-depressants (moclobemide and fluoxetine) yielded results that showed significant altering of the pharmacokinetics of almotriptan though they were deemed not clinically relevant. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Axert (US, Canada), Almogran (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea...), Almotrex (Italy), Almozen (Bulgaria and Poland) and Amignul (Spain). == References == == External links == ""Almotriptan"".

3481,"('Felbamate', 'Felbatol', 'Felbamyl', 'Taloxa', 'Felbamato')",Medical,"Felbamate (marketed under the brand name Felbatol by MedPointe) is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy. It is used to treat partial seizures (with and without generalization) in adults and partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome in children. However, an increased risk of potentially fatal aplastic anemia and/or liver failure limit the drug's usage to severe refractory epilepsy. == Mechanism of action == Felbamate has been proposed to have a unique dual mechanism of action as a positive modulator of GABAA receptors and as a blocker of NMDA receptors, particularly isoforms containing the NR2B subunit. Although it is clear that felbamate does cause pharmacological inhibition of NMDA receptors, the relevance of NMDA receptor blockade as a strategy for the treatment of human epilepsy has been questioned. Therefore, the importance of the effects of felbamate on NMDA receptors to its therapeutic action in epilepsy is uncertain. == Approval history == === United States === August 1993. Felbamate was approved for partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults and for Lennox–Gastaut Syndrome, a serious form of childhood epilepsy. Over the following year 150,000 people were started on felbamate therapy and a third of these became established. August 1, 1994. It was urgently withdrawn after 10 cases of aplastic anemia. A ""Dear Doctor"" letter was sent to 240,000 physicians. September 27, 1994. Felbamate had a limited redemption in another ""Dear Doctor"" letter sent to 260,000 physicians. It was recommended that the drug remain available only for patients with severe epilepsy for whom the benefits outweigh the risks, and that changes be made to the product's labelling to reflect the newly recognized risk. This redemption came with an additional warning since there had been 10 cases acute liver failure (4 of which were fatal). At this point, 10,000 to 12,000 people remained on the drug. === United Kingdom === The drug is only available on a limited named-patient basis. == Indications and usage == Adults: Monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with and without generalization. Children: Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. == Dosing == Felbamate is available in tablets (400 mg and 600 mg) and as a peach-coloured oral suspension (600 mg/5 mL). Adults (≥ 14 years): begin with 1,200 mg daily given every 6 to 8 hours Children (2–14 years): 15 to 45 mg per kg per day given every 6 to 8 hours == Side effects == Adverse reactions include decreased appetite, vomiting, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and headache. Many patients report increased alertness with the drug. Two rare but very serious effects include aplastic anemia and serious liver damage. The risk of aplastic anemia is between 1:3,600 and 1:5,000, of which 30% of cases are fatal. The risk of liver damage is between 1:24,000 to 1:34,000, of which 40% of cases are fatal. == Drug interactions == Felbamate is an inhibitor of CYP2C19 - an enzyme involved in the metabolism of several commonly used medications. Felbamate interacts with several other AEDs, including phenytoin, valproate, and carbamazepine; dosage adjustments may be necessary to avoid adverse effects. Concomitant administration of felbamate and carbamazepine decreases blood levels of both drugs, while increasing the level of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide, the active metabolite of carbamazepine. == History == Felbamate was discovered by Frank Berger at Wallace Laboratories. == References == == External links == Felbatol: Prescribing Information RxList: Felbamate contains extensive information including the patient warning and a sample consent form.

It is one of the estrogens present in the estrogen combination drug preparations known as conjugated estrogens (CEEs; e.g. Premarin) and esterified estrogens (EEs; e.g. Estratab, Menest). CEEs is the most commonly used form of estrogen medications in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms in the United States. Estrone sulfate is the major estrogen in CEEs (about 50%) while equilin sulfate is the second major estrogen in the formulation, present as about 25% of the total. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Equilin is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), the ERα and ERβ. In terms of relative binding affinity for the ERs, equilin has about 13% and 49% of that of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Analogously to the reversible transformation of estrone into estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, equilin can be converted into the more potent estrogen 17β-dihydroequilin in the body. This estrogen has about 113% and 108% of the relative binding affinities of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Equilin is present in CEEs in the form of equilin sulfate, which itself is inactive and acts as a prodrug of equilin via steroid sulfatase. Similarly to synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol, equilin and CEEs have disproportionate effects in certain tissues such as the liver and uterus relative to bioidentical human estrogens like estradiol and estrone. Because of their disproportionate potency in the liver, equilin and CEEs have relatively increased effects on liver protein synthesis compared to estradiol. A dosage of 0.25 mg/day equilin sulfate is equivalent to 0.625 mg/day CEEs in terms of relief from hot flashes. At a dosage of 0.625 mg/day equilin sulfate, the increases in circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin, and angiotensinogen were 1.5 to 8 times those observed with estrone sulfate. Equilin has about 42% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 80% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus, while its more active form, 17β-dihydroequilin, has about 83% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 200% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus. === Pharmacokinetics === Equilin has about 8% of the relative binding affinity of testosterone for SHBG, relative to 12% in the case of estrone. In terms of plasma protein binding, it is bound 26% to SHBG and 13% to albumin. The metabolic clearance rates of equilin and equilin sulfate are 2,640 L/day/m2 and 175 L/day/m2, respectively. In accordance, the biological half-life of equilin sulfate is substantially longer than that of equilin. Equilin is converted into 17β-dihydroequilin in the liver and in other tissues. Equilin and 17β-dihydroequilin can also be transformed into equilenin and 17β-dihydroequilenin. Equilin is excreted in the form of glucuronide conjugates. == Chemistry == Equilin, also known as δ7-estrone or as 7-dehydroestrone, as well as estra-1,3,5(10),7-tetraen-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid and an analogue of estrone.

EGCG – the most abundant catechin in tea – is a polyphenol under basic research for its potential to affect human health and disease. EGCG is used in many dietary supplements. == Food sources == === Tea === It is found in high content in the dried leaves of green tea (7380 mg per 100 g), white tea (4245 mg per 100 g), and in smaller quantities, black tea (936 mg per 100 g). During black tea production, the catechins are mostly converted to theaflavins and thearubigins via polyphenol oxidases. === Other === Trace amounts are found in apple skin, plums, onions, hazelnuts, pecans, and carob powder (at 109 mg per 100 g). == Bioavailability == When taken orally, EGCG has poor absorption even at daily intake equivalent to 8 to 16 cups of green tea, an amount causing adverse effects such as nausea or heartburn. After consumption, EGCG blood levels peak within 1.7 hours. The absorbed plasma half-life is around 5 hours, but with majority of unchanged EGCG excreted into urine over 0 to 8 hours. Methylated metabolites appear to have longer half-lives and occur at 8 to 25 times the plasma levels of unmetabolized EGCG. == Research == Well-studied in basic research, EGCG has various biological effects in laboratory studies.

A 2016 review found that high daily doses (107 to 856 mg/day) taken by human subjects over four to 14 weeks produced a small reduction of LDL cholesterol. == Potential toxicity == A 2018 review showed that excessive intake of EGCG may cause liver toxicity. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority stated that daily intake of 800 mg or more could increase risk of liver damage. Taken as a capsule or tablet 338 mg per day of EGCG is considered safe, whereas 704 mg per day is safe if consumed as a tea beverage. 100 mL of green tea contains about 70.2 mg of EGCG (about 165 mg per cup). == Regulation == Over 2008 to 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration issued several warning letters to manufacturers of dietary supplements containing EGCG for violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Most of these letters informed the companies that their promotional materials promoted EGCG-based dietary supplements in the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions that cause them to be classified as drugs under the United States code, while another focused on inadequate quality assurance procedures and labeling violations. The warnings were issued because the products had not been established as safe and effective for their marketed uses and were promoted as ""new drugs"", without approval as required under the Act. == See also == Health effects of tea Tannin Phenolic content in tea List of phytochemicals in food == References ==",Epigallocatechin-3-gallate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -7.958325295476243e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.0077662901021540165), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.06202666088938713), ('ĠMED', -0.3661987781524658), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029789412394165993)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16876833/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33350134/ ', [])"

It is a beta-adrenergic blocker; an ultra short-acting, β1-superselective intravenous adrenergic antagonist, which decreases the heart rate effectively with less negative effect on blood pressure or myocardial contractility. In comparison to other beta blockers, landiolol has the shortest elimination half-life (3 to 4 minutes), ultra-rapid onset of effect (heart rate begins to decrease immediately after completion of administration), and predictable effectiveness with inactive metabolites (heart rate returns to baseline levels at 30 min after completion of landiolol hydrochloride administration). The pure S-enantiomer structure of landiolol is believed to develop less hypotensive side effects in comparison to other β-blockers. This has a positive impact on the treatment of patients when reduction of heart rate without decrease in arterial blood pressure is desired. It is used as landiolol hydrochloride. Landiolol was approved for medical use in Japan in 2002, in Canada in November 2023, and in the United States in November 2024. == Medical uses == Landiolol is indicated as an antiarrhythmic agent to treat Supraventricular tachycardia and for the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other circumstances where short-term control of the ventricular rate with a short acting agent is desirable. Non-compensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician's judgment the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. Landiolol has been approved for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in Japan. In the United States, landiolol is indicated for the short-term reduction of ventricular rate in adults with supraventricular tachycardia including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Landiolol can be used as first-line treatment for acute ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation (Level I recommendation- 2020 Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology). == Mode of action == The drug acts as an ultra-short-acting β1-selective blocking agent. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to an inactive form by both carboxylesterase in the liver and pseudocholinesterase in the plasma, resulting in an elimination half-life of about four minutes. Landiolol is a highly selective beta-1-adrenoreceptor antagonist (the selectivity for beta-1-receptor blockade is 255 times higher than for beta-2-receptor blockade) that inhibits the positive chronotropic effects of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart, where beta-1-receptors are predominantly located. Landiolol, as other beta-blockers, is thought to reduce the sympathetic drive, resulting in reduction in heart rate, decrease in spontaneous firing of ectopic pacemakers, slowing the conduction and increase the refractory period of the AV node. Landiolol does not exhibit any membrane-stabilizing activity or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in vitro. In preclinical and clinical studies, landiolol controlled tachycardia in an ultra-short acting manner with a fast onset and offset of action and further demonstrated anti-ischaemic and cardioprotective effects. To date, landiolol has the shortest plasma half-time and the highest cardio-selectivity among β-blockers in clinical use. The selectivity of landiolol for β1-receptor blockade is 255 times higher than for β2-receptor blockade. In comparison, Metoprolol, has a much less cardioselectivity (landiolol is 100 times more cardioselective than metoprolol, and 8 times more cardioselectove than esmolol), and sixty times longer half-life (3–4 hours comparing to 3–4 minutes in case of landiolol). FDA points out that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers will have decreased cardioselectivity for metoprolol due to increased metoprolol blood levels, since the gene variation reduces the conversion of metoprolol to inactive metabolites leading to almost 5-fold higher plasma concentrations of metoprolol. Activation of β2 adrenergic receptors contributes to bronchial dilation and acceleration of alveolar fluid clearance in the pulmonary airway system. Consequently, a cardio-selective β1-blocker with limited effect on β2-receptor decreases the heart rate without the pulmonary adverse effects in patients with COPD or Asthma. Pharmacological stimulation of β2 receptors increases coronary blood flow in healthy humans and in patients with mildly atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Thus, not only does a cardio-selective β1-blocker reduce myocardial oxygen demand during exercise, but it also unveils β2-receptor-mediated coronary exercise hyperemia, while reducing the heart rate selectively. Interestingly, landiolol does not possess any sodium and calcium antagonistic properties, which makes it a more suitable cardio-selective β-blocker for patients with heart failure due to its lesser potency for negative inotropy, while offering higher potency for heart rate reduction. Contrary to landiolol, exposure to other β-blockers such as esmolol amplifies the re-expression of β-receptors which explains the drug tolerance effect seen during long-term esmolol infusion. Long term exposure of cells to betablockers which act as pharmacochaperones will raise the total surface level of β1-adrenergic receptors, resulting in exaggerating responses to endogenous agonists such as catecholamines, if the treatment is suddenly stopped. This phenomenon has been described as the betablocker withdrawal rebound. However, landiolol lacks appreciable pharmacochaperoning activity, as landiolol can hardly permeate cell membranes due to its large polar surface area. == Biotransformation == Landiolol is metabolised via hydrolysis of the ester moiety. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that landiolol is mainly metabolised in the plasma by pseudocholinesterases and carboxylesterases. Hydrolysis releases a ketal (the alcoholic component) that is further cleaved to yield glycerol and acetone, and the carboxylic acid component (metabolite M1), which subsequently undergoes beta-oxidation to form metabolite M2 (a substituted benzoic acid). The beta-1-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of landiolol metabolites M1 and M2 is 1/200 or less of the parent compound indicating a negligible effect on pharmacodynamics taking into account the maximum recommended landiolol dose and infusion duration. Neither landiolol nor the metabolites M1 and M2 showed inhibitory effects on the metabolic activity of different cytochrome P450 molecular species (CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) in vitro. The cytochrome P450 content was not affected in rats after repeated intravenous administration of landiolol. There are no data on a potential effect of landiolol or its metabolites on CYP P450 induction or time dependent inhibition available. == History == The beneficial effects of landiolol have been demonstrated in over sixty clinical trials (pubmed search -August 2018). Landiolol was generally well tolerated, with a relatively low risk of hypotension and bradycardia. Most clinical trials with landiolol have been conducted in peri-operative settings for the treatment or prophylaxis of supraventricular tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia before or after cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries. Randomized clinical trials have been published to compare landiolol with placebo< diltiazem, and amiodaron in patients with or without heart failure. Case reports on the use of landiolol after myocardial infarction, refractory electrical storm have been published. The fast turnover of landiolol will diminish most adverse events due to self-limiting administration. Landiolol may be cardio-protective in septic rats by normalizing coronary microcirculation through blockage of sepsis-induced decrease in expression of VEGF signaling system but independent of inflammatory cytokines. The efficacy and safety of landiolol in septic shock has been investigated in a multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial, and the results of the study have been published in the renown Journal Lancet Respiratory in 2020, demonstrating clinical impact of landiolol in sepsis patients through significant reduction of new-onset arrhythmia and keeping the patients within the target heart rate range. Furthermore, landiolol demonstrated a positive clinical impact regarding ventilation-free days, ICU-free days and hospital-free days. Patients in the landiolol group had a survival rate of 88% by day 28, in contrast to a mortality rate of 20% in the control group by day 28. These are very important findings which may include landiolol in the standard of care for sepsis patients, since tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are key prognostic factors for sepsis. Additionally, tachycardia exceeding 100 beats per min (bpm) on admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is a risk factor for worsening prognosis. A publication in the Journal of Cardiology illustrated in a prospective real-world setting, the safety and effectiveness of landiolol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in chronic heart failure (over one thousand patients at 209 medical institutions throughout Japan). In this survey, which is one of the largest studies ever performed in patients with chronic heart failure requiring intravenous rate control, report of serious hypotension was in less than 1% of patients, which highlights the cardio-selectivity of landiolol with limited effect on blood pressure. Noteworthy, over 70% of patients were in the NYHA class III or IV (35% NYHA IV), and close to 50% had a LVEF below 40%. The median time to first return to sinus rhythm after administration of landiolol was 14 hours, and the median highest infusion rate was 3 μg/kg/min. The excellent tolerance of landiolol at lower dosage (3–5 μg/kg/min) allows to initiate prophylactic use during surgery and post-operatively. Landiolol prophylaxis is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation without triggering adverse events related to a beta-blockade. Optimized infusion scheme with continuing landiolol infusion in the post-operative period seems to be associated with better response, while infusion limited to the intraoperative period may not be sufficient == Society and culture == === Legal status === Landiolol was approved for medical use in Japan in 2002, in Canada in November 2023, and in the United States in November 2024. === Brand names === It is sold under various brand names including Rapibloc, Raploc, Runrapiq, Landibloc, Onoact, Corbeta, and Rapiblyk. == References == == Further reading == Shiga T (June 2022).

Biodegradation played a more important role than adsorption, while microbial cells covered with tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) showed higher adsorption capacity than microbial cells themselves or microbial cells covered with both loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) and TB-EPS. The binding tests between EPS and SMM and the spectroscopic analyses (3D-EEM, UV-Vis, and FTIR) were performed to obtain more information about the adsorption process. The data showed that SMM could interact with EPS by combining with aromatic protein compounds, fulvic acid-like substances, protein amide II, and nucleic acids. Batch tests with various substances showed that SMM removal rates were in an order of NH The efficacy of orally administered drugs in cattle is thought to be slow because of the anatomical and physiological features of their forestomach. Thus, parenteral routes are mainly preferred to administer drugs. However, the effect of some drugs with unique physicochemical properties was promptly obtained even after oral administration in clinically ill cattle. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate pharmacokinetically the usefulness of the oral route in cattle by comparing the oral pharmacokinetic properties of two sulfonamides with different physicochemical properties. Sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM) were administered by intravenous and oral route to four female Holstein cows with a 4-weeks washout period. Blood samples were collected over time, and SDZ and SMM concentrations in plasma were analyzed by HPLC. Data obtained from the same animal after intravenous and oral administration were simultaneously analyzed with the one compartment model, and kinetic parameters were calculated.

Fenebrutinib, an orally administered, potent, highly selective, reversible BTK inhibitor, may be effective in CSU. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (EudraCT ID 2016-004624-35 ) randomized 93 adults with antihistamine-refractory CSU to 50 mg daily, 150 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily of fenebrutinib or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in urticaria activity score over 7 d (UAS7) at week 8. Secondary end points were the change from baseline in UAS7 at week 4 and the proportion of patients well-controlled (UAS7 ≤ 6) at week 8. Fenebrutinib efficacy in patients with type IIb autoimmunity and effects on IgG-anti-FcεRI were exploratory end points. Safety was also evaluated. The primary end point was met, with dose-dependent improvements in UAS7 at week 8 occurring at 200 mg twice daily and 150 mg daily, but not at 50 mg daily of fenebrutinib versus placebo. Asymptomatic, reversible grade 2 and 3 liver transaminase elevations occurred in the fenebrutinib 150 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily groups (2 patients each). Fenebrutinib diminished disease activity in patients with antihistamine-refractory CSU, including more patients with refractory type IIb autoimmunity. These results support the potential use of BTK inhibition in antihistamine-refractory CSU. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an intracellular signaling enzyme that regulates B-lymphocyte and myeloid cell functions. Due to its involvement in both innate and adaptive immune compartments, BTK inhibitors have emerged as a therapeutic option in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Brain-penetrant, small-molecule BTK inhibitors may also address compartmentalized neuroinflammation, which is proposed to underlie MS disease progression. BTK is expressed by microglia, which are the resident innate immune cells of the brain; however, the precise roles of microglial BTK and impact of BTK inhibitors on microglial functions are still being elucidated. Research on the effects of BTK inhibitors has been limited to rodent disease models. This is the first study reporting effects in human microglia. Here we characterize the pharmacological and functional properties of fenebrutinib, a potent, highly selective, noncovalent, reversible, brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor, in human microglia and complex human brain cell systems, including brain organoids. We find that fenebrutinib blocks the deleterious effects of microglial Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) activation, including cytokine and chemokine release, microglial clustering and neurite damage in diverse human brain cell systems. Gene expression analyses identified pathways linked to inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase production and cholesterol metabolism that were modulated by fenebrutinib treatment. In contrast, fenebrutinib had no significant impact on human microglial pathways linked to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) signaling or myelin phagocytosis. Our study enhances the understanding of BTK functions in human microglial signaling that are relevant to MS pathogenesis and suggests that fenebrutinib could attenuate detrimental microglial activity associated with FcγR activation in people with MS. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative, autoimmune disease that is still incurable. Nowadays, a variety of new drugs are being developed to prevent excessive inflammation and halt neurodegeneration. Among these are the inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Being indispensable for B cells, this enzyme became an appealing therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. Recognizing the emerging importance of BTK in myeloid cells, we investigated the impact of upcoming BTK inhibitors on neutrophil functions. Although adaptive immunity in MS has been thoroughly studied, unanswered questions about the pathogenesis can be addressed by studying the effects of candidate MS drugs on innate immune cells such as neutrophils, previously overlooked in MS. In this study, we used 3 BTK inhibitors (evobrutinib, fenebrutinib, and tolebrutinib), and found that they reduce neutrophil activation by the bacterial peptide fMLF and the chemokine interleukin-8/CXCL8. Furthermore, they diminished the production of reactive oxygen species and release of neutrophil extracellular traps. Additionally, the production of CXCL8 and interleukin-1β in response to inflammatory stimuli was decreased. Inhibitory effects of the drugs on neutrophil activation were not related to toxicity. Instead, BTK inhibitors prolonged neutrophil survival in an inflammatory environment. Finally, treatment with BTK inhibitors decreased neutrophil migration toward CXCL8 in a Boyden chamber assay but not in a transendothelial setup. Also, in vivo CXCL1-induced migration was unaffected by BTK inhibitors. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the impact of BTK inhibitors on neutrophil functions, thereby holding important implications for autoimmune or hematological diseases in which BTK is crucial.",Fenebrutinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.60526381782256e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019386084750294685)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([roche.com](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2023-05-17?utm_source=openai), [roche.com](https://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2024-09-04?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34750553/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=279, start_index=9, title='Roche’s BTK inhibitor fenebrutinib significantly reduced brain lesions in people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis', type='url_citation', url='https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2023-05-17?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=279, start_index=9, title='Roche’s fenebrutinib demonstrated near-complete suppression of disease activity and disability progression for up to 48 weeks in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis', type='url_citation', url='https://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2024-09-04?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=279, start_index=9, title='Fenebrutinib in H1 antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized phase 2 trial - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34750553/?utm_source=openai')])"
3494,"('Adipic acid', 'Hexanedioic acid', 'Adipinic acid', 'Adilactetten', 'Acifloctin')","Medical, Industrial","Adipic acid or hexanedioic acid is the organic compound with the formula (CH2)4(COOH)2. From an industrial perspective, it is the most important dicarboxylic acid: about 2.5 billion kilograms of this white crystalline powder are produced annually, mainly as a precursor for the production of nylon. Adipic acid otherwise rarely occurs in nature, but it is known as manufactured E number food additive E355. Salts and esters of adipic acid are known as adipates. == Preparation and reactivity == Adipic acid is produced by oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which is called KA oil, an abbreviation of ketone-alcohol oil. Nitric acid is the oxidant. The pathway is multistep. Early in the reaction, the cyclohexanol is converted to the ketone, releasing nitrous acid: HOCH(CH2)5 + HNO3 → O=C(CH2)5 + HNO2 + H2O The cyclohexanone is then nitrosated, setting the stage for the scission of the C-C bond: HNO2 + HNO3 → [NO+][NO3]− + H2O O=C(CH2)5 + NO+ → O=C(CHNO)(CH2)4 + H+ Side products of the method include glutaric and succinic acids. Nitrous oxide is produced in about one to one mole ratio to the adipic acid, as well, via the intermediacy of a nitrolic acid. Related processes start from cyclohexanol, which is obtained from the hydrogenation of phenol. === Alternative methods of production === Several methods have been developed by carbonylation of butadiene. For example, the hydrocarboxylation proceeds as follows: CH2=CH−CH=CH2 + 2 CO + 2 H2O → HO2C(CH2)4CO2H Another method is oxidative cleavage of cyclohexene using hydrogen peroxide. The waste product is water. Auguste Laurent discovered adipic acid in 1837 by oxidation of various fats with nitric acid via sebacic acid and gave it the current name because of that (ultimately from Latin adeps, adipis – ""animal fat""; cf. adipose tissue). === Reactions === Adipic acid is a dibasic acid (it has two acidic groups). The pKa values for their successive deprotonations are 4.41 and 5.41. With the carboxylate groups separated by four methylene groups, adipic acid is suited for intramolecular condensation reactions. Upon treatment with barium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, it undergoes ketonization to give cyclopentanone. == Uses == About 60% of the 2.5 billion kg of adipic acid produced annually is used as monomer for the production of nylon by a polycondensation reaction with hexamethylene diamine forming nylon 66. Other major applications also involve polymers; it is a monomer for production of polyurethane and its esters are plasticizers, especially in PVC. === In medicine === Adipic acid has been incorporated into controlled-release formulation matrix tablets to obtain pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. It has also been incorporated into the polymeric coating of hydrophilic monolithic systems to modulate the intragel pH, resulting in zero-order release of a hydrophilic drug. The disintegration at intestinal pH of the enteric polymer shellac has been reported to improve when adipic acid was used as a pore-forming agent without affecting release in the acidic media. Other controlled-release formulations have included adipic acid with the intention of obtaining a late-burst release profile. === In foods === Small but significant amounts of adipic acid are used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gelling aid. It is used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart. As an acidulant in baking powders, it avoids the undesirable hygroscopic properties of tartaric acid. Adipic acid, rare in nature, does occur naturally in beets, but this is not an economical source for commerce compared to industrial synthesis. == Safety == Adipic acid, like most carboxylic acids, is a mild skin irritant. It is mildly toxic, with a median lethal dose of 3600 mg/kg for oral ingestion by rats. == Environmental == The production of adipic acid is linked to emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and cause of stratospheric ozone depletion.

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, it works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making urination easier. Alfuzosin was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1988. It was approved in the US for benign prostatic hyperplasia in 2003. In 2020, it was the 336th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700 thousand prescriptions. == Side effects == The most common side effects are dizziness (due to postural hypotension), upper respiratory tract infection, headache, fatigue, and abdominal disturbances. Side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, and congested nose. Adverse effects of alfuzosin are similar to that of tamsulosin, but with 70% lower rate of retrograde ejaculation. == Chemistry == Alfuzosin contains a stereocenter, so is chiral, with two enantiomeric forms, (R)- and (S)-alfuzosin.

It is taken orally, available in 15 mg and 30 mg tablets. == Mechanism == Delapril is a prodrug; it is converted into two active metabolites, 5-hydroxy delapril diacid and delapril diacid. These metabolites bind completely to and inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), hence blocking angiotensin I to angiotensin II conversion. The resulting vasodilation prevents the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II.

BrdU is commonly used to study cell proliferation in living tissues and has been studied as a radiosensitizer and diagnostic tool in people with cancer. During the S phase of the cell cycle (when DNA replication occurs), BrdU can be incorporated in place of thymidine in newly synthesized DNA molecules of dividing cells. Cells that have recently performed DNA replication or DNA repair can be detected with antibodies specific for BrdU using techniques such as immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. BrdU-labelled cells in humans can be detected up to two years after BrdU infusion. Because BrdU can replace thymidine during DNA replication, it can cause mutations, and its use is therefore potentially a health hazard. However, because it is neither radioactive nor myelotoxic at labeling concentrations, it is widely preferred for in vivo studies of cancer cell proliferation. However, at radiosensitizing concentrations, BrdU becomes myelosuppressive, thus limiting its use for radiosensitizing. BrdU differs from thymidine in that BrdU substitutes a bromine atom for thymidine's CH3 group. The Br substitution can be used in X-ray diffraction experiments in crystals containing either DNA or RNA. The Br atom acts as an anomalous scatterer and its larger size will affect the crystal's X-ray diffraction enough to detect isomorphous differences as well. Bromodeoxyuridine releases gene silencing caused by DNA methylation. BrdU can also be used to identify microorganisms that respond to specific carbon substrates in aquatic and soil environments. A carbon substrate added to the incubations of environmental samples will cause the growth of microorganisms that can utilize that substrate. These microorganisms will then incorporate BrdU into their DNA as they grow. Community DNA can then be isolated and BrdU-labeled DNA purified using an immunocapture technique. Subsequent sequencing of the labeled DNA can then be used to identify the microbial taxa that participated in the degradation of the added carbon source. However, it is not certain whether all microbes present in an environmental sample can incorporate BrdU into their biomass during de novo DNA synthesis. Therefore, a group of microorganisms may respond to a carbon source but go undetected using this technique. Additionally, this technique is biased towards identifying microorganisms with A- and T-rich genomes. DNA with BrdU transcribes as usual DNA, with guanine included in RNA as a complement to BrdU. == See also == 5-Bromouracil 5-Bromouridine 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine Trypan blue == References == == External links == BrdU at OpenWetWare BrdU Modifications at IDT DNA",Bromodeoxyuridine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6994320750236511)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.15321435034275055), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.011063305661082268), ('ĠINDU', -0.0015478070126846433), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006767803803086281)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"
3499,"('Tadalafil', 'Cialis', 'Tadanafil', 'Ic351', 'Ic 351')",Medical,"Tadalafil, sold under the brand name Cialis among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is taken by mouth. Onset is typically within half an hour and the duration is up to 36 hours. Common side effects include headache, muscle pain, flushing, and nausea. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include a prolonged erection that can lead to damage to the penis, vision problems, and hearing loss. Tadalafil is not recommended in people taking nitrovasodilators such as nitroglycerin, as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure. Tadalafil is a PDE5 inhibitor which increases blood flow to the penis. It also dilates blood vessels in the lungs, which lowers the pulmonary artery pressure. Tadalafil was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 172nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tadalafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the United States, tadalafil (as Cialis) is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia; and (as Adcirca) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension to improve exercise ability. === Benign prostatic hyperplasia === A meta‐analysis found that tadalafil is an effective treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and that such treatment had a low rate of adverse effects. Tadalafil is FDA-approved for males as a therapy to treat and prevent symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as urinary urgency, hesitancy, weak stream, dribbling, and incontinence. Tadalafil was found to have similar benefits for lower urinary tract symptoms as the usually prescribed tamsulosin. === Pulmonary arterial hypertension === Tadalafil is approved in the United States, Canada, and Japan to improve exercise ability in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension. == Adverse effects == The most common potential side effects when using tadalafil are headache, stomach discomfort or pain, indigestion, burping, acid reflux, back pain, myalgia (pain in limbs and extremities), flushing, hypertension (or uncommonly hypotension), and stuffy/runny nose. Also common are dizziness, peripheral edema, fatigue, and urinary or respiratory tract infection; both diarrhea and constipation have been reported. Diarrhea was reported more frequently in patients 65 or older than in younger subjects. These side effects reflect the ability of PDE5 inhibition to cause vasodilation (causing blood vessels to widen) and usually resolve after a few hours. === Vision === In May 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that tadalafil (along with other PDE5 inhibitors) was associated with vision impairment related to NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy). Most, but not all, of these patients, had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for the development of NAION, unrelated to PDE5 inhibitor use. The FDA concluded that they were not able to draw a cause and effect relationship, only an association; the label of all three PDE5 inhibitors was changed to alert clinicians to that fact. A 2019 meta-analysis found that tadalafil exposure was not associated with NAION. === Hearing === In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, requires a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss as the result of post-marketing reports of temporary deafness associated with use of PDE5 inhibitors. == Metabolism == Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by the liver CYP3A4 enzyme system. == Mechanism of action == Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (more commonly known as cyclic GMP or cGMP) in smooth muscle cells. cGMP relaxes smooth muscle and increases blood flow to the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil (and sildenafil and vardenafil) inhibits PDE5. However, because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local penile release of nitric oxide, tadalafil's inhibition of PDE5 will have no effect without sexual stimulation. === Duration of action === Although sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil all work by inhibiting PDE5, tadalafil's pharmacologic distinction is its longer half-life (17.5 hours), compared to sildenafil and vardenafil, which are both 4–5 hours. This translates to a longer duration of action, which is partly responsible for ""The Weekend Pill"" nickname. Furthermore, the longer half-life is the basis for tadalafil's daily therapeutic use in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. === Comparison with actions of other PDE5 inhibitors === Sildenafil and vardenafil inhibit PDE6, an enzyme found in the eye, more than tadalafil. Some sildenafil users see a bluish tinge and have a heightened sensitivity to light because of PDE6 inhibition. Sildenafil and vardenafil also inhibit PDE1 more than tadalafil. PDE1 is found in the brain, heart, and vascular smooth muscle. It is thought that the inhibition of PDE1 by sildenafil and vardenafil leads to vasodilation, flushing, and tachycardia. Tadalafil inhibits PDE11 more than sildenafil or vardenafil. PDE11 is expressed in skeletal muscle, the prostate, the liver, the kidney, the pituitary gland, and the testes. The effects on the body of inhibiting PDE11 are not known. == Chemistry == Tadalafil is an annulated 2,5-diketopiperazine. It is also a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline. Tadalafil can be synthesized starting from (D)-tryptophan methyl ester and piperonal via a Pictet–Spengler reaction. This is followed by condensations with chloroacetyl chloride and methylamine to complete the diketopiperazine ring: == History == The FDA's approval of sildenafil in 1998 was a ground-breaking commercial event for the treatment of ED, with sales exceeding US$1 billion. Subsequently, the FDA approved both vardenafil and tadalafil in 2003. It initially was developed by the biotechnology company ICOS, and then again developed and marketed worldwide by Lilly ICOS, LLC, the joint venture of ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company. Tadalafil was approved in 2009 in the United States for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and is under regulatory review in other regions for this condition. In late November 2008, Eli Lilly sold the exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the United States to United Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $150 million. Tadalafil was discovered by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) under a partnership between Glaxo and ICOS to develop new drugs that began in August 1991. In 1993, the Bothell, Washington, biotechnology company ICOS Corporation began studying compound IC351, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enzyme inhibitor. In 1994, Pfizer scientists discovered that sildenafil, which also inhibits the PDE5 enzyme, caused penile erection in males participating in a clinical study of a heart medicine. Although ICOS scientists were not testing compound IC351 for treating ED, they recognized its potential usefulness for treating that disorder. Soon, in 1994, ICOS received a patent for compound IC351 (structurally unlike sildenafil and vardenafil), and Phase 1 clinical trials began in 1995. In 1997, the Phase 2 clinical studies were initiated for males experiencing ED, then progressed to the Phase 3 trials that supported the drug's FDA approval. Although Glaxo had an agreement with ICOS to share profits 50/50 for drugs resulting from the partnership, Glaxo let the agreement lapse in 1996 as the drugs developed were not in the company's core markets. In 1998, ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company formed the Lilly ICOS, LLC, a joint venture company to further develop and commercialize tadalafil as a treatment for ED. Two years later, Lilly ICOS, LLC, filed a new drug application with the FDA for compound IC351 (under the tadalafil generic name, and the Cialis brand name). In May 2002, Lilly ICOS reported to the American Urological Association that clinical trial testing demonstrated that tadalafil was effective for up to 36 hours, and one year later, the FDA approved tadalafil. One advantage Cialis has over Viagra and Levitra is its 17.5-hour half-life (thus Cialis is advertised to work for up to 36 hours, after which time there remains approximately 25% of the absorbed dose in the body) when compared to the four-hour half-life of sildenafil (Viagra). In 2007, Eli Lilly and Company bought the ICOS Corporation for $2.3 billion. As a result, Eli Lilly owned Cialis and then closed the ICOS operations, ending the joint venture and firing most of ICOS's approximately 500 employees, except for 127 employees of the ICOS biologics facility, which subsequently was bought by CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC). Persons surnamed ""Cialis"" objected to Eli Lilly and Company's so naming the drug, but the company has maintained that the drug's trade name is unrelated to the surname. In October 2011, the US FDA approved tadalafil to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a condition in which the prostate gland becomes enlarged, obstructing the free flow of urine. Symptoms may include sudden urges to urinate (urgency), difficulty in starting urination (hesitancy), a weak urine stream, and more frequent urination — especially at night. The FDA has also approved tadalafil for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction where the two conditions co-exist. == Society and culture == === Marketing === In the United States, the FDA relaxed rules on prescription drug marketing in 1997, allowing advertisements targeted directly to consumers. Lilly-ICOS hired the Grey Worldwide Agency in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, to run the Cialis advertising campaign. Marketing for Cialis has taken advantage of its greater duration compared to its competitors in advertisements for the drug; Stuart Elliot of The New York Times opined: ""The continuous presence of females in Cialis ads is a subtle signal that the drug makes it easier for them to set the pace with males, in contrast to the primarily male-driven imagery for Levitra and Viagra."" Iconic themes in Cialis ads include couples side by side in matching bathtubs and the slogan ""When the moment is right, will you be ready?"" Cialis ads were unique among the ED drugs in mentioning specifics of the drug. As a result, Cialis ads were also the first to describe the side effects in an advertisement, as the FDA requires advertisements with specifics to mention side effects. One of the first Cialis ads aired at the 2004 Super Bowl. Just weeks before the Super Bowl, the FDA required more possible side effects to be listed in the advertisement, including priapism. Although many parents objected to the Cialis ad being aired during the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson's halftime ""wardrobe malfunction"" overshadowed Cialis. In January 2006, the Cialis ads were tweaked, adding a doctor on screen to describe side effects and only running ads where more than 90 percent of the audience are adults, effectively ending Super Bowl ads. In 2004, Lilly-ICOS, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline spent a combined $373.1 million to advertise Cialis, Viagra, and Levitra respectively. Cialis has sponsored many sporting events, including the America's Cup and the PGA Tour, once being title sponsor of the PGA Tour Western Open tournament. === Economics === In Australia, tadalafil is subsidized through the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) for patients with a specific accepted war- or service-related disability. In the US, a generic version of tadalafil is available. While some health insurance providers cover at least part of the cost (typically limiting the number of doses covered per month), many providers, including those operating under Medicare Part D, do not cover the cost of medications prescribed for erectile dysfunction. In the UK, a generic version of tadalafil became available in November 2017, reducing its price per pill, and is available through the NHS. In China, CMOAPI is the largest manufacturer of Tadalafil powder. == Research == Tadalafil is being studied for treating Peyronie's disease. == References ==",Cialis,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.179073458653875e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003405229654163122)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/cialis?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='Everything to Know About Cialis: Use, Effectiveness, and Safety', type='url_citation', url='https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/cialis?utm_source=openai')])"

It can be formulated as the pivoxil prodrug adefovir dipivoxil. == Uses == It is used for treatment of hepatitis B. Trials of adefovir in patients with HIV have not shown any clear benefits. == History == Adefovir was invented in the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic by Antonín Holý, and the drug was developed by Gilead Sciences for HIV with the brand name Preveon. However, in November 1999, an expert panel advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to approve the drug due to concerns about the severity and frequency of kidney toxicity when dosed at 60 or 120 mg. The FDA followed that advice, refusing to approve adefovir as a treatment for HIV. Gilead Sciences discontinued its development for HIV treatment in December 1999, but continued to develop the drug for hepatitis B (HBV), where it is effective with a much lower dose of 10 mg. FDA approval for use in the treatment of hepatitis B was granted on September 20, 2002, and adefovir is sold for this indication under the brand name Hepsera. Adefovir became an approved treatment for HBV in the European Union in March 2003. == Mechanism of action == Adefovir works by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for the HBV to reproduce in the body. It is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (primarily ALT) or histologically active disease. The main benefit of adefovir over lamivudine (the first NRTI approved for the treatment of HBV) is that it takes a much longer period of time for the virus to develop resistance to it.

3502,"('Lomibuvir', 'Cis-lomibuvir', 'Lomibuvir (vx-222)', 'Lomibuvir (vx-222, vch-222)', 'Lomibuvir [usan:inn]')",Medical," To investigate in this phase 2a study (ZENITH) the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of VX-222, a selective, non-nucleoside inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase, combined with various telaprevir-based regimens for treatment of genotype 1 HCV. In total, 152 treatment-naive patients received VX-222+telaprevir ('DUAL' regimen; n=47), with ribavirin ('TRIPLE' regimen; n=46), or with peginterferon+ribavirin ('QUAD' regimen; n=59) for 12 weeks. Patients with detectable HCV RNA at weeks 2 and/or 8 received peginterferon+ribavirin for 24 (DUAL and TRIPLE) or 12 (QUAD) additional weeks. VX-222 (100 or 400 mg twice daily) was well tolerated, with an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events observed with the higher dose. Across VX-222 400-mg twice-daily regimens, the QUAD was associated with the highest frequency of grade 3/4 adverse events. The DUAL was discontinued because of high viral breakthrough before week 12. Sustained virologic response (SVR) 24 weeks after end of treatment (SVR24), including patients treated with 12 or 24 additional weeks of peginterferon+ribavirin, was 67% for TRIPLE (VX-222 400 mg twice daily) and 79 and 90% for QUAD (VX-222 100 and 400 mg twice daily, respectively). These results provide valuable information regarding the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of telaprevir combined with a non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, as dual therapy or with ribavirin without or with peginterferon. Telaprevir and VX-222, alone or with ribavirin without or with peginterferon, were generally well tolerated, with improved tolerability without peginterferon. SVR24 rates achieved with TRIPLE and QUAD regimens containing telaprevir and VX-222 were comparable to those observed with telaprevir-based therapy. VX-222, a thiophene-2-carboxylic acid derivative, is a selective nonnucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, VX-222 demonstrated effective antiviral efficacy, with substantial reductions in plasma HCV RNA in patients chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV. To characterize the potential for selection of VX-222-resistant variants in HCV-infected patients, the HCV NS5B gene was sequenced at baseline and during and after 3 days of VX-222 dosing (monotherapy) in a phase 1 study. Variants with the substitutions L419C/I/M/P/S/V, R422K, M423I/T/V, I482L/N/T, A486S/T/V, and V494A were selected during VX-222 dosing, and their levels declined over time after the end of dosing. Phenotypic analysis of these variants was conducted using HCV replicons carrying site-directed mutations. Of the 17 variants, 14 showed reduced susceptibility to VX-222 compared with the wild type, with the L419C/S and R422K variants having higher levels of resistance (>200-fold) than the rest of the variants (6.8- to 76-fold). The M423I and A486S variants remained susceptible to VX-222. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) for the L419P variant could not be obtained due to the poor replication of this replicon. The majority of the variants (15/17) were less fit than the wild type. A subset of the variants, predominately the L419S and R422K variants, were observed when the efficacy and safety of VX-222- and telaprevir-based regimens given for 12 weeks were investigated in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients in a phase 2 study. The NS3 and NS5B variants selected during the dual combination therapy showed reduced susceptibility to both telaprevir and VX-222 and had a lower replication capacity than the wild type. The phase 1b study has the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00911963, and the phase 2a study has ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01080222. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with essential functions in viral genome replication and represents a promising therapeutic target to develop direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Multiple nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNIs) binding sites have been identified within the polymerase. VX-222 and ANA598 are two NNIs targeting thumb II site and palm I site of HCV NS5B polymerase, respectively. These two molecules have been shown to be very effective in phase II clinical trials. However, the emergence of resistant HCV replicon variants (L419M, M423T, I482L mutants to VX-222 and M414T, M414L, G554D mutants to ANA598) has significantly decreased their efficacy. To elucidate the molecular mechanism about how these mutations influenced the drug binding mode and decreased drug efficacy, we studied the binding modes of VX-222 and ANA598 to wild-type and mutant polymerase by molecular modeling approach. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations results combined with binding free energy calculations indicated that the mutations significantly altered the binding free energy and the interaction for the drugs to polymerase. The further per-residue binding free energy decomposition analysis revealed that the mutations decreased the interactions with several key residues, such as L419, M423, L474, S476, I482, L497, for VX-222 and L384, N411, M414, Y415, Q446, S556, G557 for ANA598. These were the major origins for the resistance to these two drugs. In addition, by analyzing the residue interaction network (RIN) of the complexes between the drugs with wild-type and the mutant polymerase, we found that the mutation residues in the networks involved in the drug resistance possessed a relatively lower size of topology centralities. The shift of betweenness and closeness values of binding site residues in the mutant polymerase is relevant to the mechanism of drug resistance of VX-222 and ANA598. These results can provide an atomic-level understanding about the mechanisms of drug resistance conferred by the studied mutations and will be helpful to design more potent inhibitors which could effectively overcome drug resistance of antivirus agents.",Lomibuvir (vx-222),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.848420551046729e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00047600860125385225), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031861516181379557)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([investors.vrtx.com](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hepatitis-c-virus-polymerase-inhibitor-vx-222-reduced-viral?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=169, start_index=6, title='Hepatitis C Virus Polymerase Inhibitor VX-222 Reduced Viral Levels Over Three Days in Phase 1b Trial | Vertex Pharmaceuticals', type='url_citation', url='https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hepatitis-c-virus-polymerase-inhibitor-vx-222-reduced-viral?utm_source=openai')])"

Pre-clinical studies indicate that the compound acts as an activator of the Nrf2 pathway and an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. A phase 3 clinical trial evaluating bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was terminated in October 2012 after patients treated with the drug were found to have experienced a higher rate of heart-related adverse events, including heart failure, hospitalizations, and deaths. An advisory committee meeting of experts voted unanimously that bardoxolone methyl was not effective in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease in Alport syndrome and that its benefits did not outweigh its risks. A Complete Response Letter from FDA stated a similar opinion. == Clinical development == Investigations of bardoxolone methyl have been conducted by Reata Pharmaceuticals in a partnership with Abbvie and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. The UK based company e-Therapeutics has announced in late 2020 the possible development of Bardoxolone for anti-viral treatment of COVID-19(Coronavirus), and announced a possible phase 3 program to follow (https://www.etherapeutics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RNAi-Press-Release.pdf accessed 16 Feb 2021). === Phase 1 === A Phase 1 clinical trial, sponsored by Reata, was conducted to determine the safety profile of and appropriate dosing for subsequent phase II studies, as well as to evaluate antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumor or lymphoid malignancy. Grade 3 reversible liver transaminase elevations were reported. The maximum tolerated dose was 900 mg/day. NQO1 mRNA levels, indicative of Nrf2 pathway activation, were increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tumor biopsies showed decreased levels of NF-κB and cyclin D1. An improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients treated with bardoxolone methyl was noted, and based on this finding it was suggested by the authors that the drug might be beneficial for patients with CKD. === Phase 2 === A Reata-funded, Phase 2 multi-center RCT (BEAM) in patients with moderate to severe CKD and type 2 diabetes reported that eGFR was increased (> 10 ml/min/1.73 m2) in patients treated with bardoxolone methyl for 24 months. An analysis of secondary endpoints showed that approximately three-quarters of bardoxolone methyl-treated patients experienced at least a 10 percent increase in eGFR, and one-quarter of the patients had an improvement of 50%. Adverse events in bardoxolone methyl-treated patients were generally manageable and mild to moderate in severity, with muscle spasm being reported most frequently. In 2014, Reata announced the initiation of a placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study (LARIAT), to assess the effects of bardoxolone methyl in pulmonary arterial hypertension. === Phase 3 === A Phase 3 multinational RCT (BEACON) designed to test the effect of bardoxolone methyl on progression to end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular death in patients with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes was initiated by Reata in June 2011 and halted in October 2012 after bardoxolone methyl-treated patients were found to have experienced a higher rate of heart-related adverse events, including heart failure, hospitalizations, and deaths. A retrospective post-hoc analyses of the Phase 3 data, conducted by Reata, identified prior hospitalization for heart failure and the baseline level of brain natriuretic peptide, a marker of fluid retention, as predictors of heart failure hospitalizations in the BEACON trial. For patients without these baseline characteristics, the risk for heart failure events among bardoxolone methyl- and placebo-treated patients was similar. == Mechanism of action == Bardoxolone methyl is an activator of the KEAP1-Nrf2 pathway in mice.

3506,"('Benzoic acid', 'Dracylic acid', 'Benzenecarboxylic acid', 'Carboxybenzene', 'Benzeneformic acid')","Food, Medical","Benzoic acid () is a white (or colorless) solid organic compound with the formula C6H5COOH, whose structure consists of a benzene ring (C6H6) with a carboxyl (−C(=O)OH) substituent. The benzoyl group is often abbreviated ""Bz"" (not to be confused with ""Bn,"" which is used for benzyl), thus benzoic acid is also denoted as BzOH, since the benzoyl group has the formula –C6H5CO. It is the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. The name is derived from gum benzoin, which was for a long time its only source. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. Salts of benzoic acid are used as food preservatives. Benzoic acid is an important precursor for the industrial synthesis of many other organic substances. The salts and esters of benzoic acid are known as benzoates (). == History == Benzoic acid was discovered in the sixteenth century. The dry distillation of gum benzoin was first described by Nostradamus (1556), and then by Alexius Pedemontanus (1560) and Blaise de Vigenère (1596). Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler determined the composition of benzoic acid. These latter also investigated how hippuric acid is related to benzoic acid. In 1875 Salkowski discovered the antifungal properties of benzoic acid, which explains the preservation of benzoate-containing cloudberry fruits. == Production == === Industrial preparations === Benzoic acid is produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen. The process is catalyzed by cobalt or manganese naphthenates. The process uses abundant materials, and proceeds in high yield. The first industrial process involved the reaction of benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced synthetically. === Laboratory synthesis === Benzoic acid is cheap and readily available, so the laboratory synthesis of benzoic acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical value. It is a common undergraduate preparation. Benzoic acid can be purified by recrystallization from water because of its high solubility in hot water and poor solubility in cold water. The avoidance of organic solvents for the recrystallization makes this experiment particularly safe. This process usually gives a yield of around 65%. ==== By hydrolysis ==== Like other nitriles and amides, benzonitrile and benzamide can be hydrolyzed to benzoic acid or its conjugate base in acid or basic conditions. ==== From Grignard reagent ==== Bromobenzene can be converted to benzoic acid by ""carboxylation"" of the intermediate phenylmagnesium bromide. This synthesis offers a convenient exercise for students to carry out a Grignard reaction, an important class of carbon–carbon bond forming reaction in organic chemistry. ==== Oxidation of benzyl compounds ==== Benzyl alcohol and benzyl chloride and virtually all benzyl derivatives are readily oxidized to benzoic acid. == Uses == Benzoic acid is mainly consumed in the production of phenol by oxidative decarboxylation at 300−400 °C: C6H5CO2H + ½ O2 → C6H5OH + CO2 The temperature required can be lowered to 200 °C by the addition of catalytic amounts of copper(II) salts. The phenol can be converted to cyclohexanol, which is a starting material for nylon synthesis. === Precursor to plasticizers === Benzoate plasticizers, such as the glycol-, diethyleneglycol-, and triethyleneglycol esters, are obtained by transesterification of methyl benzoate with the corresponding diol. These plasticizers, which are used similarly to those derived from terephthalic acid ester, represent alternatives to phthalates. === Precursor to sodium benzoate and related preservatives === Benzoic acid and its salts are used as food preservatives, represented by the E numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Benzoic acid, benzoates and their derivatives are used as preservatives for acidic foods and beverages such as citrus fruit juices (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) and other acidified foods. Typical concentrations of benzoic acid as a preservative in food are between 0.05 and 0.1%. Foods in which benzoic acid may be used and maximum levels for its application are controlled by local food laws. Concern has been expressed that benzoic acid and its salts may react with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small quantities of carcinogenic benzene. === Medicinal === Benzoic acid is a constituent of Whitfield's ointment which is used for the treatment of fungal skin diseases such as ringworm and athlete's foot. As the principal component of gum benzoin, benzoic acid is also a major ingredient in both tincture of benzoin and Friar's balsam. Such products have a long history of use as topical antiseptics and inhalant decongestants. Benzoic acid was used as an expectorant, analgesic, and antiseptic in the early 20th century. === Niche and laboratory uses === In teaching laboratories, benzoic acid is a common standard for calibrating a bomb calorimeter. == Biology and health effects == Benzoic acid occurs naturally as do its esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts are found in most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several Vaccinium species (e.g., cranberry, V. vitis macrocarpon; bilberry, V. myrtillus) contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus Nectria galligena. Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) or Asian bull elephants (Elephas maximus). Gum benzoin contains up to 20% of benzoic acid and 40% benzoic acid esters. In terms of its biosynthesis, benzoate is produced in plants from cinnamic acid. A pathway has been identified from phenol via 4-hydroxybenzoate. == Reactions == Reactions of benzoic acid can occur at either the aromatic ring or at the carboxyl group. === Aromatic ring === Electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction will take place mainly in 3-position due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic group; i.e. benzoic acid is meta directing. === Carboxyl group === Reactions typical for carboxylic acids apply also to benzoic acid. Benzoate esters are the product of the acid catalysed reaction with alcohols. Benzoic acid amides are usually prepared from benzoyl chloride. Dehydration to benzoic anhydride is induced with acetic anhydride or phosphorus pentoxide. Highly reactive acid derivatives such as acid halides are easily obtained by mixing with halogenation agents like phosphorus chlorides or thionyl chloride. Orthoesters can be obtained by the reaction of alcohols under acidic water free conditions with benzonitrile. Reduction to benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol is possible using DIBAL-H, LiAlH4 or sodium borohydride. Decarboxylation to benzene may be effected by heating in quinoline in the presence of copper salts. Hunsdiecker decarboxylation can be achieved by heating the silver salt. == Safety and mammalian metabolism == It is excreted as hippuric acid. Benzoic acid is metabolized by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA, which is then metabolized by glycine N-acyltransferase into hippuric acid. Humans metabolize toluene which is also excreted as hippuric acid. For humans, the World Health Organization's International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) suggests a provisional tolerable intake would be 5 mg/kg body weight per day. Cats have a significantly lower tolerance against benzoic acid and its salts than rats and mice. Lethal dose for cats can be as low as 300 mg/kg body weight. The oral LD50 for rats is 3040 mg/kg, for mice it is 1940–2263 mg/kg. In Taipei, Taiwan, a city health survey in 2010 found that 30% of dried and pickled food products had benzoic acid. == See also == Nicotinic acid – Organic compound and a form of vitamin B3 == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0103 SIDS Initial Assessment Report for Benzoic Acid from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ChemicalLand",Carboxybenzene,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.2027682214975357), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.6486111283302307), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00012368128227535635), (' MED', -0.04874008893966675), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.17617268860340118), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -6.329813186312094e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.2046641707420349), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.003183774882927537), ('ĠMED', -0.002224234864115715), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0791078507900238)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO; ', [])"

3508,"('Dimercaprol', 'Dithioglycerol', 'Dithioglycerine', 'Dicaptol', 'Sulfactin')",Medical,"Dimercaprol, also called British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication used to treat acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead. It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, although the evidence for those uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended for people with peanut allergies as it is typically formulated as a suspension in peanut oil. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol is a chelator and works by binding with heavy metals. It has a very pungent odor. Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Dimercaprol has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning, and it is an essential drug. It is also used as an antidote to the chemical weapon Lewisite. Nonetheless, because it can have serious adverse effects, researchers have also pursued development of less toxic analogues, such as succimer. Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up inside the liver and other tissues. Dimercaprol is a copper chelating agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat Wilson's disease. Dimercaprol also shows effectiveness against snakebite by potently antagonizing the activity of Zn2+-dependent snake venom metalloproteinases in vitro. == Mechanism of action == Arsenic and some other heavy metals act by chelating with adjacent thiol residues on metabolic enzymes, creating a chelate complex that inhibits the affected enzyme's activity. Dimercaprol competes with the thiol groups for binding the metal ion, which is then excreted in the urine. Dimercaprol is itself toxic, with a narrow therapeutic range and a tendency to concentrate arsenic in some organs. Other drawbacks include the need to administer it by painful intramuscular injection Serious side effects include nephrotoxicity and hypertension. Dimercaprol has been found to form stable chelates in vivo with many other metals including inorganic mercury, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, gold, and nickel. However, it is not necessarily the treatment of choice for toxicity to these metals. Dimercaprol has been used as an adjunct in the treatment of the acute encephalopathy of lead toxicity. It is a potentially toxic drug, and its use may be accompanied by multiple side effects. Although treatment with dimercaprol will increase the excretion of cadmium, there is a concomitant increase in renal cadmium concentration, so that its use in case of cadmium toxicity is to be avoided. It does, however, remove inorganic mercury from the kidneys; but is not useful in the treatment of alkylmercury or phenylmercury toxicity. Dimercaprol also enhances the toxicity of selenium and tellurium, so it is not to be used to remove these elements from the body. == History == The original name of dimercaprol reflects its origins as a compound secretly developed by British biochemists at Oxford University in the beginning of the World War II, with the first synthesis in July 1940 as an antidote for lewisite, a now-obsolete arsenic-based chemical warfare agent. == See also == 2,3-Dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid Dimercaptosuccinic acid DMSA scan EDTA Heavy metal poisoning Penicillamine == References == == External links == ""Dimercaprol"".

Its molecular formula is CH3(CH2)13CO2H. It is a colorless solid. A laboratory preparation involves permanganate oxidation of 1-hexadecene (CH3(CH2)13CH=CH2). It is one of the most common odd-chain fatty acids, although it is rare in nature. Pentadecylic acid is found primarily in dairy fat, as well as in ruminant meat and some fish and plants. The butterfat in cow milk is its major dietary source, comprising 1.2% of cow milk fat.

3510,"('Pyrogallol', 'Benzene-1,2,3-triol', 'Pyrogallic acid', 'Fourrine pg', 'Fouramine brown ap')","Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Pyrogallol is an organic compound with the formula C6H3(OH)3. It is a water-soluble, white solid although samples are typically brownish because of its sensitivity toward oxygen. It is one of three isomers of benzenetriols. == Production and reactions == It is produced in the manner first reported by Scheele in 1786: heating gallic acid to induce decarboxylation. Gallic acid is also obtained from tannin. Many alternative routes have been devised. One preparation involves treating para-chlorophenoldisulfonic acid with potassium hydroxide, a variant on the time-honored route to phenols from sulfonic acids. Polyhydroxybenzenes are relatively electron-rich. One manifestation is the easy C-acetylation of pyrogallol. == Uses == It was once used in hair dyeing, dyeing of suturing materials. It also has antiseptic properties. In alkaline solution, pyrogallol undergoes deprotonation. Such solutions absorb oxygen from the air, turning brown. This conversion can be used to determine the amount of oxygen in a gas sample, notably by the use of the Orsat apparatus. Alkaline solutions of pyrogallol have been used for oxygen absorption in gas analysis. === Use in photography === Pyrogallol was also used as a developing agent in the 19th and early 20th centuries in black-and-white developers. Hydroquinone is more commonly used today. Its use is largely historical except for special purpose applications. It was still used by a few notable photographers including Edward Weston. In those days it had a reputation for erratic and unreliable behavior, due possibly to its propensity for oxidation. It experienced a revival starting in the 1980s due largely to the efforts of experimenters Gordon Hutchings and John Wimberley. Hutchings spent over a decade working on pyrogallol formulas, eventually producing one he named PMK for its main ingredients: pyrogallol, Metol, and Kodalk (the trade name of Kodak for sodium metaborate). This formulation resolved the consistency issues, and Hutchings found that an interaction between the greenish stain given to film by pyro developers and the color sensitivity of modern variable-contrast photographic papers gave the effect of an extreme compensating developer. From 1969 to 1977, Wimberley experimented with the Pyrogallol developing agent. He published his formula for WD2D in 1977 in Petersen's Photographic. PMK and other modern pyro formulations are now used by many black-and-white photographers. The Film Developing Cookbook has examples. Another developer mainly based on pyrogallol was formulated by Jay DeFehr. The 510-pyro, is a concentrate that uses triethanolamine as alkali, and pyrogallol, ascorbic acid, and phenidone as combined developers in a single concentrated stock solution with long shelf life. This developer has both staining and tanning properties and negatives developed with it are immune to the callier effect. It can be used for small and large negative formats. The Darkroom Cookbook (Alternative Process Photography) has examples. == Safety == Pyrogallol use, e.g. in hair dye formulations, is declining because of concerns about its toxicity. Its LD50 (oral, rat) is 300 mg/kg. Pure pyrogallol was found to be extremely genotoxic when inserted into cultured cells, but α amylase proteins protect against its toxicity during everyday exposure. == See also == Catechol Gallacetophenone (2,3,4-trihydroxyacetophenone) Gallic acid Syringol == References ==",Pyrogallic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.00258636218495667), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, INFO', [('IN', -0.23015502095222473), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.00539596751332283), ('ĠPERSON', -0.02593879960477352), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.099436753473128e-06), (',', -0.5760291218757629), ('ĠINFO', -0.33556607365608215), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002531684876885265)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -5.872261317563243e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3511,"('Polymyxin b (sulfate)', 'Aerosporin', 'Polymyxin b', 'Polymyxin b1', 'Polymyxin b sulphate')",Medical,"Polymyxin B, sold under the brand name Poly-Rx among others, is an antibiotic used to treat meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. While it is useful for many Gram negative infections, it is not useful for Gram positive infections. It can be given by injection into a vein, muscle, or cerebrospinal fluid or inhaled. The injectable form is generally only used if other options are not available. It is also available as the combinations bacitracin/polymyxin B and neomycin/polymyxin B/bacitracin for use on the skin. Common side effects when given by injection include kidney problems, neurological problems, fever, itchiness, and rash. Injections into muscle may result in significant pain. Other serious side effects may include fungal infections, anaphylaxis, and muscle weakness. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Polymyxin B works by breaking down the cytoplasmic membrane which generally results in bacterial cell death. Polymyxin B was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In the European Union it is only approved to be applied to the skin as of 2015. It is derived from the bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa (formerly known as Bacillus polymyxa). In 2022, the combination of polymyxin B with dexamethasone and neomycin was the 274th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Spectrum of susceptibility === Polymyxin B has been used to treat urinary tract infections and meningitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, respectively. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. Haemophilus influenzae: ≥0.8 μg/mL Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 0.25–1 μg/mL === Endotoxin adsorption === An effective use of polymyxin B is found in patients with refractory septic shock, that is, without positive outcome to the administration of standard treatments (increase in volemia and other antibiotics). The obstacle of the toxicity of polymyxin B is bypassed by extracorporeal circulation with perfusion of venous blood through a cartridge on whose fibers polymyxin B is covalently fixed; in this way the antibiotic exerts its bactericidal function but is not released into the blood since it remains fully attached to the fiber. Through this perfusion the cartridge retains the endotoxin, recognized as the trigger of septic shock. The treatment of the cartridge to polymyxin B (Toraymyxin, medical device designed and produced by the Japanese Toray), takes place in two sessions of two hours each, carried out at a distance of 24 hours. == Mechanism of action == Alters bacterial outer membrane permeability by binding to a negatively charged site in the lipopolysaccharide layer, which has an electrostatic attraction for the positively charged amino groups in the cyclic peptide portion (this site normally is a binding site for calcium and magnesium counter ions); the result is a destabilized outer membrane Fatty acid portion dissolves in hydrophobic region of cytoplasmic membrane and disrupts membrane integrity Leakage of cellular molecules, inhibition of cellular respiration Binds and inactivates endotoxin Relative absence of selective toxicity: nonspecific for cell membranes of any type, highly toxic. Removal of the hydrophobic tail of polymyxin B yields polymyxin nonapeptide (PMBN), which still binds to LPS, but no longer kills the bacterial cell. However, it still detectably increases the permeability of the bacterial cell wall to other antibiotics, indicating that it still causes some degree of membrane disorganization. == Mixture composition == Polymyxin B is composed of polymyxins B1, B1-I, B2, B3, and B6. Polymyxins B1 and B2 are considered major components. These related components are structurally identical with the exception of a variable fatty acid group on each fraction. Results from in vitro studies have shown marginal differences in MIC data when comparing the fractions. == Research application == Polymyxin B is also used to induce envelope stress in order to study the organisms response to such stress.

They are part of the repeating units of lipopolysaccharide O-antigens, of the glycan moiety of S-layer (bacterial cell surface layer) glycoproteins and also of many antibiotics. In the present study, we focused on the elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway of dTDP-alpha-D-Quip3NAc (dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucose) from the Gram-positive, anaerobic, thermophilic organism Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum E207-71, which carries Quip3NAc in its S-layer glycan. The biosynthesis of dTDP-alpha-D-Quip3NAc involves five enzymes, namely a transferase, a dehydratase, an isomerase, a transaminase and a transacetylase, and follows a pathway similar to that of dTDP-alpha-D-Fucp3NAc (dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose) biosynthesis in Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus L420-91(T). The ORFs (open reading frames) of interest were cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. To elucidate the enzymatic cascade, the different products were purified by HPLC and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The initiating reactions catalysed by the glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase RmlA and the dTDP-D-glucose-4,6-dehydratase RmlB are well established. The subsequent isomerase was shown to be capable of forming a dTDP-3-oxo-6-deoxy-D-glucose intermediate from the RmlB product dTDP-4-oxo-6-deoxy-D-glucose, whereas the isomerase involved in the dTDP-alpha-D-Fucp3NAc pathway synthesizes dTDP-3-oxo-6-deoxy-D-galactose. The subsequent reaction steps of either pathway involve a transaminase and a transacetylase, leading to the specific production of nucleotide-activated 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucose and 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactose respectively. Sequence comparison of the ORFs responsible for the biosynthesis of dTDP-alpha-D-Quip3NAc revealed homologues in Gram-negative as well as in antibiotic-producing Gram-positive bacteria. There is strong evidence that the elucidated biosynthesis pathway may also be valid for LPS (lipopolysaccharide) O-antigen structures and antibiotic precursors.

3513,"('Mannose', 'Man', 'Mannopyranose', 'Mannopyranoside', 'Carubinose')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","A man is an adult male human. Before adulthood, a male child or adolescent is referred to as a boy. Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics that result in even more differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, greater height, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition. Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the testicles, sperm ducts, prostate gland and epididymides, and penis. Secondary sex characteristics include a narrower pelvis and hips, and smaller breasts and nipples. Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined men's activities and opportunities. Men often face conscription into military service or are directed into professions with high mortality rates. Many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for men, such as religious circumcision. Men are over-represented as both perpetrators and victims of violence. Trans men have a gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, while intersex men may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male biology. == Etymology == The English term ""man"" is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *man- (see Sanskrit/Avestan manu-, Slavic mǫž ""man, male""). More directly, the word derives from Old English mann. The Old English form primarily meant ""person"" or ""human being"" and referred to men, women, and children alike. The Old English word for ""man"" as distinct from ""wif""/""woman"" or ""child"" was wer. Mann only came to mean ""man"" in Middle English, replacing wer, which survives today only in the compounds ""werewolf"" (from Old English werwulf, literally ""man-wolf""), and ""wergild"", literally ""man-payment"". == Biology == In humans, sperm cells carry either an X or a Y sex chromosome. If a sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes the female ovum, the offspring will have a male karyotype (XY). The SRY gene is typically found on the Y chromosome and causes the development of the testes, which in turn govern other aspects of male sex differentiation. Sex differentiation in males proceeds in a testes-dependent way while female differentiation is not gonad dependent. Primary sex characteristics (or sex organs) are characteristics that are present at birth and are integral to the reproductive process. For men, primary sex characteristics include the penis and testicles. Adult humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many other characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability. Humans are sexually dimorphic in body size, body structure, and body composition. Men tend to be taller and heavier than women, and adjusted for height, men tend to have greater lean and bone mass than women, and lower fat mass. Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during puberty in humans. Such features are especially evident in the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish between the sexes, but—unlike the primary sex characteristics—are not directly part of the reproductive system. Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include: Broadened shoulders; Increased body hair; An enlarged larynx (also known as an Adam's apple); and A voice that is significantly deeper than the voice of a child or a woman. Men weigh more than women. On average, men are taller than women by about 10%. On average, men have a larger waist in comparison to their hips (see waist–hip ratio) than women. In women, the index and ring fingers tend to be either more similar in size or their index finger is slightly longer than their ring finger, whereas men's ring finger tends to be longer. === Reproductive system === The internal male genitalia consist of the testicles, gonads that produce male gametes called sperm, the prostate, seminal vesicles, and bulbourethral glands, accessory glands that partake in sperm health, the epididymides, organs that store sperm cells, and the vasa deferentia and ejaculatory ducts, tubular structures that transfer the mature sperm to the urethra. The external male genitalia consist of the penis, an organ that expels semen, and the scrotum, a pouch of skin housing the testicles. The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen, which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology. Testosterone stimulates the development of the Wolffian ducts, the penis, and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum. Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-Müllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the Müllerian ducts. For males during puberty, testosterone, along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland, stimulates spermatogenesis. === Health === While a majority of the global health gender disparities is weighted against women, there are situations in which men tend to fare poorer. One such instance is armed conflicts, where men are often the immediate victims. A study of conflicts in 13 countries from 1955 to 2002 found that 81% of all violent war deaths were male. Apart from armed conflicts, areas with high incidence of violence, such as regions controlled by drug cartels, also see men experiencing higher mortality rates. This stems from social beliefs that associate ideals of masculinity with aggressive, confrontational behavior. Lastly, sudden and drastic changes in economic environments and the loss of social safety nets, in particular social subsidies and food stamps, have also been linked to higher levels of alcohol consumption and psychological stress among men, leading to a spike in male mortality rates. This is because such situations often makes it harder for men to provide for their family, a task that has been long regarded as the ""essence of masculinity."" A retrospective analyses of people infected with the common cold found that doctors underrate the symptoms of men, and are more willing to attribute symptoms and illness to women than men. Women live longer than men in all countries, and across all age groups, for which reliable records exist. In the United States, men are less healthy than women across all social classes. Non-white men are especially unhealthy. Men are over-represented in dangerous occupations and represent a majority of on the job deaths. Further, medical doctors provide men with less service, less advice, and spend less time with men than they do with women per medical encounter. == Sexuality and gender == Male sexuality and attraction varies between individuals, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispositions, personality, upbringing, and culture. While most men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual. Most cultures use a gender binary in which man is one of the two genders, the other being woman. Most men are cisgender, and their gender identity aligns with their male sex assignment at birth. Trans men have a male gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, and may undergo masculinizing hormone replacement therapy and/or sex reassignment surgery. Intersex men may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male biology. A 2016 systemic review estimated that 0.256% of people self-identify as female-to-male transgender. A 2017 survey of 80,929 Minnesota students found that roughly twice as many female-assigned adolescents self-identified as transgender, compared to adolescents with a male sex assignment. == Social role == === Masculinity === Masculinity (also sometimes called manhood or manliness) is the set of personality traits and attributes associated with boys and men. Although masculinity is socially constructed, some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced. To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate. It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as both males and females can exhibit masculine traits. Men generally face social stigma for embodying feminine traits, more so than women do for embodying masculine traits. This can also manifest as homophobia. Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods. While the outward signs of masculinity look different in different cultures, there are some common aspects to its definition across cultures. In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood. In the late 20th century, some qualities traditionally associated with marriage (such as the ""triple Ps"" of protecting, providing, and procreating) were still considered signs of having achieved manhood. === Relationships === Platonic relationships are not significantly different between men and women, though some differences do exist. Friendships involving men tend to be based more on shared activities than self-disclosure and personal connection. Perceptions of friendship involving men varies among cultures and time periods. In heterosexual romantic relationships, men are typically expected to take a proactive role, initiate the relationship, plan dates, and propose marriage. === Status === Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class. In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status. Many English words such as virtue and virile (from the Indo-European root vir meaning man) reflect this. In most cultures, male privilege allows men more rights and privileges than women. In societies where men are not given special legal privileges, they typically hold more positions of power, and men are seen as being taken more seriously in society. This is associated with a ""gender-role strain"" in which men face increased societal pressure to conform to gender roles. == History == The earliest known recorded name of a man in writing is potentially Kushim, who would have lived sometime between 3400 and 3000 BC in the Sumerian city of Uruk; though his name may have been a title rather than his actual name. The earliest confirmed names are that of Gal-Sal and his two slaves named En-pap X and Sukkalgir, from c. 3100 BC. == Family == Men may have children, whether biological or adopted; such men are called fathers. The role of men in the family has shifted considerably in the 20th and 21st centuries, taking on a more active role in raising children in most societies. Men would traditionally marry a woman when raising children, but in modern times many countries now allow for same-sex marriage, and for those couples to raise children either via adoption or surrogacy. Men may be single parents, and are increasingly so in modern times, though women are three times more likely to be single parents than men. In paternal societies, men have typically have been regarded as the ""head of household"" and held additional social privileges. == Work == Men have traditionally held jobs that were not available to women. Such jobs tended to be either more strenuous, more prestigious, or more dangerous. Modern men increasingly take untraditional career paths, such as staying home and raising children while their partner works. Modern men tend to work longer than women, which impacts their ability to spend time with their families. Even in modern times, some jobs remain available only to men, such as military service. Conscription is overwhelmingly discriminatory, currently only ten countries include women in their conscription programs. Men continue to hold more dangerous jobs than women, even in developed countries. In the United States in 2020, ten times as many men died on the job as women, and a man was ten times more likely to die on the job than a woman. == Entertainment and media == Media portrayals of men often replicate traditional understanding of masculinity. Men are portrayed more frequently in television than women and most commonly appear as leads in action and drama programming. Men are typically more active in television programming than women and typically hold more power and status. Due to their prominence, men are more likely to be both the objects and instigators of humorous or disparaging content. Fathers are often portrayed in television as either idealized and caring or clumsy and inept. In advertising, men are disproportionately featured in advertisements for alcohol, vehicles, and business products. == Clothing == Men's clothing typically encompasses a range of garments designed for various occasions, seasons, and styles. Fundamental items of a man's wardrobe include shirts, trousers, suits, and jackets, which are designed to provide both comfort and style while prioritizing functionality. Men's fashion also encompasses more casual garments such as t-shirts, sweatshirts, jeans, shorts, and swimwear, which are typically intended for informal settings. Cultural and regional traditions often influence men's fashion, resulting in diverse styles and garments that reflect the unique characteristics of different parts of the world. == Education == Men traditionally received more education than women as a result of single-sex education. Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender, is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. In the 21st century, the balance has shifted in many developed nations, and men now lag behind women in education. Men are more likely than women to be faculty at universities. In 2020, 90% of the world's men were literate, compared to 87% of women. But sub-Saharan Africa, and southwest Asia lagged behind the rest of the world; only 72% of men in sub-Saharan Africa were literate. == Rights == In most societies, men have more legal and cultural rights than women. and misogyny is far more prevalent than misandry in society. While one in six male experiences sexual assault, men typically receive less support after being victims of it, and rape of males is stigmatized. Domestic violence against men is similarly stigmatized, although men make up half of the victims in heterosexual couples. Opponents of circumcision describe it as a human rights violation. The fathers' rights movement seeks to support separated fathers that do not receive equal rights to care for their children. The men's movement is the response to issues faced by men in Western countries. It includes pro-feminist groups such as the men's liberation movement, and anti-feminist groups such as the manosphere. == Gender symbol == The Mars symbol (♂) is a common symbol that represents the male sex. The symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of Mars. It was first used to denote sex by Carl Linnaeus in 1751. The symbol is sometimes seen as a stylized representation of the shield and spear of the Roman god Mars. According to Stearn, however, this derivation is ""fanciful"" and all the historical evidence favours ""the conclusion of the French classical scholar Claude de Saumaise"" that it is derived from θρ, the contraction of a Greek epithet for Mars, θοῦρος (Thouros). == See also == Lists of men Men's studies Patriarchy Sexism == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == Helgeson, Vicki S.

3514,"('Zalcitabine', 'Ddc', 'Dideoxycytidine', 'Ddcyd', ""Cytidine, 2',3'-dideoxy-"")",Medical,"Zalcitabine (2′-3′-dideoxycytidine, ddC), also called dideoxycytidine, is a nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) sold under the trade name Hivid. Zalcitabine was the third antiretroviral to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is used as part of a combination regimen. Zalcitabine appears less potent than some other nucleoside RTIs, has an inconvenient three-times daily frequency and is associated with serious adverse events. For these reasons it is now rarely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and it has even been removed from pharmacies entirely in some countries. == Medical uses == Zalcitabine was the third antiretroviral to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was approved on June 19, 1992, as a monotherapy and again in 1996 for use in combination with zidovudine (AZT). Using combinations of NRTIs was in practice prior to the second FDA approval and the triple drug combinations with dual NRTIs and a protease inhibitor (PI) were not far off by this time. In 1992 dideoxycytidine was listed as a specialty drug. The sale and distribution of zalcitabine has been discontinued since December 31, 2006. == Drug interactions == Lamivudine (3TC) significantly inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of zalcitabine to the active form, and accordingly the drugs should not be administered together. Additionally, zalcitabine should not be used with other drugs that can cause peripheral neuropathy, such as didanosine and stavudine. == Adverse events == The most common adverse events at the beginning of treatment are nausea and headache. More serious adverse events are peripheral neuropathy, which can occur in up to 33% of patients with advanced disease, oral ulcers, oesophageal ulcers and, rarely, pancreatitis. == Resistance == Resistance to zalcitabine develops infrequently compared with other nRTIs, and generally only occurs at a low level. The most common mutation observed in vivo is T69D, which does not appear to give rise to cross-resistance to other nRTIs; mutations at positions 65, 74, 75, 184 and 215 in the pol gene are observed more rarely. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Zalcitabine has a very high oral absorption rate of over 80%. It is predominantly eliminated by the renal route, with a half-life of 2 hours. === Mechanism of action === Zalcitabine is an analog of pyrimidine. It is a derivative of the naturally existing deoxycytidine, made by replacing the hydroxyl group in position 3' with a hydrogen. It is phosphorylated in T cells and other HIV target cells into its active triphosphate form, ddCTP. This active metabolite works as a substrate for HIV reverse transcriptase, and also by incorporation into the viral DNA, hence terminating the chain elongation due to the missing hydroxyl group. Apart from inhibiting retroviral reverse transcriptase, ddC inhibits mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, resulting in a dose-limiting toxicity. == History == Zalcitabine was first synthesized in the 1960s by Jerome Horwitz and subsequently developed as an anti-HIV agent by Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Like didanosine, it was then licensed because the NCI may not market or sell drugs. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) thus licensed it to Hoffmann-La Roche. == References == == Further reading ==",Dideoxycytidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.851700214203447e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005679901223629713)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalcitabine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Zalcitabine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalcitabine?utm_source=openai')])"

Shkreli is the co-founder of the hedge funds Elea Capital, MSMB Capital Management, and MSMB Healthcare, the co-founder and former CEO of pharmaceutical firms Retrophin and Turing Pharmaceuticals, and the former CEO of start-up software company Gödel Systems, which he founded in August 2016. In September 2015, Shkreli was widely criticized when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price to insurance companies from $13.50 to $750.00 (USD) per pill. In 2017, Shkreli was convicted in federal court on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. He was sentenced to seven years in prison and up to $7.4 million in fines. In the civil antitrust case, Shkreli was fined a further $64.6 million to be repaid to victims. In May 2022, he was released early from the low-security federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania. He is permanently banned from serving as an officer of any publicly traded company. == Early life == Shkreli was born in Coney Island Hospital in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on March 17, 1983. His parents were Roman Catholic, and he said his religion has been ""a guiding post"" for him, although he does not believe in God. His parents emigrated to the United States from Albania and worked as janitors. His family descend from the Shkreli tribe in Albania. His two sisters, and his brother grew up in a working-class community in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Shkreli was raised Catholic and attended Sunday school as a child. Shkreli attended Hunter College High School. Sources differ on whether Shkreli graduated from Hunter or whether he was expelled before his senior year and received the credits necessary for his high school diploma through City-As-School High School. He ended up in a program that placed him in an internship at Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz and Company when he was 17. Shkreli received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baruch College in 2004. Shkreli told Vanity Fair that he developed an interest in chemistry when a family member suffered from treatment-resistant depression. == Career == During Shkreli's time at Cramer, Berkowitz and Company, he recommended short-selling the stock of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company testing a weight-loss drug. When its price dropped in accordance with Shkreli's prediction, Cramer's hedge fund profited. Shkreli's prediction drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigated Shkreli's knowledge about the stock but was unable to prove wrongdoing on his part. === MSMB Capital Management === After four years as an associate at Cramer Berkowitz, Shkreli worked as a financial analyst for Intrepid Capital Management and UBS Wealth Management. He then started his first hedge fund, Elea Capital Management, in 2006. In 2007, Lehman Brothers sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a 'put option transaction' in which Shkreli bet the wrong way on a broad market decline. When stocks rose, Shkreli did not have the money to cover his losses. In October 2007, Lehman Brothers won a $2.3 million default judgment against Shkreli and Elea, but Lehman collapsed before it could collect on the ruling. In September 2009, Shkreli and a childhood friend Marek Biestek started MSMB Capital Management, which took its name from the initials of the two. Shkreli and Biestek shorted biotech companies, then described flaws in the companies on stock trading chat rooms. On February 1, 2011, in a naked short sale on an account it held with Merrill Lynch, MSMB Capital sold short 32 million shares of Orexigen Therapeutics stock at about $2.50 per share the day after its price plunged from $9.09, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve the drug naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave). The stock price rebounded; MSMB could not cover the position, although it had told Merrill Lynch that it could. Merrill Lynch lost $7 million on the trade and MSMB Capital was virtually wiped out. Retrophin's 2015 SEC Complaint contended Shkreli had created MSMB Healthcare and Retrophin ""so that he could continue trading after MSMB Capital became insolvent and to create an asset that he might be able to use to placate his MSMB Capital investors."" In 2011, Shkreli filed requests with the FDA to reject a new cancer diagnostic device from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals and an inhalable insulin therapy from MannKind Corporation while publicly short-selling both companies' stocks, the values of which dropped after Shkreli's interventions. The companies had difficulty launching the products as a result, although the FDA ultimately approved both. In 2011, MSMB made an unsolicited cash bid for AMAG Pharmaceuticals at a price of $378 million. Matthew Herper of Forbes wrote that the attempted hostile takeover was ""done for the specific purpose of firing the company's management and stopping a proposed merger with Allos Therapeutics. When the merger plans stopped, so did Shkreli."" === Retrophin === Shkreli founded Retrophin (a portmanteau of ""Recombinant dystrophin"") in 2011 under the MSMB umbrella and ran it as a portfolio company with an emphasis on biotechnology, to create treatments for rare diseases. In December 2012, Shkreli was chosen for the Forbes 30 Under 30. The publication regretted it eleven years later, placing Shkreli in its ""Hall of Shame"", a list of ten notably bad picks. Retrophin's board decided to replace Shkreli in September 2014, and he resigned from the company the following month. He was replaced by Stephen Aselage. During Shkreli's tenure as CEO, the company's employees used alias Twitter accounts to make gangster rap jokes and encourage short selling of other biotech stocks. After Shkreli's departure, Retrophin filed a US$65 million lawsuit against him in August 2015, claiming that he had breached his duty of loyalty to the biopharmaceutical company in a long-running dispute over his use of company funds and ""committed stock-trading irregularities and other violations of securities rules."" The lawsuit alleged that Shkreli had threatened and harassed a former MSMB employee and his family. Shkreli and some of his business associates have been under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York since January 2015. Shkreli invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in order to avoid testifying during civil depositions. Shkreli's name is on two patents held by Retrophin for drugs to treat PKAN. In November 2020, Eric Dube, Retrophin's new chief executive, announced the company would be rebranded as Travere Therapeutics Inc. in an effort to further distance the company from Shkreli, and said the company is no longer working on treatments for the disease from which the company takes its name. ==== Views on Shkreli's leadership ==== In July 2017, at Shkreli's criminal trial, Aselage, who was hired by Shkreli in October 2012, and replaced him at Retrophin in 2014, testified ""He's a brilliant intellect, visionary"" but also someone who was called a ""Pied Piper"" and whom Aselege ""worried about not always getting 'straight answers' from"". ==== Thiola price hike ==== In May 2014, Shkreli had difficulty accessing public markets for capital, but received a $4 million series A funding round and a PIPE deal valued at $10 million underwritten by Roth Capital Partners. After obtaining the financing, Shkreli was able to acquire rights to market tiopronin (brand name Thiola), a drug used to treat the rare disease cystinuria, and another drug Chenodal, and subsequently raised the price of each drug substantially, with Thiola being marked up about 20 fold, from $1.50 to $30 per pill (patients must take 10 to 15 pills a day), and Chenodal about fivefold. Retrophin did not lower the price of these drugs after Shkreli's departure. In 2016, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals introduced a lower cost version of Thiola marketed as a compounded drug. === Turing Pharmaceuticals === Shkreli founded Turing Pharmaceuticals in February 2015, after his departure from Retrophin. He launched Turing with three drugs in development acquired from Retrophin: An intranasal version of ketamine for depression, an intranasal version of oxytocin, and Vecamyl for hypertension. Shkreli set a business strategy for Turing: To obtain licenses on out-of-patent medicines, and reevaluate the pricing of each in pursuit of windfall profits for the new company, without the need to develop and bring its own drugs to market. As markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version is expensive, Turing calculated that with closed distribution for the product and no competition, it could set high prices. ==== Daraprim price hike ==== On August 10, 2015, in accordance with Shkreli's business plan, Turing acquired Daraprim (pyrimethamine), a medication approved by the FDA in 1953, from Impax Laboratories for US$55 million. The drug's most prominent use as of late 2015 was as an anti-malarial and an antiparasitic, in conjunction with leucovorin and sulfadiazine, to treat patients with both AIDS-related and AIDS-unrelated toxoplasmosis. The patent for Daraprim had expired, but no generic version was available. The Turing–Impax deal included the condition that Impax remove the drug from regular wholesalers and pharmacies, and so in June 2015, two months before the sale to Turing was announced, Impax switched to tightly controlled distribution. In keeping with its strategy for pricing in the face of limited competition, Turing maintained the closed distribution. The New York Times said that the deal ""made sense only if Turing planned to raise the price of the drug substantially."" On September 17, 2015, Dave Muoio of Healio, an in-depth clinical information website for health care specialists, reported on a letter from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association to executives at Turing, questioning a new pricing for Daraprim. The price of a dose of the drug in the U.S. market increased by a factor of 56 (from US$13.50 to US$750 per pill) overnight. The price increase was initially criticized, jointly, by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association, by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, and soon thereafter by presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump. A subsequent organized effort called on Turing to return pricing to pre-September levels and to address several matters relating to the needs of patients, an effort that garnered endorsements from more than 160 medical‑specialty and patient‑related organizations (as of December 2015, 164 organizations from 31 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico). In response to the controversy, the record label Collect Records publicly ended its business relationship with Shkreli, who had invested in the company. In a September 2015 interview with Bloomberg Markets, Shkreli said that despite the price increase, patient co-pays would actually be lower, that many patients would get the drug at no cost, that Turing had expanded its free drug program, and that it sold half of its drugs for one dollar. He defended the price hike by saying, ""If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don't think that that should be a crime."" A few days later, Shkreli announced that he planned to lower the price by an unspecified amount, ""in response to the anger that was felt by people."" But in late November, Turing reversed course and said it would not lower the price after all. Following a request by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings for details of Turing Pharmaceuticals' finances and price-setting practices in September 2015, the company hired four lobbyists from Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney with backgrounds in health care legislation and pharmaceutical pricing. In addition to lobbyists, Shkreli hired a crisis public relations firm to help explain the pricing decision. On October 22, 2015, Mark L. Baum, CEO of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that his company would provide a combination product containing pyrimethamine (the active ingredient in Daraprim) and leucovorin at ""$1-a-pill"" as a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Daraprim. This product was intended to be used alongside sulfadiazine in the standard protocol to treat toxoplasmosis typically seen in AIDS patients. Baum said, ""This is not the first time a sole supply generic drug – especially one that has been approved for use as long as Daraprim – has had its price increased suddenly and to a level that may make it unaffordable."" He announced the availability of the compounded replacement for Daraprim as a part of a larger corporate program, ""Imprimis Cares."" to make ""novel and customizable medicines available to physicians and patients at accessible prices."" Imprimis began selling its compounded, orally taken formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin at US$99 for a 100 count bottle, essentially a dollar a dose. On November 23, 2015, Turing announced that the company would not reduce the list price of Daraprim, but said it planned instead to negotiate volume discounts of up to 50% for hospitals. Turing issued a statement that it was not as important to cut the list price as to reduce the cost to hospitals, where most patients get their initial treatment. The company pledged that no patient needing Daraprim would ever be denied access. Infectious disease specialists and patient advocates, including Tim Horn of the Treatment Action Group and Carlos del Rio of the HIV Medicine Association, said Turing's actions were insufficient, given that patients initially treated for days at a hospital typically have to continue the treatment for weeks or months after leaving. ==== Vyera/Phoenixus ==== After Shkreli was imprisoned, Turing changed its name to Vyera in 2017 to avoid negative publicity; in 2019, it was called Phoenixus AG. In March 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shkreli ""steers his old company from prison."" Using a contraband cellphone from his prison ward in Fort Dix, New Jersey, Shkreli was effectively directing the renamed firm, and was reported to have terminated the employment of executive Kevin P. Mulleady. After this news was reported in various news outlets, Shkreli was moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn in advance of a subsequent move to a federal prison in Pennsylvania. He was also facing a Bureau of Prisons investigation into his breaking federal prison rules, since federal inmates are prohibited both from running a business from prison and from possessing cell phones. In May 2023, Vyera Pharmaceuticals declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware court, listing between $10 million and $50 million in assets and between $1 million and $10 million in liabilities. The company cited ""declining profits, increased competition for generic drugs, and litigation alleging that Vyera suppressed competition for its most valuable drug, Daraprim"" per Reuters. Shkreli's shares in Vyera had earlier been ordered seized by federal court related to an FTC judgment against him. ==== FTC v. Vyera Pharmaceuticals ==== In January 2020 the FTC filed a case against Vyera ""alleging an elaborate anticompetitive scheme to preserve a monopoly for the life-saving drug, Daraprim"". A settlement was reached in December 2021. According to AP News, the settlement ""requires Vyera and Phoenixus to provide up to $40 million in relief over 10 years to consumers who allegedly were fleeced by their actions and requires them to make Daraprim available to any potential generic competitor at the cost of producing the drug."" Kevin Mulleady ""agreed to a seven-year ban on working for or holding more than an 8% share in most pharmaceutical companies."" === KaloBios Pharmaceuticals === In November 2015, an investor group led by Shkreli acquired a majority stake in KaloBios Pharmaceuticals (OTC Pink Limited: KBIOQ), a biopharmaceutical company based in South San Francisco, California. Shkreli was named CEO of the company and also planned to continue in the role of CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals. After his December 2015 arrest, KaloBios Pharmaceuticals terminated him as CEO. On December 29, 2015, KaloBios filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This followed NASDAQ delisting its shares, and the resignation of two directors. === Gödel Systems, Inc === Shkreli founded Gödel Systems in August 2016 as ""a professional software company that aims to be the leading information provider of data, workflow, and communications solutions for financial, law, and scientific professionals."" By February 2017, Gödel Systems was looking to raise $1 million through a debt offering, and had raised $50,000 out of the $1 million in debt it began issuing in mid-January 2017, according to regulatory filings. Ralph Holzmann, a former senior engineer at Twitter, is the firm's chief technology officer. === Druglike and Martin Shkreli Inu coin === Following his release from prison, in 2022, a planned software platform named Druglike controlled by Shkreli was announced with a stated aim of supporting the development of new pharmaceutical drugs. A related cryptocurrency project, the Martin Shkreli Inu coin, had been launched but in August lost 90% of its value (recovering shortly afterwards to a 55% loss) after an account believed to belong to Shkreli sold its Inu coin holdings. An account believed to belong to Shkreli claimed, in explanation, to have been hacked. == Testimony before Congress == Shkreli was subpoenaed to appear before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives to answer questions about the Daraprim price increase. Shkreli's efforts to quash the subpoena were unsuccessful. On February 4, 2016, Shkreli appeared before the House committee, along with Nancy Retzlaff, the Chief Commercial Officer of Turing, and Howard B. Schiller, the interim CEO of Valeant. Accompanied by his attorney Benjamin Brafman, Shkreli invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to every question from committee members except for two: one from Representative Trey Gowdy to confirm the pronunciation of his last name, and another from Representative Elijah Cummings to affirm he was listening. Shkreli also refused to answer even seemingly trivial questions outside the subject matter of the hearing, including those pertaining to his purchase of a Wu-Tang Clan album. Following Cummings's rebuke of Shkreli, Chairman Jason Chaffetz dismissed Shkreli from the hearing. == Criminal conviction == === Investigation and charges === On December 17, 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the FBI after a federal indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York was filed, charging him with securities fraud. The charges were filed after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin. U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said, ""Shkreli essentially ran his company like a Ponzi scheme where he used each subsequent company to pay off defrauded investors from the prior company."" Federal prosecutors said that Shkreli and co-defendant, Evan Greebel, ""engaged in multiple schemes to ensnare investors through a web of lies and deceit."" In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Shkreli said that he was targeted by law enforcement for his price hikes of the drug Daraprim and his flamboyant personality. In early 2016, Shkreli retained criminal defense attorney Benjamin Brafman to defend him. Due to Shkreli's notoriety and overwhelmingly negative public opinion, it was difficult to select an unbiased jury. At his 2017 trial, Shkreli argued that none of his investors actually lost money (some actually turned a profit) and thus his actions did not constitute a crime. Shkreli's frequent criticisms of the federal prosecutors in New York's Eastern District, whom he called ""junior varsity"" compared to their counterparts in the Southern District across the East River, both on his Facebook streaming video feed and in the hallways of the courthouse, led those prosecutors to request that judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto issue a gag order to prevent what they called a ""campaign of disruption"". Brafman said in response that his client was responding to baiting from the media and was also suffering from extreme anxiety because of his situation. Matsumoto ordered Shkreli not to speak with reporters, either in the courthouse or its immediate vicinity. === Trial, conviction, and sentencing === On August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and not guilty on five other counts which included wire fraud. Shkreli said he was delighted with the outcome and described his prosecution as ""a witch hunt of epic proportions"". On September 13, 2017, his bail was revoked following a Facebook post offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair which the judge perceived as solicitation to assault, which is not protected under the First Amendment. Shkreli's post was preceded by others that suggested he might have plans to clone Hillary Clinton. Shkreli said that his post was satire, and his lawyer described it as tasteless but not a threat. Shkreli edited the post to add a disclaimer that it was satire, and later said he did this minutes after publication. Shkreli apologized for the post. He was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn while awaiting sentencing. On March 9, 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison. During his sentencing, Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto said Shkreli seemed ""genuinely remorseful"" regarding his ""egregious multitude of lies"" but faulted him for having ""repeatedly minimized"" his misconduct. Shkreli, who cried as he gave his statement to the court, stated ""I was never motivated by money."" In 2019, Shkreli lost his appeal; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously affirmed the conviction in a seven-page ruling. The original judgment remained in effect: Shkreli was required to continue to serve his seven-year sentence and forfeit more than $7.3 million in assets. === Forfeiture of assets === On March 5, 2018, Shkreli was ordered to forfeit nearly $7.4 million in assets. The court ordered that if Shkreli had insufficient cash to fulfill the forfeiture order, his assets, including a piece of art by Pablo Picasso, would be sold to do so. Shkreli purchased the 31-track Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin (of which a single copy exists) at an auction in 2015 for around $2 million, as well as the then-unreleased Lil Wayne album Tha Carter V. In April 2018, he was ordered to pay $388,000 in restitution. In July 2021, the United States government auctioned off the Wu-Tang Clan album bought by Shkreli to PleasrDAO for $4 million USD. Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, the acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said ""Shkreli has been held accountable and paid the price for lying and stealing from investors to enrich himself"", and ""With today's sale of this one-of-a-kind album, his payment of the forfeiture is now complete."" === Incarceration === Shkreli was federal inmate number 87850-053 and was first held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, prior to being transferred to federal prison. On March 27, 2018, it was reported that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto agreed to recommend Shkreli serve his prison sentence at the minimum-security federal camp at USP Canaan, which he had previously requested. On April 18, 2018, Shkreli was transferred from Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, to FCI Fort Dix (a low-security facility) after his request to serve at Canaan was denied. Shkreli was later transferred to FCC Allenwood. On September 6, 2019, several media outlets reported that Shkreli had leveled a lawsuit in a Brooklyn court claiming he had been fraudulently persuaded by a former investor in his Elea Capital fund to sign a promissory note that ""left him owing $420,000 to the man's father."" Also in 2019, he was transferred to solitary confinement for a time, after prison authorities discovered he was using a contraband smartphone to conduct business from prison. While incarcerated, he began a relationship with reporter Christie Smythe, leading to their engagement during his imprisonment. Shkreli asked the court for compassionate release in April 2020, saying that he should be allowed to live at the New York City apartment of his then-fiancée (later identified as former Bloomberg reporter Christie Smythe) and that his firm needed him to develop a remedy for COVID-19. Judge Matsumoto denied the request and said it was another instance of ""delusional self-aggrandizing behavior"" by Shkreli. === Release === On May 18, 2022, Shkreli was released from the Allenwood prison and transferred to a Bureau of Prisons halfway house; according to Shkreli's lawyer Brafman, Shkreli was released after ""completing all programs that allowed for his prison sentence to be shortened."" He lived in the halfway house until September 2022; after his release, he lived with his sister in Queens and earned $2,500 per month as a consultant for a small law firm. Shkreli wrote that he did the consulting ""as a favor, to a friend"" and did not ""live on $2,500 a month"" but rather had an additional salary in a ""main day job"" for an unlisted position at DL Software, as well as income from other software ventures. == Civil penalties and industry bans == In December 2016, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance issued a tax warrant against Shkreli for $1.26 million for unpaid taxes. He made partial payments and the State recovered another $134,500 from the auctioning off of various assets seized from Shkreli; these included an Enigma machine for $65,000, a manuscript signed by Isaac Newton, and letters from Charles Darwin and Ada Lovelace. In April 2018, New York's attorney general asked Judge Matsumoto for priority on more than $480,000 out of the $7.4 million in assets forfeited to the federal government, arguing that the state had priority over the federal government's claims for Shkreli's forfeited assets. In April 2018, Shkreli agreed to a Securities and Exchange Commission order banning him from the securities industry in exchange for settlement of the SEC administrative action against him; Shkreli is eligible to apply for readmission to the industry. In 2020, the Federal Trade Commission and seven states—California, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia—filed a civil lawsuit against Shkreli. A seven-day bench trial was held in December 2021. In January 2022, Judge Denise Cote of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a lengthy opinion and order directing Shkreli to return $64.6 million in wrongfully obtained profits (disgorgement); the money is to be distributed to victims nationwide (via the states that were plaintiffs in the case). The court found that Shkreli had violated federal and state law through an anticompetitive scheme to delay ""the entry of generic competition for at least eighteen months"" and banned Shkreli from the pharmaceutical industry for life. The fine was upheld on appeal by both the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court denied to hear his appeal from that decision. On February 23, 2022, U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered Shkreli to pay a $1.39 million fine for violating securities laws between 2009 and 2014 and banned him from serving as an officer or a director of any publicly traded company for life. == Net worth == In January 2016, Fortune estimated the then-32-year-old Shkreli's net worth was at least $45 million but later updated its profile to reflect that ""[S]ince this article was published the value of Shkreli's E-Trade account had dropped by more than $40 million."" Shkreli leveraged a $4 million E-Trade account for his bail. In June 2017, Reuters reported that Shkreli had reported his net worth at $70 million after being arrested in 2015 and that his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in a hearing before Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, had conceded that his client still owned shares of Turing Pharmaceuticals worth between $30 and $50 million. == Personal life == In December 2020, Shkreli was in a relationship with Christie Smythe, a former reporter for Bloomberg News who broke the news of Shkreli's arrest in 2015. Smythe described their relationship as being ""life partners"". In October 2021, Smythe said the two had broken up but remained friends. In October 2023, Vanity Fair published an article on Madison Campbell, the CEO of Leda Health. In the article, it was revealed that Campbell had been involved in a romantic relationship with Shkreli between February and August 2023. Campbell says the two bonded over being ""healthcare pariahs"" but chose to keep her relationship with him private due to his reputation. Shkreli denied Vanity Fair's request for comment and blocked the author of the article on Twitter. === Hobbies and interests === Shkreli, an avid League of Legends player, began expressing interest in purchasing an eSports team in May 2014. Enemy eSports rejected a US$1.2 million offer from Shkreli. He later founded his own team, Odyssey eSports, and aimed to qualify for the 2015 North American League of Legends Challenger Series, but the team failed. In August 2015, Odyssey merged with another team to become the organization Team Imagine, with Shkreli becoming chairman of the team. During the merger, the organization signed the Dota 2 team Leviathan. Shkreli won an auction for the Wu-Tang Clan album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin after the single copy of the album was sold via Paddle8 on November 24, 2015, for US$2 million. In October 2016, Shkreli said on his Twitter account that he would release the album for free download if Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election and would destroy the album if Hillary Clinton won. He shared the intro and one track, the day after Trump was elected. In September 2017, Shkreli attempted to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on eBay, with the winning bid passing US$1 million. He was incarcerated before the sale could be completed. In March 2018, following Shkreli's conviction for fraud, a federal court seized assets belonging to him worth $7.36 million, including Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The feds sold it at auction in 2021 for an undisclosed amount to raise funds for reimbursing victims. In June 2024, Shkreli was sued by a cryptocurrency collective that bought the album for about $5 million; they claimed Shkreli secretly made digital copies in violation of their deal and distributed them to his friends and followers online. On August 26, 2024, a federal judge ordered Shkreli to turn over all copies, including digital, and report the names of anyone he distributed the music to. == References ==",Retrophin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -4.537180211627856e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10067504644393921), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0017653609393164515)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.320199877838604e-07)])","('INFO; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/retrophin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=110, start_index=6, title='retrophin | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/retrophin?utm_source=openai')])"
3516,"('Pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid', 'Minaline', 'Minalin', 'Pyrrole-2-carboxylicacid', 'Pyrrole-2-carboxylate')","Endogenous, Medical","Minalin, officially the Municipality of Minalin (Kapampangan: Balen ning Minalin; Filipino: Bayan ng Minalin), is a municipality in the province of Pampanga, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 48,380 people. The name of the municipality came from the word ""Minalis"" or ""Minalis la ding dutung"". It was coined when, during the construction of the Sta. Maria Tabungao Church, a flood came and wiped out all the materials or dutung meaning woods and carried them to Santa Monica Parish Church. The town is known for its 400-year-old church, the Santa Monica Parish Church, with its unique design that incorporates pre-colonial architectural motif alongside its European Catholic iconography. Minalin is also known for its ""Aguman Sanduk"" New Year's Celebration, where in which the town's straight men dress up as beauty queens and ride through town on festive floats. The town is also referred to as the ""Egg Basket of Central Luzon"" because of its large-scale production of eggs and chickens, prompting the town to put up the Philippines' first egg festival in 2008. == Etymology == Pansomun (grandson of Prince Balagtas, the ruler of the Kapampangan empire and Luzon), in his will, claimed to be a cousin of Rajah Soliman and Lakandula, the chieftains of Manila and Tondo in 1571 (conquest by Spain). Pansomun, as Christian convert Fernando Malang Balagtas signed in 1589 a will on the Kapampangan territory. Pansomun/Balagtas stated that he was born in Tabungao (Santa Maria, the old location of Minalin). The legend of Minalin's name came from ""minalis la ding dutung, minalis ya ing pisamban"" (the lumber moved, and so must the church). Lumber stocks at Santa Maria for the church construction were carried by floods to a hilly Burol. Capitan Diego Tolentino wrote ""minalis"", thus, the name Minalin evolved. A Malayan settlement of Kahn Bulaun, Prince Balagtas' descendant, also found in the place, beautiful women. The Spaniards called the sitio, ""mina linda de las mujerers"" (a mine of beautiful women), which could also be the source of the town's name. Subsequently, Chinese traders abbreviated the words to ""Minalin"". Minalin's name might have originated also from ""minalis"" (""to move to""). ""Mina"" means mine, a word written on a rock left at the sitio in 1700 by a Spaniard José Espeleta, and ""Lin"", the founder's name. Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) Diego Tolentino wrote Minalin in lieu of Minalis and the Calendario Manual y Guia de Forasteros, 1839 to 1841, spelled Minalin, thus Minalin. In 1860, Minalin was a producer of rice, corn, sugar cane, cacao, indigo (añil) and fruits, including dye, nipa wine, vinegar and mats (petates). == Geography == Originally known as Minalis, it has a land area of about 48.27 km2 (18.64 sq mi), and it is located south-west of the capital city of San Fernando. === Barangays === Minalin is politically subdivided into 15 barangays, as shown below. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios. === Climate === == Demographics == In the 2020 census, the population of Minalin, Pampanga, was 48,380 people, with a density of 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometre or 2,600 inhabitants per square mile. == Economy == Poverty incidence of Minalin Minalin is one of the fastest growing economy in Pampanga despite its propensity to develop flooding. Merchandising, farming and fishing are the usual source of living of Minalenos. The town is known as the ""Egg Basket of Central Luzon"" because of its large scale production of eggs and chickens. Tilapia, shrimp, crabs are also major products of the town. == Government == === Local government === The municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly), Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector. The mayor and vice mayor are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the town's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Bayan) consisting of councilors from the barangays or barrios. === Elected officials === Municipal Officials (2022–2025): Mayor: NOEL PHILIP SIOJO NAGUIT Vice Mayor: RONDON MUSNGI MERCADO Councilors: NAGUIT, SAE SUNGA, DANILO LAGMAN, RAMBO DAAG, QUEROLICO FLORES, FRANCISCO JR. SITCHON, EDGAR SUBA, RICO SOTTO, JOHN NIKKI == Landmarks and attractions == Tourist attractions of the town include its ""Aguman Sandoc"" New Year's Celebration and the 400-year old Santa Monica Parish Church in Barangay San Nicolas. === ""Aguman Sanduk"" Festival (Minalin New Year's Celebration) === One major tourist attraction in Minalin is its ""Aguman Sanduk"" New Year's Celebration in which the straight men of the town dress as beauty queens and ride through town on festive floats - displaying not only humor but also the camaraderie and charity of each member of the community. The celebration has also been referred to as the ""Belles of Minalin"" but Minalin natives prefer to continue calling the event ""Aguman Sanduk"", which translates literally as ""Association of the Ladle"".The event is differentiated from gay pride parades because the event is specifically intended for heterosexual males, and is intended simply to be an act of fun, rather than a statement about gender. This is an avenue where men from all walks of life cross-dress and dare to step out of their statuses. Whether you are a known public figure, a farmer, or a professional, it is with utmost pride that a man from Minalin will dare step out of his status to give joy (pikatulan) to his people. With the continuous celebration of the festival, it is a living proof of how Minaleños value camaraderie (pamakiabe). It is the dare that keeps the community's bond and strengthen the ties of Minaleños. This annual display of beautiful dresses and expertise in women's make up signifies that this town follows the dynamic changes in women's fashion not only in the Philippines but also in Europe, Asia and in other countries. === Egg Festival === On June 4, 2008, Minalin celebrated its fame for producing over a million chicken eggs per day by holding the country's first ""First Egg Festival."" An exhibit of Minalin's egg produce was put up, and a taste test of 10,000 boiled eggs was held. Also, 70 poultry raisers donated 100,000 eggs to Typhoon Cosme's victims in the nearby provinces of Pangasinan and Zambales. Mayor Edgar Flores and President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo graced the exhibit of their egg produce, and a taste test of 10,000 boiled eggs. Also, 70 poultry raisers donated 80,000 eggs to Pangasinan's ""Cosme"" typhoon victims, and 20,000 shall go to Zambales. === La Purisima Concepcion Festival === On 2008, the Sta Maria Barangay Youth Ministry of Barangay Sta Maria spearheaded the said festival. It is in honor of the Image of La Purisima Concepcion which was according to the book, Piaquitan qng Milabas ning Sta Maria, in the year 1609, an image was found placed inside a dried gourd skin (Tabungao in Spanish) floating in front of the chapel they were building. the chairmen of this Festival are: 2019- Noelene Pingol and Jaycee Lagman 2018- Jovaine Ordonez and Kriz Miranda 2017- Roana Kelly Sese and Jaycee Lagman 2016- Roana Kelly Sese and Renalyn Guuiriba 2015- Claud Domme Yambao and Rhysdale Sabado 2014-2013- Mary Donna Mae Mangsal 2012- Romel Zapata 2011- Jerry Canlas 2010- +Liway Manalansan 2009- Aizelle Tubig 2008- Nevil Pineda === Sunset Park === A 3,896 sq.m. Minalin Sunset Park in Santa Rita was inaugurated on July 14, 2018. It is like an esplanade or boardwalk built along ‘Tabun Road’ now Sunset Boulevard, next to a river adjacent to the Minalin Tail Dike. == Notable personalities == Governor Eddie T.

PNC is a distinct subnuclear structure predominantly found in solid tumor cells. The occurrence of PNC demonstrates a positive correlation with malignancy, serving as an indicator of tumor aggressiveness, progression, and metastasis. Various promising preclinical results have led to the clinical translation of metarrestin into a first-in-human trial. This review aims to summarize (i) the current understanding of the structure and function of PNC and its role in cancer progression and metastasis, (ii) key findings from studies examining the effect of metarrestin on various cancers across the translational spectrum, including in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical trial studies, and (iii) the pharmaceutical relevance of metarrestin as a promising anticancer candidate. Furthermore, our molecular docking and MD simulation studies show that metarrestin binds to eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 with a strong and stable affinity and inhibits eEF1A2 more efficiently compared to eEF1A1. The promising results from preclinical studies suggest that metarrestin has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of cancer, heralding a paradigm shift in its therapeutic management. Metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer mortality due to the lack of specific inhibitors against this complex process. To identify compounds selectively targeting the metastatic state, we used the perinucleolar compartment (PNC), a complex nuclear structure associated with metastatic behaviors of cancer cells, as a phenotypic marker for a high-content screen of over 140,000 structurally diverse compounds. Metarrestin, obtained through optimization of a screening hit, disassembles PNCs in multiple cancer cell lines, inhibits invasion in vitro, suppresses metastatic development in three mouse models of human cancer, and extends survival of mice in a metastatic pancreatic cancer xenograft model with no organ toxicity or discernable adverse effects. Metarrestin disrupts the nucleolar structure and inhibits RNA polymerase (Pol) I transcription, at least in part by interacting with the translation elongation factor eEF1A2. Thus, metarrestin represents a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Metarrestin is a first-in-class pyrrolo-pyrimidine-derived small molecule targeting a marker of genome organization associated with metastasis and is currently in preclinical development as an anti-cancer agent. Here, we report the in vitro ADME characteristics and in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior of metarrestin. Solubility, permeability, and efflux ratio as well as in vitro metabolism of metarrestin in hepatocytes, liver microsomes and S9 fractions, recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and potential for CYP inhibition were evaluated. Single dose pharmacokinetic profiles after intravenous and oral administration in mice, rat, dog, monkey, and mini-pig were obtained. Simple allometric scaling was applied to predict human pharmacokinetics. Metarrestin had an aqueous solubility of 150 µM at pH 7.4, high permeability in PAMPA and moderate efflux ratio in Caco-2 assays. The compound was metabolically stable in liver microsomes, S9 fractions, and hepatocytes from six species, including human. Metarrestin is a CYP3A4 substrate and, in mini-pigs, is also directly glucuronidated. Metarrestin did not show cytochrome P450 inhibitory activity. Plasma concentration-time profiles showed low to moderate clearance, ranging from 0.6 mL/min/kg in monkeys to 48 mL/min/kg in mice and moderate to high volume of distribution, ranging from 1.5 L/kg in monkeys to 17 L/kg in mice. Metarrestin has greater than 80% oral bioavailability in all species tested. The excretion of unchanged parent drug in urine was < 5% in dogs and < 1% in monkeys over collection periods of ≥ 144 h; in bile-duct cannulated rats, the excretion of unchanged drug was < 1% in urine and < 2% in bile over a collection period of 48 h. Metarrestin is a low clearance compound which has good bioavailability and large biodistribution after oral administration. Biotransformation appears to be the major elimination process for the parent drug. In vitro data suggest a low drug-drug interaction potential on CYP-mediated metabolism. Overall favorable ADME and PK properties support metarrestin's progression to clinical investigation.",Metarrestin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.531315314830863e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003970073303207755), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023285046219825745)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39768145/?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11674295/?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6176865/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=281, start_index=6, title='Small Molecule with Big Impact: Metarrestin Targets the Perinucleolar Compartment in Cancer Metastasis - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39768145/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=281, start_index=6, title='Small Molecule with Big Impact: Metarrestin Targets the Perinucleolar Compartment in Cancer Metastasis - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11674295/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=281, start_index=6, title='Metarrestin, a perinucleolar compartment inhibitor, effectively suppresses metastasis - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6176865/?utm_source=openai')])"

Coppertone uses a variety of branding, including the Coppertone girl logo and a distinctive fragrance. == Product line == The original product dates to 1944, when pharmacist Benjamin Green invented a lotion to darken tans. The product line has been expanded to include many skin care products, predominantly sunscreens. Coppertone has become the leading sun care brand in the United States, with annual $9 billion in global sales. == Branding == === Coppertone name === The name Coppertone originated from its marketing of suntan lotion, as opposed to sunscreen. === Coppertone girl === In the time when the product was a suntan lotion, the company introduced the character the Coppertone girl, also known as Little Miss Coppertone. In the advertisement, a young blond girl in pigtails stares in surprise as a cocker spaniel puppy tugs at her swimsuit, revealing her tan line. ==== Logo history ==== The original Coppertone logo was the profile of an American Indian chief. In 1953, Tally Embry Advertising in Florida was hired, and their ad men created the concept of the little girl and the pup. An artist named Joyce Ballantyne Brand re-drew the little girl in 1959 when the original artwork was destroyed in a fire. She was then working for Grant Advertising in New York. ==== Coppertone sign ==== A series of mechanical billboards were constructed across the United States, whereon the motorized dog and swimsuit bottoms rocked up and down perpetually. Although most of them are long since gone or have stopped moving, one such billboard of the then Coppertone Girl still stands in Miami Beach — dog, pigtails, swimsuit, bottom, and all. ==== Live models ==== When Joyce Ballantyne Brand redrew the logo in 1959, she purportedly used her daughter, Cheri, as her model, and her drawing closely resembled the original artwork. === Fragrances === Many Coppertone products share a distinctive fragrance. Chandler Burr described it as ""arguably the single greatest work of scent branding ever."" A researcher on human memory used it as an example of an odor that evokes autobiographical memories. Besides for the classic fragrance, the Coppertone product line has expanded to include other scents.

It is a heterocycle characterized as an azole with a 5-membered ring of three carbon atoms and two adjacent nitrogen atoms, which are in ortho-substitution. Pyrazole itself has few applications but many substituted pyrazoles are of commercial interest. == Properties == Pyrazole is a weak base, with pKb 11.5 (pKa of the conjugate acid 2.49 at 25 °C). According to X-ray crystallography, the compound is planar. The two C-N distances are similar, both near 1.33 Å == Substituted pyrazoles == Pyrazoles are also a class of compounds that have the ring C3N2 with adjacent nitrogen atoms. Notable drugs containing a pyrazole ring are celecoxib (celebrex) and the anabolic steroid stanozolol. == Preparation and reactions == Pyrazoles are synthesized by the reaction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with hydrazine and subsequent dehydrogenation: Substituted pyrazoles are prepared by condensation of 1,3-diketones with hydrazine (Knorr-type reactions). For example, acetylacetone and hydrazine gives 3,5-dimethylpyrazole: CH3C(O)CH2C(O)CH3 + N2H4 → (CH3)2C3HN2H + 2 H2O A wide variety of pyrazoles can be made so: === History === The term pyrazole was given to this class of compounds by German Chemist Ludwig Knorr in 1883. In a classical method developed by German chemist Hans von Pechmann in 1898, pyrazole was synthesized from acetylene and diazomethane. === Conversion to scorpionates === Pyrazoles react with potassium borohydride to form a class of ligands known as scorpionate. Pyrazole itself reacts with potassium borohydride at high temperatures (~200 °C) to form a tridentate ligand known as Tp ligand: === 3,5-Diphenyl-1H-pyrazole === 3,5-Diphenyl-1H-pyrazole is produced when (E)-1,3-diphenylprop-2-en-1-one is reacted with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of elemental sulfur or sodium persulfate, or by using a hydrazone in which case an azine is produced as a by-product. == Occurrence and uses == In 1959, the first natural pyrazole, 1-pyrazolyl-alanine, was isolated from seeds of watermelons. In medicine, derivatives of pyrazole are widely used, including celecoxib and similar COX-2 inhibitors, zaleplon, betazole, and CDPPB.

Since Ras signalling is abnormally activated in more than 30% of human cancers, Ras and its downstream signalling pathways are considered good targets for therapeutic interference. Ras is post-translationally modified by the addition of a farnesyl group, which permits its attachment to the plasma membrane. Exploiting this knowledge, a synthetic Ras inhibitor, S-trans, trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; Salirasib), was developed. FTS resembles the farnesylcysteine group of Ras, and acts as an effective Ras antagonist. In the present review, the effect of FTS in combination with various other drugs, as tested in vitro and in vivo, and its therapeutic potential are discussed. As reviewed, FTS cooperates with diverse therapeutic agents, which significantly improves treatment outcome. Therefore, combinations of FTS with other agents have a potential to serve as anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory therapies. The Ras family of genes is involved in the cellular regulation of proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion and apoptosis. The K-ras gene is mutated in over 90% of pancreatic cancer cases. Salirasib (S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalycilic acid [FTS]) is a synthetic small molecule that acts as a potent Ras inhibitor. It is a farnesylcysteine mimetic that selectively disrupts the association of active RAS proteins with the plasma membrane. Animal studies demonstrated that salirasib inhibited tumor growth, downregulated gene expression in the cell cycle and Ras signaling pathways. In a clinical study of salirasib combined with standard doses of gemcitabine, it was demonstrated that the two drugs have no overlapping pharmacokinetics. The salirasib recommended dose was 600 mg twice daily and the progression-free survival was 4.7 months. Future studies will determine whether salirasib adds to the anti-tumor activity of drugs approved by the US FDA for pancreatic cancer. Salirasib, or farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), is a salicylic acid derivative with demonstrated antineoplastic activity. While designed as a competitor of the substrate S-farnesyl cysteine on Ras, it is a potent competitive inhibitor of isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyl transferase. In this study, the antiproliferative activity on six different solid tumor cell lines was evaluated with a series of lipophilic thioether modified salirasib analogues, including those with or without a 1,2,3-triazole linker. A combination of bioassay, cheminformatics, docking, and in silico ADME-Tox was also performed. SAR analysis that analogues with three or more isoprene units or a long aliphatic chain exhibited the most potent activity. Furthermore, three compounds display superior antiproliferative activity than salirasib and similar potency compared to control anticancer drugs across all tested solid tumor cell lines. In addition, the behavior of the collection on migration and invasion, a key process in tumor metastasis, was also studied. Three analogues with specific antimigratory activity were identified with differential structural features being interesting starting points on the development of new antimetastatic agents. The antiproliferative and antimigratory effects observed suggest that modifying the thiol aliphatic/prenyl substituents can modulate the activity.",Salirasib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -5.080963092041202e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.03805629536509514), (' INDUSTR', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0020841085352003574), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03806264325976372)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20528225/,https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-4598-9-256,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25795639/ ', [])"

Terpenoids are terpene that are modified by the addition of a functional group, in this case, an alcohol. Terpineols have been isolated from a variety of sources such as cardamom, cajuput oil, pine oil, and petitgrain oil. Four isomers exist: α-terpineol, β-terpineol, γ-terpineol, and terpinen-4-ol. β-Terpineol and γ-terpineol differ only by the location of the double bond. Terpineol is usually a mixture of these isomers with α-terpineol as the major constituent. Terpineol has a pleasant odor similar to lilac and is a common ingredient in perfumes, cosmetics, and flavors. α-Terpineol is one of the two most abundant aroma constituents of lapsang souchong tea; the α-terpineol originates in the pine smoke used to dry the tea. (+)-α-Terpineol is a chemical constituent of skullcap. == Synthesis and biosynthesis == Although it is naturally occurring, terpineol is commonly manufactured from alpha-pinene, which is hydrated in the presence of sulfuric acid. An alternative route starts from limonene: Limonene reacts with trifluoroacetic acid in a Markovnikov addition to a trifluoroacetate intermediate, which is easily hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide to α-terpineol with 7% selectivity. Side-products are β-terpineol in a mixture of the cis isomer, the trans isomer, and 4-terpineol. The biosynthesis of α-terpineol proceeds from geranyl pyrophosphate, which releases pyrophosphate to give the terpinyl cation. This carbocation is the precursor to many terpenes and terpenoids.

It is an experimental stage drug, not licensed for use on human patients outside clinical trials. Semaxanib is a potent and selective synthetic inhibitor of the Flk-1/KDR vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. It targets the VEGF pathway, and both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated antiangiogenic potential. == Research == In February 2002, Pharmacia, the then-parent of Sugen, prematurely ended phase III clinical trials of semaxinib in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer due to discouraging results. Other studies, at earlier phases, have since been conducted. However, due to the prospect of next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the inefficacy of semaxanib in clinic trials, further development of the drug has been discontinued. A related compound, SU11248 (sunitinib), was further developed by Sugen and subsequently by Pfizer, and received FDA approval for treatment of renal carcinoma in January 2006. When combined with chronic exposure to hypoxia, SU5416 induces severe pulmonary hypertension in mice and rats. This property has been exploited to develop a series of useful, though controversial, rodent models of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the first and best characterized being the Sugen/Hypoxia (SuHx) mouse model. == Synthesis == A Vilsmeier–Haack reaction on 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (1) gives the aldehyde (2).

3534,"('Benzyl alcohol', 'Benzenemethanol', 'Phenylmethanol', 'Phenylcarbinol', 'Benzoyl alcohol')","Food, Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Benzyl alcohol (also known as α-cresol) is an aromatic alcohol with the formula C6H5CH2OH. The benzyl group is often abbreviated ""Bn"" (not to be confused with ""Bz"" which is used for benzoyl), thus benzyl alcohol is denoted as BnOH. Benzyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a mild pleasant aromatic odor. It is useful as a solvent for its polarity, low toxicity, and low vapor pressure. Benzyl alcohol has moderate solubility in water (4 g/100 mL) and is miscible in alcohols and diethyl ether. The anion produced by deprotonation of the alcohol group is known as benzylate or benzyloxide. == Natural occurrences == Benzyl alcohol is produced naturally by many plants and is commonly found in fruits and teas. It is also found in a variety of essential oils including jasmine, hyacinth and ylang-ylang. It is also found in castoreum from the castor sacs of beavers. Benzyl esters also occur naturally. == Preparation == Benzyl alcohol is produced industrially from toluene via benzyl chloride, which is hydrolyzed: C6H5CH2Cl + H2O → C6H5CH2OH + HCl Another route entails hydrogenation of benzaldehyde, a by-product of the oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid. For laboratory use, Grignard reaction of phenylmagnesium bromide (C6H5MgBr) with formaldehyde and the Cannizzaro reaction of benzaldehyde also give benzyl alcohol. The latter also gives benzoic acid, an example of an organic disproportionation reaction. == Reactions == Like most alcohols, it reacts with carboxylic acids to form esters. In organic synthesis, benzyl esters are popular protecting groups because they can be removed by mild hydrogenolysis. Benzyl alcohol reacts with acrylonitrile to give N-benzylacrylamide. This is an example of a Ritter reaction: C6H5CH2OH + NCCHCH2 → C6H5CH2N(H)C(O)CHCH2 == Applications == Benzyl alcohol is used as a general solvent for inks, waxes, shellacs, paints, lacquers, and epoxy resin coatings. Thus it can be used in paint strippers, especially when combined with compatible viscosity enhancers to encourage the mixture to cling to painted surfaces. It is a precursor to a variety of esters and ethers, used in the soap, perfume, and flavor industries. E.g. benzyl benzoate, benzyl salicylate, benzyl cinnamate, dibenzyl ether, benzyl butyl phthalate. It can be used as a local anesthetic, especially with epinephrine. As a dye solvent, it enhances the process of dying wool, nylon, and leather. === Use in health care === Benzyl alcohol is used as a bacteriostatic preservative at low concentration in intravenous medications, cosmetics, and topical drugs. Benzyl alcohol, sold under the brand name Ulesfia, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009, as a 5% solution for the treatment of head lice in people 6 months of age and older. It affects the louse's spiracles, preventing them from closing. These then become clogged with water or mineral oil or other matter and cause the insect to die from asphyxiation. Benzyl alcohol is used effectively for treating lice infestations as the active ingredient in lotion shampoo with 5% benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol is an ingredient used in the manufacture of soaps, topical creams, skin lotions, shampoos, and facial cleansers and is popular due to its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. It is a common ingredient in a variety of household products. == Safety == Sensitization to benzyl alcohol occurs very rarely, mainly in patients with stasis dermatitis. Benzyl alcohol is not considered to be a carcinogen, and no data are available regarding teratogenic or reproductive effects. Benzyl alcohol has low acute toxicity with an LD50 of 1.2 g/kg in rats. It oxidizes rapidly in healthy individuals to benzoic acid, conjugated with glycine in the liver, and excreted as hippuric acid. Very high concentrations can result in toxic effects including respiratory failure, vasodilation, hypotension, convulsions, and paralysis. Benzyl alcohol is toxic to neonates and is associated with the gasping syndrome. == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0833",Phenylcarbinol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.22418633103370667), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.5794274210929871), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.01616000011563301), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -5.860340752406046e-05), (' INDUSTR', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, FOOD', [('IN', -1.0214825868606567), ('DU', -3.3378546504536644e-06), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0002208704245276749), ('ĠPERSON', -0.5817354917526245), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -7.664863369427621e-05), ('ĠMED', -0.20159167051315308), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.018157219514250755), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0011824527755379677), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2520354092121124)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10023870319128036)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/3190,https://www.atamanchemicals.com/phenylcarbinol_u28568/,https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Phenylcarbinol ', [])"

Tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide is an orally bioavailable carbapenem with activity against uropathogenic Enterobacterales, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In this phase 3, international, double-blind, double-dummy trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide as compared with intravenous ertapenem in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide (at a dose of 600 mg every 8 hours) or intravenous ertapenem (at a dose of 1 g every 24 hours) for 7 to 10 days (or up to 14 days in patients with bacteremia). The primary efficacy end point was overall response (a composite of clinical cure and favorable microbiologic response) at a test-of-cure visit (on day 19, within a ±2-day window) in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population. The noninferiority margin was 12.5%. A total of 1372 hospitalized adult patients were enrolled; 868 patients (63.3%) were included in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population (50.8% of whom had complicated urinary tract infections and 49.2% of whom had pyelonephritis). An overall response was seen in 264 of 449 patients (58.8%) who received tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide, as compared with 258 of 419 patients (61.6%) who received ertapenem (weighted difference, -3.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.7 to 3.2). Clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit was observed in 93.1% of the patients in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population who received tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide and 93.6% of patients who received ertapenem (weighted difference, -0.6 percentage point; 95% CI, -4.0 to 2.8); the majority of patients with microbiologic response failures at the test-of-cure visit were asymptomatic patients with recurrent bacteriuria. Secondary and subgroup analyses were supportive of the primary analysis. Adverse events were observed in 25.7% of patients who received tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide and in 25.6% of patients who received ertapenem; the most common adverse events were mild diarrhea and headache. Oral tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide was noninferior to intravenous ertapenem in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis and had a similar safety profile. (Funded by Spero Therapeutics and the Department of Health and Human Services; ADAPT-PO ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03788967.). Tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide is a novel orally bioavailable prodrug of tebipenem, a carbapenem antimicrobial, that binds to penicillin-binding proteins, inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This results in weakening of peptidoglycan, leading to lysis of bacterial cells. Tebipenem displays a broad spectrum of activity against anaerobic, gram-positive, and gram-negative pathogens, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales. In a large phase 3 clinical trial (ADAPT-PO), oral tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide 600 mg every 8 h was shown to be non-inferior to intravenous ertapenem 1 g every 24 h. Overall response at test of cure was 58.8% [264/449] in the tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide group compared to 61.6% [258/419] in the ertapenem group for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis. At the test of cure, clinical cure rates were 93.1% and 93.6% and microbiological eradication was 59.5% and 63.5% with tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide and ertapenem, respectively. The most common adverse reactions associated with tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide are diarrhea, headache, and nausea. As with other carbapenems, tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide is expected to have the potential to decrease the seizure threshold and will likely require renal dosage adjustment for patients with altered renal function due to high renal clearance. If approved in the United States, tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide can serve as a potential oral antimicrobial option to decrease hospital length of stay and prevent hospital admissions due to resistant pathogens.",Guanidinobiotin (hydrobromide),PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0005532711511477828)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5787498950958252), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02648644521832466)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.glpbio.com/2-iminobiotin-hydrobromide.html,https://www.targetmol.com/compound/2-Iminobiotin,https://www.biocompare.com/11119-Chemicals-and-Reagents/18339030-2-Iminobiotin-hydrobromide/ ', [])"
3543,"('Levonorgestrel', 'Norgestrel', 'Mirena', 'Levonova', 'Microval')",Medical,"Levonorgestrel is a hormonal medication which is used in a number of birth control methods. It is combined with an estrogen to make combination birth control pills. As an emergency birth control, sold under the brand names Plan B One-Step and Julie, among others, it is useful within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The more time that has passed since sex, the less effective the medication becomes, and it does not work after pregnancy (implantation) has occurred. Levonorgestrel works by preventing ovulation or fertilization from occurring. It decreases the chances of pregnancy by 57–93%. In an intrauterine device (IUD), such as Mirena among others, it is effective for the long-term prevention of pregnancy. A levonorgestrel-releasing implant is also available in some countries. Common side effects include nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, and increased, decreased, or irregular menstrual bleeding. When used as an emergency contraceptive, if pregnancy occurs, there is no evidence that its use harms the fetus. It is safe to use during breastfeeding. Birth control that contains levonorgestrel will not change the risk of sexually transmitted infections. It is a progestin and has effects similar to those of the hormone progesterone. It works primarily by preventing ovulation and closing off the cervix to prevent the passage of sperm. Levonorgestrel was patented in 1960 and introduced for medical use together with ethinylestradiol in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraceptives are available over the counter (OTC) for all ages. In 2020, it was the 323rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Birth control === At low doses, levonorgestrel is used in monophasic and triphasic formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills, with available monophasic doses ranging from 100 to 250 μg, and triphasic doses of 50 μg, 75 μg, and 125 μg. It is combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol in these formulations. At very low daily dose of 30 μg, levonorgestrel is used in some progestogen-only pill formulations. Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in a number of intrauterine devices including Mirena and Skyla. It is also the active ingredient in the birth control implants Norplant and Jadelle. One of the more common forms of contraception that contains only levonorgestrel is an IUD. One IUD, the Mirena, is a small hollow cylinder containing levonorgestrel and polydimethylsiloxane and covered with a release rate-controlling membrane. === Emergency birth control === Levonorgestrel is used in emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), both in a combined Yuzpe regimen which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The levonorgestrel-only method uses levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (as a single dose or as two 0.75 mg doses 12 hours apart) taken within three days of unprotected sex. One study indicated that beginning as late as 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse could be effective. However, taking more than one dose of emergency contraception does not increase the chance of pregnancy not happening. Planned Parenthood asserts ""Taking the morning-after pill (also known as emergency contraception) multiple times doesn't change its effectiveness, and won't cause any long-term side effects."" The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is, according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation and thickening of cervical mucus. FIGO has stated that: ""review of the evidence suggests that LNG [levonorgestreol] ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling."" In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a change to the label saying it cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Other studies still find the evidence to be unclear. While it is unlikely that emergency contraception affects implantation it is impossible to completely exclude the possibility of post-fertilization effect. In November 2013, the EMA also approved a change to the label for HRA Pharma's NorLevo saying: ""In clinical trials, contraceptive efficacy was reduced in women weighing 75 kg [165 pounds] or more, and levonorgestrel was not effective in women who weighed more than 80 kg [176 pounds]."" In November 2013 and January 2014, the FDA and the EMA said they were reviewing whether increased weight and body mass index (BMI) reduce the efficacy of emergency contraceptives. An analysis of four WHO randomised clinical trials, published in January 2017, showed pregnancy rates of 1.25% (68/5428) in women with BMI under 25, 0.61% (7/1140) in women with BMI between 25 and 30, and 2.03% (6/295) in women with BMI over 30. These values yield an eight-fold reduction in efficacy for women with a BMI over 30 compared to women with a BMI under 25. However, emergency contraceptives remain effective regardless of BMI. === Hormone therapy === Levonorgestrel is used in combination with an estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy. It is used under the brand name Klimonorm as a combined oral tablet with estradiol valerate and under the brand name Climara Pro as a combined transdermal patch with estradiol. === Available forms === As a type of emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is used after unprotected intercourse to reduce the risk of pregnancy. However, it can serve different hormonal purposes in its different methods of delivery. It is available for use in a variety of forms: ==== By mouth ==== Levonorgestrel can be taken by mouth as a form of emergency birth control. The typical dosage is either 1.5 mg taken once or 0.75 mg taken 12–24 hours apart. The effectiveness in both methods is similar. The most widely used form of oral emergency contraception is the progestin-only pill, which contains a 1.5 mg dosage of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills are reported to have an 89% effectiveness rate if taken within the recommended 72 hours after sex. The efficacy of the drug decreases by 50% for each 12-hour delay in taking the dose after the emergency contraceptive regimen has been started. ==== Skin patch ==== Estradiol with levonorgestrel in the form of a skin patch is used under the brand name Climara Pro for hormone replacement therapy in postmenstrual women, treating symptoms such as hot flashes or osteoporosis. The simultaneous delivery of a progestogen such as levonorgestrel is necessary for the protection of the endometrium. ==== Intrauterine device ==== The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a type of long-term birth control that releases the progestin into the uterine cavity. Levonorgestrel is released at a constant, gradual rate of 0.02 mg per day by the polydimethylsiloxane membrane of the device, which renders it effective for up to five years. Because it is inserted directly into the uterus, levonorgestrel is present in the endometrium in much higher concentrations that would result from a LNG-containing oral pill; the LNG-IUS delivers 391 ng of levonorgestrel to the inner uterine region while a comparable oral contraceptive delivers only 1.35 ng. This high level of levonorgestrel impedes the function of the endometrium, making it hostile for sperm transport, fertilization, and implantation of an ovum. ==== Implant ==== Subcutaneous implants of levonorgestrel have been marketed as birth control implants under the brand names Norplant and Jadelle and are available for use in some countries. == Contraindications == Known or suspected pregnancy is a contraindication of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive. == Side effects == After an intake of 1.5 mg levonorgestrel in clinical trials, very common side effects (reported by 10% or more) included: hives, dizziness, hair loss, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, uterine pain, delayed menstruation, heavy menstruation, uterine bleeding, and fatigue; common side effects (reported by 1% to 10%) included diarrhea, vomiting, and painful menstruation; these side effects usually disappeared within 48 hours. However, the long term side effects common with oral contraceptives such as arterial disease are lower with levonorgestrel than in combination pills. Levonorgestrel as a contraceptive intrauterine device has been associated with a slightly higher risk of breast cancer than with non-use in select studies. == Overdose == Overdose of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraoceptive has not been described. Nausea and vomiting might be expected. == Interactions == If taken together with drugs that induce the CYP3A4 cytochrome P450 liver enzyme, levonorgestrel may be metabolized faster and may have lower effectiveness. These include, but are not limited to barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort and topiramate. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Levonorgestrel is a progestogen with weak androgenic activity. It has no other important hormonal activity, including no estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. The lack of significant mineralocorticoid or antimineralocorticoid activity with levonorgestrel is in spite of it having relatively high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is as much as 75% of that of aldosterone. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== Levonorgestrel is a progestogen; that is, an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), the main biological target of the progestogen sex hormone progesterone. It has effects similar to those of the hormone progesterone. As a contraceptive, it works primarily by preventing ovulation and closing off the cervix to prevent the passage of sperm. The endometrial transformation dose of levonorgestrel is 150 to 250 μg/day or 2.5 to 6 mg per cycle. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Due to its progestogenic activity, levonorgestrel has antigonadotropic effects and is able to suppress the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, from the pituitary gland. This in turn, results in suppression of gonadal activity, including reduction of fertility and gonadal sex hormone production in both women and men. The ovulation-inhibiting dose of levonorgestrel in premenopausal women is 50 to 60 μg/day. In men, levonorgestrel causes marked suppression of circulating testosterone levels secondary to its antigonadotropic effects. In healthy young men, levonorgestrel alone at a dose of 120 to 240 μg/day orally for 2 weeks suppressed testosterone levels from ~450 ng/dL to ~248 ng/dL (–45%). Because of its effects on testosterone levels, and due to its androgenic activity being only weak and hence insufficient for purposes of androgen replacement in males, levonorgestrel has potent functional antiandrogenic effects in men. Consequently, it can produce adverse effects like decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, among others. Levonorgestrel has been combined with an androgen like testosterone or dihydrotestosterone when it has been studied as a hormonal contraceptive in men. ==== Androgenic activity ==== Levonorgestrel is a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the main biological target of the androgen sex hormone testosterone. It is a weakly androgenic progestin and in women may cause androgenic biochemical changes and side effects such as decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, decreased HDL cholesterol levels, weight gain, and acne. In combination with a potent estrogen like ethinylestradiol however, all contraceptives containing androgenic progestins are negligibly androgenic in practice and in fact can be used to treat androgen-dependent conditions like acne and hirsutism in women. This is because ethinylestradiol causes a marked increase in SHBG levels and thereby decreases levels of free and hence bioactive testosterone, acting as a functional antiandrogen. Nonetheless, contraceptives containing progestins that are less androgenic increase SHBG levels to a greater extent and may be more effective for such indications. Levonorgestrel is currently the most androgenic progestin that is used in contraceptives, and contraceptives containing levonorgestrel may be less effective for androgen-dependent conditions relative to those containing other progestins that are less androgenic. ==== Other activity ==== Levonorgestrel stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins act similarly in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of levonorgestrel is approximately 95% (range 85 to 100%). The plasma protein binding of levonorgestrel is about 98%. It is bound 50% to albumin and 48% to SHBG. Levonorgestrel is metabolized in the liver, via reduction, hydroxylation, and conjugation (specifically glucuronidation and sulfation). Oxidation occurs primarily at the C2α and C16β positions, while reduction occurs in the A ring. 5α-Dihydrolevonorgestrel is produced as an active metabolite of levonorgestrel by 5α-reductase. The elimination half-life of levonorgestrel is 24 to 32 hours, although values as short as 8 hours and as great as 45 hours have been reported. About 20 to 67% of a single oral dose of levonorgestrel is eliminated in urine and 21 to 34% in feces. == Chemistry == Levonorgestrel, also known as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is the C13β or levorotatory stereoisomer and enantiopure form of norgestrel, the C13α or dextrorotatory isomer being inactive. Levonorgestrel is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is the parent compound of the gonane (18-methylestrane or 13β-ethylgonane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Besides levonorgestrel itself, this group includes desogestrel, dienogest, etonogestrel, gestodene, norelgestromin, norgestimate, and norgestrel. Levonorgestrel acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate are C17β esters of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel has a molecular weight of 312.45 g/mol and a partition coefficient (log P) of 3.8. == History == Norgestrel (rac-13-ethyl-17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone), the racemic mixture containing levonorgestrel and dextronorgestrel, was discovered by Hughes and colleagues at Wyeth in 1963 via structural modification of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). It was the first progestogen to be manufactured via total chemical synthesis. Norgestrel was introduced for medical use as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Eugynon in Germany in 1966 and under the brand name Ovral in the United States 1968, and as a progestogen-only pill under the brand name Ovrette in the United States in 1973. Following its discovery, norgestrel had been licensed by Wyeth to Schering AG, which separated the racemic mixture into its two optical isomers and identified levonorgestrel (13β-ethyl-17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) as the active component of the mixture. Levonorgestrel was first studied in humans by 1970, and was introduced for medical use in Germany as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Neogynon in August 1970. A more widely used formulation, containing lower doses of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, was introduced under the brand name Microgynon by 1973. In addition to combined formulations, levonorgestrel was introduced as a progestogen-only pill under the brand names Microlut by 1972 and Microval by 1974. Many other formulations and brand names of levonorgestrel-containing birth control pills have also been marketed. Levonorgestrel, taken alone in a single high dose, was first evaluated as a form of emergency contraception in 1973. It was the second progestin to be evaluated for such purposes, following a study of quingestanol acetate in 1970. In 1974, the Yuzpe regimen, which consisted of high doses of a combined birth control pill containing ethinylestradiol and norgestrel, was described as a method of emergency contraception by A. Albert Yuzpe and colleagues, and saw widespread interest. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception was introduced under the brand name Postinor by 1978. Ho and Kwan published the first study comparing levonorgestrel only and the Yuzpe regimen as methods of emergency contraception in 1993 and found that they had similar effectiveness but that levonorgestrel alone was better-tolerated. In relation to this, the Yuzpe regimen has largely been replaced as a method of emergency contraception by levonorgrestrel-only preparations. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception was approved in the United States under the brand name Plan B in 1999, and has also been marketed widely elsewhere throughout the world under other brand names such as Levonelle and NorLevo in addition to Postinor. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved Plan B One-Step for sale over-the-counter in the United States without a prescription or age restriction. Levonorgestrel has also been introduced for use as a progestogen-only intrauterine device under the brand names Mirena and Skyla among others, as a progestogen-only birth control implant under the brand names Norplant and Jadelle, as a combined oral tablet with estradiol valerate for menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name Klimonorm, and as a combined transdermal patch with estradiol for menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name Climara Pro. Ester prodrugs of levonorgestrel such as levonorgestrel acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate have been developed and studied as other forms of birth control such as long-acting progestogen-only injectable contraceptives and contraceptive vaginal rings, but have not been marketed for medical use. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Levonorgestrel is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while lévonorgestrel is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known as d-norgestrel, d(–)-norgestrel, or D-norgestrel, as well as by its developmental code names WY-5104 (Wyeth) and SH-90999 (Schering AG). === Brand names === Levonorgestrel is marketed alone or in combination with an estrogen (specifically ethinylestradiol, estradiol, or estradiol valerate) under a multitude of brand names throughout the world, including Alesse, Altavera, Alysena, Amethia, Amethyst, Ashlyna, Aviane, Camrese, Chateal, Climara Pro, Cycle 21, Daysee, Emerres, Enpresse, Erlibelle, Escapelle, Falmina, Introvale, Isteranda, Jadelle, Jaydess, Jolessa, Klimonorm, Kurvelo, Kyleena, Lessina, Levlen, Levodonna, Levonelle, Levonest, Levosert, Levora, Liletta, Loette, Logynon, LoSeasonique, Lutera, Lybrel, Marlissa, Microgynon, Microlut, Microvlar, Min-Ovral, Miranova, Mirena, My Way, Myzilra, Next Choice, Nordette, Norgeston, NorLevo, Norplant, One Pill, Option 2, Orsythia, Ovima, Ovranette, Plan B, Plan B One-Step, Portia, Postinor, Postinor-2, Preventeza, Ramonna, Rigevidon, Quartette, Quasense, Seasonale, Seasonique, Skyla, Sronyx, Tri-Levlen, Trinordiol, Triphasil, Triquilar, Tri-Regol, Trivora, and Upostelle, among many others. These formulations are used as emergency contraceptives, normal contraceptives, or in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. As an emergency contraceptive, levonorgestrel is often referred to colloquially as the ""morning-after pill"". === Availability === Levonorgestrel is very widely marketed throughout the world and is available in almost every country. === Accessibility === Levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraception is available over-the-counter in some countries, such as the United States. On some college campuses, Plan B is available from vending machines. A policy update in 2015, required all pharmacies, clinics, and emergency departments run by Indian Health Services (for Native Americans) to have Plan B One-Step in stock, to distribute it to any woman (or her representative) who asked for it without a prescription, age verification, registration or any other requirement, to provide orientation training to all staff regarding the medication, to provide unbiased and medically accurate information about emergency contraception, and to make someone available at all times to distribute the pill in case the primary staffer objected to providing it on religious or moral grounds. == Research == Levonorgestrel has been studied in combination with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone as a hormonal contraceptive for men. == References == == External links == Media related to Levonorgestrel at Wikimedia Commons",Microval,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.054500666621607e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003536995267495513), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00863331276923418)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007099286303855479), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacycode.com](https://pharmacycode.com/Microval.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Microval - Contraceptives, ATC:G03AC03', type='url_citation', url='https://pharmacycode.com/Microval.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3544,"('Octanoic acid', 'Caprylic acid', 'N-octanoic acid', 'Octylic acid', 'N-caprylic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Caprylic acid (from Latin capra 'goat'), also known under the systematic name octanoic acid or C8 Acid, is a saturated fatty acid, medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA). It has the structural formula H3C−(CH2)6−COOH, and is a colorless oily liquid that is minimally soluble in water with a slightly unpleasant rancid-like smell and taste. Salts and esters of octanoic acid are known as octanoates or caprylates. The name of the related acyl group is octanoyl, capryloyl, or caprylyl. It is a common industrial chemical, which is produced by oxidation of the C8 aldehyde. Its compounds are found naturally in the milk of various mammals and as a minor constituent of coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Two other acids are named after goats via the Latin word capra: caproic acid (C6) and capric acid (C10). Together, these three fatty acids comprise 15% of the fatty acids in goat milk fat. == Uses == Caprylic acid is used commercially in the production of esters used in perfumery and also in the manufacture of dyes. Caprylic acid is an antimicrobial pesticide used as a food contact surface sanitizer in commercial food handling establishments on dairy equipment, food processing equipment, breweries, wineries, and beverage processing plants. It is also used as disinfectant in health care facilities and public places. In addition, caprylic acid is used as an algicide, bactericide, fungicide, and herbicide in nurseries, greenhouses, garden centers, and interiors, and on ornamentation. Products containing caprylic acid are formulated as soluble concentrate/liquids and ready-to-use liquids. Caprylic acid plays an important role in the body's regulation of energy input and output, a function which is performed by the hormone ghrelin. The sensation of hunger is a signal that the body requires an input of energy in the form of food consumption. Ghrelin stimulates hunger by triggering receptors in the hypothalamus. In order to activate these receptors, ghrelin must undergo a process called acylation in which it acquires an acyl group, and caprylic acid provides this by linking at a specific serine site on ghrelin molecules. Other fatty acids in the same position have similar effects on hunger. The acyl chloride of caprylic acid is used in the synthesis of perfluorooctanoic acid. === Dietary uses === Caprylic acid is taken as a dietary supplement. In the body, caprylic acid would be found as octanoate, or unprotonated caprylic acid. Some studies have shown that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) can help in the process of excess calorie burning, and thus weight loss; however, a systematic review of the evidence concluded that the overall results are inconclusive. Also, interest in MCTs has been shown by endurance athletes and the bodybuilding community, but MCTs have not been found to be beneficial to exercise performance. === Medical uses === Caprylic acid has been studied as part of a ketogenic diet to treat children with intractable epilepsy.

Nephrotoxicity is the main dose-limiting undesirable consequence of CsA. Urotensin II (U-II), a novel peptide with a powerful influence on vascular biology, has been added to the list of potential renal vascular regulators. Upregulation of the urotensin receptors and elevation of plasma U-II levels are thought to possibly play a role in the etiology of renal failure. The present study examines this hypothesis by evaluating renal function and histology with regard to the potential role of U-II and its antagonist, palosuran, in the pathogenesis of CsA-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with CsA (15 mg/kg, for 21 days, intraperitoneally) or CsA + palosuran (300 mg/kg, for 21 days). Renal function was measured and histopathology, U-II immunostaining and protein detection with western blotting of the kidneys were performed. Cyclosporine-A administration caused a marked decline in creatinine clearance (Ccr). Fractional sodium excretion (FENa) tended to increase in the CsA-treated rats. Plasma U-II levels decreased in the CsA-treated rats. Cyclosporine-A treatment resulted in a marked deterioration in renal histology and an increase in the expression of U-II protein in the kidneys. Palosuran's improvement of renal function manifested as a significant decrease in serum creatinine levels and a significant increase in urine creatinine levels, resulting in a marked increase in Ccr. Palosuran produced a significant normalization of kidney histology and prevented an increase in U-II expression. Cyclosporine-A-induced renal impairment was accompanied by an increase in U-II expression in kidneys and a contrary decrease in systemic U-II levels. Palosuran improved the condition of rats suffering from renal dysfunction by preventing the decrease in renal U-II expression without affecting the systemic levels of U-II. The protective effect of palosuran in CsA nephrotoxicity is possibly independent of its U-II receptor antagonism. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and fatal disorder that any valuable advance in the management of diseases has crucial importance. The present study aimed to compare the Endothelin1 (ET1) inhibitor bosentan which is regarded as standard therapy with different dose regimens of palosuran which is urotensin-II (UII) inhibitor and explore the discrepancy for mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), UII, ET1 levels, and pulmonary vascular pathology. Seventy rats were randomly divided into seven groups of ten animals each: group 1 (control group) received the vehicle subcutaneously, instead of monocrotaline (MCT) and vehicle; group 2 (MCT group) received subcutaneous MCT and vehicle; and group 3 (MCT + palosuran 30 mg) received subcutaneous MCT and palosuran. Other groups consist of group 4 (MCT + palosuran 100 mg), group 5 (MCT + bosentan 30 mg), group 6 (MCT + bosentan 100 mg), and group 7 (combination therapy). Serum ET1, UII, mPAP levels, and pulmonary arteriolar pathology of different diameter vessels of all groups have been measured and recorded. The ET1 and UII levels of untreated rats (group 2) were significantly higher than the other groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, mPAP levels of group 2 were significantly higher than the other groups (p = 0.001). Finally, 50-125-μm diameter of arteriole wall thickness was found to be significantly thicker in monocrotaline group compared to groups 4 and 6 (p < 0.001). Statistical differences of wall thickness/diameter ratios of arteries and arterioles larger than 125 was found to be significant between group 5, group 6, and the control group (p < 0.001). UII inhibitor is at least as effective as standard therapy bosentan. Findings of this study consolidate that palosuran could be a new future promising therapeutic option in PAH.

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Three dose levels were investigated for PKs, PDs, and safety in sequential groups of 8 subjects each. The plasma concentration-time profile is characterized by rapid absorption and 2 peaks after drug administration. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 25 h. Steady-state concentrations were reached after 4-5 days of dosing. The accumulation factor was approximately 2.5. With increasing doses, a more than dose proportional increase in AUCτ and Cmax was observed. Urinary excretion of unchanged palosuran was below 3%. No consistent effect was found on any of the PD variables. Palosuran was well tolerated in multiple doses up to 500 mg b.i.d.

3549,"('Asiaticoside', 'Centelase', 'Madecassol', 'Asiaticosid', 'Emdecassol')",Medical," Centella asiatica is an ethnomedicinal herbaceous species that grows abundantly in tropical and sub-tropical regions of China, India, South-Eastern Asia and Africa. It is a popular nutraceutical that is employed in various forms of clinical and cosmetic treatments. C. asiatica extracts are reported widely in Ayurvedic and Chinese traditional medicine to boost memory, prevent cognitive deficits and improve brain functions. The major bioactive constituents of C. asiatica are the pentacyclic triterpenoid glycosides, asiaticoside and madecassoside, and their corresponding aglycones, asiatic acid and madecassic acid. Asiaticoside and madecassoside have been identified as the marker compounds of C. asiatica in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and these triterpene compounds offer a wide range of pharmacological properties, including neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-allergic, anti-depressant, anxiolytic, antifibrotic, antibacterial, anti-arthritic, anti-tumour and immunomodulatory activities. Asiaticoside and madecassoside are also used extensively in treating skin abnormalities, burn injuries, ischaemia, ulcers, asthma, lupus, psoriasis and scleroderma. Besides medicinal applications, these phytocompounds are considered cosmetically beneficial for their role in anti-ageing, skin hydration, collagen synthesis, UV protection and curing scars. Existing reports and experimental studies on these compounds between 2005 and 2022 have been selectively reviewed in this article to provide a comprehensive overview of the numerous therapeutic advantages of asiaticoside and madecassoside and their potential roles in the medical future. Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by motor symptoms due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum (STR), alongside neuroinflammation. Asiaticoside (AS), a primary active component with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, is derived from Centella asiatica. However, the precise mechanisms through which AS influences PD associated with inflammation are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to explore the protective mechanism of AS in PD. Targets associated with AS and PD were identified from the Swiss Target Prediction, Similarity Ensemble Approach, PharmMapper, and GeneCards database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify potential therapeutic targets. Concurrently, GO and KEGG analyses were performed to predict potential signaling pathways. To validate these mechanisms, the effects of AS on 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice were investigated. Furthermore, neuroinflammation and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were assessed to confirm the anti-inflammatory properties of AS. In vitro experiments in BV2 cells were then performed to investigate the mechanisms of AS in PD. Moreover, CETSA, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) were performed for further validation. Network pharmacology analysis identified 17 potential targets affected by AS in PD. GO and KEGG analyses suggested the biological roles of these targets, demonstrating that AS interacts with 149 pathways in PD. Notably, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway was identified as a key pathway mediating AS's effect on PD. In vivo studies demonstrated that AS alleviated motor dysfunction and reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-induced PD mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that AS substantially decreased IL-1β release in BV2 cells, attributing this to the modulation of the NLRP3 signaling pathway. CETSA and molecular docking studies indicated that AS forms a stable complex with NLRP3. MDs suggested that ARG578 played an important role in the formation of the complex. In this study, we first predicted that the potential target and pathway of AS's effect on PD could be NLRP3 protein and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway by network pharmacology analysis. Further, we demonstrated that AS could alleviate symptoms of PD induced by MPTP through its interaction with the NLRP3 protein for the first time by in vivo and in vitro experiments. By binding to NLRP3, AS effectively inhibits the assembly and activation of the inflammasome. These findings suggest that AS is a promising inhibitor for PD driven by NLRP3 overactivation. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), an immunosuppressive cytokine, is often elevated in various tumors and inhibits the immune system's ability to combat tumor cells. Despite promising results from TGF-β inhibitor therapies, their clinical efficacy remains limited. This study aimed to enhance the antitumor capabilities of natural killer (NK) cells in the presence of TGF-β by exploring the potential of asiaticoside, a natural compound with established clinical safety. The effects of asiaticoside on NK cells were investigated to determine its potential to counteract TGF-β-induced immunosuppression and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Natural compounds were screened using a Luminex assay to identify those promoting Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion from NK cells. Asiaticoside-pretreated NK cells' cytotoxicity was assessed against K562, OVCAR8, and A2780 cells using organoids from ascites-derived ovarian cancer (OC) cells. In vivo efficacy was evaluated with B16 melanoma lung metastasis and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6 mice, using asiaticoside as a 50 mg/kg injection. The compound's ability to enhance NK cell-driven anti-neoplastic responses was further assessed in an OC murine model. Effects on TGF-β/SMAD pathways and mitochondrial functions were examined through various microscopy and metabolomic techniques. The involvement of the mTOR/DRP1 axis in asiaticoside-mediated restoration of mitochondrial oxidation in NK cells after TGF-β suppression was determined using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the DRP1 inhibitor Mdivi-1. Asiaticoside-treated NK cells retained their ability to suppress tumor growth and metastasis despite TGF-β presence. Asiaticoside downregulated TGF-β receptors 1 (TGFBR1) expression, impaired the protein stability of TGFBR1 and TGF-β receptors 2 (TGFBR2), and reduced SMAD2 phosphorylation, preventing SMAD2 translocation from the mitochondria. This preserved mitochondrial respiration and maintained NK cell antitumor activity. The study concludes that asiaticoside has significant potential as a strategy for ""priming"" NK cells in cellular immunotherapy. By demonstrating that asiaticoside degrades the TGF-β receptor, leading to reduced phosphorylation of SMAD2 and preventing its mitochondrial translocation, thereby maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Meantime, asiaticoside counteracts TGF-β-induced suppression of mitochondrial oxidative and aerobic respiration through the mTOR/DRP1 pathways. The research uncovers a previously unreported pathway for preserving mitochondrial respiration and NK cell functionality. A detailed mechanistic insight into how asiaticoside functions at the molecular level was explored. Its ability to counteract the immunosuppressive effects of TGF-β makes it a valuable candidate for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapies in treating a variety of tumors with elevated TGF-β levels.",Asiaticoside,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.000953502138145268), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.054500666621607e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.00978961680084467), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.5763017535209656), (' FOOD', -0.0010805641068145633)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.01286163181066513), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.005361108109354973), ('ĠPERSON', -0.11485233902931213), ('AL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.3232143828645349e-05), (',', -0.38689562678337097), ('ĠFOOD', -0.02908610738813877), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1269809603691101)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.16025429964065552), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0019286326132714748), (' PERSONAL', -0.005239087622612715), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.47408005595207214), (' MED', -8.77627644513268e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9983323/?utm_source=openai), [exponentbeauty.com](https://exponentbeauty.com/blogs/dose/asiaticoside-skincare-ingredient?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=229, start_index=24, title='Therapeutic properties and pharmacological activities of asiaticoside and madecassoside: A review - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9983323/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=229, start_index=24, title='Asiaticoside (Centella Asiatica): Skincare Ingredient Spotlight | Exponent Beauty', type='url_citation', url='https://exponentbeauty.com/blogs/dose/asiaticoside-skincare-ingredient?utm_source=openai')])"
3550,"('Thioguanine',)",Medical,"Tioguanine, also known as thioguanine or 6-thioguanine (6-TG) or tabloid is a medication used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Long-term use is not recommended. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver problems and inflammation of the mouth. It is recommended that liver enzymes be checked weekly when on the medication. People with a genetic deficiency in thiopurine S-methyltransferase are at higher risk of side effects. Avoiding pregnancy when on the medication is recommended. Tioguanine is in the antimetabolite family of medications. It is a purine analogue of guanine and works by disrupting DNA and RNA. Tioguanine was developed between 1949 and 1951. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Acute leukemias in both adults and children Chronic myelogenous leukemia Inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis Psoriasis Colorectal cancer in mice resistant to immunotherapy == Side effects == Leukopenia and neutropenia Thrombocytopenia Anemia Anorexia Nausea and vomiting Hepatotoxicity: this manifests as: === Hepatic veno-occlusive disease === The major concern that has inhibited the use of thioguanine has been veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and its histological precursor nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH). The incidence of NRH with thioguanine was reported as between 33 and 76%. The risk of ensuing VOD is serious and frequently irreversible so this side effect has been a major concern. However, recent evidence using an animal model for thioguanine-induced NRH/VOD has shown that, contrary to previous assumptions, NRH/VOD is dose dependent and the mechanism for this has been demonstrated. This has been confirmed in human trials, where thioguanine has proven to be safe but efficacious for coeliac disease when used at doses below those commonly prescribed. This has led to a revival of interest in thioguanine because of its higher efficacy and faster action compared to other thiopurines and immunosuppressants such as mycophenylate. == Contraindications == Pregnancy Lactation: The safety warning against breastfeeding may have been a conservative assessment, but research evidence suggests that thiopurines do not enter breastmilk. == Interactions == Cancers that do not respond to treatment with mercaptopurine do not respond to thioguanine. On the other hand, some cases of IBD that are resistant to mercaptopurine (or its pro-drug azathioprine) may be responsive to thioguanine. == Pharmacogenetics == The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible for the direct inactivation of thioguanine to its methylthioguanine base – this methylation prevents thioguanine from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and an increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving thioguanine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of thiopurine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for thioguanine notes that patients who are TPMT-deficient may be prone to developing myelosuppression and that laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. == Metabolism and pharmacokinetics == A single oral dose of thioguanine has incomplete metabolism, absorption and high interindividual variability. The bioavailability of thioguanine has an average of 30% (range 14-46%). The maximum concentration in plasma after a single oral dose is attained after 8 hours. Thioguanine, like other thiopurines, is cytotoxic to white cells; as a result it is immunosuppressive at lower doses and anti-leukemic/anti-neoplastic at higher doses. Thioguanine is incorporated into human bone marrow cells, but like other thiopurines, it is not known to cross the blood-brain barrier. Thioguanine cannot be demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid, similar to the closely related compound 6-mercaptopurine which also cannot penetrate to the brain. The plasma half-life of thioguanine is short, due to the rapid uptake into liver and blood cells and conversion to 6-TGN. The median plasma half-life of 80-minutes with a range of 25–240 minutes. Thioguanine is excreted primarily through the kidneys in urine, but mainly as a metabolite, 2-amino-6-methylthiopurine. However, the intra-cellular thio-nucleotide metabolites of thioguanine (6-TGN) have longer half-lives and can therefore be measured after thioguanine is eliminated from the plasma. Thioguanine is catabolized (broken down) via two pathways. One route is through the deamination by the enzyme guanine deaminase to 6-thioxanthine, which has minimal anti-neoplastic activity, then by oxidation by xanthine oxidase of the thioxanthine to thiouric acid. This metabolic pathway is not dependent on the efficacy of xanthine oxidase, so that the inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the drug allopurinol, does not block the breakdown of thioguanine, in contrast to its inhibition of the breakdown of the related thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine. The second pathway is the methylation of thioguanine to 2-amino-6-methylthiopurine, which is minimally effective as an anti-neoplastic and significantly less toxic than thioguanine. This pathway also is independent of the enzyme activity of xanthine oxidase. == Mechanism of action == 6-Thioguanine is a thio analogue of the naturally occurring purine base guanine. 6-thioguanine utilises the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) to be converted to 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (TGMP). High concentrations of TGMP may accumulate intracellularly and hamper the synthesis of guanine nucleotides via the enzyme Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMP dehydrogenase), leading to DNA mutations. TGMP is converted by phosphorylation to thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP). Simultaneously deoxyribosyl analogs are formed, via the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. The TGMP, TGDP and TGTP are collectively named 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). 6-TGN are cytotoxic to cells by: (1) incorporation into DNA during the synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell; and (2) through inhibition of the GTP-binding protein (G protein) Rac1, which regulates the Rac/Vav pathway. == Chemistry == It is a pale yellow, odorless, crystalline powder. == Names == Tioguanine (INN, BAN, AAN), or thioguanine (USAN).

3553,"('Cefoxitin', 'Mefoxin', 'Cefoxitinum', 'Rephoxitin', 'Cefoxitina')",Medical,"Cefoxitin is a second-generation cephamycin antibiotic developed by Merck & Co., Inc. from Cephamycin C in the year following its discovery, 1972. It was synthesized in order to create an antibiotic with a broader spectrum. It is often grouped with the second-generation cephalosporins. Cefoxitin requires a prescription and as of 2010 is sold under the brand name Mefoxin by Bioniche Pharma, LLC. The generic version of cefoxitin is known as cefoxitin sodium. == History and discovery == Groups of researchers at Merck and Lilly discovered Cephamycin C while looking at penicillin-producing bacteria. This followed their discovery of erythromycin, another antibiotic. Cephamycin C was the first cephem discovered but while it was highly resistant to several beta-lactamases, as is its derivative cefoxitin, it was almost only effective against Gram negative bacteria. The scientists used chemically modified the compound to give cefoxitin, so titled due to its semi-synthetic nature. This new modification broadened its spectrum to include Gram positive bacteria. More than 300 modifications were made to it and tested on the cephalosporin base with methoxy groups at the 7-alpha position. Yet only cefoxitin retained its previous effectiveness against Gram negative bacteria, developed effectiveness against Gram positive bacteria, and resisted breakdown by beta-lactamase. Cefoxitin, and the cephamycin family as a whole, served as a branching point and impulsed the discovery of more classes of beta-lactams. This is in part due to their primary and early discovery in the broths studied. == Mechanism == Cefoxitin is a beta-lactam antibiotic which binds to penicillin binding proteins, or transpeptidases. By binding to PBPs, cefoxitin prevents the PBPs from forming the cross-linkages between the peptidoglycan layers that make up the bacterial cell wall, thereby interfering with cell wall synthesis. It is a strong beta-lactamase inducer, as are certain other antibiotics (such as imipenem). However, cefoxitin is a better substrate than imipenem for beta-lactamases. == Microbiological resistance == In the presence of cefoxitin, bacteria that make beta-lactamases will increase their production and secretion to cleave the beta lactam ring. As a cephamycin, cefoxitin is highly resistant to hydrolysis by some beta-lactamases, in part due to the presence of the 7-alpha-methoxy functional group (see skeletal formula above). Another more efficient form of resistance to cefoxitin is provided by the mecA gene in bacteria. This gene codes for an alternative penicillin binding protein, PBP2a. This PBP has a lower binding affinity for penicillin-based antibiotics such as cefoxitin and will continue to cross-link the peptidoglycan layers of the cell wall even in the presence of the beta-lactam antibiotics. MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a strain that has acquired resistance to cefoxitin via this gene. For the purposes of detecting bacterial strains with the mecC gene, which like mecA codes for a different PBP, cefoxitin is more reliable than oxacillin because mecC does not correlate as strongly with oxacillin resistance. == Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility == Cefoxitin's spectrum of in vitro antimicrobial activity includes a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. It is inactive against most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Staphylococci that are resistant to methicillin and oxacillin should also be considered clinically resistant to cefoxitin even if they test susceptible by in vitro methods. Major bacterial strains susceptible to cefoxitin include: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus sp. E. coli Salmonella sp. Proteus vulgaris Flavobacterium sp. Klebsiella sp. Major bacteria resistant to cefoxitin include: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Enterococci Listeria monocytogenes Enterobacter sp. Bacteroides sp. == Replacement and substitution == In a 2005 study, Fernandes et al. determined that cefoxitin serves as an appropriate replacement for methicillin in determining if some bacteria display methicillin resistance. Likewise, Funsun et al. found in a 2009 study that cefoxitin disk assays correctly identified all 60 mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA isolates, to be resistant to cefoxitin. Due, in part, to the unavailability of methicillin in the United States, cefoxitin has replaced methicillin for disk diffusion tests, which determine the sensitivity of a bacterial specimen to a given antibiotic. Cefoxitin also yields more accurate results for disk diffusion tests. Interpretive criteria for determining susceptibility to cefoxitin via disk diffusion are greater than or equal to 22mm resulting in a ""susceptible"" result for Staphylococcus aureus and greater than or equal to 25mm for coagulase-negative staphylococci to be considered susceptible. The following are susceptibility data for several medically significant microorganisms, measured by minimum inhibitory concentration, which is an alternative, liquid medium test for susceptibility. Escherichia coli: 0.2 μg/ml – 64 μg/ml Haemophilus influenzae: 0.5 μg/ml – 12.5 μg/ml Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.2 μg/ml – 1 μg/ml == Uses in medicine == Cefoxitin is sold in three major IV doses, 1g, 2g, and 10g. It is usually given to adults every six to eight hours in 1g or 2g doses. Cefoxitin may interfere with tests detecting urine glucose and result in a false positive. As with any antibiotic, it should not be given to patients who are allergic to it. Cefoxitin is used to treat: Skin infections, primarily due to Staphylococcus Urinary tract infections Bronchitis Tonsillitis Ear infections Bacterial pneumonia Sepsis Bone and joint infections Abdominal infections and abscesses Perineum injuries Pelvic inflammatory disease Gonorrhea Infections caused by susceptible bacteria mentioned earlier Cefoxitin has many other uses; it may be given prior to surgery to prevent the development of surgical wound infections, and when used in third and fourth degree perineal injuries in women after giving vaginal birth, cefoxitin decreases infection rate at two and six weeks. However, the earlier and more times a child is exposed to cefoxitin, as with early and multiple exposure to many antibiotics, the greater the likelihood of developing inflammatory bowel disease later in life. This may be due in part to a decreased variety of microorganisms in the digestive system. It is also used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, because it is a broad spectrum antibiotic. For outpatient treatment, oral antibiotics or those with less frequent dosing may be prescribed. As an effective alternative to penicillin and spectinomycin, and replacement for methicillin, cefoxitin is used to treat gonorrhea in both men and women with few side effects. == Side effects == Side effects for cefoxitin are regarded as mild. Common side effects include: local tenderness or pain at the site of injection skin color change, mild diarrhea mild nausea headache loss of appetite vaginal discharge and itching swelling of feet or legs. While cefoxitin has not been associated with alcohol incompatibility like other members of the second generation cephalosporins class, it has been with a higher risk of coagulopathy, a bleeding disorder. This is not a comprehensive list and not intended to provide medical advice. If any of the previous side effects are severe, or if an allergic reaction takes place immediately contact your doctor. == Notable drug interactions == === Contraindications === A contraindication means that the drug in question should not be used under particular circumstances. For cefoxitin, this includes patients who are hypersensitive to cephalosporin antibiotics. Patients with colitis, kidney disease, or liver disease are also advised not to take cefoxitin. However, some drug databases will considers the diseases means for caution rather than contraindications. === Major or Severe === Aside from the above-mentioned contraindications and diseases which require monitoring by a doctor, the live cholera and live typhoid vaccines are known to have a severe interaction with cefoxitin. Individuals on a low sodium diet, undergoing dialysis, or who have experienced seizures, particularly following antibiotic therapy, should also consult their physician prior to taking cefoxitin. === Moderate === Only take additional antibiotics, anticoagulants and blood thinners under doctor supervision. Cefoxitin may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal birth control. This increases the risk for pregnancy and a medical consult will help determine whether backup birth control methods should be used. === Minor === Minor drug interactions do not usually require a change in treatment. Your doctor may monitor specific events, such as bleeding, while taking cefoxitin. Two such minor interactions occur between cefoxitin and heparin as well as genistein. == Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data == Pharmocokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for cefoxitin are, as of 2013, considered limited and outdated. A few relatively recent studies have attempted to remedy that. One such study was by the Hôpitaux de Paris in collaboration with the French Ministry of Health. However, while the clinical trials were completed in 2015, no study data have been published. The expected results from using cefoxitin over carbapenems, another type of antibiotic with a wider bacterial spectrum, included effective treatment of E. coli produce extended spectrum beta-lactamase, less selective pressure on the GI tract which better maintains balanced flora, and a lower treatment cost. This followed a 2012 French study on the same E. coli strain with CTX-M-15 extended release beta-lactamase. Lepeule et al. determined that in mice, the ideal pharmacodynamic target of fT>MIC=33%, where MIC is the minimum inhibitory concentration, was obtained with 200 mg/kg every four hours. The fT>MIC (%) was increased by 11% when the administration frequency was increased from every four hours to every three hours. This implied that increasing the frequency might yield similar results in humans. The study also found no significant difference between the effectiveness of carbapenems and cefoxitin and suggested that cefoxitin can be used as an alternative treatment for CTX-M producing E. coli to carbapenems such as imipenem and ertapenem. == References == == External links == ""Cefoxitin"".

3554,"('Aztreonam', 'Azactam', 'Primbactam', 'Aztreon', 'Nebactam')",Medical,"Aztreonam, sold under the brand name Azactam among others, is an antibiotic used primarily to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This may include bone infections, endometritis, intra abdominal infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. It is given by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by inhalation. Common side effects when given by injection include pain at the site of injection, vomiting, and rash. Common side effects when inhaled include wheezing, cough, and vomiting. Serious side effects include Clostridioides difficile infection and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Those who are allergic to other β-lactam have a low rate of allergy to aztreonam. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is in the monobactam family of medications. Aztreonam inhibits cell wall synthesis by blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking to cause bacterial death. Aztreonam was approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. It is available as a generic medication. It is a manufactured version of a chemical from the bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum. Aztreonam is available in a combination with avibactam (aztreonam/avibactam). == Medical uses == Nebulized forms of aztreonam are used to treat infections that are complications of cystic fibrosis and are approved for such use in the EU and the US; they are also used off-label for non-CF bronchiectasis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mycobacterial disease, and to treat infections in people who have received lung transplants. Aztreonam has strong activity against susceptible gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is resistant to some beta-lactamases, but is inactivated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes. It is known to be effective against a wide range of bacteria including Citrobacter, Enterobacter, E. coli, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Serratia species. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus 8 - >128 μg/ml Staphylococcus epidermidis 8 - 32 μg/ml Streptococcus pyogenes 8 - ≥128 μg/ml === Spectrum of activity === Acinetobacter anitratus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis are generally susceptible to aztreonam, while some staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Xanthomonas maltophilia are resistant to it. Furthermore, Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter koseri (Citrobacter diversus), Pantoea agglomerans (Enterobacter agglomerans), Haemophilus spp. and Streptococcus pyogenes have developed resistance to aztreonam to varying degrees. === Administration === Aztreonam is poorly absorbed when given orally, so it must be administered as an intravenous or intramuscular injection (brand name Azactam), or inhaled (brand name Cayston) using an ultrasonic nebulizer. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the inhalation form in February 2010, for the suppression of P. aeruginosa infections in people with cystic fibrosis. It received conditional approval for administration in Canada and the European Union in September 2009, and has been fully approved in Australia. == Contraindications == Aztreonam can be safely used in people with a penicillin or cephalosporin allergy (except for people with a ceftazidime allergy as ceftazidime and aztreonam share a similar side chain). It is also frequently used as an alternative to aminoglycosides because is not ototoxic or nephrotoxic. == Side effects == Reported side effects include injection site reactions, rash, and rarely toxic epidermal necrolysis. Gastrointestinal side effects generally include diarrhea and nausea and vomiting. Although C. difficile infection is a possible complication of aztreonam therapy, this antibiotic is associated with a low risk of developing C. difficile infection. There may be drug-induced eosinophilia. Because of the unfused beta-lactam ring there is somewhat lower cross-reactivity between aztreonam and many other beta-lactam antibiotics, and it may be safe to administer aztreonam to many patients with hypersensitivity (allergies) to penicillins and nearly all cephalosporins. There is a much lower risk of cross-sensitivity between aztreonam and other beta-lactam antibiotics than within other beta-lactam antibiotics. However, there is a higher chance of cross-sensitivity if a person is specifically allergic to ceftazidime, a cephalosporin. Aztreonam exhibits cross-sensitivity with ceftazidime due to a similar side chain. == Mechanism of action == Aztreonam is similar in action to penicillin. It inhibits synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, by blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking. It has a very high affinity for penicillin-binding protein-3 and mild affinity for penicillin-binding protein-1a. Aztreonam binds the penicillin-binding proteins of Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria very poorly and is largely ineffective against them. Aztreonam is bactericidal, but less so than some of the cephalosporins. == Research == Aztreonam is under consideration for human infections sustained by metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria. In these circumstances aztreonam is combined with ceftazidime/avibactam. The combination of aztreonam and avibactam are in phase III clinical trails. The combination of aztreonam and avibactam has demonstrated to be active against 80% of MBL isolates reaching a clinical infection resolution in 80% of MBL-infected patients. Synergism between aztreonam and arbekacin or tobramycin against P. aeruginosa has been suggested. == References ==",Primbactam,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014165864326059818)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1741439700126648), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06808976083993912)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.029750484973192215), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([galinos.gr](https://www.galinos.gr/web/drugs/main/drugs/primbactam?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Γαληνός - Φάρμακο - PRIMBACTAM', type='url_citation', url='https://www.galinos.gr/web/drugs/main/drugs/primbactam?utm_source=openai')])"
3555,"('Higenamine (hydrochloride)', 'Norcoclaurine (hydrochloride)', 'Higenamine', 'Demethyl-coclaurine', 'Norcoclaurine')",Medical,"Higenamine (norcoclaurine) is a chemical compound found in a variety of plants including Nandina domestica (fruit), Aconitum carmichaelii (root), Asarum heterotropioides, Galium divaricatum (stem and vine), Annona squamosa, and Nelumbo nucifera (lotus seeds). Higenamine is found as an ingredient in sports and weight loss dietary supplements sold in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration has received reports of adverse effects from higenamine-containing supplements since 2014, but higenamine's health risks remain poorly understood. == Legality == Higenamine, also known as norcoclaurine HCl, is legal to use within food supplements in the UK, EU, the USA and Canada. Its main use is within food supplements developed for weight management and sports supplements. Traditional formulations with higenamine have been used for thousands of years within Chinese medicine and come from a variety of sources including fruit and orchids. There are no studies comparing the safety of modern formulations (based on synthetic higenamine) with traditional formulations. Nevertheless, it will not be added to the EU 'novel foods' catalogue, which details all food supplements that require a safety assessment certificate before use. Along with many other β2 agonists, higenamine is prohibited by World Anti-Doping Agency for use in sports. In 2016, French footballer Mamadou Sakho was temporarily banned by UEFA after testing positive for Higenamine causing the player to miss the 2016 Europa League final. The ban was lifted after the player successfully made the mitigating defence that there was an absence of significant negligence as the substance was not on the list of banned substances despite drugs of the same category – β2 agonists – being banned. == Pharmacology == Since higenamine is present in plants which have a history of use in traditional medicine, the pharmacology of this compound has attracted scientific interest. In animal models, higenamine has been demonstrated to be a β2 adrenoreceptor agonist. Adrenergic receptors, or adrenoceptors, belong to the class of G protein–coupled receptors, and are the most prominent receptors in the adipose membrane, besides also being expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. These adipose membrane receptors are classified as either α or β adrenoceptors. Although these adrenoceptors share the same messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the specific transduction pathway depends on the receptor type (α or β). Higenamine partly exerts its actions by the activation of an enzyme, adenylate cyclase, responsible for boosting the cellular concentrations of the adrenergic second messenger, cAMP. In a rodent model, it was found that higenamine produced cardiotonic, vascular relaxation, and bronchodilator effects. In particular, higenamine, via a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism, induced relaxation in rat corpus cavernosum, leading to improved vasodilation and erectile function. Related to improved vasodilatory signals, higenamine has been shown in animal models to possess antiplatelet and antithrombotic activity via a cAMP-dependent pathway, suggesting higenamine may contribute to enhanced vasodilation and arterial integrity. In humans, higenamine has been studied as an investigational drug in China for use as a pharmacological agent for cardiac stress tests as well as for treatment of a number of cardiac conditions including bradyarrhythmias. The human trials were relatively small (ranging from 10 to 120 subjects) and higenamine was administered intravenously, most commonly using gradual infusions of 2.5 or 5 mg. Higenamine consistently increased heart rate but had variable effects on blood pressure. One small study described higenamine's effect on cardiac output: higenamine led to an increased ejection fraction in 15 patients with heart disease. == Toxicity == The safety of orally administered higenamine in humans is unknown. During a study of acute toxicity, mice were orally administered the compound at a dose of 2 g per kg of bodyweight. No mice died during the study. In human trials of intravenous higenamine, subjects who received higenamine reported shortness of breath, racing heart, dizziness, headaches, chest tightness. == Biosynthesis == (S)-Norcoclaurine/Higenamine is at the center of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid (BIA) biosynthesis. In spite of large structure diversity, BIAs biosynthesis all share a common first committed intermediate (S)-norcoclaurine. (S)-norcoclaurine is produced by the condensation of two tyrosine derivatives, dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). In plants, tyrosine is synthesized through Shikimate pathway, during which the last step involves decarboxylation and dehydrogenation of arogenate to give L-tyrosine. To generate dopamine from tyrosine, there are two pathways. In one pathway, tyrosine undergoes decarboxylation catalyzed by tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) to become tyramine, which is then followed by oxidation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to render dopamine. Alternatively, tyrosine can be oxidized by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to form L-DOPA, which is then later decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) to provide dopamine. Besides that, the other starting material, 4-HPAA, is generated through a first transamination by tyrosine transeaminase (TyrAT) to form 4-hydroxylphenylpyruvate (4-HPP), and a subsequent decarboxylation by 4-HPP decarboxylase. The condensation of dopamine and 4-HPAA to form (S)-norcoclaurine is catalyzed by (S)-norcoclaurine synthase (NCS). Such reaction is one type of Pictet-Spengler reaction. In this reaction, Asp-141 and Glu-110 in the NCS active site are involved in the activation of the amine and carbonyl respectively to facilitate imine formation. Then, the molecule will be cyclized as the mechanism shown below to produce (S)-nococlaurine. == See also == Papaverine == References ==",Norcoclaurine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.6051484942436218), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -7.941850526549388e-06), (' FOOD', -0.016130324453115463), (',', -0.0031827057246118784), (' MED', -0.6341838240623474), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.11249696463346481), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0006038511055521667), ('ĠMED', -0.6276811957359314), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), (',', -0.25195935368537903), ('ĠINDU', -0.9488643407821655), ('ST', -4.5536911784438416e-05), ('RI', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062087833881378174)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0007121934904716909), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.12693104147911072), (' FOOD', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Serine protease enzymes have a variety of functions in the body, and so camostat has a diverse range of uses. Camostat is approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis. The oral proteolytic enzyme inhibitor has been on the market since 1985 under the trade name Foipan Tablets. The manufacturer is Ono Pharmaceutical. The drug is used in the treatment of some forms of cancer and is also effective against some viral infections, as well as inhibiting fibrosis in liver or kidney disease or pancreatitis. == Pharmacology == It is an inhibitor of the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). For chronic pancreatitis camostat's typical dose is 600 mg daily, for postoperative reflux esophagitis 300 mg are taken. The daily dose is split in 3 doses and taken after each meal. == Side effects == As side effects allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, hyperkalemia, platelet and leukocyte depletion, liver dysfunction, jaundice have been reported. == COVID-19 == Inhibition of TMPRSS2 partially blocked infection by SARS-CoV and Human coronavirus NL63 in HeLa cell cultures. Another in vitro study showed that camostat significantly reduces the infection of Calu-3 lung cells by SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It is currently in many Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Camostat decreased CRP levels better compared to Lopinavir/Ritonavir in a small study of mild COVID-19 patients. Camostat decreased COVID-19 severity, improved inflammatory markers and oxygenation compared to hydroxychloroquine treated patients. A study of 205 COVID-19 patients treated with Camostat, carried out at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark and concluding in April 2021, showed no noticeable effects of Camostat on duration of hospitalisation or severity of the cases, but noted that higher doses (the study used 600 mg Camostat daily dosage) might still have a possible effect.

It is a medication for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chemically, it is a cytidine analog. == Medical uses == Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including previously treated and untreated, de novo and secondary MDS of all French-American-British subtypes (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) and Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2, and High-Risk International Prognostic Scoring System groups. In patients with chronic kidney disease, Batty and colleagues reported the first case series on the feasibility of therapy with hypomethylating agents in patients with chronic kidney disease. It also has EU approval for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). == Pharmacology == Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. It incorporates into DNA strands upon replication, and then when DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) such as DNMT1, are engaged to bind the DNA and to replicate the methylation to the daughter strand, DNMTs are bound to decitabine irreversibly and cannot disengage. Therefore, the action of decitabine is division-dependent, meaning the cells have to divide in order for the pharmaceutical to act. Therefore, cancer cells which divide much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected by decitabine just because they replicate more. It seems that DNA hypermethylation is critical for development of cancer cells, and specifically for haematological malignancies. Methylation of CpG islands upstream of tumor suppressor genes in order to silence them seems to be critical for these type of cancers. Thus at optimal doses, decitabine blocks this type of methylation and has an anti-neoplastic effect. == Research == === Atherosclerosis === A number of investigators have shown a relationship between atherosclerosis and disturbed blood flow. This upregulates DNA methyltransferase expression, which leads to genome-wide DNA methylation alterations and global gene expression changes. These studies have revealed several mechanosensitive genes, such as HoxA5, Klf3, and Klf4, whose promoters were hypermethylated by disturbed blood flow, but rescued by DNA methyltransferases inhibitors such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. It has been found that use of this DNA methyltranferase inhibitor prevents atherosclerosis lesion formation and reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. == References == == Further reading == Moon C, Kim SH, Park KS, Choi BK, Lee HS, Park JB, et al.

The chemoenzymatic synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNTFA was attempted by three recombinant enzymes. Recombinant N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase was used to produce GlcNAc/GlcNTFA-1-phosphate from GlcNAc/GlcNTFA. N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase from Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 was used to produce UDP-GlcNAc/GlcNTFA from GlcNAc/GlcNTFA-1-phosphate. Inorganic pyrophosphatase from E. coli K12 MG1655 was used to hydrolyze pyrophosphate to accelerate the reaction. The above enzymes were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified, respectively, and finally mixed in one-pot bioreactor. The effects of reaction conditions on the production of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNTFA were characterized.

Current endocrine therapies address the estrogenic aspect of disease and offer some relief from pain but are associated with significant side effects. Immune dysfunction is also widely believed to be an underlying contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. This study evaluated an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, bentamapimod (AS602801), which interrupts immune pathways, in 2 rodent endometriosis models. Treatment of nude mice bearing xenografts biopsied from women with endometriosis (BWE) with 30 mg/kg AS602801 caused 29% regression of lesion. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or progesterone (PR) alone did not cause regression of BWE lesions, but combining 10 mg/kg AS602801 with MPA caused 38% lesion regression. In human endometrial organ cultures (from healthy women), treatment with AS602801 or MPA reduced matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) release into culture medium. In organ cultures established with BWE, PR or MPA failed to inhibit MMP-3 secretion, whereas AS602801 alone or MPA + AS602801 suppressed MMP-3 production. In an autologous rat endometriosis model, AS602801 caused 48% regression of lesions compared to GnRH antagonist Antide (84%). AS602801 reduced inflammatory cytokines in endometriotic lesions, while levels of cytokines in ipsilateral horns were unaffected. Furthermore, AS602801 enhanced natural killer cell activity, without apparent negative effects on uterus. These results indicate that bentamapimod induced regression of endometriotic lesions in endometriosis rodent animal models without suppressing ER action. c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibition mediated a comprehensive reduction in cytokine secretion and moreover was able to overcome PR resistance. To test the hypothesis that the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (JNKI) bentamapimod (AS602801/PGL5001) can reduce induced endometriosis in baboons. Prospective randomized placebo-controlled study. Nonhuman primate research center. Twenty baboons each underwent four laparoscopies. Initial screening laparoscopy (L1) was followed after one rest cycle by an endometriosis-induction laparoscopy (L2). Fifty days after L2, the baboons were randomized just before staging laparoscopy (L3). Treatment lasted for 60 days, followed by a post-treatment staging laparoscopy (L4). Randomization before a 60-day treatment in four groups: daily placebo (n = 5), daily oral administration of 20 mg/kg JNKI (n = 5), concomitant daily oral administration of 20 mg/kg JNKI and 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; n = 5), or subcutaneous administration of 3 mg cetrorelix every 3 days (n = 5). Type, surface area and volume of endometriotic lesions, and revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine score and stage were recorded during L3 and L4. Menstrual cycle length and serum hormonal concentration were recorded before and after treatment. Compared with placebo, treatment with JNKI, JNKI + PMA, or cetrorelix resulted in lower total surface area and volume of endometriotic lesions. Remodeling of red active lesions into white lesions was observed more frequently in baboons treated with JNKI + MPA than in baboons treated with JNKI only. Menstrual cycle length and serum hormonal concentration were similar between placebo and JNKI groups. JNKI alone was as effective as JNKI + MPA or cetrorelix in reducing induced endometriosis in baboons, but without severe side effects or effect on cycle length or serum reproductive hormones.",Bentamapimod,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007100477814674377), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03817211836576462), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01816658489406109)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5933194/,https://www.scbt.com/ko/p/bentamapimod-848344-36-5,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~816040,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~816038,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~816041,https://www.invivochem.com/as-602801-bentamapimod.html ', [])"
