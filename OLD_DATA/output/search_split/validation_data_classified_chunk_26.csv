2577,"('Etofylline', 'Aethophyllinum', 'Oxyphylline', 'Cordalin', 'Ascorphylline')",Medical," Drug delivery to lungs via pulmonary administration offers potential for the development of new drug delivery systems. Here we fabricated the etofylline (ETO) encapsulated mannose-anchored N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (Mn-TMC NPs). The prominent characteristics like biocompatibility, controlled release, targeted delivery, high penetrability, enhanced physical stability, and scalability mark Mn-TMC NPs as a viable alternative to various nanoplatform technologies for effective drug delivery. Mannosylation of TMC NPs leads to the evolution of new drug delivery vehicle with gratifying characteristics, and potential benefits in efficient drug therapy. It is widely accepted that following pulmonary administration, the introduction of mannose to the surface of drug nanocarriers provide selective macrophage targeting via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The fabricated Mn-TMC NPs exhibited particle size of 223.3 nm, PDI 0.490, and ζ-potential -19.1 mV, drug-loading capacity 76.26 ± 1.2%, and encapsulation efficiency of 91.75 ± 0.88%. Sustained drug release, biodegradation studies, stability, safety, and aerodynamic behavior revealed the effectiveness of prepared nanoformulation for pulmonary administration. In addition, the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rat model revealed a significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy of ETO, illustrating mannosylation a promising approach for efficient therapy of airway diseases following pulmonary administration. Teratological studies of the hypolipidaemic drugs etofylline clofibrate (VULM) and fenofibrate were carried out in mice. Pregnant mice were given etofylline clofibrate and fenofibrate in doses 11.7, 117.1, and 585.5 mg/kg orally from day 7 to 16 of gestation. Terminal maternal body weight was significantly decreased after all doses of etofylline clofibrate in a non-dose-related fashion compared to the control group. The foetuses were examined on day 19 of gestation. They were weighed and inspected for external, skeletal and visceral abnormalities. The low and middle doses of etofylline clofibrate and fenofibrate had no adverse effects on embryofoetal development. The highest etofylline clofibrate dose induced a significant decrease of foetal weight at term, likewise postimplantation loss was significantly increased after the highest dose of fenofibrate. The incidence of external, skeletal and visceral anomalies was not dose-dependent. In this study no teratogenic effects were detected, yet with the highest etofylline clofibrate and fenofibrate doses some foetotoxic effects were observed. A simple, sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet detection (272 nm) was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of theophylline and etofylline in human plasma. Following rapid sample preparation, the analytes and internal standard (hydrochlorothiazide) were separated using an isocratic mobile phase on a reverse phase C18 column. The lower limit of quantification was 100 ng/mL for both theophylline and etofylline with a relative standard deviation of less than 6%. A linear dynamic range of 100-10,000 ng/mL for both theophylline and etofylline was established. This HPLC method was validated with between-batch precision of 2.2-6.0 and 1.4-3.7% for theophylline and etofylline, respectively. The between-batch accuracy was 94.3-98.0 and 95.4-98.2%, respectively. Stability of theophylline and etofylline in plasma was excellent, with no evidence of degradation during sample processing (autosampler) and 30 days storage in a freezer. This validated method is simple and rugged enough to be used in pharmacokinetic studies.",Etofylline,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005946326069533825), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20142824947834015)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medindia.net](https://www.medindia.net/doctors/drug_information/etofylline.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=9, title='Etofylline Drug Information - Indications, Dosage, Side Effects and Precautions', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medindia.net/doctors/drug_information/etofylline.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

2579,"('Nitrofurantoin', 'Furadantin', 'Furadonine', 'Furadantine', 'Furadantoin')",Medical,"Nitrofurantoin, sold under the brand name Macrobid among others, is an antibacterial medication of the nitrofuran class used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), although it is not as effective for kidney infections. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and headaches. Rarely numbness, lung problems, or liver problems may occur. While it appears to be generally safe during pregnancy its use is not recommended near time of delivery. While it usually works by slowing bacterial growth, it may result in bacterial death at the high concentrations found in urine, provided forced fluid dilution of urine is avoided. Nitrofurantoin was first sold in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 158th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Urinary tract infections === Uses of nitrofurantoin include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prophylaxis against UTIs in people prone to recurrent UTIs. It is a first-line therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis. It is not recommended for empiric treatment of hospital-acquired UTIs. Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones, has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin in the contemporary treatment of UTIs. The efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating UTIs combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the first-line agents for treating uncomplicated UTIs as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. In meta-analyses of clinical trials, nitrofurantoin has shown clinical UTI cure rates of 79 to 92% and bacterial eradication rates of 80 to 92%. Treatment with nitrofurantoin for 7 days was not more effective than treatment for 5 days, whereas treatment for 5 days was superior to treatment for 3 days (which showed clinical cure rates of 61–70%). The effectiveness of nitrofurantoin for 5 days is equivalent to that with single-dose fosfomycin. As a prophylactic against UTIs, nitrofurantoin was similarly effective to other antibiotics, with a UTI risk ratio of 0.38. Taken daily long-term as a prophylactic, there were no differences in effectiveness between different doses of nitrofurantoin (50 mg/day, 75 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or 50 mg twice daily). Although similarly effective as other antibiotics, prophylactic nitrofurantoin showed an increased risk of adverse effects compared to other antibiotics (risk ratios = 2.17 to 2.24). The adverse effects of nitrofurantoin were mostly gastrointestinal in nature. === Other bacterial infections === Nitrofurantoin is not recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis (kidney infection), and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels. Nitrofurantoin appears likely to minimally penetrate the prostate gland. As such, nitrofurantoin is not recommended for eradication of chronic bacterial prostatitis. In any case, in men with antibiotic-refractory or relapsing chronic bacterial prostatitis, prophylactic nitrofurantoin may be useful in preventing UTIs and managing symptoms. However, supporting data are lacking as of 2020. === Antibacterial activity === Nitrofurantoin has been shown to have good activity against: Escherichia coli Staphylococcus species Enterococcus species Klebsiella species (mixed) Citrobacter species Coagulase negative staphylococci Bacillus subtilis species Streptococcus agalactiae It is used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms. Many or all strains of the following genera are resistant to nitrofurantoin: Enterobacter species (mixed) Proteus species Pseudomonas species Acinetobacter species Morganella species Serratia species Providencia species === Special populations === ==== Pregnancy ==== Nitrofurantoin is pregnancy category A in Australia. It is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat UTIs. There is a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn when used near time of delivery. Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice. Evidence of safety in early pregnancy is mixed as of 2017. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that while they can be used in the first trimester other options may be preferred. They remain a first line treatment in the second trimester. A 2015 meta analysis found no increased risk from first trimester use in cohort studies that was a slight increase of malformations in case control studies. == Contraindications == Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (CrCl < 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl < 40 ml/min would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers Criteria. Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month, as they have immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of nitrofurantoin are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Less common adverse events (occurring in less than 1% of those taking the drug) include: Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, emesis Neurologic: dizziness, drowsiness, amblyopia Respiratory: acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction Allergic: pruritus, urticaria Dermatologic: hair loss Miscellaneous: fever, chills, malaise Taken daily long-term as a prophylactic, side effects of nitrofurantoin occur at rates of 0 to 29%. They are generally mild, reversible, and are predominantly gastrointestinal. === Lung toxicity === The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. These reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, headache, back pain, and epigastric pain. Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema. Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early. === Liver toxicity === Liver reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. === Neuropathy === Neuropathy is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin. Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug. === Gut microflora === Nitrofurantoin has been found to modify the gut microbiota composition. Effects in three clinical studies have included increased abundance of Actinobacteria, Bifidobacterium species, and Clostridium species, decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium species, and no changes. Similarly to other antibiotics, nitrofurantoin has been associated with increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection and associated diarrhea. However, this was based on a single study in which only two cases occurred. Other sources state that nitrofurantoin has a low risk of Clostridioides difficile infection. == Interactions == Nitrofurantoin has historically been reported to be a disulfiram-like drug and to produce alcohol intolerance-type reactions when combined with alcohol. However, subsequent clinical studies failed to replicate these findings and the earlier results have been deemed erroneous. == Pharmacology == Organisms are said to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 μg/mL or less. The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100 mg is less than 1 μg/mL and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/mL or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6. Nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple cystitis. At the concentrations achieved in urine (>100 μg/mL), nitrofurantoin is a bactericide. It is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32 μg/mL. Nitrofurantoin and the quinolone antibiotics are mutually antagonistic in vitro. It is not known whether this is of clinical significance. Resistance to nitrofurantoin may be chromosomal or plasmid-mediated and involves inhibition of nitrofuran reductase. Acquired resistance in E. coli continues to be rare. Nitrofurantoin and its metabolites are excreted mainly by the kidneys. In renal impairment, the concentration achieved in urine may be subtherapeutic. === Mechanism of action === Nitrofurantoin is concentrated in the urine, leading to higher and more effective levels in the urinary tract than in other tissues or compartments. With a 100 mg oral dose, plasma levels are typically less than 1 μg/mL while in the urine it reaches 200 μg/mL. The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is made possible by the rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad mechanism of action for nitrofurantoin is likely responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as it affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell. == History == Nitrofurantoin has been available for the treatment of lower UTIs since 1953. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Nitrofurantoin is marketed under many names in countries worldwide. == Animal feed == Residues from the breakdown of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, have been found in chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a ""zero tolerance or no residue standard"". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats. == References ==",Furadantoin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003586364327929914), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00249182409606874)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/furadantin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=9, title='Furadantin: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/furadantin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Both the anhydrous salt and its trihydrate are known. Both are white powders. Chloramine-T is used as a reagent in organic synthesis. It is commonly used as cyclizing agent in the synthesis of aziridine, oxadiazole, isoxazole and pyrazoles. It's inexpensive, has low toxicity and acts as a oxidizing agent. In addition, it also acts as a source of nitrogen anions and electrophilic cations. It may undergo degradation on long term exposure to atmosphere such that care must be taken during its storage. == Reactions == Chloramine-T contains active (electrophilic) chlorine. Its reactivity is similar to that of sodium hypochlorite. Aqueous solutions of chloramine-T are slightly basic (pH typically 8.5). The pKa of the closely related N-chlorophenylsulfonamide C6H5SO2NClH is 9.5. It is prepared by oxidation of toluenesulfonamide with sodium hypochlorite, with the latter being produced in situ from sodium hydroxide and chlorine (Cl2): == Uses == === Reagent in amidohydroxylation === The Sharpless oxyamination converts an alkene to a vicinal aminoalcohol. A common source of the amido component of this reaction is chloramine-T. Vicinal aminoalcohols are important products in organic synthesis and recurring pharmacophores in drug discovery. === Oxidant === Chloramine-T is a strong oxidant. It oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to sulfur and mustard gas to yield a harmless crystalline sulfimide. It converts iodide to iodine monochloride (ICl). ICl rapidly undergoes electrophilic substitution predominantly with activated aromatic rings, such as those of the amino acid tyrosine. Thus, chloramine-T is used to incorporate iodine into peptides and proteins. Chloramine-T together with iodogen or lactoperoxidase is commonly used for labeling peptides and proteins with radioiodine isotopes. === Disinfectant === Chloramine-T has a long history as a hospital disinfectant. It is effective against e.g. hepatitis and HI viruses. Unlike the more common sodium hypochlorite, chloramine-T is mildly basic, almost odorless and is not a bleaching agent. == Safety == Chloramine-T is harmful if swallowed. It is corrosive on skin, eyes or mucous membranes. It releases toxic chlorine gas upon reaction with acids. It is water-soluble and thus can be released to the environment dissolved in water. It is a known sensitizer. Chloramine-T has been observed to cause occupational asthma and flu-like symptoms. == Certifications == EN 1276 Bactericidal EN 13713 Bactericidal EN 14675 Virucidal EN 14476 Virucidal Norovirus EN 1650 Fungicidal EN 13704 Sporicidal Clostridioides difficile == References == == External links == M.

2581,"('Guanosine', 'Vernine')","Endogenous, Medical","Guanosine (symbol G or Guo) is a purine nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). These forms play important roles in various biochemical processes such as synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, photosynthesis, muscle contraction, and intracellular signal transduction (cGMP). When guanine is attached by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of a deoxyribose ring it is known as deoxyguanosine. == Physical and chemical properties == Guanosine is a white, crystalline powder with no odor and mild saline taste.

It is a xenobiotic that was originally designed to treat tuberculosis, but was later most prominently used as an antidepressant drug. However, it was withdrawn from the market because of its hepatotoxicity. The medical use of iproniazid was discontinued in most of the world in the 1960s, but remained in use in France until its discontinuation in 2015. == History == Iproniazid was originally developed for the treatment of tuberculosis, but in 1952, its antidepressant properties were discovered when researchers noted that patients became inappropriately happy when given isoniazid, a structural analog of iproniazid. Subsequently, N-isopropyl addition led to development as an antidepressant and was approved for use in 1958. It was withdrawn in most of the world a few years later in 1961 due to a high incidence of hepatitis, and was replaced by less hepatotoxic drugs such as phenelzine and isocarboxazid. Canada surprisingly withdrew iproniazid in July 1964 due to interactions with food products containing tyramine. Nevertheless, iproniazid has historic value as it helped establish the relationship between psychiatric disorders and the metabolism of neurotransmitters. Although iproniazid was one of the first antidepressants ever marketed, amphetamine (marketed as Benzedrine from 1935, for ""mild depression"", amid other indications) predates it; and frankincense has been marketed traditionally for millennia for, among other things, altering mood, although it was not until 2012 that one of the components of its smoke was found to have antidepressant effects in mice. == Structure and reactivity == The structure of iproniazid is chemically, in both structure and reactivity, similar to isoniazid. Iproniazid is a substituted hydrazine of which the isopropyl hydrazine moiety is essential for the inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity. == Synthesis == There are multiple routes to synthesize iproniazid. The most common precursor is methyl isonicotinate which formes isonicotinohydrazide when it reacts with hydrazine. Isonicotinohydrazide can be converted into iproniazid via different pathways. One synthesis pathway involves AcMe which results in the formation of N'-(propan-2-ylidene)isonicotinohydrazide. Subsequently, the C=N linkage is selectively hydrogenated in the presence of a platinum catalyst and with water, alcohol or acetic acid as solvent. In another pathway isonicotinohydrazide reacts with either 2-bromopropane or 2-chloropropane in an N-isopropyl addition reaction to the hydrazine moiety. This directly results in the formation of iproniazid. == Reactions and mechanism of action == Iproniazid inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidases (MAOs) both directly and by formation of an active metabolite, isopropylhydrazine. The formation of isopropylhydrazine from iproniazid has been observed without MAOs present. Both iproniazid and isopropylhydrazine react near the active site of MAOs. The reaction is a progressive first-order reaction with a high activation energy. In the presence of oxygen it is an irreversible reaction, as dehydrogenation of iproniazid at the active site of the enzyme takes place. This dehydrogenation resembles the first step of amine oxidation. After dehydrogenation iproniazid further reacts with the enzyme. Inhibition of MAOs by iproniazid is competitive and sensitive to changes in pH and temperature, similar to oxidation of the monoamine substrate. Inhibition cannot be reversed by addition of the substrate. Iproniazid is able to displace non-hydrazine inhibitors, but not other hydrazine inhibitors from the active site of the enzyme. To increase the inhibition of monoamine oxidase, cyanide can be used. The reaction however remains oxygen-dependent. MAO inhibition can be decreased by addition of glutathione, suggesting non enzymatic conjugation of either iproniazid or isopropylhydrazine with glutathione. == Metabolism and toxicity == Iproniazid is metabolized in the body. Iproniazid is converted to isopropyl hydrazine and isonicotinic acid in an initial hydrolysis reaction. Isopropyl hydrazine can either be released in the blood or it can be metabolically activated by microsomal CYP450 enzymes. This oxidation of isopropyl hydrazine is a toxification reaction that eventually can lead to the formation of an alkylating agent: the isopropyl radical. Hepatic necrosis was found in rats with doses as low as 10 mg/kg. === Isopropyl radical === The presence of the isopropyl radical was indicated by another observed product of the metabolism of iproniazid: the gas propane. Alkylating agents have the capability to bind to chemical groups such as amino, phosphate hydroxyl, imidazole and sulfhydryl groups. The formed isopropyl radical is able to form S-isopropyl conjugates in vitro. This diminishes covalent binding to other proteins, however it was only observed in vitro. In vivo, hepatotoxic doses of isopropyl hydrazine, the precursor of the isopropyl radical, did not deplete sulfhydryl-group containing compounds. === Liver necrosis === The isopropyl radical formed as a result of the metabolism of iproniazid, is able to covalently bind to proteins and other macromolecules in the liver. These interactions are the reason for the hepatotoxicity of iproniazid. Covalent binding results in liver necrosis by presumably changing protein function leading to organelle stress and acute toxicity. However, the exact mechanism of how the binding of iproniazid derivatives to liver proteins would induce liver necrosis remains unclear. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are present at the highest concentrations in the liver, causing most alkylating agents to be produced in the liver. This explains why the liver is mostly damaged by covalent binding of alkylating agents such as the isopropyl radical. Rat models and other animal models have shown that cytochrome P450 enzymes convert isopropyl hydrazine to alkylating compounds that induce liver necrosis. An inducer of a class of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes, phenobarbital, highly increased the chance of necrosis. In contrast, the compounds cobalt chloride, piperonyl butoxide and alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate inhibit microsomal enzymes which resulted in a decreased chance of necrosis due to isopropyl hydrazine. === Metabolism to other forms === Iproniazid can also be metabolised by O-dealkylation from iproniazid to acetone and isoniazid. Isoniazid can undergo further metabolism via multiple metabolic pathways, of which one eventually results in alkylating agents as well. This toxifying metabolic pathway includes N-acetylation. Reactions involving acetylation are influenced by genetic variance: the acetylator phenotype. The toxicological response to isoniazid (and thus iproniazid) can therefore be subjected to interindividual differences. Acetone can also be produced in alternative pathway as a metabolite of isopropyl hydrazine. It is eventually converted to CO2 and exhaled. === Isonicotinic acid === Isonicotinic acid, formed during the hydrolysis of iproniazid, is described as a moderately toxic compound and allergen with cumulative effects. Isonicotinic acid is further metabolized by glycine-conjugation or glucuronic acid-conjugation. === Other toxic effects === Iproniazid can also interact with tyrosine-containing food products which may have toxic effects. == Excretion == Excretion can occur via different routes: via the lungs, the urine, bile and sometimes via the skin or breast milk. Iproniazid has a molecular weight of 179.219 g/mol, which is far below 500 g/mol, and it is hydrophilic (because of e.g. the N-H groups in the molecule). These two properties together indicate that iproniazid is likely to be excreted in the urine via the kidneys. Iproniazid can also be metabolized and excreted afterwards in the form of one of its metabolites which can be found in the figure above. Isoniazid is hydrophilic and has a molecular weight of 137.139 g/mol. Isoniazid is therefore expected to be excreted via the urine, if it is not further metabolized in the body. The same holds for isonicotinic acid and isonicotinoyl glycine. Carbon dioxide and propane are gaseous which are presumably transported out of the body by exhalation via the lungs. == Indication == Iproniazid was originally produced as anti-tuberculosis medicine, but found to be more effective as antidepressant. When it was discovered that iproniazid is hepatotoxic, it was replaced by medicinal xenobiotics that are less harmful to the liver. Examples of antidepressant drugs that are nowadays used instead of iproniazid are isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. Drugs more effective for treatment of tuberculosis are isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and rifampicin. == Efficacy and side effects == === Efficacy === Iproniazid was designed to treat tuberculosis, but its most significant positive effect is that it has a mood-stimulating property. Therefore, it was used as an antidepressant drug. === Adverse effects === The most significant adverse effects of using iproniazid is the hepatotoxicity caused by its metabolites. Moreover, usage of iproniazid results in several adverse effects such as dizziness (when lying down), drowsiness, headaches, ataxia, numbness of the feet and hands, and muscular twitching. However, these adverse effects disappear after approximately 10 weeks. == Effects on animals == Rat animal models have been used to investigate the hepatotoxic (bio)chemical mechanism of iproniazid. A metabolite of iproniazid, isopropyl hydrazine, was found to be a potent hepatotoxin in rats. Hepatic necrosis was found in rats with doses as low as 10 mg/kg. It was predicted with admetSAR that iproniazid had a LD50 of 2.6600 mol/kg in rats. === Lethality === See the table for experimentally determined LD50, TDLo and LDLo values of various organisms. == See also == Hydrazine (antidepressant) Isoniazid == References ==",Iproniazide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03761482611298561), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006001578294672072), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20149041712284088)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproniazid,https://www.britannica.com/science/iproniazid,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04818 ', [])"

2585,"('Rifaximin', 'Rifaxidin', 'Rifacol', 'Xifaxan', 'Rifamycin l 105')",Medical,"Rifaximin is a non-absorbable, broad-spectrum antibiotic mainly used to treat travelers' diarrhea. It is based on the rifamycin antibiotics family. Since its approval in Italy in 1987, it has been licensed in more than 30 countries for the treatment of a variety of non-infectious gastrointestinal diseases like irritable bowel syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy. It acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the RNA polymerase enzyme. This binding blocks translocation, which stops transcription. It was developed by Salix Pharmaceuticals. == Medical uses == === Travelers' diarrhea === Rifaximin is used to treat travelers' diarrhea caused by E. coli bacteria in people aged twelve years of age and older. It treats travelers' diarrhea by stopping the growth of the bacteria that cause diarrhea. Rifaximin will not work to treat travelers' diarrhea that is bloody or occurs with fever. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Rifaximin is used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It possesses anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, and is a non-absorbable antibiotic that acts locally in the gut. These properties make it efficacious in relieving chronic functional symptoms of non-constipation type irritable bowel syndrome. It appears to retain its therapeutic properties for this indication, even after repeated courses. It is particularly indicated where small intestine bacterial overgrowth is suspected of involvement in irritable bowel syndrome. Symptom relief or improvement can be obtained for global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, including: abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, and stool consistency. A drawback is that repeated courses may be necessary for relapse of symptoms. === Clostridioides difficile infection === Rifaximin may also be a useful addition to vancomycin when treating people with relapsing C. difficile infection. However, the quality of evidence of these studies was judged to be low. Because exposure to rifamycins in the past may increase risk for resistance, rifaximin should be avoided in such cases. === Hepatic encephalopathy === Rifaximin is used to prevent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy (changes in thinking, behavior, and personality caused by a build-up of toxins in the brain in adults who have liver disease). It treats hepatic encephalopathy by stopping the growth of bacteria that produce toxins and that may worsen the liver disease. Although high-quality evidence is lacking, it appears to be as effective as, or more effective than, other available treatments for hepatic encephalopathy (such as lactulose), is better tolerated, and may work faster. It prevents reoccurring encephalopathy and is associated with high patient satisfaction. People are more compliant and satisfied to take this medication than any other due to minimal side effects, prolonged remission, and overall cost. The drawbacks are increased cost, and lack of robust clinical trials for hepatic encephalopathy without combination lactulose therapy. === Other uses === Other uses include treatment of: infectious diarrhea, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and diverticular disease. It is effective in treating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth regardless of whether it is associated with irritable bowel syndrome or not. It has also shown efficacy with rosacea, ocular rosacea which also presents as dry eyes for patients with co-occurrence with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). === Veterinary uses === Rifaximin is used to treat cattle mastitis intramammarily and post-partum metritis intrauterinally. == Special caution == People should avoid rifaximin if they are allergic either rifabutin, rifampin, or rifapentine. It may cause attenuated vaccines (such as typhoid vaccine) not to work well. Health-care professionals should be informed about its usage before giving immunizations. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid rifaximin: it can harm the fetus. Caution is required in people with cirrhosis who have a Child–Pugh score of C. == Side effects == Rifaximin has an excellent safety profile due to its lack of systemic absorption. Clinical trials did not show any serious adverse events while using rifaximin. There were no deaths while using it in the clinical trials. The most common side effects include nausea, stomach pain, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, muscle tightening, and joint pain. It may also cause reddish discoloration of urine. The most serious side effects of rifaximin are: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea Drug-resistant bacterial superinfection Severe allergic reactions including hives, rashes and itching == Interactions == As rifaximin is not significantly absorbed from the gut, the great majority of this drug's interactions are negligible in people with healthy liver function, so healthcare providers usually do not worry about drug interactions unless liver impairment is present. It may decrease the effectiveness of warfarin, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant, in people with liver problems. == Pharmacology == Rifaximin is a semisynthetic broad spectrum antibacterial drug, derived through chemical modification of the natural antibiotic rifamycin. It has very low bioavailability due to its poor absorption after oral administration. Because of this local action within the gut and the lack of horizontal transfer of resistance genes, the development of bacterial resistance is rare, and most of the drug taken orally stays in the gastrointestinal tract where the infection takes place. === Mechanism of action === Rifaximin interferes with transcription by binding to the β-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase. This results in the blockage of the translocation step that normally follows the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, which occurs in the transcription process. This in turn results in a reduction of bacteria populations, including gas-producing bacteria, which may reduce mucosal inflammation, epithelial dysfunction, and visceral hypersensitivity. Rifaximin has broad spectrum antibacterial properties against both gram positive and gram negative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. As a result of bile acid solubility, its antibacterial action is limited mostly to the small intestine and less so the colon. A resetting of the bacterial composition has also been suggested as a possible mechanism of action for relief of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. Additionally, rifaximin may have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on gut mucosa via modulation of the pregnane X receptor. Other mechanisms for its therapeutic properties include inhibition of bacterial translocation across the epithelial lining of the intestine, inhibition of adherence of bacteria to the epithelial cells, and a reduction in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. == Availability == In the United States, Salix Pharmaceuticals holds a US Patent for rifaximin and markets it under the brand name Xifaxan. In addition to receiving FDA approval for travelers' diarrhea and (marketing approved for) hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin received FDA approval for irritable bowel syndrome in May 2015. No generic formulation is available in the US and none has appeared due to the fact that the FDA approval process was ongoing. If rifaximin receives full FDA approval for hepatic encephalopathy it is likely that Salix will maintain marketing exclusivity and be protected from generic formulations until 24 March 2017. In 2018, a patent dispute with Teva was settled which delayed a generic in the United States, with the patent set to expire in 2029. Rifaximin is approved in many countries for the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders. In August 2013, Health Canada issued a Notice of Compliance to Salix Pharmaceuticals for the drug product Zaxine. In India, it is available under the brand names Ciboz and Xifapill. In Russia and Ukraine the drug is sold under the name Alfa Normix (Альфа Нормикс), and under the name Flonorm in Mexico, produced by Alfa Wassermann S.p.A. (Italy). In 2018, the FDA approved a similar drug by Cosmos Pharmaceuticals called Aemcolo for traveler's diarrhea. == Physicochemical properties == Rifaximin can exist in different crystalline forms depending on the degree of hydration. They drastically differ in water solubility, which has to be taken into account during the manufacturing process. Wet rifaximin exists in the β-form, which can be dehydrated to obtain forms α and δ. ε-Form can be only obtained by dehydrating δ-form. Amongst them, γ-form is the most stable and is resistant to high humidity levels. Based upon animal-model studies, bioavailability (Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24, AUC∞) increases in the following order: β, α, ε, δ, γ. Thus, structures with lower bioavailability exert their antimicrobial activity more locally in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas δ- and γ-forms are more suitable for systemic treatment (however the problem with cross-resistance with rifampicin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis might lead to multidrug-resistant strain selection). == References ==",Xifaxan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014351768186315894), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007251255447044969)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/xifaxan.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Xifaxan: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/xifaxan.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It should not be taken by women who are or might become pregnant, and it is secreted in breast milk. == Interactions == People who are taking warfarin should not also take tranilast, as they interact. It appears to inhibit UGT1A1 so will interfere with metabolism of drugs that are affected by that enzyme. == Adverse effects == When given systemically, tranilast appears to cause liver damage; in a large well-conducted clinical trial it caused elevated transaminases three times the upper limit of normal in 11 percent of patients, as well as anemia, kidney failure, rash, and problems urinating. Given systemically it inhibits blood formation, causing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. == Society and culture == As of March 2018 it was marketed in Japan, China, and South Korea under the brand names Ao Te Min, Arenist, Brecrus, Garesirol, Hustigen, Krix, Lumios, Rizaben, Tramelas, Tranilast, and it was marketed as a combination drug with salbutamol under the brand name Shun Qi. In 2016 the FDA proposed that tranilast be excluded from the list of active pharmaceutical ingredients that compounding pharmacies in the US could formulate with a prescription. == Pharmacology == It appears to work by inhibiting the release of histamine from mast cells; it has been found to inhibit proliferation of fibroblasts but its biological target is not known. It has been shown to inhibit the release of many cytokines in various cell types, in in vitro studies. It has also been shown to inhibit NALP3 inflammasome activation and is being studied as a treatment for NALP3-driven inflammatory diseases. It has also been found to block the ion channel TRPV2. == Chemistry == Tranilast is an analog of a metabolite of tryptophan, and its chemical name is 3′,4′-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (N-5′). It is almost insoluble in water, easily soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, soluble in dioxane, and very slightly soluble in ether. It is photochemically unstable in solution. == Research == After promising results in three small clinical trials, tranilast was studied in a major clinical trial (the PRESTO trial) by SmithKline Beecham in partnership with Kissei for prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization, but was not found effective for that application.

This is accomplished through the bronchial challenge test, or methacholine challenge, in which a subject inhales aerosolized methacholine, leading to bronchoconstriction. Other therapeutic uses are limited by its adverse cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia and hypotension, which arise from its function as a cholinomimetic. == Pharmacology == It is highly active at all of the muscarinic receptors, but has little effect on the nicotinic receptors. Methacholine has a charged quaternary amine structure, rendering it insoluble in lipid cell membranes. Clinically, this means that it will not cross the blood–brain barrier and has poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is broken down at a relatively slow rate within the body, due to its relative resistance to acetylcholinesterases. The chemical structure of methacholine is derived from acetylcholine by the substitution of a methyl group on the β carbon; this methyl group increases selectivity for muscarinic receptors over nicotinic receptors. The quaternary ammonium group is essential for activity. == Contraindications == Use of methacholine is contraindicated in patients with recent heart attack or stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, known severe airway disease, or aortic aneurysm.

They bind client proteins to assist in protein stabilization, translocation of polypeptides across cell membranes and recovery of proteins from aggregates. Heat shock protein inhibitors are a diverse group of novel agents that have been demonstrated to have pro-apoptotic effects on malignant cells through inhibition of ATP binding on the ATP/ADP-binding pocket of the heat shock protein. Initial development of heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and 17-AAG, were limited by hepatotoxicity and the need for solvent carrying agents. In contrast, retaspimycin, or IPI-504, a derivative of geldanamycin and 17-AAG, is highly soluble in water and generally well tolerated. In Phase I/II trials, retaspimycin has shown activity in NSCLC and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The most promising activity was observed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Phase I/II trials are currently underway to evaluate the dosing schedules and activity of IPI-504 in breast cancer. Given the in vitro activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, melanoma, leukemia and pancreatic cancer, current and future trials are of clinical interest. This article reviews IPI-504 and its utility in a wide variety of cancer phenotypes. Abstract A phase 1 study of IPI-504 (retaspimycin hydrochloride) administered intravenously twice weekly for 2 weeks at 22.5, 45, 90, 150, 225, 300 or 400 mg/m(2) followed by 10 days off-treatment was conducted to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IPI-504 in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics were also evaluated. Eighteen patients (mean age 60.5 years; median 9 prior therapies) were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported for IPI-504 doses up to 400 mg/m(2). The most common treatment-related adverse event was grade 1 infusion site pain (four patients). All other treatment-related events were assessed as grade 1 or 2 in severity. The area under the curve (AUC) increased with increasing dose, and the mean half-life was approximately 2-4 h for IPI-504 and its metabolites. Four patients had stable disease, demonstrating modest single-agent activity in relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is required for the proper folding, function, and stability of various client proteins, two of which (KIT and PDGFRα) are critical in the pathogenesis and progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). This phase I study investigated the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of retaspimycin hydrochloride (IPI-504), a novel potent and selective HSP90 inhibitor, in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST or other soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). IPI-504 was administered intravenously at doses ranging from 90 to 500 mg/m(2) twice weekly for 2 weeks on/1 week off. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles were determined. Response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 and optionally via 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) imaging. Fifty-four patients received IPI-504; 37 with GIST and 17 with other STS. The MTD was 400 mg/m(2) twice weekly for 2 weeks on/1 week off. Common related adverse events were fatigue (59%), headache (44%), and nausea (43%). Exposure to IPI-504, 17-AAG, and 17-AG increased with IPI-504 dose. Stable disease (SD) was observed in 70% (26 of 37) of patients with GIST and 59% (10 of 17) of patients with STS. There was one confirmed partial response (PR) in a patient with GIST and one PR in a patient with liposarcoma. Metabolic partial responses occurred in 11 of 29 (38%) patients with GIST. In this study of advanced GIST or other STS, IPI-504 was generally well-tolerated with some evidence of antitumor activity, serving as a clinical proof-of-concept that HSP90 inhibition remains a promising strategy.",Retaspimycin (hydrochloride),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002851079625543207), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019315887475386262)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([biocentury.com](https://www.biocentury.com/article/212984/retaspimycin-hcl-development-discontinued?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=127, start_index=6, title='BioCentury - Retaspimycin HCl: Development discontinued', type='url_citation', url='https://www.biocentury.com/article/212984/retaspimycin-hcl-development-discontinued?utm_source=openai')])"
2592,"('Sotrastaurin', 'Sotrastaurin (aeb071)', 'Sotrastaurin [usan:inn]', 'Sotrastaurina', 'Sotrastaurine')",Medical," Sotrastaurin (AEB071) is an investigational immunosuppressant that blocks T-lymphocyte activation through protein kinase C inhibition. It is currently in Phase II of clinical development for the prevention of acute rejection after solid organ transplantation. In renal transplant clinical trials, sotrastaurin has been administered at doses of 200 to 300 mg twice daily. Using a validated liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry, steady-state predose blood concentrations averaged approximately 600 and 900 ng/mL at these dose levels, respectively. Sotrastaurin is primarily metabolized through CYP3A4. There is one active metabolite, N-desmethyl-sotrastaurin, that is present at low blood concentrations (less than 5% of the parent exposure). The elimination half-life of sotrastaurin averages 6 hours. Clinical drug interaction studies to date have demonstrated that sotrastaurin increases the area under the concentration-time curve of everolimus 1.2-fold and of tacrolimus twofold. Conversely, sotrastaurin area under the concentration-time curve is increased up to 1.8-fold by cyclosporine and 4.6-fold by ketoconazole. Blood samples from renal transplant patients receiving sotrastaurin were stimulated ex vivo by protein kinase C-dependent pathways. Inhibition of cytokine production, expression of CD69, and thymidine uptake served as biomarkers that demonstrated the ability of sotrastaurin to inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation at the doses used in these studies. Phase II trials have paired sotrastaurin with tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, or everolimus. The clinical and pharmacokinetic results of these and upcoming trials will determine the optimal immunosuppressive regimen to benefit from sotrastaurin's novel mechanism of action and whether therapeutic drug monitoring will be beneficial. Sotrastaurin is a protein kinase C inhibitor in development for prevention of rejection after liver transplantation. In a pharmacokinetic study, 13 de novo liver transplant recipients received 100 mg sotrastaurin once between days 1-3 and once between days 5-8 post-transplant. Sotrastaurin absorption based on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of total drug in blood (3544 ± 1434 ng·h/ml) was similar to that of healthy subjects in a previous study (4531 ± 1650 ng·h/ml). However, the sotrastaurin binding protein, α1-acid glycoprotein, was nominally higher in patients (1.07 ± 0.28 vs. 0.87 ± 0.16 g/l, P = 0.13) yielding a 60% lower AUC based on free drug versus that in healthy subjects (27 ± 13 vs. 62 ± 15 ng·h/ml, P < 0.0001). There was minor excretion of sotrastaurin in drained bile (1% of dose) consistent with the fact that sotrastaurin is extensively metabolized leaving little unchanged drug to excrete. In the first week after liver transplantation, sotrastaurin is bioavailable after oral administration. However, patients with elevated α1-acid glycoprotein levels may have lower free drug concentrations. Whether a higher dose of sotrastaurin is needed to compensate for this in the short-term after surgery will be addressed in future clinical trials.",Sotrastaurin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017970333283301443), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003137096355203539), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001939917216077447)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19876790/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21564523/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19491325/ ', [])"

It was developed by Merck and completed Phase III trials, used in combination with the NS5A replication complex inhibitor elbasvir under the trade name Zepatier, either with or without ribavirin. Grazoprevir is a second generation hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor acting at the NS3/4A protease targets. It has good activity against a range of HCV genotype variants, including some that are resistant to most currently used antiviral medications. == Side effects == Side effects have only been assessed in the combination with elbasvir. Common side effects of the combination include feeling tired, nausea, reduced appetite, and headache. Low red blood cell count has occurred when co-administered with ribavirin in some cases. The most important risks are alanine transaminase elevation, hyperbilirubinemia, drug resistance development and drug interactions. == Interactions == Grazoprevir is transported by the solute carrier proteins SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. Drugs that inhibit this proteins, such as rifampicin, ciclosporin, and a number of AIDS medications (atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cobicistat), can cause a significant increase in grazoprevir blood plasma levels.

Combination with drugs that induce this enzyme, such as efavirenz, carbamazepine or St. John's wort, can lead to ineffectively low plasma levels of grazoprevir. Combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Grazoprevir blocks NS3, a serine protease enzyme the virus needs for splitting its polyprotein into the functional virus proteins, and NS4A, a cofactor of NS3. === Pharmacokinetics === Grazoprevir reaches peak plasma concentrations two hours after oral intake together with elbasvir (variation between patients: 30 minutes to three hours). In hepatitis C patients, steady state concentrations are found after about six days. Plasma protein binding is 98.8%, mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.

Carbenoxolone is used for the treatment of peptic, esophageal and oral ulceration and inflammation. Electrolyte imbalance is a serious side effect of carbenoxolone when used systemically. Carbenoxolone reversibly inhibits the conversion of inactive cortisone to cortisol by blocking 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). 11β-HSD also reversibly catalyzes the conversion of 7-ketocholesterol to 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol. Carbenoxolone is a modestly potent, reasonably effective, water-soluble blocker of gap junctions. Carbenoxolone has also been used in topical creams such as Carbosan gel, marketed for treatment of lip sores and mouth ulcers. == Nootropic effects == Carbenoxolone has also been investigated for nootropic effects. This research started from an observation that long-term exposure to glucocorticoids may have negative effects on cognition. Carbenoxolone may decrease the amount of active glucocorticoid in the brain, because the drug inhibits 11β-HSD, an enzyme which regenerates cortisol, an active glucocorticoid, from inactive cortisone. In the research trial investigating this use of carbenoloxone, it was shown that the drug improved verbal fluency in elderly healthy men (aged 55–75). In type 2 diabetics aged 52–70, the drug improved verbal memory.

Since citric acid and isocitric acid are structural isomers, they share similar physical and chemical properties. Due to these similar properties, it is difficult to separate the isomers. Salts and esters of isocitric acid are known as isocitrates. The isocitrate anion is a substrate of the citric acid cycle. Isocitrate is formed from citrate with the help of the enzyme aconitase, and is acted upon by isocitrate dehydrogenase. Isocitric acid is commonly used as a marker to detect the authenticity and quality of fruit products, most often citrus juices. In authentic orange juice, for example, the ratio of citric acid to D-isocitric acid is usually less than 130. An isocitric acid value higher than this may be indicative of fruit juice adulteration. Isocitric acid has largely been used as a biochemical agent due to limited amounts. However, isocitric acid has been shown to have pharmaceutical and therapeutic effects. Isocitric acid has been shown to effectively treat iron deficient anemia. Additionally, isocitric acid could be used to treat Parkinson's disease. Yarrowia lipolytica can be used to produce isocitric acid and is inexpensive compared to other methods. Furthermore, other methods produce unequal amounts of citric acid to isocitric acid ratio, mostly producing citric acid.

The names of pyroglutamic acid conjugate base, anion, salts, and esters are pyroglutamate, 5-oxoprolinate, or pidolate. It is a metabolite in the glutathione cycle that is converted to glutamate by 5-oxoprolinase. Pyroglutamate is found in many proteins including bacteriorhodopsin. N-terminal glutamic acid and glutamine residues can spontaneously cyclize to become pyroglutamate, or enzymatically converted by glutaminyl cyclases. This is one of several forms of blocked N-termini which present a problem for N-terminal sequencing using Edman chemistry, which requires a free primary amino group not present in pyroglutamic acid. The enzyme pyroglutamate aminopeptidase can restore a free N-terminus by cleaving off the pyroglutamate residue. Pyroglutamic acid exists as two distinct enantiomers: (2R) or D which happens to be (+) or d (2S) or L which happens to be (–) or l == Metabolism == As first discovered in 1882, pyroglutamic acid can be formed by heating glutamic acid at 180 °C, which results in the loss of a molecule of water.

Pyroglutamic acid may function in glutamate storage, and acts to oppose the action of glutamate, including in the brain. It also acts on the brain's cholinergic system; Amyloid β containing pyroglutamic acid is increased in Alzheimer's disease; this may be part of the disease process. Increased levels of pyroglutamic acid in the blood, leading to excess in the urine (5-oxoprolinuria), can occur following paracetamol overdose, as well as in certain inborn errors of metabolism, causing high anion gap metabolic acidosis. == Uses == The sodium salt of pyroglutamic acid—known either as sodium pyroglutamate, sodium PCA, or sodium pidolate—is used for dry skin and hair products, as it is a humectant. It has low toxicity and is not a skin irritant, but its use in products is limited by a high price. L-pyroglutamic acid is sold online as a nootropic dietary supplement. Magnesium pidolate, the magnesium salt of pyroglutamic acid, is found in some mineral supplements.

The names of pyroglutamic acid conjugate base, anion, salts, and esters are pyroglutamate, 5-oxoprolinate, or pidolate. It is a metabolite in the glutathione cycle that is converted to glutamate by 5-oxoprolinase. Pyroglutamate is found in many proteins including bacteriorhodopsin. N-terminal glutamic acid and glutamine residues can spontaneously cyclize to become pyroglutamate, or enzymatically converted by glutaminyl cyclases. This is one of several forms of blocked N-termini which present a problem for N-terminal sequencing using Edman chemistry, which requires a free primary amino group not present in pyroglutamic acid. The enzyme pyroglutamate aminopeptidase can restore a free N-terminus by cleaving off the pyroglutamate residue.

2602,"('Arginine', 'H-dl-arg-oh', 'Arginine, free base', 'Arginin', 'Arginine, dl-')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Arginine is the amino acid with the formula (H2N)(HN)CN(H)(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. The molecule features a guanidino group appended to a standard amino acid framework. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−CO2−) and both the amino and guanidino groups are protonated, resulting in a cation. Only the l-arginine (symbol Arg or R) enantiomer is found naturally. Arg residues are common components of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG. The guanidine group in arginine is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. Like all amino acids, it is a white, water-soluble solid. The one-letter symbol R was assigned to arginine for its phonetic similarity. == History == Arginine was first isolated in 1886 from yellow lupin seedlings by the German chemist Ernst Schulze and his assistant Ernst Steiger. He named it from the Greek árgyros (ἄργυρος) meaning ""silver"" due to the silver-white appearance of arginine nitrate crystals. In 1897, Schulze and Ernst Winterstein (1865–1949) determined the structure of arginine. Schulze and Winterstein synthesized arginine from ornithine and cyanamide in 1899, but some doubts about arginine's structure lingered until Sørensen's synthesis of 1910. == Sources == === Production === It is traditionally obtained by hydrolysis of various cheap sources of protein, such as gelatin. It is obtained commercially by fermentation. In this way, 25-35 g/liter can be produced, using glucose as a carbon source. === Dietary sources === Arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people do not need to supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline. Additional, dietary arginine is necessary for otherwise healthy individuals temporarily under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury or sepsis, or if either of the major sites of arginine biosynthesis, the small intestine and kidneys, have reduced function, because the small bowel does the first step of the synthesizing process and the kidneys do the second. Arginine is an essential amino acid for birds, as they do not have a urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which need to be processed through the urea cycle, and if not enough arginine is present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation. Animal sources of arginine include meat, dairy products, and eggs, and plant sources include seeds of all types, for example grains, beans, and nuts. === Biosynthesis === Arginine is synthesized from citrulline in the urea cycle by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents. The pathways linking arginine, glutamine, and proline are bidirectional. Thus, the net use or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage. Arginine is made by the body as follows. The epithelial cells of the small intestine produce citrulline, primarily from glutamine and glutamate, which is secreted into the bloodstream which carries it to the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract the citrulline and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the blood. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis and thus create a dietary requirement for arginine. For such a person, arginine would become ""essential"". Synthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS). This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline to nitric oxide (citrulline-NO) or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, nitric oxide synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in nitric oxide producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of nitric oxide breakdown. == Function == Arginine plays an important role in cell division, wound healing, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. It is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), making it important in the regulation of blood pressure. Arginine is necessary for T-cells to function in the body, and can lead to their deregulation if depleted. === Proteins === Arginine's side chain is amphipathic, because at physiological pH it contains a positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, at the end of a hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the hydrophilic head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein. Arginine residues in proteins can be deiminated by PAD enzymes to form citrulline, in a post-translational modification process called citrullination.This is important in fetal development, is part of the normal immune process, as well as the control of gene expression, but is also significant in autoimmune diseases. Another post-translational modification of arginine involves methylation by protein methyltransferases. === Precursor === Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide, an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system's reaction to infection. Arginine is also a precursor for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate). The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium. == Structure == The amino acid side-chain of arginine consists of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a guanidinium group, which has a pKa of 13.8, and is therefore always protonated and positively charged at physiological pH. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds. == Research == === Growth hormone === Intravenously administered arginine is used in growth hormone stimulation tests because it stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. A review of clinical trials concluded that oral arginine increases growth hormone, but decreases growth hormone secretion, which is normally associated with exercising. However, a more recent trial reported that although oral arginine increased plasma levels of L-arginine it did not cause an increase in growth hormone. === Herpes-Simplex Virus (Cold sores) === Research from 1964 into amino acid requirements of herpes simplex virus in human cells indicated that ""...the lack of arginine or histidine, and possibly the presence of lysine, would interfere markedly with virus synthesis"", but concludes that ""no ready explanation is available for any of these observations"". Further reviews conclude that ""lysine's efficacy for herpes labialis may lie more in prevention than treatment."" and that ""the use of lysine for decreasing the severity or duration of outbreaks"" is not supported, while further research is needed. A 2017 study concludes that ""clinicians could consider advising patients that there is a theoretical role of lysine supplementation in the prevention of herpes simplex sores but the research evidence is insufficient to back this. Patients with cardiovascular or gallbladder disease should be cautioned and warned of the theoretical risks."" === High blood pressure === A meta-analysis showed that L-arginine reduces blood pressure with pooled estimates of 5.4 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 2.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Supplementation with l-arginine reduces diastolic blood pressure and lengthens pregnancy for women with gestational hypertension, including women with high blood pressure as part of pre-eclampsia. It did not lower systolic blood pressure or improve weight at birth. === Schizophrenia === Both liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assays have found that brain tissue of deceased people with schizophrenia shows altered arginine metabolism. Assays also confirmed significantly reduced levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but increased agmatine concentration and glutamate/GABA ratio in the schizophrenia cases. Regression analysis indicated positive correlations between arginase activity and the age of disease onset and between L-ornithine level and the duration of illness. Moreover, cluster analyses revealed that L-arginine and its main metabolites L-citrulline, L-ornithine and agmatine formed distinct groups, which were altered in the schizophrenia group. Despite this, the biological basis of schizophrenia is still poorly understood, a number of factors, such as dopamine hyperfunction, glutamatergic hypofunction, GABAergic deficits, cholinergic system dysfunction, stress vulnerability and neurodevelopmental disruption, have been linked to the aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the disease. === Raynaud's phenomenon === Oral L-arginine has been shown to reverse digital necrosis in Raynaud syndrome. == Safety and potential drug interactions == L-arginine is recognized as safe (GRAS-status) at intakes of up to 20 grams per day. L-arginine is found in many foods, such as fish, poultry, and dairy products, and is used as a dietary supplement. It may interact with various prescription drugs and herbal supplements. == See also == Arginine glutamate AAKG Canavanine and canaline are toxic analogs of arginine and ornithine. == References == == Sources == Griffiths JR, Unwin RD (2016).

This paper reviews the toxicity of HP-beta-CD, using both literature information and novel data, and presents new information. In addition, it includes a brief review from studies of the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of HP-beta-CD in both humans and animals. This review concludes that HP-beta-CD is well tolerated in the animal species tested (rats, mice and dogs), particularly when dosed orally, and shows only limited toxicity. In short duration studies, there were slight biochemical changes whereas studies of a longer duration, up to three months, produced additional minor haematological changes but no histopathological changes. When dosed intravenously, histopathological changes were seen in the lungs, liver and kidney but all findings were reversible and no effect levels were achieved. The carcinogenicity studies showed an increase in tumours in rats in the pancreas and intestines which are both considered to be rat-specific. There were also non-carcinogenic changes noted in the urinary tract, but these changes were also reversible and did not impair renal function. There were no effects on embryo-foetal development in either rats or rabbits. HP-beta-CD has been shown to be well tolerated in humans, with the main adverse event being diarrhoea and there have been no adverse events on kidney function, documented to date. Lifestyle- and genetically induced disorders related to disturbances in cholesterol metabolism have shown the detrimental impact of excessive cholesterol levels on a plethora of pathological processes such as inflammation. In this context, two-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) is increasingly considered as a novel pharmacological compound to decrease cellular cholesterol levels due to its ability to increase cholesterol solubility. However, recent findings have reported contra-indicating events after the use of CD questioning the clinical applicability of this compound. Given its potential as a therapeutic compound in metabolic inflammatory diseases, in this study, we evaluated the inflammatory effects of CD administration in the context of cholesterol-induced metabolic inflammation  Cholesterol accumulation is documented in various malignancies including breast cancer. Consequently, depleting cholesterol in cancer cells can serve as a viable treatment strategy. We identified the potency of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), a cholesterol-depletor in vitro against two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 (Oestrogen-receptor positive, ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)). The results were then compared against two non-cancerous cell lines using cytotoxic-, apoptosis-, and cholesterol-based assays.

2605,"('Doxepin (hydrochloride)', 'Doxepin', '(e)-doxepin', 'Trans-doxepin', 'Doxepinum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Doxepin is a medication belonging to the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) class of drugs used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, chronic hives, and insomnia. For hives it is a less preferred alternative to antihistamines. It has a mild to moderate benefit for sleeping problems. It is used as a cream for itchiness due to atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, and blurry vision. Serious side effects may include increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, mania, and urinary retention. A withdrawal syndrome may occur if the dose is rapidly decreased. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not generally recommended. Although how it works for treating depression remains an area of active inquiry, it may involve increasing the levels of norepinephrine, along with blocking histamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. Doxepin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 218th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Doxepin is used as a pill to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and chronic hives, and for short-term help with trouble remaining asleep after going to bed (a form of insomnia). As a cream it is used for short-term treatment of itchiness caused by atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus. === Insomnia === Doxepin is used in the treatment of insomnia. In 2016, the American College of Physicians advised that insomnia be treated first by treating comorbid conditions, then with cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral changes, and then with drugs; doxepin was among those recommended for short-term help maintaining sleep, on the basis of weak evidence. The 2017 American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendations focused on treatment with drugs were similar. A 2015 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review of treatments for insomnia had similar findings. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found that doxepin had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.30 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –0.05 to 0.64). The certainty of evidence was rated as very low, and no data were available for longer-term treatment (3 months). For comparison, the other sedating antihistamines assessed, trimipramine and doxylamine, had effect sizes (SMD) at 4 weeks of 0.55 (95% CI –0.11 to 1.21) (very low certainty evidence) and 0.47 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.89) (moderate certainty evidence), respectively. Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs generally showed larger effect sizes (e.g., SMDs of 0.45 to 0.83) than doxepin, whereas the effect sizes of orexin receptor antagonists, such as suvorexant, were more similar (SMDs of 0.23 to 0.44). Doses of doxepin used for sleep normally range from 3 to 6 mg, but high doses of up to 25 to 50 mg may be used as well. === Other uses === A 2010 review found that topical doxepin is useful to treat itchiness. A 2010 review of treatments for chronic hives found that doxepin had been superseded by better drugs but was still sometimes useful as a second-line treatment. == Contraindications == Known contraindications include: Hypersensitivities to doxepin, other TCAs, or any of the excipients inside the product used Glaucoma A predisposition to developing urinary retention such as in benign prostatic hyperplasia Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors in last 14 days === Pregnancy and lactation === Its use in pregnant and lactating women is advised against, although the available evidence suggests it is unlikely to cause negative effects on fetal development. The lack of evidence from human studies, however, means it is currently impossible to rule out any risk to the fetus and it is known to cross the placenta. Doxepin is secreted in breast milk and neonatal cases of respiratory depression in association with maternal doxepin use have been reported. == Side effects == Doxepin's side effects profile may differ from the list below in some countries where it is licensed to be used in much smaller doses (viz., 3 mg and 6 mg). Central nervous system: fatigue, dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, confusion, nightmares, agitation, increased anxiety, difficulty sleeping, seizures (infrequently), temporary confusion (delirium), rarely induction of hypomania and psychosis, extrapyramidal side effects (rarely), abuse in patients with polytoxicomania (rarely), ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Anticholinergic: dry mouth, constipation, even ileus (rarely), difficulties in urinating, sweating, precipitation of glaucoma Antiadrenergic: Low blood pressure, (if patient arises too fast from the lying/sitting position to standing—known as orthostatic hypotension), abnormal heart rhythms (e.g., sinus tachycardia, bradycardia, and atrioventricular block) Allergic/toxic: skin rash, photosensitivity, liver damage of the cholestatic type (rarely), hepatitis (extremely rare), leuko- or thrombocytopenia (rarely), agranulocytosis (very rarely), hypoplastic anemia (rarely) Others: frequently increased appetite and weight gain, rarely nausea, rarely high blood pressure. May increase or decrease liver enzyme levels in the blood of some people. The side effects of low-dose doxepin for insomnia in long-term clinical trials (28 to 85 days) in adults and elderly people were as follows: == Overdose == Like other TCAs, doxepin is highly toxic in cases of overdose. Mild symptoms include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic ileus), hyperthermia (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of doxepin overdose. Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a gastric lavage so as to reduce absorption of the doxepin. Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable. Antiarrhythmic agents may be an appropriate measure to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from doxepin overdose. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects. Haemodialysis is not recommended due to the high degree of protein binding with doxepin. ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after doxepin overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities. == Interactions == Doxepin should not be used within 14 days of using a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. It is advised not to be used in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine owing to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin owing to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions. == Pharmacology == Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) (a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine), with additional antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic activities. === Pharmacodynamics === Doxepin is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, or a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), and has additional antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic activities. It is specifically an antagonist of the histamine H1 and H2 receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, the α1-adrenergic receptor, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5). Similarly to other tricyclic antidepressants, doxepin is often prescribed as an effective alternative to SSRI medications. Doxepin is also a potent blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, and this action is thought to be involved in both its lethality in overdose and its effectiveness as an analgesic (including in the treatment of neuropathic pain, and as a local anesthetic). The potencies of doxepin in terms of its receptor antagonism specifically are as follows: Extremely strong: Histamine H1 receptor Strong: α1-adrenergic receptor, 5-HT2A and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors Moderate: 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors Weak: α2-adrenergic and D2 receptors Based on its IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values for monoamine reuptake inhibition, doxepin is relatively selective for the inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake, with a much weaker effect on the serotonin transporter. Although there is a significant effect that takes place at one of the specific serotonergic binding sites, the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor subtype. There is negligible influence on dopamine reuptake. The major metabolite of doxepin, nordoxepin (desmethyldoxepin), is pharmacologically active similarly, but relative to doxepin, is much more selective as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. In general, the demethylated variants of tertiary amine TCAs like nordoxepin are much more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake, less potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake, and less potent in their antiadrenergic, antihistamine, and anticholinergic activities. Antidepressant doses of doxepin are defined as 25 to 300 mg/day, although are typically above 75 mg/day. Antihistamine doses, including for dermatological uses and as a sedative/hypnotic for insomnia, are considered to be 3 to 25 mg, although higher doses between 25 and 50 mg and in some cases even up to 150 mg have been used to treat insomnia. At low doses, below 25 mg, doxepin is a pure antihistamine and has more of a sedative effect. At antidepressant doses of above 75 mg, doxepin is more stimulating with antiadrenergic, antiserotonergic, and anticholinergic effects, and these activities contribute to its side effects. Doxepin is a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers with an approximate ratio of 85:15. When doxepin was developed, no effort was made to separate or balance the mixture following its synthesis, resulting in the asymmetric ratio. (Z)-Doxepin is more active as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake than (E)-doxepin. The selectivity of doxepin for inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake over that of serotonin is likely due to the 85% presence of (E)-doxepin in the mixture. Most other tertiary amine TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine do not exhibit E-Z isomerism or such mixture asymmetry and are comparatively more balanced inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. ==== As a hypnotic ==== Doxepin is a highly potent antihistamine, with this being its strongest activity. In fact, doxepin has been said to be the most or one of the most potent H1 receptor antagonists available, with one study finding an in vitro Ki of 0.17 nM. It is the most potent and selective H1 receptor antagonist of the TCAs (although the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) mirtazapine is slightly more potent), and other sedating antihistamines, for instance the over-the-counter diphenhydramine (Ki = 16 nM) and doxylamine (Ki = 42 nM), show far lower affinities for this receptor in comparison. The affinity of doxepin for the H1 receptor is far greater than its affinity for other sites, and 10- to 100-fold higher doses are needed for antidepressant effects. In accordance, although it is often described as a ""dirty drug"" due to its highly promiscuous binding profile, doxepin acts as a highly selective antagonist of the H1 receptor at very low doses (less than 10 mg; typically 3 to 6 mg). At these doses, it notably has no clinically relevant anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth or cognitive/memory impairment, unlike most other sedating antihistamines, and similarly has no effect on other receptors such as adrenergic and serotonin receptors. The H1 receptor antagonism of doxepin is responsible for its hypnotic effects and its effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia at low doses. The incidence of side effects with doxepin and its safety at these doses was similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; the most frequent side effects were headache and somnolence/sedation, both with an incidence of less than 5%. Other side effects sometimes associated with antihistamines, including daytime sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain, all were not observed. Clinical evidence of H1 receptor antagonists and TCAs for the treatment insomnia shows mixed effectiveness and is limited in its quality due to weaknesses like small sample sizes and poor generalizability. However, doxepin is a unique and notable exception; it has been well-studied in the treatment of insomnia and shows consistent benefits with excellent tolerability and safety. Aside from diphenhydramine and doxylamine, which have historical approval as hypnotics, doxepin is the only H1 receptor antagonist that is specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia in the United States. The effect sizes of very low-dose doxepin in the treatment of insomnia range from small to medium. These include subjective and objective measures of sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Conversely, very low-dose doxepin shows relatively weak effects on sleep initiation and does not significantly separate from placebo on this measure. This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine (Z-drug) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency. However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of doxepin (50 to 300 mg/day), which have been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset. A positive dose–response relationship on sleep measures was observed for doses of doxepin between 1 and 6 mg in clinical studies, whereas the incidence of adverse effects remained constant across this dose range in both young and older adults. However, the incidence of adverse effects appeared to increase with longer treatment duration. A dose of doxepin as low as 1 mg/day was found to significantly improve most of the assessed sleep measures, but unlike the 3 and 6 mg/day doses, was not able to improve wake time during sleep. This, along with greater effect sizes with the higher doses, was likely the basis for the approval of the 3 and 6 mg doses of doxepin for insomnia and not the 1 mg dose. At very low doses, doxepin has not shown discontinuation or withdrawal effects nor rebound insomnia. Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies of up to 12 weeks duration. This appears to be in contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of tolerance and dependence (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness. It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1 week). It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but it has been suggested that it may have to do with the lack of selectivity for the H1 receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses. Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and confusion. This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65. Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H1 receptor blockade. Antagonism of the H1, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and α1-adrenergic receptors is thought to have sleep-promoting effects and to be responsible for the sedative effects of TCAs including those of doxepin. Although doxepin is selective for the H1 receptor at doses lower than 25 mg, blockade of serotonin and adrenergic receptors may also be involved in the hypnotic effects of doxepin at higher doses. However, in contrast to very low doses of doxepin, rebound insomnia and daytime sedation are significantly more frequent than placebo with moderate doses (25 to 50 mg/day) of the drug. In addition, one study found that although such doses of doxepin improved sleep measures initially, most of the benefits were lost with chronic treatment (by 4 weeks). Due to limited data however, more research on potential tolerance and withdrawal effects of moderate doses of doxepin is needed. At these doses of doxepin, dry mouth, an anticholinergic effect, was common (71%), and other side effects such as headache (25%), increased appetite (21%), and dizziness (21%) were also frequently observed, although these adverse effects were notably not significantly more frequent than with placebo in the study in question. In any case, taken together, higher doses of doxepin than very low doses are associated with an increased rate of side effects as well as apparent loss of hypnotic effectiveness with chronic treatment. Doxepin at a dose of 25 mg/day for 3 weeks has been found to decrease cortisol levels by 16% in adults with chronic insomnia and to increase melatonin production by 26% in healthy volunteers. In individuals with neuroendocrine dysregulation in the form of nocturnal melatonin deficiency presumably due to chronic insomnia, very-low-dose doxepin was found to restore melatonin levels to near-normal values after 3 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the circadian sleep–wake cycle may be involved in the beneficial effects of doxepin on sleep and insomnia. ==== CYP2D6 inhibition ==== Doxepin has been identified as an inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vivo in a study of human patients being treated with 75 to 250 mg/day for depression. While it significantly altered metabolic ratios for sparteine and its metabolites, doxepin did not convert any of the patients to a different metabolizer phenotype (e.g., extensive to intermediate or poor). Nonetheless, inhibition of CYP2D6 by doxepin could be of clinical importance. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Doxepin is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but between 55 and 87% undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in a mean oral bioavailability of approximately 29%. Following a single very low dose of 6 mg, peak plasma levels of doxepin are 0.854 ng/mL (3.06 nmol/L) at 3 hours without food and 0.951 ng/mL (3.40 nmol/L) at 6 hours with food. Plasma concentrations of doxepin with antidepressant doses are far greater, ranging between 50 and 250 ng/mL (180 to 900 nmol/L). Area-under-curve levels of the drug are increased significantly when it is taken with food. ==== Distribution ==== Doxepin is widely distributed throughout the body and is approximately 80% plasma protein-bound, specifically to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. ==== Metabolism ==== Doxepin is extensively metabolized by the liver via oxidation and N-demethylation. Its metabolism is highly stereoselective. Based on in vitro research, the major enzymes involved in the metabolism of doxepin are the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 also involved to a lesser extent. The major active metabolite of doxepin, nordoxepin, is formed mainly by CYP2C19 (>50% contribution), while CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent, and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are not involved. Both doxepin and nordoxepin are hydroxylated mainly by CYP2D6, and both doxepin and nordoxepin are also transformed into glucuronide conjugates. The elimination half-life of doxepin is about 15–18 hours, whereas that of nordoxepin is around 28–31 hours. Up to 10% of Caucasian individuals show substantially reduced metabolism of doxepin that can result in up to 8-fold elevated plasma concentrations of the drug compared to normal. Nordoxepin is a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers similarly to doxepin. Whereas pharmaceutical doxepin is supplied in an approximate 85:15 ratio mixture of (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers and plasma concentrations of doxepin remain roughly the same as this ratio with treatment, plasma levels of the (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers of nordoxepin, due to stereoselective metabolism of doxepin by cytochrome P450 enzymes, are approximately 1:1. ==== Elimination ==== Doxepin is excreted primarily in the urine and predominantly in the form of glucuronide conjugates, with less than 3% of a dose excreted unchanged as doxepin or nordoxepin. === Pharmacogenetics === Since doxepin is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of doxepin may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of cytochrome P450 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most people are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of doxepin. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers break down doxepin much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. A study assessed the metabolism of a single 75 mg oral dose of doxepin in healthy volunteers with genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes. In CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, the mean clearance rates of (E)-doxepin were 406, 247, and 127 L/hour, respectively (~3-fold difference between extensive and poor). In addition, the bioavailability of (E)-doxepin was about 2-fold lower in extensive relative to poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, indicating a significant role of CYP2D6 in the first-pass metabolism of (E)-doxepin. The clearance of (E)-doxepin in CYP2C9 slow metabolizers was also significantly reduced at 238 L/hour. CYP2C19 was involved in the metabolism of (Z)-doxepin, with clearance rates of 191 L/hour in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers and 73 L/hour in poor metabolizers (~2.5-fold difference). Area-under-the-curve (0–48 hour) levels of nordoxepin were dependent on the genotype of CYP2D6 with median values of 1.28, 1.35, and 5.28 nM•L/hour in CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively (~4-fold difference between extensive and poor). Taken together, doxepin metabolism appears to be highly stereoselective, and CYP2D6 genotype has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics of (E)-doxepin. Moreover, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as well as patients taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (which can potentially convert a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer into a poor metabolizer), may be at an increased risk for adverse effects of doxepin due to their slower clearance of the drug. Another study assessed doxepin and nordoxepin metabolism in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid, extensive, and poor metabolizers following a single 75 mg oral dose. They found up to more than 10-fold variation in total exposure to doxepin and nordoxepin between the different groups. The researchers suggested that in order to achieve equivalent exposure, based on an average dose of 100%, the dosage of doxepin might be adjusted to 250% in ultra-rapid metabolizers, 150% in extensive metabolizers, 50% in intermediate metabolizers, and 30% in poor metabolizers. == Chemistry == Doxepin is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzoxepin, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is the only TCA with a dibenzoxepin ring system to have been marketed. Doxepin is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nordoxepin being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), and trimipramine. Doxepin is a mixture of (E) and (Z) stereoisomers (the latter being known as cidoxepin or cis-doxepin) and is used commercially in a ratio of approximately 85:15. The chemical name of doxepin is (E/Z)-3-(dibenzo[b,e]oxepin-11(6H)-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21NO with a molecular weight of 279.376 g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 1668-19-5 and of the hydrochloride is 1229-29-4. == History == Doxepin was discovered in Germany in 1963 and was introduced in the United States as an antidepressant in 1969. It was subsequently approved at very low doses in the United States for the treatment of insomnia in 2010. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Doxepin is the generic name of the drug in English and German and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while doxepin hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are doxepina, in French and its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française are doxépine, and in Latin is doxepinum. The cis or (Z) stereoisomer of doxepin is known as cidoxepin, and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name while cidoxepin hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. === Brand names === It was introduced under the brand names Quitaxon and Aponal by Boehringer and as Sinequan by Pfizer. Doxepin is marketed under many brand names worldwide, including: Adnor, Anten, Antidoxe, Colian, Deptran, Dofu, Doneurin, Dospin, Doxal, Doxepini, Doxesom, Doxiderm, Flake, Gilex, Ichderm, Li Ke Ning, Mareen, Noctaderm, Oxpin, Patoderm, Prudoxin, Qualiquan, Quitaxon, Sagalon, Silenor, Sinepin, Sinequan, Sinquan, and Zonalon. It is also marketed as a combination drug with levomenthol under the brand name Doxure. === Approvals === The oral formulations of doxepin are FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of depression and sleep-maintenance insomnia, and its topical formulations are FDA-approved the short-term management for some itchy skin conditions. In Australia and the United Kingdom, the only licensed indications are in the treatment of major depression and pruritus in eczema. == Research == === Antihistamine === Cidoxepin is under development by Elorac, Inc. for the treatment of chronic urticaria (hives). As of 2017, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication. The drug was also under investigation for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and contact dermatitis, but development for these indications was discontinued. === Headache === Doxepin is under development by Winston Pharmaceuticals in an intranasal formulation for the treatment of headache. As of August 2015, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication. === Neuropathic pain === As of 2017, there is no good evidence that topical doxepin is useful to treat localized neuropathic pain. == References == == External links == Media related to Doxepin at Wikimedia Commons",Trans-doxepin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9146995327901095e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001445904199499637), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002481002826243639)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01416350994259119), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/doxepin-oral-route/description/drg-20072083?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=135, start_index=9, title='Doxepin (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/doxepin-oral-route/description/drg-20072083?utm_source=openai')])"
2606,"('Racecadotril', 'Acetorphan', 'Benzyl 2-(3-(acetylthio)-2-benzylpropanamido)acetate', 'Hidrasec', 'Racecadotril (acetorphan)')",Medical,"Racecadotril, also known as acetorphan, is an antidiarrheal medication which acts as a peripheral enkephalinase inhibitor. Unlike other opioid medications used to treat diarrhea, which reduce intestinal motility, racecadotril has an antisecretory effect — it reduces the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestine. It is available in France (where it was first introduced in ~1990) and other European countries (including Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Finland, Russia and the Czech Republic) as well as most of South America and some South East Asian countries (including China, India and Thailand), but not in the United States. It is sold under the tradename Hidrasec, among others. Thiorphan is the active metabolite of racecadotril, which exerts the bulk of its inhibitory actions on enkephalinases. == Medical uses == Racecadotril is used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and adults and has better tolerability than loperamide, as it causes less constipation and flatulence. Several guidelines have recommended racecadotril use in addition to oral rehydration treatment in children with acute diarrhea. == Contraindications == Racecadotril has no contraindications apart from known hypersensitivity to the substance. There is insufficient data for the therapy of chronic diarrhea, for patients with renal or hepatic failure, and for children under three months. Additional contraindications for the children's formulation are hereditary fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption and saccharase deficiency, as it contains sugar. == Side effects == The most common adverse effect is headache, which occurs in 1–2% of patients. Rashes occur in fewer than 1% of patients. Other described skin reactions include itching, urticaria, angioedema, erythema multiforme, and erythema nodosum. == Overdose == No cases of overdose are known. Adults have tolerated 20-fold therapeutic doses without ill effects. == Interactions == No interactions in humans have been described. Combining racecadotril with an ACE inhibitor can theoretically increase the risk for angioedema. Racecadotril and its main metabolites neither inhibit nor induce the liver enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. They also do not induce UGT enzymes. This means that racecadotril has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Enkephalins are peptides produced by the body that act on opioid receptors with preference for the δ subtype. Activation of δ receptors inhibits the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, decreasing intracellular levels of the messenger molecule cAMP. The active metabolite of racecadotril, thiorphan, inhibits enkephalinase enzymes in the intestinal epithelium with an IC50 of 6.1 nM, protecting enkephalins from being broken down by these enzymes. (Racecadotril itself is much less potent at 4500 nM.) This reduces diarrhea related hypersecretion in the small intestine without influencing basal secretion. Racecadotril also has no influence on the time substances, bacteria or virus particles stay in the intestine. === Pharmacokinetics === Racecadotril is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and reaches Cmax within 60 minutes. Food delays Cmax by 60 to 90 minutes but does not affect the overall bioavailability. Racecadotril is rapidly and effectively metabolized to the moderately active S-acetylthiorphan the main active metabolite thiorphan, of which 90% are bound to blood plasma proteins. In therapeutic doses, racecadotril does not pass the blood–brain barrier. Inhibition of enkephalinases starts 30 minutes after administration, reaches its maximum (75–90% inhibition with a therapeutic dose) two hours after administration, and lasts for eight hours. The elimination half-life, measured from enkephalinase inhibition, is three hours. Thiorphan is further metabolized to inactive metabolites such as the methyl thioether and the methyl sulfoxide. Both active and inactive metabolites are excreted, mostly via the kidney (81.4%), and to a lesser extent via the feces (8%). == Society and culture == === Brand names === In France, Portugal and Spain it is sold as Tiorfan and in Italy as Tiorfix, in Czech Republic as Enditril. In India it is available as Redotril and Enuff. In the Philippines it is sold as Hidrasec. == See also == Ecadotril, the (S)-enantiomer of racecadotril D/DL-Phenylalanine RB-101 == References == == External links == Media related to Racecadotril at Wikimedia Commons ""Racecadotril"".

2607,"('Brivudine', 'Bromovinyldeoxyuridine', ""(e)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine"", 'Brivudin', 'Helpin')",Medical,"Brivudine (trade names Zostex, Mevir, Brivir, among others) is an antiviral drug used in the treatment of herpes zoster (""shingles""). Like other antivirals, it acts by inhibiting replication of the target virus. == Medical uses == Brivudine is used for the treatment of herpes zoster in adult patients. It is taken orally once daily, in contrast to aciclovir, valaciclovir and other antivirals. A study has found that it is more effective than aciclovir, but this has been disputed because of a possible conflict of interest on part of the study authors. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in patients undergoing immunosuppression (for example because of an organ transplant) or cancer therapy, especially with fluorouracil (5-FU) and chemically related (pro)drugs such as capecitabine and tegafur, as well as the antimycotic drug flucytosine, which is also related to 5-FU. It has not been proven to be safe in children and pregnant or breastfeeding women. == Adverse effects == The drug is generally well tolerated. The only common side effect is nausea (in 2% of patients). Less common side effects (<1%) include headache, increased or lowered blood cell counts (granulocytopenia, anaemia, lymphocytosis, monocytosis), increased liver enzymes, and allergic reactions. == Interactions == Brivudine interacts strongly and in rare cases lethally with the anticancer drug fluorouracil (5-FU), its prodrugs and related substances. Even topically applied 5-FU can be dangerous in combination with brivudine. This is caused by the main metabolite, bromovinyluracil (BVU), irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) which is necessary for inactivating 5-FU. After a standard brivudine therapy, DPD function can be compromised for up to 18 days. This interaction is shared with the closely related drug sorivudine which also has BVU as its main metabolite. There are no other relevant interactions. Brivudine does not significantly influence the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. == Pharmacology == === Spectrum of activity === The drug inhibits replication of varicella zoster virus (VZV) – which causes herpes zoster – and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but not HSV-2 which typically causes genital herpes. In vitro, inhibitory concentrations against VZV are 200- to 1000-fold lower than those of aciclovir and penciclovir, theoretically indicating a much higher potency of brivudine. Clinically relevant VZV strains are particularly sensitive. === Mechanism of action === Brivudine is an analogue of the nucleoside thymidine. The active compound is brivudine 5'-triphosphate, which is formed in subsequent phosphorylations by viral (but not human) thymidine kinase and presumably by nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. Brivudine 5'-triphosphate works because it is incorporated into the viral DNA, but then blocks the action of DNA polymerases, thus inhibiting viral replication. === Pharmacokinetics === Brivudine is well and rapidly absorbed from the gut and undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, where the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase quickly splits off the sugar component, leading to a bioavailability of 30%. The resulting metabolite is bromovinyluracil (BVU), which does not have antiviral activity. BVU is also the only metabolite that can be detected in the blood plasma. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. Brivudine is almost completely (>95%) bound to plasma proteins. Terminal half-life is 16 hours; 65% of the substance are found in the urine and 20% in the faeces, mainly in form of an acetic acid derivative (which is not detectable in the plasma), but also other water-soluble metabolites, which are urea derivatives. Less than 1% is excreted in form of the original compound. == Chemistry == The molecule has three chiral carbon atoms in the deoxyribose (sugar) part all of which have defined orientation; i.e. the drug is stereochemically pure. The substance is a white powder. == Manufacturing == Main supplier is Berlin Chemie, now part of Italy's Menarini Group. In Central America is provided by Menarini Centro America and Wyeth. == History == The substance was first synthesized by scientists at the University of Birmingham in the UK in 1976. It was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HSV-1 and VZV by Erik De Clercq at the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Belgium in 1979. In the 1980s the drug became commercially available in East Germany, where it was marketed as Helpin by a pharmaceutical company called Berlin-Chemie. Only after the indication was changed to the treatment of herpes zoster in 2001 did it become more widely available in Europe. Brivudine is approved for use in a number of European countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. == Etymology == The name brivudine derives from the chemical nomenclature bromo-vinyl-deoxyuridine or BVDU for short. It is sold under trade names such as Bridic, Brival, Brivex, Brivir, Brivirac, Brivox, Brivuzost, Zerpex, Zonavir, Zostex, and Zovudex. == Research == A Cochrane Systematic Review examined the effectiveness of multiple antiviral drugs in the treatment of herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis. Brivudine was found to be significantly more effective than idoxuridine in increasing the number of successfully healed eyes of participants. == See also == Related antiviral drugs Aciclovir Valacyclovir, a prodrug form of aciclovir Famciclovir, an analogue of Penciclovir with greater oral availability Foscarnet, an intravenous antiviral for aciclovir-resistant VZV Penciclovir, a topical preparation Vaccines and other treatments Zostavax, a live virus Herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine Varivax, a live virus Varicella Zoster (chickenpox) vaccine Shingrix, a recombinant subunit vaccine for shingles VZV immune globulin, an antibody-based treatment for immune-suppressed patients with zoster == References ==",Helpin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0010931475553661585), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0041399020701646805)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.25208836793899536), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

2610,"('Œ≤-carotene', 'Provitamin a', 'Beta-carotene', 'Beta carotene', 'Beta,beta-carotene')","Food, Medical","β-Carotene (beta-carotene) is an organic, strongly colored red-orange pigment abundant in fungi, plants, and fruits. It is a member of the carotenes, which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons. Dietary β-carotene is a provitamin A compound, converting in the body to retinol (vitamin A). In foods, it has rich content in carrots, pumpkin, spinach, and sweet potato. It is used as a dietary supplement and may be prescribed to treat erythropoietic protoporphyria, an inherited condition of sunlight sensitivity. β-carotene is the most common carotenoid in plants. When used as a food coloring, it has the E number E160a.: 119 The structure was deduced in 1930. Isolation of β-carotene from fruits abundant in carotenoids is commonly done using column chromatography. It is industrially extracted from richer sources such as the algae Dunaliella salina. The separation of β-carotene from the mixture of other carotenoids is based on the polarity of a compound. β-Carotene is a non-polar compound, so it is separated with a non-polar solvent such as hexane. Being highly conjugated, it is deeply colored, and as a hydrocarbon lacking functional groups, it is lipophilic. == Provitamin A activity == Plant carotenoids are the primary dietary source of provitamin A worldwide, with β-carotene as the best-known provitamin A carotenoid. Others include α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoid absorption is restricted to the duodenum of the small intestine. One molecule of β-carotene can be cleaved by the intestinal enzyme β,β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase into two molecules of vitamin A. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == As part of the digestive process, food-sourced carotenoids must be separated from plant cells and incorporated into lipid-containing micelles to be bioaccessible to intestinal enterocytes. If already extracted (or synthetic) and then presented in an oil-filled dietary supplement capsule, there is greater bioavailability compared to that from foods. At the enterocyte cell wall, β-carotene is taken up by the membrane transporter protein scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SCARB1). Absorbed β-carotene is then either incorporated as such into chylomicrons or first converted to retinal and then retinol, bound to retinol binding protein 2, before being incorporated into chylomicrons. The conversion process consists of one molecule of β-carotene cleaved by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene, into two molecules of retinal. When plasma retinol is in the normal range the gene expression for SCARB1 and BCO1 are suppressed, creating a feedback loop that suppresses β-carotene absorption and conversion. The majority of chylomicrons are taken up by the liver, then secreted into the blood repackaged into low density lipoproteins (LDLs). From these circulating lipoproteins and the chylomicrons that bypassed the liver, β-carotene is taken into cells via receptor SCARB1. Human tissues differ in expression of SCARB1, and hence β-carotene content. Examples expressed as ng/g, wet weight: liver=479, lung=226, prostate=163 and skin=26. Once taken up by peripheral tissue cells, the major usage of absorbed β-carotene is as a precursor to retinal via symmetric cleavage by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene. A lesser amount is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme beta-carotene 9',10'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO2 gene. The products of this asymmetric cleavage are two beta-ionone molecules and rosafluene. BCO2 appears to be involved in preventing excessive accumulation of carotenoids; a BCO2 defect in chickens results in yellow skin color due to accumulation in subcutaneous fat. == Conversion factors == For counting dietary vitamin A intake, β-carotene may be converted either using the newer retinol activity equivalents (RAE) or the older international unit (IU). === Retinol activity equivalents (RAEs) === Since 2001, the US Institute of Medicine uses retinol activity equivalents (RAE) for their Dietary Reference Intakes, defined as follows: 1 μg RAE = 1 μg retinol from food or supplements 1 μg RAE = 2 μg all-trans-β-carotene from supplements 1 μg RAE = 12 μg of all-trans-β-carotene from food 1 μg RAE = 24 μg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food RAE takes into account carotenoids' variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans better than and replaces the older retinol equivalent (RE) (1 μg RE = 1 μg retinol, 6 μg β-carotene, or 12 μg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin). RE was developed 1967 by the United Nations/World Health Organization Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO/WHO). === International Units === Another older unit of vitamin A activity is the international unit (IU). Like retinol equivalent, the international unit does not take into account carotenoid variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans, as well as the more modern retinol activity equivalent. Food and supplement labels still generally use IU, but IU can be converted to the more useful retinol activity equivalent as follows: 1 μg RAE = 3.33 IU retinol 1 IU retinol = 0.3 μg RAE 1 IU β-carotene from supplements = 0.3 μg RAE 1 IU β-carotene from food = 0.05 μg RAE 1 IU α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food = 0.025 μg RAE1 == Dietary sources == The average daily intake of β-carotene is in the range 2–7 mg, as estimated from a pooled analysis of 500,000 women living in the US, Canada, and some European countries. Beta-carotene is found in many foods and is sold as a dietary supplement. β-Carotene contributes to the orange color of many different fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese gac (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng.) and crude palm oil are particularly rich sources, as are yellow and orange fruits, such as cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and papayas, and orange root vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes. The color of β-carotene is masked by chlorophyll in green leaf vegetables such as spinach, kale, sweet potato leaves, and sweet gourd leaves. The U.S. Department of Agriculture lists foods high in β-carotene content: === No dietary requirement === Government and non-government organizations have not set a dietary requirement for β-carotene. == Side effects == Excess β-carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body. The most common side effect of excessive β-carotene consumption is carotenodermia, a physically harmless condition that presents as a conspicuous orange skin tint arising from deposition of the carotenoid in the outermost layer of the epidermis. === Carotenosis === Carotenoderma, also referred to as carotenemia, is a benign and reversible medical condition where an excess of dietary carotenoids results in orange discoloration of the outermost skin layer. It is associated with a high blood β-carotene value. This can occur after a month or two of consumption of beta-carotene rich foods, such as carrots, carrot juice, tangerine juice, mangos, or in Africa, red palm oil. β-carotene dietary supplements can have the same effect. The discoloration extends to palms and soles of feet, but not to the white of the eye, which helps distinguish the condition from jaundice. Carotenodermia is reversible upon cessation of excessive intake. Consumption of greater than 30 mg/day for a prolonged period has been confirmed as leading to carotenemia. === No risk for hypervitaminosis A === At the enterocyte cell wall, β-carotene is taken up by the membrane transporter protein scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SCARB1). Absorbed β-carotene is then either incorporated as such into chylomicrons or first converted to retinal and then retinol, bound to retinol binding protein 2, before being incorporated into chylomicrons. The conversion process consists of one molecule of β-carotene cleaved by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene, into two molecules of retinal. When plasma retinol is in the normal range the gene expression for SCARB1 and BCO1 are suppressed, creating a feedback loop that suppresses absorption and conversion. Because of these two mechanisms, high intake will not lead to hypervitaminosis A. === Drug interactions === β-Carotene can interact with medication used for lowering cholesterol. Taking them together can lower the effectiveness of these medications and is considered only a moderate interaction. Bile acid sequestrants and proton-pump inhibitors can decrease absorption of β-carotene. Consuming alcohol with β-carotene can decrease its ability to convert to retinol and could possibly result in hepatotoxicity. Research on animal feeds, suggests that β-Carotene might act as an ""antivitamin D"" that counteracts the availability in forages of vitamin D. === β-Carotene and lung cancer in smokers === Chronic high doses of β-carotene supplementation increases the probability of lung cancer in smokers while its natural vitamer, retinol, increases lung cancer in smokers and nonsmokers. The effect is specific to supplementation dose as no lung damage has been detected in those who are exposed to cigarette smoke and who ingest a physiological dose of β-carotene (6 mg), in contrast to high pharmacological dose (30 mg). Increases in lung cancer have been attributed to the tendency of β-carotene to oxidize, yet based on the pharmacokinetics of β-carotene absorption and transport through the intestine and the lack of specific β-carotene transporters, it is unlikely that β-carotene reaches the lung of smokers in sufficient quantities. Additional research is required to understand the link between the increased risk of cancer and all-cause mortality following β-carotene supplementation. Additionally, supplemental, high-dose β-carotene may increase the risk of prostate cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiovascular and total mortality irrespective of smoking status. == Industrial sources == β-carotene is industrially made either by total synthesis (see Retinol § Industrial synthesis) or by extraction from biological sources such as vegetables, microalgae (especially Dunaliella salina), and genetically-engineered microbes. The synthetic path is low-cost and high-yield. == Research == Medical authorities generally recommend obtaining beta-carotene from food rather than dietary supplements. A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that high-dosage (≥9.6 mg/day) beta-carotene supplementation is associated with a 6% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality, while low-dosage (<9.6 mg/day) supplementation does not have a significant effect on mortality. Research is insufficient to determine whether a minimum level of beta-carotene consumption is necessary for human health and to identify what problems might arise from insufficient beta-carotene intake. However, a 2018 meta-analysis mostly of prospective cohort studies found that both dietary and circulating beta-carotene are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. The highest circulating beta-carotene category, compared to the lowest, correlated with a 37% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, while the highest dietary beta-carotene intake category, compared to the lowest, was linked to an 18% decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality. === Macular degeneration === Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people. AMD is an oxidative stress, retinal disease that affects the macula, causing progressive loss of central vision. β-carotene content is confirmed in human retinal pigment epithelium. Reviews reported mixed results for observational studies, with some reporting that diets higher in β-carotene correlated with a decreased risk of AMD whereas other studies reporting no benefits. Reviews reported that for intervention trials using only β-carotene, there was no change to risk of developing AMD. === Cancer === A meta-analysis concluded that supplementation with β-carotene does not appear to decrease the risk of cancer overall, nor specific cancers including: pancreatic, colorectal, prostate, breast, melanoma, or skin cancer generally. High levels of β-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in current and former smokers. Results are not clear for thyroid cancer. === Cataract === A Cochrane review looked at supplementation of β-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, independently and combined, on people to examine differences in risk of cataract, cataract extraction, progression of cataract, and slowing the loss of visual acuity. These studies found no evidence of any protective effects afforded by β-carotene supplementation on preventing and slowing age-related cataract. A second meta-analysis compiled data from studies that measured diet-derived serum beta-carotene and reported a not statistically significant 10% decrease in cataract risk. === Erythropoietic protoporphyria === High doses of β-carotene (up to 180 mg per day) may be used as a treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria, a rare inherited disorder of sunlight sensitivity, without toxic effects. === Food drying === Foods rich in carotenoid dyes show discoloration upon drying. This is due to thermal degradation of carotenoids, possibly via isomerization and oxidation reactions. == See also == Sunless tanning with beta-carotene Vitamin A Retinol Carotenoids == References ==",Beta carotene,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.3877161741256714), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' MED', -0.44794368743896484), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0007107630372047424), (' INDUSTR', -0.22555457055568695), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.12783189117908478), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -3.635817120084539e-05), ('ĠMED', -0.07557176798582077), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.3132858872413635), ('ĠINDU', -0.10442564636468887), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -2.9205850296420977e-05), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04863695055246353)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Carotene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=115, start_index=30, title='Β-Carotene', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Carotene?utm_source=openai')])"

Minoxidil acts as a prodrug of minoxidil sulfate. Minoxidil sulfate is formed from minoxidil via sulfotransferase enzymes, with the predominant enzyme responsible, at least in hair follicles, being SULT1A1. Minoxidil sulfate acts as a potassium channel opener, among other actions, and has vasodilating, hypotensive, and trichogenic or hypertrichotic (hair growth-promoting) effects. Its mechanism of action in terms of hair growth is still unknown, although multiple potential mechanisms have been implicated. Minoxidil sulfate is a sulfate ester of minoxidil, not a sulfate salt of the compound. However, minoxidil sulfate forms an inner salt, which makes it more hydrophobic than minoxidil. This is in contrast to most sulfate esters, which are usually more hydrophilic than their non-ester forms. The bioactivation of minoxidil into minoxidil sulfate is very unusual and is among the only known instances of sulfation producing a more active drug form. Normally, sulfation tends to inactivate drugs by reducing their biological activity and increasing their excretion. Minoxidil sulfate is highly unstable in aqueous solutions and alcohol-containing solvents, with a half-life of 6 hours in aqueous solutions and a further much lower half-life in alcohol-containing solvents. This has served as a limiting factor in its potential pharmaceutical use and therapeutic effectiveness. Moreover, minoxidil sulfate has a 40% higher molecular weight than minoxidil, and this may reduce its absorption into the scalp. In any case, a minoxidil sulfate-based topical formulation has been investigated for the treatment of scalp hair loss. Additionally, minoxidil-sulfate-based topical formulations appear to be available for medical use in some parts of the world, for instance in Brazil. == References ==",Minoxidil sulfate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.03329489007592201), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.006721417419612408), (' END', -0.00981181114912033), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -3.15441757265944e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004135706985834986), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1002521961927414)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoxidil_sulfate,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2230218/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/minoxidil-sulfate ', [])"

By selectively targeting the A1 receptor, tecadenoson may be associated with fewer adverse effects such as flushing, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and hypotension than adenosine, which is a nonselective agonist of all 4 adenosine receptors. Based on the results of phase I and phase II clinical trials, tecadenoson appears to be an effective agent for producing rapid and sustained conversion of PSVT to sinus rhythm. Additionally, the adverse effects that are typically attributed to adenosine's nonselective stimulation of the A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors appear to occur less frequently with the use of tecadenoson. Tecadenoson also appears to be associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation following conversion of PSVT compared with the rates that have been associated with adenosine in the literature. A randomized, prospective trial will need to be conducted in the future to appropriately compare the safety and efficacy of tecadenoson and adenosine. Tecadenoson is a potent selective A1-adenosine receptor agonist with a dose-dependent negative dromotropic effect on the AV node. Tecadenoson terminates induced paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) without the clinically significant side effects caused by stimulation of other adenosine receptors. This trial was designed to determine a safe and effective tecadenoson bolus for termination of electrophysiologically induced PSVT. Patients with a history of symptomatic PSVT and inducible PSVT at the time of a clinically indicated electrophysiology study were randomized into a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Five 2-dose tecadenoson bolus regimens were evaluated versus placebo (75/150, 150/300, 300/600, 450/900, 900 microg/900 microg). The second bolus was administered only if PSVT persisted for 1 minute after the first bolus. Each tecadenoson regimen resulted in a significant therapeutic conversion rate compared with placebo (range, 50.0% to 90.3%, analysis of all patients dosed; n=181; P<0.0005). Conversion by the first bolus was dose related (range: placebo, 3.3% to 86.7% for 900 microg/900 microg). Time to conversion was dose dependent, with a median time of <1 minute for the 3 highest dose regimens. Postconversion arrhythmias were transient, requiring no additional treatment in 4 regimens (including placebo). Transient second- and third-degree heart block occurred at higher doses (300/600, 450/900, 900 microg/900 microg) and was supported with backup pacing when needed. No effect on blood pressure was observed. Ten patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tolerated tecadenoson without bronchospasm. We identified an optimal tecadenoson regimen (300 microg/600 microg) that effectively and rapidly converted 90% (28 of 31) of PSVT patients to normal sinus rhythm with no significant adverse effects. The high density of A1 adenosine receptors in the brain results in significant potential for central nervous system (CNS)-related adverse effects with A1 agonists. Tecadenoson is a selective A1 adenosine receptor agonist with close similarity to adenosine. We studied the binding and transmembrane transport of tecadenoson by recombinant human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs) hENT1 and hENT2, and human concentrative nucleoside transporters (hCNTs) hCNT1, hCNT2, and hCNT3 in vitro and by mouse mENT1 in vivo. Binding affinities of the five recombinant human nucleoside transporters for tecadenoson differed (hENT1 > hCNT1 > hCNT3 > hENT2 > hCNT2), and tecadenoson was transported largely by hENT1. Pretreatment of mice with a phosphorylated prodrug of nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside, an inhibitor of mENT1, significantly decreased brain exposure to tecadenoson compared with that of the untreated (control) group, suggesting involvement of mENT1 in transport of tecadenoson across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In summary, ENT1 was shown to mediate the transport of tecadenoson in vitro with recombinant and native human protein and in vivo with mice. The micromolar apparent Km value of tecadenoson for transport by native hENT1 in cultured cells suggests that hENT1 will not be saturated at clinically relevant (i.e., nanomolar) concentrations of tecadenoson, and that hENT1-mediated passage across the BBB may contribute to the adverse CNS effects observed in clinical trials. In contrast, in cases in which a CNS effect is desired, the present results illustrate that synthetic A1 agonists that are transported by hENT1 could be used to target CNS disorders because of enhanced delivery to the brain.",Tecadenoson,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005689432728104293), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003196252044290304)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04954?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=6, title='Tecadenoson: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04954?utm_source=openai')])"
2613,"('Ipratropium (bromide)', 'Sch 1000', 'Ipratropium', 'Ipratropium ion', 'N-isopropylatropine')",Medical,"Ipratropium bromide, sold under the brand name Atrovent among others, is a type of anticholinergic medication which is applied by different routes: inhaler, nebulizer, or nasal spray, for different reasons. The inhalant opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is used to treat the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. It is used by inhaler or nebulizer. Onset of action is typically within 15 to 30 minutes and lasts for three to five hours. The nasal spray prevents the glands in the nose from producing large amounts of fluid. It is used to treat rhinorrhea (runny nose) caused by allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, and the common cold. It is used by metered-dose manual pump spray. Onset of action is within an hour. Common side effects of inhalant use include dry mouth, cough, inflammation of the airways, and shortness of breath. Potentially serious side effects include urinary retention, worsening spasms of the airways, and a severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Ipratropium is a short-acting muscarinic antagonist, which works by causing smooth muscles to relax. Common side effects of nasal spray may include headache, dry nose, dry mouth or throat, nasal or throat irritation, nosebleeds, bad taste in mouth, nausea, dizziness, or constipation. Potentially serious side effects are unusual, but include severe allergic reaction, eye pain or change in vision, or urinary retention. It is considered safe during pregnancy, but it can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Ipratropium bromide was patented in 1966, and approved for medical use in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medicines needed in a health system. Ipratropium is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 219th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ipratropium as an inhalant can be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbation. It is supplied in a canister for use in an inhaler or in single dose vials for use in a nebulizer. It is also used to treat and prevent minor and moderate bronchial asthma, especially asthma that is accompanied by cardiovascular system diseases, as it has been shown to produce fewer cardiovascular side effects. Combination with beta-adrenergic agonists increases the dilating effect on the bronchi, as when ipratropium is combined with salbutamol (albuterol — USAN) under the trade names Combivent (a non-aerosol metered-dose inhaler or MDI) and Duoneb (nebulizer) for the management of COPD and asthma, and with fenoterol (trade names Duovent and Berodual N) for the management of asthma. Ipratropium as a nasal solution sprayed into the nostrils can reduce rhinorrhea (runny nose) but will not help nasal congestion. It is supplied in a metered-dose manual pump spray. == Contraindications == The main contraindication for ipratropium in any form is hypersensitivity to atropine and related substances. Conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder neck obstruction are not necessarily contraindicators, but should be taken into account, particularly if the patient is receiving an anticholinergic by another route. === Peanut allergy === Previously, Atrovent inhalers used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as a propellant and contained soy lecithin in the propellant ingredients. In 2008 all CFC inhalers were phased out and hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhalers replaced them. Allergy to peanuts was noted for the inhaler as a contraindication but now is not. It has never been a contraindication when administered as a nebulized solution. == Side effects == If ipratropium is inhaled, side effects resembling those of other anticholinergics are minimal. However, dry mouth and sedation have been reported. Also, effects such as skin flushing, tachycardia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, nausea, palpitations, and headache have been observed. Inhaled ipratropium does not decrease mucociliary clearance. The inhalation itself can cause headache and irritation of the throat in a few percent of patients. Urinary retention has been reported in patients receiving doses by nebulizer. As a result, caution may be warranted, especially by men with prostatic hypertrophy. Common side effects of nasal spray are experienced at a rate of 1-6% (versus the control group of 0-3%), and may include headache, dry nose, dry mouth or throat, nasal or throat irritation, nosebleeds, bad taste in mouth, nausea, dizziness, or constipation. Potentially serious side effects from nasal spray are rare, but include severe allergic reaction, eye pain or change in vision, or difficulty urinating. Accidental contact with the eye should be avoided. == Interactions == Interactions with other anticholinergics like tricyclic antidepressants, anti-Parkinson drugs and quinidine, which theoretically increase side effects, are clinically irrelevant when ipratropium is administered as an inhalant. Ipratropium nasal spray may interact with certain medications for depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions, certain medications for Parkinson's disease such as benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, atropine, certain antihistamines for allergy, cough, and cold, certain medications for bladder problems such as oxybutynin and tolterodine, certain medications for stomach problems such as dicyclomine and hyoscyamine, and certain medications for motion sickness such as scopolamine. == Pharmacology == Chemically, ipratropium bromide is a quaternary ammonium compound (which is indicated by the -ium per the BAN and the USAN) obtained by treating atropine with isopropyl bromide, thus the name: isopropyl + atropine. It is chemically related to components of the plant Datura stramonium, which was used in ancient India for asthma. Ipratropium exhibits broncholytic action by reducing cholinergic influence on the bronchial musculature. It blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, without specificity for subtypes, and therefore promotes the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in a decreased intracellular concentration of cGMP. Most likely due to actions of cGMP on intracellular calcium, this results in decreased contractility of smooth muscle in the lung, inhibiting bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. It is a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, and does not diffuse into the blood, which prevents systemic side effects. Ipratropium is a derivative of atropine but is a quaternary amine and therefore does not cross the blood–brain barrier, which prevents central side effects. Ipratropium should never be used in place of salbutamol (albuterol) as a rescue medication. == References ==",Ipratropium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.682172998902388e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010895135346800089)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ipratropium-inhalation-route/description/drg-20067557?utm_source=openai), [medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a695021.html?utm_source=openai), [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544261/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=319, start_index=9, title='Ipratropium (inhalation route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ipratropium-inhalation-route/description/drg-20067557?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=319, start_index=9, title='Ipratropium Oral Inhalation: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a695021.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=319, start_index=9, title='Ipratropium - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544261/?utm_source=openai')])"
2614,"('Choline (chloride)', 'Choline', 'Choline ion', 'Bilineurine', 'Cholinum')","Food, Medical","Choline is a cation with the chemical formula [(CH3)3NCH2CH2OH]+. Choline forms various salts, such as choline chloride and choline bitartrate. An essential nutrient for animals, it is a structural component of phospholipids and cell membranes. Choline is used to synthesize acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle control and numerous functions of the nervous system. Choline is involved in early development of the brain, gene expression, cell membrane signaling, and brain metabolism. Although humans synthesize choline in the liver, the amount produced naturally is insufficient to meet cellular functions, requiring that some choline be obtained from foods or dietary supplements. Foods rich in choline include meats, poultry, eggs, and other animal-based products, cruciferous vegetables, beans, nuts, and whole grains. Choline is present in breast milk and is commonly added as an ingredient to baby foods. == Chemistry == Choline is a quaternary ammonium cation. The cholines are a family of water-soluble quaternary ammonium compounds. Choline is the parent compound of the cholines class, consisting of ethanolamine residue having three methyl groups attached to the same nitrogen atom. Choline hydroxide is known as choline base. It is hygroscopic and thus often encountered as a colorless viscous hydrated syrup that smells of trimethylamine (TMA). Aqueous solutions of choline are stable, but the compound slowly breaks down to ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols, and TMA. Choline chloride can be prepared by treating TMA with 2-chloroethanol: (CH3)3N + ClCH2CH2OH → [(CH3)3NCH2CH2OH]+Cl− Choline has historically been produced from natural sources, such as via hydrolysis of lecithin. == Choline as a nutrient == Choline is widespread in living beings. In most animals, choline phospholipids are necessary components in cell membranes, in the membranes of cell organelles, and in very low-density lipoproteins. Choline is an essential nutrient for humans and many other animals. Humans are capable of some de novo synthesis of choline but require additional choline in the diet to maintain health. Dietary requirements can be met by choline by itself or in the form of choline phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine. Choline is not formally classified as a vitamin despite being an essential nutrient with an amino acid–like structure and metabolism. Choline is required to produce acetylcholine – a neurotransmitter – and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor. Upon methylation SAM is transformed into S-adenosyl homocysteine. Symptomatic choline deficiency causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and muscle damage. Excessive consumption of choline (greater than 7.5 grams per day) can cause low blood pressure, sweating, diarrhea, and fish-like body smell due to trimethylamine, which forms in the metabolism of choline. Rich dietary sources of choline and choline phospholipids include organ meats, egg yolks, dairy products, peanuts, certain beans, nuts and seeds. Vegetables with pasta and rice also contribute to choline intake in the American diet. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === In plants, the first step in de novo biosynthesis of choline is the decarboxylation of serine into ethanolamine, which is catalyzed by a serine decarboxylase. The synthesis of choline from ethanolamine may take place in three parallel pathways, where three consecutive N-methylation steps catalyzed by a methyl transferase are carried out on either the free-base, phospho-bases, or phosphatidyl-bases. The source of the methyl group is S-adenosyl-L-methionine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine is generated as a side product. In humans and most other animals, de novo synthesis of choline proceeds via the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway, but biosynthesis is not enough to meet human requirements. In the hepatic PEMT route, 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) receives 2 acyl groups from acyl-CoA forming a phosphatidic acid. It reacts with cytidine triphosphate to form cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol. Its hydroxyl group reacts with serine to form phosphatidylserine which decarboxylates to ethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) forms. A PEMT enzyme moves three methyl groups from three S-adenosyl methionines (SAM) donors to the ethanolamine group of the phosphatidylethanolamine to form choline in the form of a phosphatidylcholine. Three S-adenosylhomocysteines (SAHs) are formed as a byproduct. Choline can also be released from more complex precursors. For example, phosphatidylcholines (PC) can be hydrolyzed to choline (Chol) in most cell types. Choline can also be produced by the CDP-choline route, cytosolic choline kinases (CK) phosphorylate choline with ATP to phosphocholine (PChol). This happens in some cell types like liver and kidney. Choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferases (CPCT) transform PChol to CDP-choline (CDP-Chol) with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). CDP-choline and diglyceride are transformed to PC by diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT). In humans, certain PEMT-enzyme mutations and estrogen deficiency (often due to menopause) increase the dietary need for choline. In rodents, 70% of phosphatidylcholines are formed via the PEMT route and only 30% via the CDP-choline route. In knockout mice, PEMT inactivation makes them completely dependent on dietary choline. === Absorption === In humans, choline is absorbed from the intestines via the SLC44A1 (CTL1) membrane protein via facilitated diffusion governed by the choline concentration gradient and the electrical potential across the enterocyte membranes. SLC44A1 has limited ability to transport choline: at high concentrations part of it is left unabsorbed. Absorbed choline leaves the enterocytes via the portal vein, passes the liver and enters systemic circulation. Gut microbes degrade the unabsorbed choline to trimethylamine, which is oxidized in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide. Phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholines are hydrolyzed via phospholipases to choline, which enters the portal vein. Due to their water solubility, some of them escape unchanged to the portal vein. Fat-soluble choline-containing compounds (phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins) are either hydrolyzed by phospholipases or enter the lymph incorporated into chylomicrons. === Transport === In humans, choline is transported as a free ion in blood. Choline–containing phospholipids and other substances, like glycerophosphocholines, are transported in blood lipoproteins. Blood plasma choline levels in healthy fasting adults is 7–20 micromoles per liter (μmol/L) and 10 μmol/L on average. Levels are regulated, but choline intake and deficiency alters these levels. Levels are elevated for about 3 hours after choline consumption. Phosphatidylcholine levels in the plasma of fasting adults is 1.5–2.5 mmol/L. Its consumption elevates the free choline levels for about 8–12 hours, but does not affect phosphatidylcholine levels significantly. Choline is a water-soluble ion and thus requires transporters to pass through fat-soluble cell membranes. Three types of choline transporters are known: SLC5A7 CTLs: CTL1 (SLC44A1), CTL2 (SLC44A2) and CTL4 (SLC44A4) OCTs: OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT2 (SLC22A2) SLC5A7s are sodium- (Na+) and ATP-dependent transporters. They have high binding affinity for choline, transport it primarily to neurons and are indirectly associated with the acetylcholine production. Their deficient function causes hereditary weakness in the pulmonary and other muscles in humans via acetylcholine deficiency. In knockout mice, their dysfunction results easily in death with cyanosis and paralysis. CTL1s have moderate affinity for choline and transport it in almost all tissues, including the intestines, liver, kidneys, placenta, and mitochondria. CTL1s supply choline for phosphatidylcholine and trimethylglycine production. CTL2s occur especially in the mitochondria in the tongue, kidneys, muscles, and heart. They are associated with the mitochondrial oxidation of choline to trimethylglycine. CTL1s and CTL2s are not associated with the acetylcholine production, but transport choline together via the blood–brain barrier. Only CTL2s occur on the brain side of the barrier. They also remove excess choline from the neurons back to blood. CTL1s occur only on the blood side of the barrier, but also on the membranes of astrocytes and neurons. OCT1s and OCT2s are not associated with the acetylcholine production. They transport choline with low affinity. OCT1s transport choline primarily in the liver and kidneys while OCT2s transport choline in kidneys and the brain. === Storage === Choline is stored in the cell membranes and organelles as phospholipids, and inside cells as phosphatidylcholines and glycerophosphocholines. === Excretion === Even at choline doses of 2–8 g, little choline is excreted into urine in humans. Excretion happens via transporters that occur within kidneys (see transport). Trimethylglycine is demethylated in the liver and kidneys to dimethylglycine (tetrahydrofolate receives one of the methyl groups). Methylglycine forms, is excreted into urine, or is demethylated to glycine. == Function == Choline and its derivatives have many biological functions. Notably choline serves as a precursor for other essential cell components and signaling molecules, such as phospholipids that form cell membranes, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the osmoregulator trimethylglycine (betaine). Trimethylglycine in turn serves as a source of methyl groups by participating in the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine. === Phospholipid precursor === Choline is transformed to diverse phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. These are found in all cell membranes and the membranes of most cell organelles. Phosphatidylcholines are structurally important part of the cell membranes. In humans, 40–50% of their phospholipids are phosphatidylcholines. Choline phospholipids also form lipid rafts in the cell membranes along with cholesterol. The rafts are centers, for example for cholinergic receptors and receptor signal transduction enzymes. Phosphatidylcholines are needed for the synthesis of VLDLs: 70–95% of their phospholipids are phosphatidylcholines in humans. Choline is also needed for the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant, which is a mixture consisting mostly of phosphatidylcholines. The surfactant is responsible for lung elasticity, that is for lung tissue's ability to contract and expand. For example, deficiency of phosphatidylcholines in the lung tissues has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Phosphatidylcholines are excreted into bile and work together with bile acid salts as surfactants in it, thus helping with the intestinal absorption of lipids. === Acetylcholine synthesis === Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a necessary role in muscle contraction, memory and neural development. Nonetheless, there is little acetylcholine in the human body relative to other forms of choline. Neurons also store choline in the form of phospholipids to their cell membranes for the production of acetylcholine. === Source of trimethylglycine === In humans, choline is oxidized irreversibly in liver mitochondria to glycine betaine aldehyde by choline oxidases. This is oxidized by mitochondrial or cytosolic betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenases to trimethylglycine. Trimethylglycine is a necessary osmoregulator. It also works as a substrate for the BHMT-enzyme, which methylates homocysteine to methionine. This is a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) precursor. SAM is a common reagent in biological methylation reactions. For example, it methylates guanidines of DNA and certain lysines of histones. Thus it is part of gene expression and epigenetic regulation. Choline deficiency thus leads to elevated homocysteine levels and decreased SAM levels in blood. == Content in foods == Choline occurs in foods as a free cation and in the form of phospholipids, especially as phosphatidylcholines. Choline is highest in organ meats and egg yolks though it is found to a lesser degree in non-organ meats, grains, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Cooking oils and other food fats have about 5 mg/100 g of total choline. In the United States, food labels express the amount of choline in a serving as a percentage of Daily Value (%DV) based on the Adequate Intake of 550 mg/day. 100% of the daily value means that a serving of food has 550 mg of choline. ""Total choline"" is defined as the sum of free choline and choline-containing phospholipids, without accounting for mass fraction. Human breast milk is rich in choline. Exclusive breastfeeding corresponds to about 120 mg of choline per day for the baby. Increase in a mother's choline intake raises the choline content of breast milk and low intake decreases it. Infant formulas may or may not contain enough choline. In the EU and the US, it is mandatory to add at least 7 mg of choline per 100 kilocalories (kcal) to every infant formula. In the EU, levels above 50 mg/100 kcal are not allowed. Trimethylglycine is a functional metabolite of choline. It substitutes for choline nutritionally, but only partially. High amounts of trimethylglycine occur in wheat bran (1,339 mg/100 g), toasted wheat germ (1,240 mg/100 g) and spinach (600–645 mg/100 g), for example. === Daily values === The following table contains updated sources of choline to reflect the new Daily Value and the new Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts Labels. It reflects data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. FoodData Central, 2019. DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for choline is 550 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older. The FDA does not require food labels to list choline content unless choline has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing choline arranged by nutrient content. == Dietary recommendations == Insufficient data is available to establish an estimated average requirement (EAR) for choline, so the Food and Nutrition Board established adequate intakes (AIs). For adults, the AI for choline was set at 550 mg/day for men and 425 mg/day for women. These values have been shown to prevent hepatic alteration in men. However, the study used to derive these values did not evaluate whether less choline would be effective, as researchers only compared a choline-free diet to a diet containing 550 mg of choline per day. From this, the AIs for children and adolescents were extrapolated. Recommendations are in milligrams per day (mg/day). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendations are general recommendations for the EU countries. The EFSA has not set any upper limits for intake. Individual EU countries may have more specific recommendations. The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) recommendations apply in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. == Intake in populations == Twelve surveys undertaken in 9 EU countries between 2000 and 2011 estimated choline intake of adults in these countries to be 269–468 milligrams per day. Intake was 269–444 mg/day in adult women and 332–468 mg/day in adult men. Intake was 75–127 mg/day in infants, 151–210 mg/day in 1- to 3-year-olds, 177–304 mg/day in 3- to 10-year-olds and 244–373 mg/day in 10- to 18-year-olds. The total choline intake mean estimate was 336 mg/day in pregnant adolescents and 356 mg/day in pregnant women. A study based on the NHANES 2009–2012 survey estimated the choline intake to be too low in some US subpopulations. Intake was 315.2–318.8 mg/d in 2+ year olds between this time period. Out of 2+ year olds, only 15.6±0.8% of males and 6.1±0.6% of females exceeded the adequate intake (AI). AI was exceeded by 62.9±3.1% of 2- to 3-year-olds, 45.4±1.6% of 4- to 8-year-olds, 9.0±1.0% of 9- to 13-year-olds, 1.8±0.4% of 14–18 and 6.6±0.5% of 19+ year olds. Upper intake level was not exceeded in any subpopulations. A 2013–2014 NHANES study of the US population found the choline intake of 2- to 19-year-olds to be 256±3.8 mg/day and 339±3.9 mg/day in adults 20 and over. Intake was 402±6.1 mg/d in men 20 and over and 278 mg/d in women 20 and over. == Deficiency == === Signs and symptoms === Symptomatic choline deficiency is rare in humans. Most obtain sufficient amounts of it from the diet and are able to biosynthesize limited amounts of it via PEMT. Symptomatic deficiency is often caused by certain diseases or by other indirect causes. Severe deficiency causes muscle damage and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which may develop into cirrhosis. Besides humans, fatty liver is also a typical sign of choline deficiency in other animals. Bleeding in the kidneys can also occur in some species. This is suspected to be due to deficiency of choline derived trimethylglycine, which functions as an osmoregulator. === Causes and mechanisms === Estrogen production is a relevant factor which predisposes individuals to deficiency along with low dietary choline intake. Estrogens activate phosphatidylcholine producing PEMT enzymes. Women before menopause have lower dietary need for choline than men due to women's higher estrogen production. Without estrogen therapy, the choline needs of post-menopausal women are similar to men's. Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (genetic factors) affecting choline and folate metabolism are also relevant. Certain gut microbes also degrade choline more efficiently than others, so they are also relevant. In deficiency, availability of phosphatidylcholines in the liver are decreased – these are needed for formation of VLDLs. Thus VLDL-mediated fatty acid transport out of the liver decreases leading to fat accumulation in the liver. Other simultaneously occurring mechanisms explaining the observed liver damage have also been suggested. For example, choline phospholipids are also needed in mitochondrial membranes. Their unavailability leads to the inability of mitochondrial membranes to maintain proper electrochemical gradient, which, among other things, is needed for degrading fatty acids via β-oxidation. Fat metabolism within liver therefore decreases. == Excess intake == Excessive doses of choline can have adverse effects. Daily 8–20 g doses of choline, for example, have been found to cause low blood pressure, nausea, diarrhea and fish-like body odor. The odor is due to trimethylamine (TMA) formed by the gut microbes from the unabsorbed choline (see trimethylaminuria). The liver oxidizes TMA to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Elevated levels of TMA and TMAO in the body have been linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis and mortality. Thus, excessive choline intake has been hypothetized to increase these risks in addition to carnitine, which also is formed into TMA and TMAO by gut bacteria. However, choline intake has not been shown to increase the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases. It is plausible that elevated TMA and TMAO levels are just a symptom of other underlying illnesses or genetic factors that predispose individuals for increased mortality. Such factors may have not been properly accounted for in certain studies observing TMA and TMAO level related mortality. Causality may be reverse or confounding and large choline intake might not increase mortality in humans. For example, kidney dysfunction predisposes for cardiovascular diseases, but can also decrease TMA and TMAO excretion. == Health effects == === Neural tube closure === Low maternal intake of choline is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Higher maternal intake of choline is likely associated with better neurocognition/neurodevelopment in children. Choline and folate, interacting with vitamin B12, act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can then go on to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is the substrate for almost all methylation reactions in mammals. It has been suggested that disturbed methylation via SAM could be responsible for the relation between folate and NTDs. This may also apply to choline. Certain mutations that disturb choline metabolism increase the prevalence of NTDs in newborns, but the role of dietary choline deficiency remains unclear, as of 2015. === Cardiovascular diseases and cancer === Choline deficiency can cause fatty liver, which increases cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. Choline deficiency also decreases SAM production, which partakes in DNA methylation – this decrease may also contribute to carcinogenesis. Thus, deficiency and its association with such diseases has been studied. However, observational studies of free populations have not convincingly shown an association between low choline intake and cardiovascular diseases or most cancers. Studies on prostate cancer have been contradictory. === Cognition === Studies observing the effect between higher choline intake and cognition have been conducted in human adults, with contradictory results. Similar studies on human infants and children have been contradictory and also limited. == Perinatal development == Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline de novo, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that Pemt −/− mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline. While maternal stores of choline are depleted during pregnancy and lactation, the placenta accumulates choline by pumping choline against the concentration gradient into the tissue, where it is then stored in various forms, mostly as acetylcholine. Choline concentrations in amniotic fluid can be ten times higher than in maternal blood. === Functions in the fetus === Choline is in high demand during pregnancy as a substrate for building cellular membranes (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for methylation of DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing ""fat"" portions). In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline's use as a material for making cellular membranes (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy and continues to be rapid to approximately five years of age. During this time, the demand is high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphatidylcholine (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers. Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation. Acetylcholine is even present in the placenta and may help control cell proliferation and differentiation (increases in cell number and changes of multiuse cells into dedicated cellular functions) and parturition. Choline uptake into the brain is controlled by a low-affinity transporter located at the blood–brain barrier. Transport occurs when arterial blood plasma choline concentrations increase above 14 μmol/L, which can occur during a spike in choline concentration after consuming choline-rich foods. Neurons, conversely, acquire choline by both high- and low-affinity transporters. Choline is stored as membrane-bound phosphatidylcholine, which can then be used for acetylcholine neurotransmitter synthesis later. Acetylcholine is formed as needed, travels across the synapse, and transmits the signal to the following neuron. Afterwards, acetylcholinesterase degrades it, and the free choline is taken up by a high-affinity transporter into the neuron again. == Uses == Choline chloride and choline bitartrate are used in dietary supplements. Bitartrate is used more often due to its lower hygroscopicity. Certain choline salts are used to supplement chicken, turkey and some other animal feeds. Some salts are also used as industrial chemicals: for example, in photolithography to remove photoresist. Choline theophyllinate and choline salicylate are used as medicines, as well as structural analogs, like methacholine and carbachol. Radiolabeled cholines, like 11C-choline, are used in medical imaging. Other commercially used salts include tricholine citrate and choline bicarbonate. The most common forms of dietary choline supplements are shown in the following table: == History == === Discovery === In 1849, Adolph Strecker was the first to isolate choline from pig bile. In 1852, L. Babo and M. Hirschbrunn extracted choline from white mustard seeds and named it sinkaline. In 1862, Strecker repeated his experiment with pig and ox bile, calling the substance choline for the first time after the Greek word for bile, chole, and identifying it with the chemical formula C5H13NO. In 1850, Theodore Nicolas Gobley extracted from the brains and roe of carps a substance he named lecithin after the Greek word for egg yolk, lekithos, showing in 1874 that it was a mixture of phosphatidylcholines. In 1865, Oscar Liebreich isolated ""neurine"" from animal brains. The structural formulas of acetylcholine and Liebreich's ""neurine"" were resolved by Adolf von Baeyer in 1867. Later that year ""neurine"" and sinkaline were shown to be the same substances as Strecker's choline. Thus, Bayer was the first to resolve the structure of choline. The compound now known as neurine is unrelated to choline. === Discovery as a nutrient === In the early 1930s, Charles Best and colleagues noted that fatty liver in rats on a special diet and diabetic dogs could be prevented by feeding them lecithin, proving in 1932 that choline in lecithin was solely responsible for this preventive effect. In 1998, the US National Academy of Medicine reported their first recommendations for choline in the human diet. == References ==",Choline,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.1674787551164627), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.1472419600977446e-06), (' FOOD', -0.0004914337769150734), (',', -0.06203031167387962), (' MED', -0.17209473252296448), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07), (',', -0.029790988191962242), (' INDUSTR', -0.009942840784788132), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.4998585283756256), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -9.929640509653836e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.008876980282366276), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4742313027381897)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.008619893342256546), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -4.5491004129871726e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline ', [])"
2615,"('Allopurinol',)",Medical,"Allopurinol is a medication used to decrease high blood uric acid levels. It is specifically used to prevent gout, prevent specific types of kidney stones and for the high uric acid levels that can occur with chemotherapy. It is taken orally (by mouth) or intravenously (injected into a vein). Common side effects when used orally include itchiness and rash. Common side effects when used by injection include vomiting and kidney problems. While not recommended historically, starting allopurinol during an attack of gout appears to be safe. In those already on the medication, it should be continued even during an acute gout attack. While use during pregnancy does not appear to result in harm, this use has not been well studied. Allopurinol is in the xanthine oxidase inhibitor family of medications. Allopurinol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1966. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Allopurinol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 39th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Gout === Allopurinol is used to reduce urate formation in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred or is predictable. The specific diseases and conditions where it is used include gouty arthritis, skin tophi, kidney stones, idiopathic gout; uric acid lithiasis; acute uric acid nephropathy; neoplastic disease and myeloproliferative disease with high cell turnover rates, in which high urate levels occur either spontaneously, or after cytotoxic therapy; certain enzyme disorders which lead to overproduction of urate, for example: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, including Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; glucose 6-phosphatase including glycogen storage disease; phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase; adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. It is also used to treat kidney stones caused by deficient activity of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. === Tumor lysis syndrome === Allopurinol was also commonly used to treat tumor lysis syndrome in chemotherapeutic treatments, as these regimens can rapidly produce severe acute hyperuricemia; however, it has gradually been replaced by urate oxidase therapy. Intravenous formulations are used in this indication when people are unable to swallow medication. === Inflammatory bowel disease === Allopurinol cotherapy is used to improve outcomes for people with inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease who do not respond to thiopurine monotherapy. Cotherapy has also been shown to greatly improve hepatoxicity side effects in treatment of IBD. Cotherapy invariably requires dose reduction of the thiopurine, usually to one-third of the standard dose depending upon the patient's genetic status for thiopurine methyltransferase. === Psychiatric disorders === Allopurinol has been tested as an augmentation strategy for the treatment of mania in bipolar disorder. Meta-analytic evidence showed that adjunctive allopurinol was superior to placebo for acute mania (both with and without mixed features). Its efficacy was not influenced by dosage, follow-up duration, or concurrent standard treatment. === Cardiovascular disease === There is a correlation between uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease and mortality, and so allopurinol has been explored as a potential treatment to reduce risk of cardiac disease. However, the data is inconsistent and conflicting, and the use of allopurinol for use in cardiovascular disease is controversial. Independently of its effects on uric acid, it may also have effects on oxidative stress and inflammation. == Side effects == Because allopurinol is not a uricosuric, it can be used in people with poor kidney function. However, for people with impaired kidney function, allopurinol has two disadvantages. First, its dosing is complex. Second, some people are hypersensitive to the drug; therefore, its use requires careful monitoring. Allopurinol has rare but potentially fatal adverse effects involving the skin. The most serious adverse effect is a hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever, skin rash, eosinophilia, hepatitis, and worsened renal function, collectively referred to as DRESS syndrome. Allopurinol is one of the drugs commonly known to cause Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, two life-threatening dermatological conditions. More common is a less-serious rash that leads to discontinuing this drug. More rarely, allopurinol can also result in the depression of bone marrow elements, leading to cytopenias, as well as aplastic anemia. Moreover, allopurinol can also cause peripheral neuritis in some patients, although this is a rare side effect. Another side effect of allopurinol is interstitial nephritis. == Drug interactions == Drug interactions are extensive, and are as follows: Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine: Azathioprine is metabolised to 6-mercaptopurine which in turn is inactivated by the action of xanthine oxidase - the target of allopurinol. Giving allopurinol with either of these drugs at their normal dose will lead to overdose of either drug; only one-quarter of the usual dose of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be given; Didanosine: plasma didanosine Cmax and AUC values were approximately doubled with concomitant allopurinol treatment; it should not be co-administered with allopurinol and if it must be, the dose of should be reduced and the person should be closely monitored. Allopurinol may also increase the activity or half-life of the following drugs, in order of seriousness and certainty of the interaction: Ciclosporin Coumarin anticoagulants, such as warfarin (reported rarely, but is serious when it occurs) Vidarabine Chlorpropamide Phenytoin Theophylline Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine, mechlorethamine Co-administration of the following drugs may make allopurinol less active or decrease its half-life: Salicylates and medicines that increase the secretion of uric acid furosemide (see more on diuretics below) Co-administration of the following drugs may cause hypersensitivity or skin rash: Ampicillin and amoxicillin Diuretics, in particular thiazides, especially in renal impairment Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) == Pharmacology == A common misconception is that allopurinol is metabolized by its target, xanthine oxidase, but this action is principally carried out by aldehyde oxidase. The active metabolite of allopurinol is oxipurinol, which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is almost completely metabolized to oxipurinol within two hours of oral administration, whereas oxipurinol is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18–30 hours. For this reason, oxipurinol is believed responsible for the majority of allopurinol's effect. === Mechanism of action === Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine (1H-Purine-2,6-dione) oxidase is responsible for the successive oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and subsequently uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribonucleotides, hypoxanthine can be salvaged to the purine ribonucleotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribonucleotides may cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol, therefore, decreases uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis. === Pharmacogenetics === The HLA-B*5801 allele is a genetic marker for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The frequency of the HLA-B*5801 allele varies between ethnicities: Han Chinese and Thai populations have HLA-B*5801 allele frequencies of around 8%, as compared to European and Japanese populations, who have allele frequencies of around 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively. The increase in risk for developing allopurinol-induced SJS or TEN in individuals with the HLA-B*5801 allele (as compared to those who do not have this allele) is very high, ranging from a 40-fold to a 580-fold increase in risk, depending on ethnicity. As of 2011 the FDA-approved drug label for allopurinol did not contain any information regarding the HLA-B*5801 allele, though FDA scientists did publish a study in 2011 which reported a strong, reproducible and consistent association between the allele and allopurinol-induced SJS and TEN. However, the American College of Rheumatology recommends screening for HLA-B*5801 in high-risk populations (e.g. Koreans with stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease and those of Han Chinese and Thai descent), and prescribing patients who are positive for the allele an alternative drug. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines state that allopurinol is contraindicated in known carriers of the HLA-B*5801 allele. == History == Allopurinol was first synthesized and reported in 1956 by Roland K. Robins (1926–1992), in a search for antineoplastic agents. Allopurinol inhibits the breakdown (catabolism) of the thiopurine drug mercaptopurine, and was later tested by Wayne Rundles in collaboration with Gertrude Elion's lab at Wellcome Research Laboratories to see if it could improve treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by enhancing the action of mercaptopurine. However, no improvement in leukemia response was noted with mercaptopurine-allopurinol co-therapy, so that work turned to other compounds and the team then started testing allopurinol as a potential therapeutic for gout. Allopurinol was first marketed as a treatment for gout in 1966. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Allopurinol is sold as an injection for intravenous use and as a tablet. === Brands === Allopurinol has been marketed in the United States since 19 August 1966, when it was first approved by FDA under the trade name Zyloprim. Allopurinol was marketed at the time by Burroughs Wellcome. Allopurinol is a generic drug sold under a variety of brand names, including Allohexal, Allosig, Milurit, Alloril, Progout, Ürikoliz, Zyloprim, Zyloric, Zyrik, and Aluron. == See also == Lesinurad/allopurinol, a fixed-dose combination drug == References == == Further reading == Dean L (March 2016).

It is also found in other Cordyceps species as well as Ophiocordyceps sinensis. == Biological activity == Cordyceps fungi produce cordycepin as a means of infecting insect populations, due to its biological activity. Because cordycepin is similar to adenosine, some enzymes cannot discriminate between the two. It can therefore participate in certain biochemical reactions (for example, 3-dA can trigger the premature termination of mRNA synthesis). By acting as an adenosine analog, cordycepin is the most potent molecular circadian clock resetter out of several screened compounds. Cordycepin has displayed cytotoxicity against some leukemic cell lines in vitro. Additionally, cordycepin displays an effect in cancers, such as lung, renal, colon, and breast cancer. Cordycepin reduces viable A549 lung cancer cell populations by 50%. Cordycepin produces rapid, robust imipramine-like antidepressant effects in animal models of depression, and these effects, similarly to those of imipramine, are dependent on enhancement of AMPA receptor signaling. Cordycepin has anti-inflammatory qualities, as well as the ability to defend against injury from cerebral ischemia in mice. == See also == 2'-Deoxyadenosine == References ==",Cordycepine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.06213920935988426)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.3367067873477936), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), (',', -0.2014705389738083), ('ĠFOOD', -0.12209472060203552), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06207394227385521)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.032835181802511215)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordycepin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Cordycepin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordycepin?utm_source=openai')])"
2617,"('Oxaprozin', 'Oxaprozinum', 'Wy21743', 'Daypro', 'Alvo')",Medical,"Oxaprozin, also known as oxaprozinum, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Chemically, it is a propionic acid derivative. Safety and efficacy has been established in children over 6 years with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis only, and there is an increased risk of adverse reactions in the elderly population. It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1983. == Medical uses == In 2015, oxaprozin was one of twenty NSAIDs included in a clinical trial to compare the efficacy of NSAIDs in the short-term treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The NSAIDs were compared by completing randomized controlled trials of NSAIDs in patients with active AS. Efficacy reported at 2–12 weeks and adverse effects were examined. Efficacy was measured by change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness. A total of 26 trials with a total of 3410 participants were completed (58% of the trials had fewer than 50 participants). While all 20 NSAIDs were found to reduce more pain than the placebo, 15 were found to be significantly better. In regards to the decrease of morning stiffness and the likelihood of adverse events, there was no significant difference between NSAIDs. It was concluded that etoricoxib was more effective in reducing pain of AS, however due to small studies and insufficient evidence, no one NSAID could be determined to be the most effective treatment of AS. After etoricoxib, patients taking oxaprozin experienced the least amount of pain with fewer adverse effects than naproxen. == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == History == Oxaprozin was developed and patented by Wyeth-Ayerst. The US patent 3578671, Oxazoles, was filed November 6, 1967 and published May 11, 1971. Following the filing of the patent, the first description of oxaprozin exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties was outlined in the article Diaryloxazole and diaylthiazolealkanoci acids: two novel series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. This article was published in Nature in 1968. In December 1988, Wyeth-Ayerst licensed the marketing rights for the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean to Searle. Daypro became available January 5, 1993. Upon its release, “The Pink Sheet” estimated that the average whole sale price of Searle's Daypro was $112.30 for 100 (600 mg) tablets. The price was comparable to other prescription NSAIDs. == Society and culture == === FDA approval === The oxaprozin new drug application (NDA 18-841) was submitted to the FDA on August 10, 1982. The drug was granted an “NDA Day” review on June 15–16, 1992. After Searle agreed to complete seven Phase IV postmarketing studies on October 22, the FDA approved Daypro on October 29, 1992. Since the approval of Daypro by Searle, other companies have submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to the FDA. Daypro by Searle is listed as the Reference Listed Drug to prove the bioequivalence of the ANDAs. Below is a table listing all of the approved oxaprozin products. === Recalls === Advantage Dose LLC recalled oxaprozin tablets on November 26, 2008. The company was not in conformance with cGMP.

2618,"('Tetracycline (hydrochloride)', 'Tetracycline', 'Deschlorobiomycin', 'Tetracyclinum', 'Achromycin')",Medical,"Tetracycline, sold under various brand names, is an antibiotic in the tetracyclines family of medications, used to treat a number of infections, including acne, cholera, brucellosis, plague, malaria, and syphilis. It is available in oral and topical formulations. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and loss of appetite. Other side effects include poor tooth development if used by children less than eight years of age, kidney problems, and sunburning easily. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria. Tetracycline was patented in 1953 and was approved for prescription use in 1954. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tetracycline is available as a generic medication. Tetracycline was originally made from bacteria of the genus Streptomyces. == Medical uses == === Spectrum of activity === Tetracyclines have a broad spectrum of antibiotic action. Originally, they possessed some level of bacteriostatic activity against almost all medically relevant aerobic and anaerobic bacterial genera, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, with a few exceptions, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus spp., which display intrinsic resistance. However, acquired (as opposed to inherent) resistance has proliferated in many pathogenic organisms and greatly eroded the formerly vast versatility of this group of antibiotics. Resistance amongst Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, anaerobes, members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and several other previously sensitive organisms is now quite common. Tetracyclines remain especially useful in the management of infections by certain obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia. They are also of value in spirochaetal infections, such as syphilis, and Lyme disease. Certain rare or exotic infections, including anthrax, plague, and brucellosis, are also susceptible to tetracyclines. Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1994. Tetracycline is first-line therapy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia), Lyme disease (B. burgdorferi), Q fever (Coxiella), psittacosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and nasal carriage of meningococci. It is also one of a group of antibiotics which together may be used to treat peptic ulcers caused by bacterial infections. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however, protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria leading to effects that may confound experimental results. The following list presents MIC susceptibility data for some medically significant microorganisms: Escherichia coli: 1 μg/mL to >128 μg/mL Shigella spp.: 1 μg/mL to 128 μg/mL === Anti-eukaryote use === The tetracyclines also have activity against certain eukaryotic parasites, including those responsible for diseases such as dysentery caused by an amoeba, malaria (a plasmodium), and balantidiasis (a ciliate). === Use as a biomarker === Since tetracycline is absorbed into bone, it is used as a marker of bone growth for biopsies in humans. Tetracycline labeling is used to determine the amount of bone growth within a certain period of time, usually a period around 21 days. Tetracycline is incorporated into mineralizing bone and can be detected by its fluorescence. In ""double tetracycline labeling"", a second dose is given 11–14 days after the first dose, and the amount of bone formed during that interval can be calculated by measuring the distance between the two fluorescent labels. Tetracycline is also used as a biomarker in wildlife to detect consumption of medicine- or vaccine-containing baits. == Side effects == Use of tetracycline antibiotics can: Discolor permanent teeth (yellow-gray-brown), from prenatal period through childhood and adulthood. Children receiving long- or short-term therapy with a tetracycline or glycylcycline may develop permanent brown discoloration of the teeth. Be inactivated by calcium ions, so are not to be taken with milk, yogurt, and other dairy products Be inactivated by aluminium, iron, and zinc ions, not to be taken at the same time as indigestion remedies (some common antacids and over-the-counter heartburn medicines) Cause skin photosensitivity, so exposure to the sun or intense light is not recommended Cause drug-induced lupus, and hepatitis Cause microvesicular fatty liver Cause tinnitus Cause epigastric pain Interfere with methotrexate by displacing it from the various protein-binding sites Cause breathing complications, as well as anaphylactic shock, in some individuals Affect bone growth of the fetus, so should be avoided during pregnancy Fanconi syndrome may result from ingesting expired tetracyclines. Caution should be exercised in long-term use when breastfeeding. Short-term use is safe; bioavailability in milk is low to nil. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme associated with doxycycline use have been reported, but a causative role has not been established. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the attachment of charged tRNA at the P site peptide chain. Tetracycline blocks the A-site so that a hydrogen bond is not formed between the amino acids. Tetracycline binds to the 30S and 50S subunit of microbial ribosomes. Thus, it prevents the formation of a peptide chain. The action is usually not inhibitory and irreversible even with the withdrawal of the drug. Mammalian cells are not vulnerable to the effect of Tetracycline as these cells contain no 30S ribosomal subunits so do not accumulate the drug. This accounts for the relatively small off-site effect of tetracycline on human cells. === Mechanisms of resistance === Bacteria usually acquire resistance to tetracycline from horizontal transfer of a gene that either encodes an efflux pump or a ribosomal protection protein. Efflux pumps actively eject tetracycline from the cell, preventing the build up of an inhibitory concentration of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. Ribosomal protection proteins interact with the ribosome and dislodge tetracycline from the ribosome, allowing for translation to continue. == History == === Discovery === The tetracyclines, a large family of antibiotics, were discovered by Benjamin Minge Duggar in 1948 as natural products, and first prescribed in 1948. Benjamin Duggar, working under Yellapragada Subbarow at Lederle Laboratories, discovered the first tetracycline antibiotic, chlortetracycline (Aureomycin), in 1945. The structure of Aureomycin was elucidated in 1952 and published in 1954 by the Pfizer-Woodward group. After the discovery of the structure, researchers at Pfizer began chemically modifying aureomycin by treating it with hydrogen in the presence of a palladized carbon catalyst. This chemical reaction replaced a chlorine moiety with a hydrogen, creating a compound named tetracycline via hydrogenolysis. Tetracycline displayed higher potency, better solubility, and more favorable pharmacology than the other antibiotics in its class, leading to its FDA approval in 1954. The new compound was one of the first commercially successful semi-synthetic antibiotics that was used, and laid the foundation for the development of Sancycline, Minocycline, and later the Glycylcyclines. === Evidence in antiquity === Tetracycline has a high affinity for calcium and is incorporated into bones during the active mineralization of hydroxyapatite. When incorporated into bones, tetracycline can be identified using ultraviolet light. There is evidence that early inhabitants of Northeastern Africa consumed tetracycline antibiotics. Nubian mummies from between 350 and 550 A.D. were found to exhibit patterns of fluorescence identical with that of modern tetracycline labelled bone. It is conjectured that the beer brewed by the Nubians was the source of the tetracycline found in these bones. == Society and culture == === Economics === According to data from EvaluatePharma and published in the Boston Globe, in the USA the price of tetracycline rose from $0.06 per 250-mg pill in 2013 to $4.06 a pill in 2015. The Globe described the ""big price hikes of some generic drugs"" as a ""relatively new phenomenon"" which has left most pharmacists ""grappling"" with large upswings"" in the ""costs of generics, with 'overnight' price changes sometimes exceeding 1,000%."" === Brand names === It is marketed under the brand names Sumycin, Tetracyn, and Panmycin, among others. Actisite is a thread-like fiber formulation used in dental applications. It is also used to produce several semisynthetic derivatives, which together are known as the tetracycline antibiotics. The term ""tetracycline"" is also used to denote the four-ring system of this compound; ""tetracyclines"" are related substances that contain the same four-ring system. === Media === Due to the drug's association with fighting infections, it serves as the main ""commodity"" in the science fiction series Aftermath, with the search for tetracycline becoming a major preoccupation in later episodes. Tetracycline is also represented in Bohemia Interactive's survival sandbox, DayZ. In the game, players may find the antibiotic to treat the common cold, influenza, cholera and infected wounds, but does not portray any side effects associated with tetracycline. == Research == === Genetic engineering === In genetic engineering, tetracycline is used in transcriptional activation. It has been used as an engineered ""control switch"" in chronic myelogenous leukemia models in mice. Engineers were able to develop a retrovirus that induced a particular type of leukemia in mice, and could then ""switch"" the cancer on and off through tetracycline administration. This could be used to grow the cancer in mice and then halt it at a particular stage to allow for further experimentation or study. A technique being developed for the control of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti (the infection vector for yellow fever, dengue fever, Zika fever, and several other diseases) uses a strain that is genetically modified to require tetracycline to develop beyond the larval stage. Modified males raised in a laboratory develop normally as they are supplied with this chemical and can be released into the wild. Their subsequent offspring inherit this trait, but find no tetracycline in their environments, so never develop into adults. == References ==",Achromycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004631400224752724), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00526150269433856)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/achromycin-v.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Achromycin V: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/achromycin-v.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is not marketed in the United States or Canada. Although the mechanism of action of diphenidol on the vestibular system has not yet been elucidated, it exerts an anticholinergic effect due to interactions with mACh receptors, particularly M1, M2, M3 and M4. Hence, its actions may take place at the vestibular nuclei, where a significant excitatory input is mediated by ACh receptors, and also at the vestibular periphery where mACh receptors are expressed at efferent synapses. A series of selective mACh-receptor antagonists based on the diphenidol molecule has been synthesized, but they have not yet been the subject of clinical trials. == Synthesis == Alkylation of 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane [109-70-6] (1) with piperidine (2) gives 3-Piperidinopropyl chloride [1458-63-5] (3).

Their effects on cell proliferation and differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells were examined. Incubation of HL-60 cells with these cationic and zwitterionic alkyl ether lipids inhibited proliferation of HL-60 cells with IC50 values ranging from 10 to 500 ng/mL. The cells were induced by the lipids to differentiate into morphologically and functionally mature granulocytes. Among the compounds we tested, 1-octadecyl-2-pyrimidinyl-3-[3-(5- carboxylatepentyl)imidazolioethoxyethyl]glycerol (compound I) was the most effective in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells. Compound I showed on a molar basis, an inhibitory effect on the leukemic cells over 50 times greater than did 2-(2-dodecyloxyethoxy)ethyl 2-pyridinio-ethyl phosphate, the antileukemic alkyl ether phospholipid. The effect of serum on the antineoplastic action of the alkyl-lysophospholipid 1-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3) was studied in two human leukemia cell lines, HL60 and K562, and in leukemic cells of patients. Decreasing amounts of serum in the culture medium enhanced the cytotoxic action of ET-18-OCH3 dramatically in both cell lines and in the leukemic cells, as measured by cell survival and proliferation. Uptake of ET-18-OCH3 was likewise increased at reduced serum levels. Similar effects were obtained when fetal calf serum (FCS) in the culture medium was substituted by bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid free). Selectivity of the alkyl-lysophospholipid at reduced serum or BSA level was demonstrated by clonogenic assays of normal marrow progenitor cells.

Beta-blockers as a collective medication class are not recommended as routine first-line treatment of high blood pressure for all patients, due to evidence demonstrating less effective cardiovascular protection and a less favourable safety profile when compared to other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications. Common side effects include dizziness, tiredness, joint pain, low blood pressure, nausea, and shortness of breath. Severe side effects may include bronchospasm. Safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. Use is not recommended in those with liver problems. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta blocker and alpha-1 blocker. How it improves outcomes is not entirely clear but may involve dilation of blood vessels. Carvedilol was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 34th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Carvedilol is indicated in the management of congestive heart failure (CHF), commonly as an adjunct to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and diuretics. It has been clinically shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in people with CHF. The mechanism of carvedilol in heart failure is due to its inhibition of receptors in the adrenergic nervous system, which releases noradrenaline to the body, including the heart. Noradrenaline is a hormone that causes the heart to beat faster and work harder. Blocking its binding to adrenergic receptors in the heart causes vasodilation, decreases heart rate and blood pressure, and improves myocardial contractility, which ultimately decreases the heart's workload. Carvedilol reduces the risk of death, hospitalisations, and recurring heart attacks in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (with an ejection fraction <40%) following a heart attack Carvedilol has also been proven to reduce death and hospitalization in patients with severe heart failure. Carvedilol is not considered a first-line treatment for hypertension; however, research has demonstrated that it exhibits an antihypertensive effect when compared to a placebo or other antihypertensive medications. Carvedilol has shown efficacy in preventing bleeding from oesophageal varices in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis and may have benefit in avoiding successive bleeds. Carvedilol is used in the treatment of acute cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. overdose) with sympathomimetics, for instance caused by amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, or ephedrine. It has also specifically been found to block the sympathomimetic effects of MDMA. Dual α1 and beta blockers like carvedilol and labetalol may be more favorable for such purposes due to the possibility of ""unopposed α-stimulation"" with selective beta blockers. === Available forms === Carvedilol is available in the following forms: Oral tablet Extended-release (24-hour) oral capsule (approved by the FDA in 2006) == Contraindications == Carvedilol should not be used in patients with bronchial asthma or bronchospastic conditions due to increased risk of bronchoconstriction. It should not be used in people with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or a decompensated heart condition. People with severe hepatic impairment should use carvedilol with caution. == Side effects == The most common side effects (>10% incidence) of carvedilol include: Dizziness Fatigue Low blood pressure Diarrhea Weakness Slowed heart rate Weight gain Erectile dysfunction Carvedilol is not recommended for people with uncontrolled bronchospastic disease (e.g. current asthma symptoms) as it can block receptors that assist in opening the airways. Carvedilol may mask symptoms of low blood sugar, resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness. This is termed beta blocker induced hypoglycemia unawareness. == Interactions == The risk of bradycardia is increased if used with amiodarone, digoxin, diltiazem, ivabradine, or verapamil. Also, combination of carvedilol with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem and verapamil, enhances it cardiodepressant effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Carvedilol is both a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist (β1, β2) and an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α1). The S(–) enantiomer accounts for the beta-blocking activity whereas the S(–) and R(+) enantiomers have alpha-blocking activity. The affinity (Ki) of carvedilol for the β-adrenergic receptors is 0.32 nM for the human β1-adrenergic receptor and 0.13 to 0.40 nM for the β2-adrenergic receptor. Using rat proteins, carvedilol has shown affinity for a variety of targets including the β1-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 0.24–0.43 nM), β2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 0.19–0.25 nM), α1-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 3.4 nM), α2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 2,168 nM), 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 3.4 nM), 5-HT2 receptor (Ki = 207 nM), H1 receptor (Ki = 3,034 nM), D2 receptor (Ki = 213 nM), μ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2,700 nM), veratridine site of voltage-gated sodium channels (IC50 = 1,260 nM), serotonin transporter (Ki = 528 nM), norepinephrine transporter (Ki = 2,406 nM), and dopamine transporter (Ki = 627 nM). It is an antagonist of the human 5-HT2A receptors with moderate affinity (Ki = 547 nM), although it is unclear if this is significant for its pharmacological actions given its much stronger activity at adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol reversibly binds to β-adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes. Inhibition of these receptors prevents a response to the sympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. This action is beneficial in heart failure patients where the sympathetic nervous system is activated as a compensatory mechanism. Carvedilol blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and an antihypertensive effect. There is no reflex tachycardia response due to carvedilol blockade of β1-adrenergic receptors on the heart. === Pharmacokinetics === Carvedilol is about 25% to 35% bioavailable following oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Absorption is slowed when administered with food, however, it does not show a significant difference in bioavailability. Taking carvedilol with food decreases the risk of orthostatic hypotension. The majority of carvedilol is bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly to albumin. Carvedilol is a basic, hydrophobic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of 115 L. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min. Carvedilol is highly lipophilic and easily crosses the blood–brain barrier in animals, and hence is not thought to be peripherally selective. The compound is metabolized by liver enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 via aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation, then further conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation. The three active metabolites exhibit only one-tenth of the vasodilating effect of the parent compound. However, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is about 13-fold more potent in β-blockade than the parent. The mean elimination half-life of carvedilol following oral administration ranges from 7 to 10 hours. The pharmaceutical product is a mix of two enantiomorphs, R(+)-carvedilol and S(–)-carvedilol, with differing metabolic properties. R(+)-Carvedilol undergoes preferential selection for metabolism, which results in a fractional half-life of about 5 to 9 hours, compared with 7 to 11 hours for the S(-)-carvedilol fraction. == Chemistry == Carvedilol is a highly lipophilic compound with an experimental log P of 3.8 to 4.19 and a predicted log P of 3.05 to 4.2. == References == == Further reading == == External links ==",Carvedilol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0609570381348021e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013004888023715466)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/carvedilol,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvedilol,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01136 ', [])"

This action is beneficial in heart failure patients where the sympathetic nervous system is activated as a compensatory mechanism. Carvedilol blockade of α1-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and an antihypertensive effect. There is no reflex tachycardia response due to carvedilol blockade of β1-adrenergic receptors on the heart. === Pharmacokinetics === Carvedilol is about 25% to 35% bioavailable following oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Absorption is slowed when administered with food, however, it does not show a significant difference in bioavailability. Taking carvedilol with food decreases the risk of orthostatic hypotension. The majority of carvedilol is bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly to albumin. Carvedilol is a basic, hydrophobic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of 115 L. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min. Carvedilol is highly lipophilic and easily crosses the blood–brain barrier in animals, and hence is not thought to be peripherally selective. The compound is metabolized by liver enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 via aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation, then further conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation. The three active metabolites exhibit only one-tenth of the vasodilating effect of the parent compound. However, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is about 13-fold more potent in β-blockade than the parent. The mean elimination half-life of carvedilol following oral administration ranges from 7 to 10 hours. The pharmaceutical product is a mix of two enantiomorphs, R(+)-carvedilol and S(–)-carvedilol, with differing metabolic properties. R(+)-Carvedilol undergoes preferential selection for metabolism, which results in a fractional half-life of about 5 to 9 hours, compared with 7 to 11 hours for the S(-)-carvedilol fraction. == Chemistry == Carvedilol is a highly lipophilic compound with an experimental log P of 3.8 to 4.19 and a predicted log P of 3.05 to 4.2. == References == == Further reading == == External links ==",Coreg,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.417489309271332e-06), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034564718953333795)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/coreg.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=74, start_index=9, title='Coreg Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/coreg.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2623,"('Daba', '(2s)-2,4-diaminobutanoic acid', '(s)-2,4-diaminobutanoic acid', 'Butanoic acid, 2,4-diamino-, (2s)-', 'Diaminobutyric acid')","Endogenous, Medical"," l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DABA) aminotransferases can catalyze the formation of amines at the distal ω-position of substrates, and is the intial and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of the cytoprotecting molecule (S)-2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyrimidine carboxylic acid (ectoine). Although there is an industrial interest in the biosynthesis of ectoine, the DABA aminotransferases remain poorly characterized. Herein, we present the crystal structure of EctB (2.45 Å), a DABA aminotransferase from Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM 3043, a well-studied organism with respect to osmoadaptation by ectoine biosynthesis. We investigate the enzyme's oligomeric state to show that EctB from C. salexigens is a tetramer of two functional dimers, and suggest conserved recognition sites for dimerization that also includes the characteristic gating loop that helps shape the active site of the neighboring monomer. Although ω-transaminases are known to have two binding pockets to accommodate for their dual substrate specificity, we herein provide the first description of two binding pockets in the active site that may account for the catalytic character of DABA aminotransferases. Furthermore, our biochemical data reveal that the EctB enzyme from C. salexigens is a thermostable, halotolerant enzyme with a broad pH tolerance which may be linked to its tetrameric state. Put together, this study creates a solid foundation for a deeper structural understanding of DABA aminotransferases and opening up for future downstream studies of EctB's catalytic character and its redesign as a better catalyst for ectoine biosynthesis. In summary, we believe that the EctB enzyme from C. salexigens can serve as a benchmark enzyme for characterization of DABA aminotransferases. DATABASE: Structural data are available in PDB database under the accession number 6RL5. Climate change exhibits great variation on different flanks and at different elevations in the same mountain range. To investigate the complexity of the geographic patterns of climate and phenology in the Qinling-Daba mountains (QDM), in the North-South transition zone of China, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of daily air temperature and precipitation data measured at 118 national weather stations (1969-2018). The principal findings were as follows. (1) Overall, a significant trend of warming was detected in all seasons over the past 50 years, with rates of increase of 0.347, 0.125, 0.200 and 0.302 °C/10a, in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Precipitation did not show significant variation at most stations in different seasons. (2) The rising rate of air temperature varied considerably between different flanks. Generally, air temperature change on northern flanks was greater than on southern flanks in all seasons. The tendency of air temperature change was greater in spring and winter than in summer and autumn on different flanks in the QDM. (3) The rate of increase in high-elevation regions was greater than in low-elevation regions in summer, autumn and winter, e.g., 0.440, 0.390 and 0.456 °C/10a at 3000-4000 m and 0.205, 0.218 and 0.303 °C/10a at 0-1000 m, respectively. However, in spring, the rate of increase in low-elevation regions were higher than in high-elevation regions, e.g., 0.369 °C/10a at 0-1000 m and 0.317 °C/10a at 3000-4000 m. The Qinling-Daba Mountains span subtropical and warm temperate zones and are one of the most remarkable biodiversity hotspots in China.

2624,"('Tazarotene', 'Tazorac', 'Zorac', 'Ethyl 6-((4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)ethynyl)nicotinate', 'Avage')",Medical,"Tazarotene, sold under the brand name Tazorac, among others, is a third-generation prescription topical retinoid. It is primarily used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and acne. Tazarotene is also used as a therapeutic for photoaged and photodamaged skin. It is a member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. Tazarotene was approved for medical use in 1997 and is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Tazarotene is most commonly used topically to treat acne vulgaris and psoriasis. Like other topical retinoids, such as tretinoin and adapalene, tazarotene can be combined with benzoyl peroxide or an oral antibiotic, such as clindamycin or dapsone, for the treatment of acne. This results in increased efficacy compared to tazarotene monotherapy. For psoriasis, a combination therapy of tazarotene and a mid- to high-potency corticosteroid is more effective than either treatment alone. Tazarotene can also be used for the treatment of photodamaged skin. It can reduce the clinical and histological signs of photodamaged skin. The therapy is more effective when used with the daily application of sunscreen. === Pregnancy === Before 2015, tazarotene was considered a Category X drug (meaning its use was contraindicated during pregnancy) according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, despite demonstrating similar plasma retinoid levels as adapalene and tretinoin, which were classified as Category C drugs. Under the FDA's updated Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule which eliminated the lettered pregnancy categories and came into effect in 2015, tazarotene was determined to be contraindicated in pregnancy. Because of the lack of pregnancy outcomes data for the drug, the determination was based on the teratogenic effects observed in rat and rabbit studies. == Contraindications == Tazarotene is contraindicated for use in patients who are known to be or suspected of being pregnant. Tazarotene is a known teratogen. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects for tazarotene include skin irritation, such as redness, itchiness, and burning. In patients with psoriasis, these adverse effects can be mitigated by a combined treatment with either mometasone furoate or fluocinonide. These effects tend to be mild to moderate, and increase in intensity as tazarotene concentration increases. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tazarotene is selective for two types of retinoic acid receptors, RAR-γ and RAR-β. Like all retinoids, it affects the ability of keratinocytes in the epidermis to proliferate and differentiate. It does so by upregulating filaggrin expression and downregulating the expression of keratinocyte transglutaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, involucrin, epidermal growth factor receptor, and various keratins. === Pharmacokinetics === More than 99% of tazarotenic acid, the active metabolite of tazarotene, in the blood binds to plasma proteins (the most predominant being albumin). The volume of distribution (VD) for tazarotene is 26.1 L/kg and the VD for tazarotenic acid is 1.97 L/kg. Tazarotene is excreted from the body via feces and urine equally, and it has an elimination half-life of 16 to 18 hours. == Synthesis == Acetylenic retinoid prodrug converted to the active metabolite, tazarotenic acid, with selective affinity for retinoic acid receptors RARβ and RARγ. The formation of the ring system involves first alkylation of the anion from thiophenol with dimethylallyl bromide (1) to give the thioether (2). Friedel-Crafts cyclization of the olefin with the equivalent of PPA then gives the thiopyran (3). Acylation with acetyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride gives the methyl ketone (4). Reaction of the enolate of that ketone with diethyl chlorophosphate gives the enol phosphate 5 as a transient intermediate. This eliminates diethyl phosphite in the presence of excess base to give the corresponding acetylene 6. The anion from the reaction of the acetylene with base is then used to displace chlorine from Ethyl 6-chloronicotinate (7). This reaction affords the coupling product tazarotene (8). == References ==",Avage,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.16026708483695984), (' PERSONAL', -7.896309739408025e-07), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00028153270250186324), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018175598233938217)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.632542913896032e-05)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In the late 1970s, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center discovered that cancerous cells take in natural folate through a protein identified as plasma membrane transporter (now referred to as ""reduced folate carrier type 1"" or ""RFC-1""). Further research showed that when normal cells evolve into cancerous cells they often overproduce RFC-1 to ensure they get enough folate. A subsequent scientific collaboration was ultimately formed among SRI International, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Southern Research Institute with the intention of developing an antifolate with greater therapeutic selectivity – an agent that could be more effectively internalized into tumors (transported into the cells through RFC-1) and would be more toxic to cancer cells than normal cells. This collaboration, supported by the National Cancer Institute, led to the identification of pralatrexate in the mid-1990s. Pralatrexate was later licensed to Allos Therapeutics in 2002 for further development. Allos Therapeutics, Inc. was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on September 5, 2012.

2626,"('Alendronate (sodium hydrate)', 'Alendronate', 'Mk 217', 'Fosamax', '(4-amino-1-hydroxy-1-phosphonobutyl)phosphonic acid')",Medical,"Alendronic acid, sold under the brand name Fosamax among others, is a bisphosphonate medication used to treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone. It is taken by mouth. Use is often recommended together with vitamin D, calcium supplementation, and lifestyle changes. Common side effects (1 to 10% of patients) include constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, and acid reflux. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or in those with poor kidney function. Alendronic acid works by decreasing the activity of cells that break down bone. Alendronic acid was first described in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 103rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Alendronic acid is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women; the treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis; the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis; and the treatment of Paget's disease of bone. == Side effects == Gastrointestinal tract: Ulceration and possible rupture of the esophagus; this may require hospitalization and intensive treatment. Gastric and duodenal ulceration may also occur. Esophageal cancer, a meta-analysis concluded that bisphosphonate treatment is NOT associated with excess risk of esophageal cancer. General: infrequent cases of skin rash, rarely manifesting as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, eye problems (uveitis, scleritis) and generalized muscle, joint, and bone pain (rarely severe) have been reported. Osteonecrosis of the jaw may occur while on this drug, if dental work of any kind is carried out. The risk is considerably higher for extractions in the mandible (lower jaw) than other areas of the mouth, and the risk increases if you have been taking it for four or more years Although this side effect is uncommon (0.4-1.6% for oral alendronic acid), it occurs primarily in patients being administered intravenous bisphosphonates, with most cases being reported in cancer patients. Bone: alendronate has been linked in long-term users to the development of low-impact femoral fractures. Further, studies suggest that users of alendronate have an increase in the numbers of osteoclasts and develop giant, more multinucleated osteoclasts; the significance of this development is unclear. Fosamax has been linked to a rare type of leg fracture that cuts straight across the upper thigh bone after little or no trauma (subtrochanteric fractures). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, which include ibandronate, pamidronate and alendronate exert their effects on osteoclasts mainly by inhibiting the synthesis of isoprenoid lipids such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via the mevalonate pathway. These isoprenoids are used in posttranslational modification(prenylation) of small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rac. These prenylated GTPases are necessary for various cellular processes including osteoclast morphology, endosome trafficking, and apoptosis. Alendronate has also been shown to impair the function of osteclast lysosomes. === Pharmacokinetics === The fraction of the drug that reaches the circulatory system intact (systemic bioavailability) after oral dosing is low, averaging only 0.6–0.7% in women and in men under fasting conditions. Intake together with meals and beverages other than water further reduces the bioavailability. The absorbed drug rapidly partitions, with approximately 50% binding to the exposed bone surface; the remainder is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Unlike with most drugs, the strong negative charge on the two phosphonate moieties limits oral bioavailability, and, in turn, the exposure to tissues other than bone is very low. After absorption in the bone, alendronate has an estimated terminal elimination half-life of 10 years. == References ==",Fosamax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.529942543740617e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004390706308186054)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/fosamax.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Fosamax: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/fosamax.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2627,"('Vincristine (sulfate)', 'Leurocristine (sulfate)', 'Vincristine', 'Vinkristin', 'Leurocristine')",Medical,"Vincristine, also known as leurocristine and sold under the brand name Oncovin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung cancer among others. It is given intravenously. Most people experience some side effects from vincristine treatment. Commonly it causes a change in sensation, hair loss, constipation, difficulty walking, and headaches. Serious side effects may include neuropathic pain, lung damage, or low white blood cells which increases the risk of infection. Use during pregnancy may result in birth defects. It works by stopping cells from dividing properly. It is vital that it not be given intrathecally, as this may kill. Vincristine was first isolated in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is a vinca alkaloid that can be obtained from the Madagascar periwinkle Catharanthus roseus. == Medical uses == Vincristine is delivered via intravenous infusion for use in various types of chemotherapy regimens. Its main uses are in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as part of the chemotherapy regimen CHOP R-CVP, Hodgkin's lymphoma as part of MOPP, COPP, BEACOPP, or the less popular Stanford V chemotherapy regimen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and in treatment for nephroblastoma as well as the chemotherapy regimen VDC-IE for Ewing's sarcoma. It is also used to induce remission in ALL with dexamethasone and L-asparaginase, and in combination with prednisone to treat childhood leukemia. Vincristine is occasionally used as an immunosuppressant, for example, in treating thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). == Side effects == The main side effects of vincristine are chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, hyponatremia, constipation, and hair loss. Vincristine-induced neuropathy is the main dose-limiting side effect. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be severe, and may be a reason to reduce or avoid using vincristine. The symptoms are progressive and enduring tingling numbness, pain and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes affecting the arms and legs. One of the first symptoms of peripheral neuropathy is foot drop: A person with a family history of foot drop and/or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) should avoid vincristine. A 2021 study has suggested that anakinra can reduce the neuropathy. Accidental injection of vinca alkaloids into the spinal canal (intrathecal administration) is highly dangerous, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent. The medical literature documents cases of ascending paralysis due to massive encephalopathy and spinal nerve demyelination, accompanied by intractable pain, almost uniformly leading to death. Several patients have survived after aggressive and immediate intervention. Rescue treatments consist of washout of the cerebrospinal fluid and administration of protective medications. Children may do better following this injury. One child, who was aggressively treated at the time of the injection, recovered almost completely with only mild neurological deficits. A significant series of inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration occurred in China in 2007 when batches of cytarabine and methotrexate (both often used intrathecally) manufactured by the company Shanghai Hualian were found to be contaminated with vincristine. The overuse of vincristine may also lead to drug resistance by overexpression of the p-glycoprotein pump (Pgp). There is an attempt to overcome resistance by the addition of derivatives and substituents to the vincristine molecule. == Mechanism of action == Vincristine works partly by binding to the tubulin protein, stopping the tubulin dimers from polymerizing to form microtubules, causing the cell to be unable to separate its chromosomes during the metaphase. The cell then undergoes apoptosis. The vincristine molecule inhibits leukocyte production and maturation. A downside, however, to vincristine is that it does not only affect the division of cancer cells. It affects all rapidly dividing cell types, making it necessary for the very specific administration of the drug. == Chemistry == The natural extraction of vincristine from Catharanthus roseus is produced at a percent yield of less than 0.0003%. For this reason, alternate methods to produce synthetic vincristine are being used. Vincristine is created through the semi-synthesis coupling of indole alkaloids vindoline and catharanthine in the vinca plant. It can also now be synthesized through a stereocontrolled total synthesis technique which retains the correct stereochemistry at C18' and C2'. The absolute stereochemistry at these carbons is responsible for vincristine's anticancer activity. The liposome encapsulation of vincristine enhances the efficacy of the vincristine drug while simultaneously decreasing the neurotoxicity associated with it. Liposome encapsulation increases vincristine's plasma concentration and circulation lifetime in the body, and allows the drug to enter cells more easily. == History == Having been used as a folk remedy for centuries, studies in the 1950s revealed that the rosy periwinkle Catharanthus roseus contained over 120 alkaloids, many of which are biologically active, the two most significant being vincristine and vinblastine. Its use as an anti-tumor, anti-mutagenic agent is well documented in the ancient Ayurveda system of medicine and in the folk culture of Madagascar and Southern Africa. It was not found to be anti-diabetic in double blinded controlled studies. While initial studies for its use in diabetes mellitus were disappointing, the discovery that it caused myelosuppression (decreased activity of the bone marrow) led to its study in mice with leukemia, whose lifespan was prolonged by the use of a vinca preparation. Treatment of the ground plant with Skellysolve-B (hexane), followed by dilute tartaric acid and benzene extraction, provided an active fraction. This fraction was further chromatographed on deactivated aluminium oxide using trichloromethane and benzene, and separation by pH using extraction with various buffers to yield vincristine. Vincristine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 1963 under the brand name Oncovin and was marketed by Eli Lilly and Company. The drug was initially developed by a team at Lilly Research Laboratories in Indianapolis where it was demonstrated that vincristine cured artificially induced leukemia in mice and remission of acute leukemias of childhood. Production of vincristine required one ton of dried periwinkle leaves to produce one ounce of vincristine. The periwinkle was grown on a ranch in Texas. == Society and culture == === Suppliers === Two generic drug makers were suppliers of vincristine in the United States: Teva and Pfizer. In 2019 Teva stopped producing vincristine, leaving Pfizer as the only company in production. Teva has said that they will restart production, and expect it to be available in 2020. === Shortage === In October 2019 an impending shortage was reported; no adequate substitute is known for treating childhood-cancers. By 2022, the shortage of vincristine continued. === Controversy === ==== Pharmaceutical bioprospecting ==== Vincristine's origins are debated as an example of pharmaceutical bioprospecting in the fields of ethnobotany and ethnomedicine. Some consider the Catharanthus roseus plant from which vincristine is derived, and its folk remedies to be endemic to Madagascar, and that Madagascar was denied royalties from vincristine sales. However, Catharanthus roseus has a documented history in folk medicine treatments in other locations. In 1963, Lilly researchers acknowledged that the plant was used in Brazil to treat hemorrhage, scurvy, toothaches, and chronic wounds; in the British West Indies to treat diabetic ulcers; and in the Philippines and South Africa as an oral hypoglycemic agent – but not as a treatment for cancer. Catharanthus roseus has been a cosmopolitan species since before the Industrial Revolution and the plant's use in folk remedies suggested general bioactivity for diabetes treatment, not cancer. In the mid-eighteenth century, botanist Judith Sumner recorded the arrival of Catharanthus roseus at London's Chelsea Physic Garden from the Jardin des plantes in Paris. It's unclear how the plant first arrived in Paris and the details of its origins in Madagascar beyond reports of its transport from Madagascar by early European explorers. Vincristine was initially distributed at cost to increase accessibility, though later switched to a for-profit model to recover the costs of production and development. According to Michael Brown, vincristine may not be a tidy example of pharmaceutical bioprospecting, but it demonstrates how pharmaceuticals with a history of use in folk medicine have intellectual property claims which are difficult to untangle. ==== Vincristine and confusion with other drugs in administration ==== Vincristine has been involved in a number of medical errors. Multiple instances of vincristine having been administered improperly, after having been confused with other drugs, have occurred. If delivered into the spine (intrathecal) it causes paralysis and usually death. In 2003, two Australian oncology pharmacists recommended a solution. The suggested procedure is to prepare and administer vincristine in a small volume mini-bag rather than a syringe thus physically preventing the vincristine syringe being accidentally attached to a spinal needle. Acceptance of this safer procedure has been slow. == Research == In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a liposomal formulation of vincristine branded as Marqibo. Marqibo was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in November 2021. A nano-particle bound version of vincristine was under development as of 2014. In 1995 and 2006, Malagasy agronomists and American political ecologists studied the production of Catharanthus roseus around Fort Dauphin and Ambovombe and its export as a natural source of the alkaloids used to make vincristine, vinblastine and other vinca alkaloid cancer drugs. Their research focused on the wild collection of periwinkle roots and leaves from roadsides and fields and its industrial cultivation on large farms. == References ==",Vinkristin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.674201020156033e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011059414595365524)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Forskolin is commonly used in laboratory research to increase levels of cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylate cyclase. == Mechanism of action == Forskolin is used in biochemistry experiments to raise levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in studies of cell physiology. Forskolin activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular levels of cAMP. cAMP is an important second messenger necessary for the proper biological response of cells to hormones and other extracellular signals. It is required for cell communication in the hypothalamus-pituitary gland axis, and for the feedback control of hormones via induction of corticotropin-releasing factor gene transcription. Cyclic AMP acts by activating cAMP-sensitive pathways such as protein kinase A and EPAC1. == Chemistry == It is defined as a category 4 chemical with acute dermal toxicity based on 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). === Derivatives === Its derivatives include colforsin daropate, NKH477, and FSK88, which may be more potent than forskolin at raising cAMP. These derivatives may have pharmaceutical utility against bronchoconstriction and heart failure. === Chemical synthesis === A total chemical synthesis has been reported. The key step of this chemical synthesis is photocyclization of a synthetic intermediate in presence of oxygen and methylene blue, followed by a singlet oxygen Diels-Alder reaction. == Biosynthesis == The heterocyclic ring is synthesized after the formation of the trans-fused carbon ring systems formed by a carbocation mediated cyclization. The remaining tertiary carbocation is quenched by a molecule of water. After deprotonation, the remaining hydroxy group is free to form the heterocyclic ring. This cyclization can occur either by attack of the alcohol oxygen onto the allylic carbocation formed by loss of diphosphate, or by an analogous SN2'-like displacement of the diphosphate. This forms the core ring system A of forskolin. The remaining modifications of the core ring system A can putatively be understood as a series of oxidation reactions to form a poly-ol B which is then further oxidized and esterified to form the ketone and acetate ester moieties seen in forskolin. However, because the biosynthetic gene cluster has not been described, this putative synthesis could be incorrect in the sequence of oxidation/esterification events, which could occur in almost any order. == Weight loss == Although forskolin has been used in preliminary weight loss research, the low quality of the studies and inconclusive results prevented any determination of effects. == See also == Adenylyl cyclase Cyclic AMP == References == == External links == Hall, Harriet (2014-06-03).

A Waters ACQUITY BEH C18 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) and SCIEX QTRAP® LC-MS/MS System were used. Analyses were conducted to optimize the chromatographic and MS conditions, and the pharmacokinetic parameters of ticarcillin and clavulanate were assessed. Linear relationships were observed in the ranges of 10 to 10,000 ng/mL for ticarcillin R (r A UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of ticarcillin and clavulanate in rat plasma. Twenty-five patients were treated with ticarcillin disodium, 18 of whom had anaerobic infections that included pleuropulmonary infections (seven), mandibular osteomyelitis (four), perirectal abscess (two), sepsis, primary site unknown (one), liver abscess (one), pelvic abscess (one), decubitus ulcer (one), and synergistic gangrene (one). Seven had no anaerobic infections. Three had anaerobic septicemia. Culture results included anaerobes: peptococci (ten), peptostreptococci (ten), Bacteroides fragilis (six), Bacteroides not fragilis (ten), eubacteria (three), fusobacteria (two), Clostridium (one), Veillonella (one), and acidaminococcus (one); aerobes: Proteus (three), Klebsiella (two), Escherichia coli (two), and streptococci (two). Six patients with mixed aerobic infections initially received gentamicin sulfate in addition. The serum levels were 110 +/- 20 microgram/ml one hour after intravenous infusion of 5 g of ticarcillin disodium. All anaerobic isolates were susceptible at less than or equal to 100 microgram/ml and 85% by less than or equal to 25 microgram/ml of ticarcillin. Sixteen patients responded well to ticarcillin and two failed to respond. Our study suggests that ticarcillin is useful in the treatment of anaerobic infections. Clavulanate potentiated ticarcillin contains two components with an established safety record. Ticarcillin used clinically alone and with clavulanate, a component of clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin, given orally or intravenously. No pharmacokinetic interaction occurs between the two components when given together in man or animals in which metabolism is qualitatively similar to man. Safety evaluation studies carried out in the animals established as suitable for studying the toxicology of ticarcillin have shown no unexpected synergistic or antagonistic toxic effects of Timentin not predicted from the toxicological evaluation of clavulanate alone. Reproductive mutagenic, cardiovascular and general pharmacological studies have shown no significant hazard from Timentin. Clinical experience with ticarcillin has been reviewed, and impairment of platelet function, seen at supratherapeutic doses, has been shown in an animal model not to be influenced by clavulanate. The assessment of the safety of ticarcillin and clavulanate for therapeutic use in man is thus comprised of the clinical experience with ticarcillin and parenteral clavulanate in clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin, animal safety evaluation studies, and the clinical experience with Timentin reported in this symposium.",Ticarcillin (disodium),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001586549769854173), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006746845785528421)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Here we show that modelling of intermittent ceralasertib treatment in mouse tumor models reveals CD8 In our previous study, we found that the Chk1 inhibitor prexasertib enhances the antitumour effect of the oral anticancer drug S-1 against pancreatic cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining S-1 and ceralasertib, an oral inhibitor of ATR, which is located upstream of Chk1. Ceralasertib is currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials for various cancers. The cell-proliferation inhibitory effect was measured by MTT assay, using the pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3, SUIT-2, PANC-1, and MIA PaCa-2, while apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using PI/Annexin staining. The mechanism underlying the combined effect was analysed using western blotting, and the antitumor effect was analysed using a mouse xenograft model. MTT assay revealed that the combination of S-1 and ceralasertib had a synergistic effect, leading to the suppression of cell proliferation. Measurement with PI/Annexin staining revealed that the combination of S-1 and ceralasertib induced apoptosis more efficiently than either drug alone. Western blotting results showed that ceralasertib inhibited S-1-induced activation of ATR and Chk1. The average estimated tumour volume after 3 weeks of administration was 601 mm The combination of S-1 and ceralasertib demonstrated a high antiproliferative effect in inhibiting tumour growth in vitro. AZD6738 (ceralasertib) is a potent and selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase. ATR is activated in response to stalled DNA replication forks to promote G2-M cell-cycle checkpoints and fork restart. Here, we found AZD6738 modulated CHK1 phosphorylation and induced ATM-dependent signaling (pRAD50) and the DNA damage marker γH2AX. AZD6738 inhibited break-induced replication and homologous recombination repair. In vitro sensitivity to AZD6738 was elevated in, but not exclusive to, cells with defects in the ATM pathway or that harbor putative drivers of replication stress such as CCNE1 amplification. This translated to in vivo antitumor activity, with tumor control requiring continuous dosing and free plasma exposures, which correlated with induction of pCHK1, pRAD50, and γH2AX. AZD6738 showed combinatorial efficacy with agents associated with replication fork stalling and collapse such as carboplatin and irinotecan and the PARP inhibitor olaparib. These combinations required optimization of dose and schedules in vivo and showed superior antitumor activity at lower doses compared with that required for monotherapy. Tumor regressions required at least 2 days of daily dosing of AZD6738 concurrent with carboplatin, while twice daily dosing was required following irinotecan. In a BRCA2-mutant patient-derived triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenograft model, complete tumor regression was achieved with 3 to5 days of daily AZD6738 per week concurrent with olaparib. Increasing olaparib dosage or AZD6738 dosing to twice daily allowed complete tumor regression even in a BRCA wild-type TNBC xenograft model. These preclinical data provide rationale for clinical evaluation of AZD6738 as a monotherapy or combinatorial agent. This detailed preclinical investigation, including pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and dose-schedule optimizations, of AZD6738/ceralasertib alone and in combination with chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors can inform ongoing clinical efforts to treat cancer with ATR inhibitors.",(s)-ceralasertib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016234986833296716), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00318508199416101)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.836499985889532e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10786692/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=6, title='Durable responses to ATR inhibition with ceralasertib in tumors with genomic defects and high inflammation - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10786692/?utm_source=openai')])"

2633,"('Prednisolone', 'Metacortandralone', 'Hydroretrocortine', 'Predonine', 'Delta-cortef')",Medical,"Prednisolone is a corticosteroid, a steroid hormone used to treat certain types of allergies, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and cancers, electrolyte imbalances and skin conditions. Some of these conditions include adrenocortical insufficiency, high blood calcium, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, eye inflammation, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and phimosis. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a vein, used topically as a skin cream, or as eye drops. It differs from the similarly named prednisone in having a hydroxyl at the 11th carbon instead of a ketone. Common side effects with short-term use include nausea, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, increased appetite, and fatigue. More severe side effects include psychiatric problems, which may occur in about 5% of people. Common side effects with long-term use include bone loss, weakness, yeast infections, and easy bruising. While short-term use in the later part of pregnancy is safe, long-term use or use in early pregnancy is occasionally associated with harm to the baby. It is a glucocorticoid made from hydrocortisone (cortisol). Prednisolone was discovered and approved for medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug. In 2022, it was the 136th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == When used in low doses, corticosteroids serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. At higher doses, they are considered as immunosuppressants. Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and, it is presumed, delay or slow healing. They inhibit edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. === Systemic use === Prednisolone is a corticosteroid drug with predominant glucocorticoid and low mineralocorticoid activity, making it useful for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as asthma, uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, urticaria, angioedema, ulcerative colitis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, Crohn's disease, Bell's palsy, multiple sclerosis, cluster headaches, vasculitis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, autoimmune hepatitis, lupus, Kawasaki disease, dermatomyositis, post-myocardial infarction syndrome, and sarcoidosis. Prednisolone can also be used for allergic reactions ranging from seasonal allergies to drug allergic reactions. Prednisolone can also be used as an immunosuppressant for organ transplants. Prednisolone in lower doses can be used in cases of adrenal insufficiency due to Addison's disease. === Topical use === Ophthalmology Topical prednisolone is mainly used in the ophthalmic pathway as eye drops in numerous eye conditions, including corneal injuries caused by chemicals, burns, and alien objects, inflammation of the eyes, mild to moderate non-infectious allergies, disorders of the eyelid, conjunctiva or sclera, ocular inflammation caused by operation and optic neuritis. Some side effects include glaucoma, blurred vision, eye discomfort, impaired recovery of injured site, scarring of the optic nerve, cataracts, and urticaria. However, their prevalence is not known. Prednisolone eye drops are contraindicated in individuals who develop hypersensitivity reactions against prednisolone, or individuals with the current conditions, such as tuberculosis of the eye, shingles affecting the eye, raised intraocular pressure, and eye infection caused by fungus. Prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (eye drops) is prepared as a sterile ophthalmic suspension and used to reduce swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions affecting the eye. It has been explored as a treatment option for bacterial keratitis. Prednisolone eye drops are used in conjunctivitis caused by allergies and bacteria, marginal keratitis, uveitis, endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the eye involving the aqueous humor, Graves' ophthalmopathy, herpes zoster ocular infection, inflammation of the eye after surgery, and corneal injuries caused by chemicals, radiation, thermal burns, or penetration of foreign objects. It is also used in the prevention of myringosclerosis, herpes simplex stromal keratitis. Topical prednisolone can also be used after procedures such as Laser Peripheral Iridotomy for patients with primary angle-closure suspects (PACS) to control inflammations. Ear drops In addition, topical prednisolone can also be administered as ear drops. == Adverse effects == Adverse reactions from the use of prednisolone include: Increased appetite, weight gain, nausea, and malaise Increased risk of infection Cardiovascular events Dermatological effects including reddening of the face, bruising/skin discoloration, impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, skin rash, edema, and abnormal hair growth Hyperglycemia; patients with diabetes may need increased insulin or diabetic therapies Menstrual abnormalities Lower response to hormones, especially during stressful instances such as surgery or illness Change in electrolytes: rise in blood pressure, increased sodium and low potassium, leading to alkalosis Gastrointestinal system effects: swelling of the stomach lining, reversible increase in liver enzymes, and risk of stomach ulcers Muscular and skeletal abnormalities, such as muscle weakness/muscle loss, osteoporosis (see steroid-induced osteoporosis), long bone fractures, tendon rupture, and back fractures Neurological effects, including involuntary movements (convulsions), headaches, and vertigo Psychosocial behavioral and emotional disturbances with aggression being one of the most common cognitive symptoms, especially with oral use. Nasal septum perforation and bowel perforation (in some pathologic conditions). Discontinuing prednisolone after long-term or high-dose use can lead to adrenal insufficiency. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Although there are no major human studies of prednisolone use in pregnant women, studies in several animals show that it may cause birth defects including increased likelihood of cleft palate. Prednisolone is found in the breast milk of mothers taking prednisolone. === Local adverse effects in the eye === When used topically on the eye, the following are potential side effects: Cataracts: Extended usage of corticosteroids may cause clouding at the back of the lens, also known as posterior subcapsular cataract. This type of cataract reduces the path of light from reaching the eye, which interferes with a person's reading vision. Consumption of prednisolone eye drops post-surgery may also retard the healing process. Corneal thinning: When corticosteroids are used in the long term, corneal and scleral thinning is also one of its consequences. When not ceased, thinning may ultimately lead to perforation of the cornea. Glaucoma: Elongated use of corticosteroids has a chance of causing a raised intraocular pressure (IOP), injuring the optic nerve, and weakening visual awareness. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with concomitant conditions of glaucoma. Doctors track patients' IOP if they are using corticosteroid eye drops for more than 103 days. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As a glucocorticoid, the lipophilic structure of prednisolone allows for easy passage through the cell membrane where it then binds to its respective glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) located in the cytoplasm. Upon binding, the formation of the GC/GCR complex causes dissociation of chaperone proteins from the glucocorticoid receptor enabling the GC/GCR complex to translocate inside the nucleus. This process occurs within 20 minutes of binding. Once inside the nucleus, the homodimer GC/GCR complex binds to specific DNA binding sites known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) resulting in gene expression or inhibition. Complex binding to positive GREs leads to the synthesis of anti-inflammatory proteins while binding to negative GREs blocks the transcription of inflammatory genes. They inhibit the release of signals that promote inflammation such as nuclear factor-Kappa B (NF-κB), Activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), and stimulate anti-inflammatory signals such as the interleukin-10 gene. All of them will collectively cause a sequence of events, including the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and additional inflammatory mediators. Glucocorticoids also inhibit neutrophil cell death and demargination. As well as phospholipase A2, which in turn lessens arachidonic acid derivative genesis. === Pharmacokinetics === Prednisolone has a relatively short half-life, ranging 2–4 hours. It also has a large therapeutic window, considering the dosage required to produce a therapeutic effect is a few times higher than what the body naturally produces. Prednisolone is 70–90% plasma protein bound, it binds to proteins such as albumin. Both prednisolone phosphate and prednisolone acetate go through ester hydrolysis in the body to form prednisolone. It subsequently undergoes the usual metabolism of prednisolone. Concomitant use of prednisolone and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole is shown to cause a rise in plasma prednisolone concentrations by about 50% owing to a diminished clearance. Prednisolone predominantly undergoes kidney elimination and is excreted in the urine as sulphate and metabolites of glucuronide conjugate. === Prednisone === Prednisone is a prodrug that is activated in the liver. When it enters the body, prednisone is triggered by the liver and body chemicals to turn into its active form, prednisolone. == Chemistry == Prednisolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid closely related to its cognate prednisone, having identical structure save for two fewer hydrogens near C11. It is also known as δ1-cortisol, δ1-hydrocortisone, 1,2-dehydrocortisol, or 1,2-dehydrohydrocortisone, as well as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. == Interactions == Co-administration of prednisolone eye drops with ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may perhaps exacerbate its effects, causing unwanted side effects such as toxicity. The wound healing process may also be hindered. Drug interactions of prednisolone include other immunosuppressants like azathioprine or ciclosporin, antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel, anticoagulants like dabigatran or warfarin, or NSAIDs such as aspirin, celecoxib, or ibuprofen. == Special populations == === Children === Prolonged use of prednisolone eye drops in children may lead to raised intraocular pressure. While this phenomenon is dose-dependent, it is shown to have a greater effect, especially in children under 6 years of age. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Research on animal reproduction has indicated that there is a trace of teratogenicity when doses are reduced by 10 times the human recommended dose. There is no sufficient information on human pregnancy at this moment. Use is only recommended when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for the pregnant mother and the fetus. Prednisolone when delivered systemically can be found in the mother's breast milk, however, there is no data provided for the extent of prednisolone found in the system after administering eye drops. However, the presence of corticosteroids is recorded when they are administered systemically, and it could affect the fetus' growth. Therefore, the use of prednisolone during breastfeeding is not advocated. == Society and culture == === Dosage forms === Prednisolone is supplied as oral liquid, oral suspension, oral syrup, oral tablet, and oral disintegrating tablet. It may be a generic medication or supplied as brands Flo-Pred (prednisolone acetate oral suspension), Millipred (oral tablets), Orapred (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral dissolving tablets), Pediapred (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution), Veripred 20, Prelone, Hydeltra-T.B.A., Hydeltrasol, Key-Pred, Cotolone, Predicort, Medicort, Predcor, Bubbli-Pred, Omnipred, P-Pred (prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension), Pred Mild, Pred Forte, and others. === Athletics === As a glucocorticosteroid, unauthorized or ad hoc use of prednisolone during competition via oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or rectal routes is banned under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) anti-doping rules. == Veterinary uses == Prednisolone is used in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions in cats, dogs, horses, small mammals such as ferrets, birds, and reptiles. Its usage in treating inflammation, immune-mediated disease, Addison's disease, and neoplasia is often considered off-label use. Many drugs are commonly prescribed for off-label use in veterinary medicine."" Studies in ruminating species, such as alpacas, have shown that oral administration of the drug is associated with a reduced bioavailability compared to intravenous administration; however, levels that are therapeutic in other species can be achieved with oral administration in alpacas. It is used in a broad spectrum of diseases, for example, inflammation of scleral tissues, cornea, and conjunctiva in dogs. In horses, prednisolone acetate suspensions are priorly used to treat inflammation in the middle layer of the eye, also known as anterior uveitis and equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), which is the leading cause of visual impairment in horses. Prednisolone acetate eye drops are not to be used in other animals such as birds. Prednisolone acetate eye drops are also prescribed to dogs and cats to lessen swelling, redness, burning, and pain sensations after surgeries of the eye. Cats with conjunctivitis usually are required to avoid using ophthalmic preparations of corticosteroids and its derivatives. The most typical infections are caused by herpes virus. == References == == External links == ""Prednisolone Ophthalmic"". MedlinePlus.

2635,"('Acetylcholine (chloride)', 'Ach (chloride)', 'Acetylcholine', 'Choline acetate', 'O-acetylcholine')","Endogenous, Medical","Acetylcholine (ACh) is an organic compound that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals (including humans) as a neurotransmitter. Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline. Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction—in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles. This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions. Acetylcholine is also a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, both as an internal transmitter for both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, and as the final product released by the parasympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter and as a neuromodulator. The brain contains a number of cholinergic areas, each with distinct functions; such as playing an important role in arousal, attention, memory and motivation. Acetylcholine has also been found in cells of non-neural origins as well as microbes. Recently, enzymes related to its synthesis, degradation and cellular uptake have been traced back to early origins of unicellular eukaryotes. The protist pathogens Acanthamoeba spp. have shown evidence of the presence of ACh, which provides growth and proliferative signals via a membrane-located M1-muscarinic receptor homolog. Partly because of acetylcholine's muscle-activating function, but also because of its functions in the autonomic nervous system and brain, many important drugs exert their effects by altering cholinergic transmission. Numerous venoms and toxins produced by plants, animals, and bacteria, as well as chemical nerve agents such as sarin, cause harm by inactivating or hyperactivating muscles through their influences on the neuromuscular junction. Drugs that act on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, such as atropine, can be poisonous in large quantities, but in smaller doses they are commonly used to treat certain heart conditions and eye problems. Scopolamine, or diphenhydramine, which also act mainly on muscarinic receptors in an inhibitory fashion in the brain (especially the M1 receptor) can cause delirium, hallucinations, and amnesia through receptor antagonism at these sites. So far as of 2016, only the M1 receptor subtype has been implicated in anticholinergic delirium. The addictive qualities of nicotine are derived from its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. == Chemistry == Acetylcholine is a choline molecule that has been acetylated at the oxygen atom. Because of the charged ammonium group, acetylcholine does not penetrate lipid membranes. Because of this, when the molecule is introduced externally, it remains in the extracellular space and at present it is considered that the molecule does not pass through the blood–brain barrier. == Biochemistry == Acetylcholine is synthesized in certain neurons by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase from the compounds choline and acetyl-CoA. Cholinergic neurons are capable of producing ACh. An example of a central cholinergic area is the nucleus basalis of Meynert in the basal forebrain. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase converts acetylcholine into the inactive metabolites choline and acetate. This enzyme is abundant in the synaptic cleft, and its role in rapidly clearing free acetylcholine from the synapse is essential for proper muscle function. Certain neurotoxins work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, thus leading to excess acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis of the muscles needed for breathing and stopping the beating of the heart. == Functions == Acetylcholine functions in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS, cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus support the cognitive functions of those target areas. In the PNS, acetylcholine activates muscles and is a major neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system. === Cellular effects === Like many other biologically active substances, acetylcholine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. There are two main classes of acetylcholine receptor, nicotinic and muscarinic. They are named for chemicals that can selectively activate each type of receptor without activating the other: muscarine is a compound found in the mushroom Amanita muscaria; nicotine is found in tobacco. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. In other words, they are ion channels embedded in cell membranes, capable of switching from a closed to an open state when acetylcholine binds to them; in the open state they allow ions to pass through. Nicotinic receptors come in two main types, known as muscle-type and neuronal-type. The muscle-type can be selectively blocked by curare, the neuronal-type by hexamethonium. The main location of muscle-type receptors is on muscle cells, as described in more detail below. Neuronal-type receptors are located in autonomic ganglia (both sympathetic and parasympathetic), and in the central nervous system. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have a more complex mechanism, and affect target cells over a longer time frame. In mammals, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been identified, labeled M1 through M5. All of them function as G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a second messenger system. The M1, M3, and M5 subtypes are Gq-coupled; they increase intracellular levels of IP3 and calcium by activating phospholipase C. Their effect on target cells is usually excitatory. The M2 and M4 subtypes are Gi/Go-coupled; they decrease intracellular levels of cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Their effect on target cells is usually inhibitory. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are found in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system of the heart, lungs, upper gastrointestinal tract, and sweat glands. === Neuromuscular junction === Acetylcholine is the substance the nervous system uses to activate skeletal muscles, a kind of striated muscle. These are the muscles used for all types of voluntary movement, in contrast to smooth muscle tissue, which is involved in a range of involuntary activities such as movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract and constriction of blood vessels. Skeletal muscles are directly controlled by motor neurons located in the spinal cord or, in a few cases, the brainstem. These motor neurons send their axons through motor nerves, from which they emerge to connect to muscle fibers at a special type of synapse called the neuromuscular junction. When a motor neuron generates an action potential, it travels rapidly along the nerve until it reaches the neuromuscular junction, where it initiates an electrochemical process that causes acetylcholine to be released into the space between the presynaptic terminal and the muscle fiber. The acetylcholine molecules then bind to nicotinic ion-channel receptors on the muscle cell membrane, causing the ion channels to open. Sodium ions then flow into the muscle cell, initiating a sequence of steps that finally produce muscle contraction. Factors that decrease release of acetylcholine (and thereby affecting P-type calcium channels): Antibiotics (clindamycin, polymyxin) Magnesium: antagonizes P-type calcium channels Hypocalcemia Anticonvulsants Diuretics (furosemide) Eaton-Lambert syndrome: inhibits P-type calcium channels Myasthenia gravis Botulinum toxin: inhibits SNARE proteins Calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem) do not affect P-channels. These drugs affect L-type calcium channels. === Autonomic nervous system === The autonomic nervous system controls a wide range of involuntary and unconscious body functions. Its main branches are the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. Broadly speaking, the function of the sympathetic nervous system is to mobilize the body for action; the phrase often invoked to describe it is fight-or-flight. The function of the parasympathetic nervous system is to put the body in a state conducive to rest, regeneration, digestion, and reproduction; the phrase often invoked to describe it is ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"". Both of these aforementioned systems use acetylcholine, but in different ways. At a schematic level, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are both organized in essentially the same way: preganglionic neurons in the central nervous system send projections to neurons located in autonomic ganglia, which send output projections to virtually every tissue of the body. In both branches the internal connections, the projections from the central nervous system to the autonomic ganglia, use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to innervate (or excite) ganglia neurons. In the parasympathetic nervous system the output connections, the projections from ganglion neurons to tissues that do not belong to the nervous system, also release acetylcholine but act on muscarinic receptors. In the sympathetic nervous system the output connections mainly release noradrenaline, although acetylcholine is released at a few points, such as the sudomotor innervation of the sweat glands. ==== Direct vascular effects ==== Acetylcholine in the serum exerts a direct effect on vascular tone by binding to muscarinic receptors present on vascular endothelium. These cells respond by increasing production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, leading to vasodilation. === Central nervous system === In the central nervous system, ACh has a variety of effects on plasticity, arousal and reward. ACh has an important role in the enhancement of alertness when we wake up, in sustaining attention and in learning and memory. Damage to the cholinergic (acetylcholine-producing) system in the brain has been shown to be associated with the memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease. ACh has also been shown to promote REM sleep. In the brainstem acetylcholine originates from the Pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus collectively known as the mesopontine tegmentum area or pontomesencephalotegmental complex. In the basal forebrain, it originates from the basal nucleus of Meynert and medial septal nucleus: The pontomesencephalotegmental complex acts mainly on M1 receptors in the brainstem, deep cerebellar nuclei, pontine nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive. It also projects to the thalamus, tectum, basal ganglia and basal forebrain. Basal nucleus of Meynert acts mainly on M1 receptors in the neocortex. Medial septal nucleus acts mainly on M1 receptors in the hippocampus and parts of the cerebral cortex. In addition, ACh acts as an important internal transmitter in the striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. It is released by cholinergic interneurons. In humans, non-human primates and rodents, these interneurons respond to salient environmental stimuli with responses that are temporally aligned with the responses of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. ==== Memory ==== Acetylcholine has been implicated in learning and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug scopolamine impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals. In animals, disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the neocortex impairs the learning of simple discrimination tasks, comparable to the acquisition of factual information and disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas produces forgetfulness, comparable to anterograde amnesia in humans. == Diseases and disorders == === Myasthenia gravis === The disease myasthenia gravis, characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, occurs when the body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine nicotinic receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission. Over time, the motor end plate is destroyed. Drugs that competitively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (e.g., neostigmine, physostigmine, or primarily pyridostigmine) are effective in treating the symptoms of this disorder. They allow endogenously released acetylcholine more time to interact with its respective receptor before being inactivated by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve and muscle). == Pharmacology == Blocking, hindering or mimicking the action of acetylcholine has many uses in medicine. Drugs acting on the acetylcholine system are either agonists to the receptors, stimulating the system, or antagonists, inhibiting it. Acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists can either have an effect directly on the receptors or exert their effects indirectly, e.g., by affecting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which degrades the receptor ligand. Agonists increase the level of receptor activation; antagonists reduce it. Acetylcholine itself does not have therapeutic value as a drug for intravenous administration because of its multi-faceted action (non-selective) and rapid inactivation by cholinesterase. However, it is used in the form of eye drops to cause constriction of the pupil during cataract surgery, which facilitates quick post-operational recovery. === Nicotinic receptors === Nicotine binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, mimicking the effect of acetylcholine at these receptors. ACh opens a Na+ channel upon binding so that Na+ flows into the cell. This causes a depolarization, and results in an excitatory post-synaptic potential. Thus, ACh is excitatory on skeletal muscle; the electrical response is fast and short-lived. Curares are arrow poisons, which act at nicotinic receptors and have been used to develop clinically useful therapies. === Muscarinic receptors === Muscarinic receptors form G protein-coupled receptor complexes in the cell membranes of neurons and other cells. Atropine is a non-selective competitive antagonist with Acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. === Cholinesterase inhibitors === Many ACh receptor agonists work indirectly by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The resulting accumulation of acetylcholine causes continuous stimulation of the muscles, glands, and central nervous system, which can result in fatal convulsions if the dose is high. They are examples of enzyme inhibitors, and increase the action of acetylcholine by delaying its degradation; some have been used as nerve agents (Sarin and VX nerve gas) or pesticides (organophosphates and the carbamates). Many toxins and venoms produced by plants and animals also contain cholinesterase inhibitors. In clinical use, they are administered in low doses to reverse the action of muscle relaxants, to treat myasthenia gravis, and to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (rivastigmine, which increases cholinergic activity in the brain). === Synthesis inhibitors === Organic mercurial compounds, such as methylmercury, have a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups, which causes dysfunction of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. This inhibition may lead to acetylcholine deficiency, and can have consequences on motor function. === Release inhibitors === Botulinum toxin (Botox) acts by suppressing the release of acetylcholine, whereas the venom from a black widow spider (alpha-latrotoxin) has the reverse effect. ACh inhibition causes paralysis. When bitten by a black widow spider, one experiences the wastage of ACh supplies and the muscles begin to contract. If and when the supply is depleted, paralysis occurs. == Comparative biology and evolution == Acetylcholine is used by organisms in all domains of life for a variety of purposes. It is believed that choline, a precursor to acetylcholine, was used by single celled organisms billions of years ago for synthesizing cell membrane phospholipids. Following the evolution of choline transporters, the abundance of intracellular choline paved the way for choline to become incorporated into other synthetic pathways, including acetylcholine production. Acetylcholine is used by bacteria, fungi, and a variety of other animals. Many of the uses of acetylcholine rely on its action on ion channels via GPCRs like membrane proteins. The two major types of acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, have convergently evolved to be responsive to acetylcholine. This means that rather than having evolved from a common homolog, these receptors evolved from separate receptor families. It is estimated that the nicotinic receptor family dates back longer than 2.5 billion years. Likewise, muscarinic receptors are thought to have diverged from other GPCRs at least 0.5 billion years ago. Both of these receptor groups have evolved numerous subtypes with unique ligand affinities and signaling mechanisms. The diversity of the receptor types enables acetylcholine to create varying responses depending on which receptor types are activated, and allow for acetylcholine to dynamically regulate physiological processes. ACh receptors are related to 5-HT3 (serotonin), GABA, and Glycine receptors, both in sequence and structure, strongly suggesting that they have a common evolutionary origin. == History == In 1867, Adolf von Baeyer resolved the structures of choline and acetylcholine and synthesized them both, referring to the latter as acetylneurin in the study. Choline is a precursor for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine was first noted to be biologically active in 1906, when Reid Hunt (1870–1948) and René de M. Taveau found that it decreased blood pressure in exceptionally tiny doses. This was after Frederick Walker Mott and William Dobinson Halliburton noted in 1899 that choline injections decreased the blood pressure of animals. In 1914, Arthur J. Ewins was the first to extract acetylcholine from nature. He identified it as the blood pressure-decreasing contaminant from some Claviceps purpurea ergot extracts, by the request of Henry Hallett Dale. Later in 1914, Dale outlined the effects of acetylcholine at various types of peripheral synapses and also noted that it lowered the blood pressure of cats via subcutaneous injections even at doses of one nanogram. The concept of neurotransmitters was unknown until 1921, when Otto Loewi noted that the vagus nerve secreted a substance that inhibited the heart muscle whilst working as a professor in the University of Graz. He named it vagusstoff (""vagus substance""), noted it to be a structural analog of choline and suspected it to be acetylcholine. In 1926, Loewi and E. Navratil deduced that the compound is probably acetylcholine, as vagusstoff and synthetic acetylcholine lost their activity in a similar manner when in contact with tissue lysates that contained acetylcholine-degrading enzymes (now known to be cholinesterases). This conclusion was accepted widely. Later studies confirmed the function of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. In 1936, H. H. Dale and O. Loewi shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their studies of acetylcholine and nerve impulses. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Warning over combining common medicines for elderly",Acetylcholine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -3.273621405242011e-05), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.009781407192349434), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.0531076592742465e-06), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.4742506742477417), ('ĠMED', -0.005266127642244101), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025101364590227604)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.005234002135694027), (' MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; ([my.clevelandclinic.org](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24568-acetylcholine-ach?utm_source=openai), [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/ingredient/acetylcholine.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=221, start_index=21, title='Acetylcholine (ACh): What It Is, Function & Deficiency', type='url_citation', url='https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24568-acetylcholine-ach?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=221, start_index=21, title='Acetylcholine - brand name list from Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/ingredient/acetylcholine.html?utm_source=openai')])"

2637,"('Adenosine', 'Adenine riboside', 'Adenocard', 'Adenoscan', 'Beta-d-adenosine')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Adenosine (symbol A) is an organic compound that occurs widely in nature in the form of diverse derivatives. The molecule consists of an adenine attached to a ribose via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Adenosine is one of the four nucleoside building blocks of RNA (and its derivative deoxyadenosine is a building block of DNA), which are essential for all life on Earth. Its derivatives include the energy carriers adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate, also known as AMP/ADP/ATP. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is pervasive in signal transduction. Adenosine is used as an intravenous medication for some cardiac arrhythmias. Adenosyl (abbreviated Ado or 5'-dAdo) is the chemical group formed by removal of the 5′-hydroxy (OH) group. It is found in adenosylcobalamin (an active form of vitamin B12) and as a radical in the radical SAM enzymes. == Medical uses == === Supraventricular tachycardia === In individuals with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is a first line treatment used to help identify and convert the rhythm. Certain SVTs can be successfully terminated with adenosine. This includes any re-entrant arrhythmias that require the AV node for the re-entry, e.g., AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). In addition, atrial tachycardia can sometimes be terminated with adenosine. Fast rhythms of the heart that are confined to the atria (e.g., atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) or ventricles (e.g., monomorphic ventricular tachycardia), and do not involve the AV node as part of the re-entrant circuit, are not typically converted by adenosine. However, the ventricular response rate is temporarily slowed with adenosine in such cases. Because of the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent SVTs, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. When adenosine is used to cardiovert an abnormal rhythm, it is normal for the heart to enter ventricular asystole for a few seconds. This can be disconcerting to a normally conscious patient, and is associated with angina-like sensations in the chest. === Nuclear stress test === Adenosine is used as an adjunct to thallium (TI 201) or technetium (Tc99m) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (nuclear stress test) in patients unable to undergo adequate stress testing with exercise. === Dosage === When used to treat SVT, adenosine is administered intravenously as a rapid bolus (typically 0.10–0.15 mg/kg initially) over 1-2 seconds, followed by a rapid saline flush (often using a 2-way or 3-way stopcock). If the initial dose is ineffective, it may be repeated every 2 minutes with a slightly increased dose (0.05–0.1 mg/kg increments) every 2 minutes up to a maximum total dose of 0.3 mg/kg (not exceeding 12 mg). Due to adenosine's extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), it is often injected through a central venous line or a large proximal peripheral vein; administration into lower extremities, PICC lines, or smaller veins may lead to therapeutic failure due to rapid metabolism before reaching the heart. When given to dilate the arteries, such as in a ""stress test"", the dosage is typically 0.14 mg/kg/min, administered for 4 or 6 minutes, depending on the protocol. The recommended dose may be increased in patients on theophylline since methylxanthines prevent binding of adenosine at receptor sites. The dose is often decreased in patients on dipyridamole (Persantine) and diazepam (Valium) because adenosine potentiates the effects of these drugs. The recommended dose is also reduced by half in patients presenting congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, shock, hypoxia, and/or chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease, and in elderly patients. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects associated with adenosine administration are primarily due to its activation of adenosine receptors on vascular tissue, resulting in vasodilation. Side effects of adenosine include skin flushing, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, nervousness, numbness, and a sense of impending doom. These effects are typically very short-lived due to adenosine's rapid metabolism and short half-life. Less common, but more serious, cardiovascular effects can occur, such as cardiac arrhythmias (including premature atrial and ventricular contractions and atrioventricular (AV) block), hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and prolonged asystole. == Drug interactions == Dipyridamole potentiates the action of adenosine, requiring the use of lower doses. Methylxanthines (e.g. caffeine found in coffee, theophylline found in tea, or theobromine found in chocolate) have a purine structure and bind to some of the same receptors as adenosine. Methylxanthines act as competitive antagonists of adenosine and can blunt its pharmacological effects. Individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines may require increased doses of adenosine. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine to the adenosine A1 receptor, which enhances release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase. ""Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine,"" which allows it to bind and block its receptors. == Contraindications == Common contraindications for adenosine include Asthma, traditionally considered an absolute contraindication. This is being contested, and it is now considered a relative contraindication (however, selective adenosine antagonists are being investigated for use in treatment of asthma) == Pharmacological effects == Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3). Extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nM; however, in response to cellular damage (e.g., in inflammatory or ischemic tissue), these concentrations are quickly elevated (600–1,200 nM). Thus, in regard to stress or injury, the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia, ischemia, and seizure activity. Activation of A2A receptors produces a constellation of responses that in general can be classified as anti-inflammatory. Enzymatic production of adenosine can be anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive. === Adenosine receptors === All adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) are G-protein-coupled receptors. The four receptor subtypes are further classified based on their ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. The A1 receptors couple to Gi/o and decrease cAMP levels, while the A2 adenosine receptors couple to Gs, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, A1 receptors couple to Go, which has been reported to mediate adenosine inhibition of Ca2+ conductance, whereas A2B and A3 receptors also couple to Gq and stimulate phospholipase activity. Researchers at Cornell University have recently shown adenosine receptors to be key in opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mice dosed with adenosine have shown increased transport across the BBB of amyloid plaque antibodies and prodrugs associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and cancers of the central nervous system. === Ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor === Adenosine is an endogenous agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor. However, while it is able to increase appetite, unlike other agonists of this receptor, adenosine is unable to induce the secretion of growth hormone and increase its plasma levels. === Mechanism of action === When it is administered intravenously, adenosine causes transient heart block in the atrioventricular (AV) node. This is mediated via the A1 receptor, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP and so causing cell hyperpolarization by increasing K+ efflux via inward rectifier K+ channels, subsequently inhibiting Ca2+ current. It also causes endothelial-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle as is found inside the artery walls. This causes dilation of the ""normal"" segments of arteries, i.e. where the endothelium is not separated from the tunica media by atherosclerotic plaque. This feature allows physicians to use adenosine to test for blockages in the coronary arteries, by exaggerating the difference between the normal and abnormal segments. The administration of adenosine also reduces blood flow to coronary arteries past the occlusion. Other coronary arteries dilate when adenosine is administered while the segment past the occlusion is already maximally dilated, which is a process called coronary steal. This leads to less blood reaching the ischemic tissue, which in turn produces the characteristic chest pain. == Metabolism == Adenosine used as a second messenger can be the result of de novo purine biosynthesis via adenosine monophosphate (AMP), though it is possible other pathways exist. When adenosine enters the circulation, it is broken down by adenosine deaminase, which is present in red blood cells and the vessel wall. Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine nucleoside transporter, allows adenosine to accumulate in the blood stream. This causes an increase in coronary vasodilatation. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a known cause of immunodeficiency. == Research == === Viruses === The adenosine analog NITD008 has been reported to directly inhibit the recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the dengue virus by terminating its RNA chain synthesis. This interaction suppresses peak viremia and rise in cytokines and prevents lethality in infected animals, raising the possibility of a new treatment for this flavivirus. The 7-deaza-adenosine analog has been shown to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus. BCX4430 is protective against Ebola and Marburg viruses. Such adenosine analogs are potentially clinically useful since they can be taken orally. === Anti-inflammatory properties === Adenosine is believed to be an anti-inflammatory agent at the A2A receptor. Topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction. Topical administration of adenosine for use in wound-healing deficiencies and diabetes mellitus in humans is currently under clinical investigation. Methotrexate's anti-inflammatory effect may be due to its stimulation of adenosine release. === Central nervous system === In general, adenosine has an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system (CNS). Caffeine's stimulatory effects are credited primarily (although not entirely) to its capacity to block adenosine receptors, thereby reducing the inhibitory tonus of adenosine in the CNS. This reduction in adenosine activity leads to increased activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. Experimental evidence suggests that adenosine and adenosine agonists can activate Trk receptor phosphorylation through a mechanism that requires the adenosine A2A receptor. === Hair === Adenosine has been shown to promote thickening of hair on people with thinning hair. A 2013 study compared topical adenosine with minoxidil in male androgenetic alopecia, finding it was as potent as minoxidil (in overall treatment outcomes) but with higher satisfaction rate with patients due to “faster prevention of hair loss and appearance of the newly grown hairs” (further trials were called for to clarify the findings). === Sleep === Adenosine is a key factor in regulating the body's sleep-wake cycle. Adenosine levels rise during periods of wakefulness and lowers during sleep. Higher adenosine levels correlate with a stronger feeling of sleepiness, also known as sleep drive or sleep pressure. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is considered one of the most effective treatments for insomnia, utilizes short-term sleep deprivation to raise and regulate adenosine levels in the body, for the intended promotion of consistent and sustained sleep in the long term. A principal component of cannabis delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) induces sleep in rats by increasing adenosine levels in the basal forebrain. These components also significantly increase slow-wave sleep during the sleep cycle, mediated by CB1 receptor activation. These findings identify a potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids to induce sleep in conditions where sleep may be severely attenuated. == Vasodilation == It also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation. == See also == Adenosine receptor Adenosine reuptake inhibitor List of growth hormone secretagogues == References ==",Adenoscan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.10027480870485306), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.176947600673884e-05), (' END', -3.297462171758525e-05), ('OG', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ENO', -0.0015036711702123284), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0010800487361848354), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.006735360249876976), ('ĠEND', -0.00023648326168768108), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014222566038370132)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/adenoscan.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=9, title='Adenoscan Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/adenoscan.html?utm_source=openai')])"

These compounds led to the synthesis of a new generation, sugar modified nucleoside analog vidarabine, and the related compound cytarabine.

The drug was first synthesized in 1960 in the Bernard Randall Baker lab at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International). The drug was originally intended as an anti-cancer drug. The anti-viral activity of vidarabine was first described by M. Privat de Garilhe and J. De Rudder in 1964. It was the first nucleoside analog antiviral to be given systemically and was the first agent to be licensed for the treatment of systemic herpes virus infection in humans. It was University of Alabama at Birmingham researcher and physician Richard J. Whitley in 1976 where the clinical effectiveness of vidarabine was first realized, and vidarabine was used in the treatment of many viral diseases. Vidarabine is an analog of adenosine with the D-ribose replaced with D-arabinose. As you can see from figure 1.1 that it is a stereoisomer of adenosine. It has a half-life of 60 minutes, and its solubility is 0.05%, and is able to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) when converted to its active metabolite. == Mode of action == The Mechanism of action of vidarabine Vidarabine works by interfering with the synthesis of viral DNA. It is a nucleoside analog and therefore has to be phosphorylated to be active. This is a three-step process in which vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP. This is the active form of vidarabine and is both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of ‘faulty’ DNA. This is where ara-ATP is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can no longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Vidarabine triphosphate (ara-ATP) also inhibits RNA polyadenylation; preventing polyadenylation essential for HIV-1 and other retroviruses; and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, preventing transmethylation reactions. Uniquely to vidarabine, the diphosphorylated vidarabine (ara-ADP) also has an inhibitory effect. Other nucleoside analogs need to be triphosphorlated to give any antiviral effect, but ara-ADP inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. This prevents the reduction of nucleotide diphosphates, causing a reduction of viral replication. == Mode of resistance == Vidarabine is more toxic and less metabolically stable than many of the other current antivirals such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Viral strains resistant to vidarabine show changes in DNA polymerase. It is prone to deamination by adenosine deaminase to inosine. This metabolite still possesses antiviral activity, but is 10-fold less potent than vidarabine. 60% of vidarabine eliminated by the kidney is excreted as 9-β-D-arabinofuranosylhypoxanthine in the urine. Some breakdown of the purine ring may also occur, forming uric acid. Structural modifications of vidarabine have proven partially effective at blocking deamination, such as replacement of the amine with a methoxy group (ara-M). This results in about a 10-fold greater selectivity against Varicella Zoster Virus than ara-A, however analog of vidarabine is inactive against other viruses due to it not being able to be phosphorylated. The use of an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase to increase the half-life of vidarabine has also been tried, and drugs such as dCF and EHNA have been used with a small amount of success. == Synthesis, preparation and isolation == Chemical synthesis of Vidarabine was first attained in 1960, as a part of studies on developing potential anticancer agents by B. R. Baker et al. based on unique biological properties of 1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (ara-U). More specifically some of its important reactions include treatments with 2'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphorylase, methyltransferase, or nucleoside phosphorylase, affording the corresponding 5'-phosphate, giving rise to no methylation at its 5-position, or no cleavage of the glycosyl bond in contrast to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine,. respectively. This earlier work gave impetus to further synthetic studies on the nucleosides with the β-D-arabinofuranosyl moiety including Vidarabine, and the isolation of Vidarabine from the fermentation culture broth of Streptomyces antibioticus. In addition to the potential anticancer properties antiviral activity of Vidarabine was also demonstrated in 1965. Particularly worthy of mention is the collaboration of efficient chemical and enzymatic reactions, i.e., transesterification from ethylene carbonate to uridine accompanied by spontaneous intramolecular elimination of carbon dioxide giving 2,2'-O-anhydro-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (anhydro-ara-U); and acid-hydrolysis of anhydro-ara-U giving ara-U; and subsequent enzymatic transglycosylation of the sugar moiety of ara-U to the 9-position of adenine with perfect retention of the β-configuration. and following papers. Ultimately, in 1984, these pioneering syntheses led to the first commercial synthesis of Vidarabine in Japan under the trade name of ""Arasena-A."" An enzymatic approach duplicating the same concept was also later reported. Furthermore, replacement of adenine with 2-fluoroadenine in the enzymatic transglycosylation reaction from ara-U to the 9-position of adenine made it bring about efficient synthesis of 2-fluoro-9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (fludarabine). == Selectivity == Vidarabine is less susceptible to the development of drug resistant strains than other antivirals such as IDU, and has been used successfully in the treatment of IDU resistant viral strains. The half-life of the active triphosphate metabolite (ara-ATP) is three times longer in HSV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells, however the mechanism of selectivity is not known. == Clinical indication == Vidarabine is an antiviral, active against herpes viruses, poxviruses, rhabdoviruses, hepadnaviruses and some RNA tumour viruses. A 3% ophthalmic ointment Vira-A is used in the treatment of acute keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent superficial keratitis caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2. Vidarabine is also used to treat herpes zoster in AIDS patients, reducing lesions formation and the duration of viral shedding. Many of the previous uses of vidarabine have been superseded by acyclovir, due to the hospitalisation required for intra venous dosing, and acyclovir has a higher selectivity, lower inhibitory concentration and higher potency. Toxic side effects are rare, but have been reported with high concentrations of vidarabine, such as nausea, vomiting, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving high intravenous doses daily. == References ==",Arabinosyladenine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.497983460780233e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0067289662547409534)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006715370807796717), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"

It is a neutral, stable compound. Kifunensine is a potent inhibitor of the mannosidase I enzyme and is primarily used in cell culture to make high mannose glycoproteins. Inside a cell, it prevents endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I (ERM1) from trimming mannose residues from precursor glycoproteins. Kifunensine shows no inhibitory action against mannosidase II or the endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase, and it weakly inhibits arylmannosidase. When incorporated in cell culture media, kifunensine has shown no significant impact on cell growth or glycoprotein production yield. Kifunensine has shown potential for treatment of sarcoglycanopathies and lysosomal storage disorders. == History == Kifunensine was first isolated by Iwami et al. in 1987, and described as a new type of immunoactive substance. It was originally prepared by culturing the actinobacterium Kitasatosporia kifunense in a suitable medium at 25–33 °C for several days, followed by extraction of the alkaloid. The structure of kifunensine was published in 1989 by Kayakiri et al. == Enzyme inhibition == Kifunensine is a potent inhibitor of the mannosidase I enzyme. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than deoxymannojirimycin – an alkaloid with a similar structure. Kifunensine inhibits human endoplasmic reticulum α-1,2-mannosidase I and Golgi Class I mannosidases IA, IB and IC with Ki values of 130 and 23 nM, respectively. Being a neutral molecule (cf other mannosidase inhibitors such as deoxymannojirimycin), it can permeate inside cells. Once inside a cell, kifunensine blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mannosidase I (ERM1). This blocks processing of glycoproteins in the ER, to leave them with glycoforms with mainly nine mannose residues attached to two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Man9GlcNAc2). The addition of 5–20 μM kifunensine to mammalian cell culture media is sufficient to achieve complete mannosidase I inhibition. Kifunensine does not inhibit mannosidase II or the endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase. It weakly inhibits arylmannosidase. == Synthesis == Kayakiri et al. published a synthesis of kifunensine from D-glucose in 1990 and a synthesis of 8-epi-kifunensine in 1991. A synthesis of kifunensine and some analogues, from L-ascorbic acid, was published by Hering et al. in 2005. Kifunensine is now made by GlycoSyn in a commercial process from N-acetylmannosamine in eight steps via a patented process. == Uses == === Production of high mannose glycoproteins in cell culture === Kifunensine's inhibitory action has led to its use in the preparation of high mannose glycoproteins by culture of transformed mammalian cells. It is easier to modify the glycosylation of a glycoprotein by using a culture media ingredient with an existing transformed cell line than by generating a new cell line, especially if many cell lines or leads are being screened. === Therapeutic uses === Kifunensine's use as a therapeutic is currently being researched in several conditions that benefit from its ability to inhibit mannosidase I. ==== Sarcoglycanopathies ==== Sarcoglycanopathies are autosomal recessive muscular disorders of the Limb–girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LMGD) group. Four forms, LGMD 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F have been identified, which result from defects in the γ-, α-, β- and δ-sarcoglycan genes. There are fewer than 1,500 patients with sarcoglycanopathy in the European Union. In cell-based assays and in an animal model, kifunensine was found to be particularly suited to addressing LGMD 2D (R77C substitution), which has been diagnosed in patients in Europe, Africa, Japan and Brazil. Kifunensine was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of each of γ-, α-, β- and δ-sarcoglycanopathy by the European Medicines Agency in October 2011. A patent for the treatment of sarcoglycanopathies is held by Genethon. Claim 11 relates to the use of kifunensine as an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, particularly of mannosidase I. The development of kifunensine was put on hold due to side effects that need further analysis. ==== Lysosomal storage disorders ==== In the lysosomal storage disorders – Gaucher's disease and Tay–Sachs disease – endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents the native folding of mutated lysosomal enzymes in a patient's fibroblasts. Kifunensine, given in very low concentration (50 nM), inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I and interferes with early substrate recognition, prolonged ER retention and substrate folding. It did not cause irremediably misfolded proteins to accumulate or induce apoptosis in the cells. In addition, the combination of ERAD inhibition using kifunensine with proteostasis modulation (MG-132 = Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al) to enhance the cellular folding capacity, resulted in the synergistic rescue of mutated enzymes. A patent held by Rice University makes the following claims: #9 : A method comprising administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of at least one inhibitor of ER-associated degradation #10 : The method of claim 9 wherein the subject has Gaucher's disease or Tay–Sachs disease #11 : The method of claim 9 wherein the inhibitor is eeyarestatin I or kifunensine. == References ==",Kifunensine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.02015700750052929), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0031793788075447083), (' INDUSTR', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.047406673431396484), ('ICAL', -3.099436753473128e-06), (',', -0.20143868029117584), ('ĠINDU', -0.04272444173693657), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005257945042103529)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.1271582394838333), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.002475777640938759), (' INDUSTR', -5.836499985889532e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kifunensine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2144287/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300908420300717 ', [])"

It is secretolytic, increasing the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract, which makes the phlegm thinner and less viscous. This contributes to a secretomotoric effect, allowing the cilia to more easily transport the phlegm out of the lungs. For this reason it is often added to cough syrups. It has been shown to increase the proportion of serous bronchial secretion, making it more easily expectorated. It is indicated as ""secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport"". Bromhexine is contained in various formulations, high and low strength syrups 8 mg/5 ml, 4 mg/5 ml, tablets and soluble tablets (both with 8 mg bromhexine) and solution for oral use 10 mg/5 ml, adapted to the need of the patients.

2643,"('Lincomycin (hydrochloride monohydrate)', 'Lincomycin', 'Cillimycin', 'Lincolnensin', 'Lincomycinum')",Medical,"Lincomycin is a lincosamide antibiotic that comes from the actinomycete Streptomyces lincolnensis. A related compound, clindamycin, is derived from lincomycin by using thionyl chloride to replace the 7-hydroxy group with a chlorine atom with inversion of chirality. It was released for medical use in September 1964. == Uses == Although similar in antibacterial spectrum and mechanism of action to macrolides, lincomycin is also effective against other organisms including actinomycetes and some species of Mycoplasma and Plasmodium. However, because of its adverse effects and toxicity, it is rarely used today and reserved for patients allergic to penicillin or where bacteria have developed resistance. == Clinical pharmacology == Intramuscular administration of a single dose of 600 mg of Lincomycin produces average peak serum levels of 11.6 μg/mL at 60 min, and maintains therapeutic levels for 17 h to 20 h, for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion after this dose ranges from 1.8% to 24.8% (mean: 17.3%). A two-hour intravenous infusion of 600 mg of Lincomycin achieves average peak serum levels of 15.9 μg/mL and yields therapeutic levels for 14 h for most susceptible gram-positive organisms. Urinary excretion ranges from 4.9% to 30.3% (mean: 13.8%). The biological half-life after IM or IV administration is 5.4 ± 1.0 h. The serum half-life of lincomycin may be prolonged in patients with severe impairment of renal function, compared to patients with normal renal function. In patients with abnormal hepatic function, serum half-life may be twofold longer than in patients with normal hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing lincomycin from the serum. Tissue level studies indicate that bile is an important route of excretion. Significant levels have been demonstrated in the majority of body tissues. Although lincomycin appears to diffuse in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), levels of lincomycin in the CSF appear inadequate for the treatment of meningitis. == Biosynthesis == Lincomycin is an antibiotic classified as a member of the lincosamide class, which typically features a L-proline amino acid derivative linked through amide group with an eight-carbon aminothio sugar. The two units 4-propyl-L-proline and the amino-octose, are each synthesized separately, and are then condensed by LmbD protein, and then further postcondensation reactions involving cleaving of mycothiol, deacetylation, and S-methylation finally yield lincomycin. The biosynthesis of the amino acid moiety of lincomycin, starts with tyrosine which is transformed to 4-propyl-L-proline by the consecutive action of LmbB1, LmbB2, LmbW, LmbA and LmbX proteins. 4-Propyl-L-proline is activated by LmbC and loaded into LmbN, a bifunctional peptidyl carrier protein, and is ready for condensation by LmbD. The biosynthetic pathway for production of the amino-octose moiety is almost fully elucidated although the order of the steps still needs further research. Condensation through a transaldolase (LmbR) of ribose 5-phosphate (C5) with fructose 6-phosphate or sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (providing a C3 unit) forms the octose (C8). Further transformations involving isomerization (LmbN), 1-phosphorylation (LmbP), 8-dephosphorylation (LmbK), guanosine diphosphate attachment at position 1 (LmbO), 4-epimerization (LmbM), 6-oxidation (LmbL), amination (LmbS), imine reduction (LmbZ) and 8-reduction, are performed to construct the amino-octose unit. LmbT protein exchange GDP by ergothioneine and the condensation with 4-propyl-L-proline and catalysed by LmbD can occur. The amide-linked product between the amino acid and the amino-octose bound to ergothioneine is then the substrate of LmbV, which substitute ergothioneine by mycothiol. The mycothiol moiety is then cleaved by LmbE, and the product is further processed by LmbIH, LmbQ, LmbJ, LmbF and is finally sulphur methylated by LmbG, to afford lincomycin. == Spectrum of susceptibility == Lincomycin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and cell wall-less bacteria including pathogenic species of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma. Lincomycin is used to treat severe bacterial infections in patients who cannot use penicillin antibiotics. Lincomycin shows weak activity against most Gram-negative bacteria. The following represents susceptibility (MIC) data for a few pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus - 0.2 μg/mL - 32 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae - 0.05 μg/mL - 0.4 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes - 0.04 μg/mL - 0.8 μg/mL == References ==",Lincolnensin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005535095697268844), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00020895205670967698), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003189241047948599)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([scbt.com](https://www.scbt.com/p/lincomycin-154-21-2?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=9, title='Lincomycin | CAS 154-21-2 | SCBT - Santa Cruz Biotechnology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.scbt.com/p/lincomycin-154-21-2?utm_source=openai')])"

Beraprost showed EP(3) agonism and induced LPA and SPA vasoconstriction, whereas the EP(3) antagonist inhibited this vasoconstriction and enhanced beraprost- and iloprost-induced SPA vasodilation. These findings suggest that the EP(3) agonism of beraprost and iloprost interfered with the SPA vasodilation resulting from their IP receptor agonism.

Fresh ginger does not contain zingerone, but it is produced by cooking or drying of the ginger root, which causes a reverse aldol reaction on gingerol. == Production == === History === Zingerone was first isolated from the ginger root in 1917 by Hiroshi Nomura, a chemistry professor at Tokyo Imperial University. Nomura named the compound and identified the empirical formula of zingerone in his studies at the laboratory of the Agricultural College. He initially identified it as the chemical component contributing pungency to ginger, something further work has disproven. === Current methods === Nomura identified and later patented a method for the synthesis of zingerone, in which vanillin and acetone are reacted under basic conditions to form dehydrozingerone. This compound is obtained in about 95% quantity. This reaction is followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the intermediate compound in order to form zingerone, obtained in approximately 100% quantity. == Biological effects == Ginger compounds have been shown to be active against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin-induced diarrhea. This type of diarrhea is the leading cause of infant death in developing countries. Zingerone is likely the active constituent responsible for the antidiarrheal efficacy of ginger. Zingerone is recognized as being a particularly efficient free radical scavenger. It is able to scavenge and degrade free radicals and reactive oxygen species in the body, and inhibits enzymes involved in the generation of these reactive oxygen species. It is used by some flowers to attract pollinating fruit flies by mimicking the sex pheromone of the fly. == References ==",Vanillylacetone,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -3.173704271830502e-06), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.023251768201589584), (' PERSONAL', -0.0024827925954014063), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0014486543368548155), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.002574583748355508), ('ĠPERSON', -0.2031797468662262), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6932058334350586)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The efficacy of oral limaprost was evaluated in adult Japanese patients in three randomised, double-blind, 6-week trials. One study included patients with thromboangiitis obliterans and two trials included patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Limaprost was generally well tolerated and serious adverse events were uncommon. THROMBOANGIITIS OBLITERANS: In a randomised, double-blind trial in Japanese patients primarily with thromboangiitis obliterans (n=136), there was no significant difference between patients receiving limaprost 30 microg/day and those receiving oral ticlopidine 500 microg/day in the improvement of ischaemic symptoms. LUMBAR SPINAL CANAL STENOSIS: Limaprost 15 microg/day was superior to limaprost 3 microg/day for overall drug usefulness and overall improvement from baseline to study end in a phase III trial in 146 patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Assessment of overall improvement considered various objective symptoms (e.g. muscle strength, walking ability) and subjective symptoms (e.g. pain or numbness in extremities), while overall usefulness also considered safety issues. The efficacy of limaprost 15 microg/day was not significantly different from that of 30 microg/day, but tended to be better than that of 6 microg/day in a phase II trial in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis and normal straight leg raise test results. The optimal dosage of limaprost for this indication was therefore deemed to be 15 microg/day. To investigate the association between the use of limaprost and the risk of bleeding. A self-controlled case series analysis was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database in South Korea. We identified patients aged 18 years or older who had at least one prescription of limaprost and were diagnosed with at least one case of bleeding between 2003 and 2019. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of bleeding was calculated by dividing the incidence rate in the exposed period to limaprost by that in the unexposed period and adjusted for age using conditional Poisson regression model. Among 72,860 patients with limaprost prescriptions and bleeding diagnoses, there were 184,732 events of bleeding. After adjusting for age, the IRR was 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-1.50), wherein the IRR was the highest during the 0-7 days after limaprost initiation (IRR, 2.11; 95% CI, 2.03-2.18). Risk of bleeding was higher when limaprost was concomitantly used with antithrombotics or other drugs for spinal stenosis treatment, and when higher daily doses of limaprost were administered. Our findings suggest that the risk of bleeding increased by 1.5-fold in periods of limaprost exposure compared to unexposed periods, with particularly higher risks observed during the first week after limaprost initiation, with concomitant drugs related to bleeding, and with a higher daily dose. A careful risk-benefit assessment is warranted when initiating limaprost, especially when administered with other medications or in higher daily doses. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of (and risk factors for) postoperative pregabalin and/or limaprost to treat persistent numbness and/or pain of the lower extremities after lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) surgery. Medical records of 329 patients (168 men, 161 women; average age 70 years) were retrospectively reviewed for data on the duration of LSS diagnosis; LSS disease; preoperative medication (limaprost, pregabalin, or combined limaprost/pregabalin; duration); symptoms; preoperative/postoperative intermittent claudication (IC); operation type; and postoperative medication and period. Limaprost, pregabalin, and combined limaprost/pregabalin were prescribed preoperatively for 43%, 7%, and 5% of patients, respectively. At an average of 21 months postoperatively, limaprost, pregabalin, and combined therapy were prescribed in 11%, 8%, 4% of patients, respectively. Medication requirement was significantly lower postoperatively than preoperatively (P < 0.0001). Significant risk factors for required postoperative medication were required preoperative medication (odds ratio [OR] 3.088, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.679 to 5.681]; postoperative period (OR 1.063, 95% CI 1.031 to 1.096); and postoperative IC (OR 3.868, 95% CI 1.481 to 10.103). A negative impact from postoperative medication was seen in patients who had undergone decompression surgery (OR 0.589, 95% CI 0.377 to 0.918). Overall, 23% of LSS patients required medication for pain and/or numbness at 21 months postoperatively. Significant factors portending required postoperative medication were preoperative medication, longer postoperative period, and postoperative IC.

2647,"('Cefixime', 'Cephoral', 'Cefixima', 'Cefiximum', 'Cefspan')",Medical,"Cefixime, sold under the brand name Suprax among others, is an antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections. These infections include otitis media, strep throat, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and Lyme disease. For gonorrhea typically only one dose is required. In the United States it is a second-line treatment to ceftriaxone for gonorrhea. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions and Clostridioides difficile diarrhea. It is not recommended in people with a history of a severe penicillin allergy. It appears to be relatively safe during pregnancy. It is in the third-generation cephalosporin class of medications. It works by disrupting the bacteria's cell wall resulting in its death. Cefixime was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication in the United States. == Medical uses == Cefixime treats infections of the: Urinary tract: Uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Ear: Otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Throat: Tonsillitis and pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Chest and lungs: Chronic bronchitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Cervix and urethra: Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by susceptible isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates). Skin and soft tissue infection: effective against group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci are resistant. It is also used to treat typhoid fever. === Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility === Cefixime is a broad spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic and is commonly used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, urinary tract, and upper respiratory tract. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: Escherichia coli: 0.015 μg/mL – 4 μg/mL Haemophilus influenzae: ≤0.004 μg/mL – >4 μg/mL Proteus mirabilis: ≤0.008 μg/mL – 0.06 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.12 μg/mL Staphylococcus aureus: >128 μg/mL (Resistant) Enterobacter spp.: >128 μg/mL (Resistant) == Mechanism of action == The bactericidal action of Cefixime is due to the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It binds to one of the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of the peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death. Absorption Only 40–50% is absorbed from the GI tract (oral bioavailability). Absorption may be slowed but not decreased when taken with food. Average peak concentration after administration of oral suspension is approximately 25–50% greater than the peak concentration following oral tablet or capsules administration. Distribution It has high concentrations in bile and urine. It can cross the placenta and its protein binding capacity is 65%. == Contraindications == Cefixime is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or allergies to cephalosporin class of antibiotics. As Cefixime is a third generation cephalosporin, it is not contraindicated for patients with a true penicillin allergy. == Adverse effects == Adverse drug reactions include diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes, urticaria and Stevens–Johnson syndrome have been reported. There is no specific antidote for cefixime overdosage. == Drug interactions == Alcohol – No major interaction has been observed between cefixime and alcohol. == History == It was sold under the trade name Suprax 125 in the United States until 2003, when it was taken off the market by drug manufacturer Wyeth after its patent expired. Lupin started selling Suprax in the United States in 2007, and it is available in different formulations and strengths. == Marketing == Cefixime is marketed under many brand names worldwide; examples include Fixacef, Pancef, Caricef, Taxim o, Texit, Ofex, Ceftid, Cef-3, Denvar, 3-C, Cefim, Magnett, Oroken, Ofiken, Fix-A, and Zifi.

It is a small molecule inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) used for the treatment of cancer. FGFRs are a subset of tyrosine kinases which are unregulated in some tumors and influence tumor cell differentiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Astex Pharmaceuticals discovered the drug and licensed it to Janssen Pharmaceuticals for further development. == Medical uses == In the United Statest, erdafitinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations whose disease has progressed on or after at least one line of prior systemic therapy. In April 2019, erdafitinib was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer with an FGFR3 or FGFR2 alteration that has progressed beyond traditional platinum-based therapies, subject to a confirmatory trial. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. In January 2024, the FDA approved erdafitinib for adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations, as determined by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, whose disease has progressed on or after at least one line of prior systemic therapy. In August 2024, the EMA approved erdafitinib for adults with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) carrying susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations. == Side effects == Common side effects include increased phosphate level, mouth sores, feeling tired, change in kidney function, diarrhea, dry mouth, nails separating from the bed or poor formation of the nail, change in liver function, low salt (sodium) levels, decreased appetite, change in sense of taste, low red blood cells (anemia), dry skin, dry eyes and hair loss. Other side effects include redness, swelling, peeling or tenderness on the hands or feet (hand foot syndrome), constipation, stomach pain, nausea and muscle pain. Erdafitinib may cause serious eye problems, including inflamed eyes, inflamed cornea (front part of the eye) and disorders of the retina, an internal part of the eye. Patients are advised to have eye examinations intermittently and to tell their health care professional right away if they develop blurred vision, loss of vision or other visual changes. == History == The efficacy of erdafitinib was studied in a clinical trial (NCT02365597) that included 87 adults with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, with FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations, that had progressed following treatment with chemotherapy. The overall response rate in these adults was 32.2%, with 2.3% having a complete response and almost 30% having a partial response. The response lasted for a median of approximately five-and-a-half months. The trial was conducted in Asia, Europe, and the United States. Erdafitinib received an accelerated approval. Further clinical trials are required to confirm erdafitinib's clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies. Erdafitinib was also granted breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA granted the approval of Balversa to Janssen Pharmaceutical. The FDA also approved the therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit, developed by Qiagen Manchester, Ltd., for use as a companion diagnostic with erdafinitib for this therapeutic indication. In January 2024, the FDA approved erdafitinib for adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations, as determined by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test, whose disease has progressed on or after at least one line of prior systemic therapy. This approval amends the indication previously granted under accelerated approval for people with metastatic urothelial carcinoma with susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 alterations after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. Efficacy was evaluated in Study BLC3001 Cohort 1, a randomized, open-label trial of 266 participants with metastatic urothelial carcinoma harboring selected FGFR3 alterations who had received 1-2 prior systemic treatments, including a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive erdafitinib or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (docetaxel or vinflunine). Randomization was stratified by region, performance status, and presence of visceral or bone metastases.

2650,"('Propofol', 'Diprivan', 'Disoprofol', 'Disoprivan', 'Diisopropylphenol')",Medical,"Propofol is the active component of an intravenous anesthetic formulation used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It is chemically termed 2,6-diisopropylphenol. The formulation was approved under the brand name Diprivan. Numerous generic versions have since been released. Intravenous administration is used to induce unconsciousness after which anesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. It is manufactured as part of a sterile injectable emulsion formulation using soybean oil and lecithin, giving it a white milky coloration. Recovery from propofol-induced anesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g., drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) compared to other anesthetic agents. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction or maintenance of anesthesia prior to and during surgeries. It may be administered as a bolus or an infusion, or some combination of the two. First synthesized in 1973, by John B. Glen, a British veterinary anesthesiologist working for Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI, later AstraZeneca), in 1986 propofol was introduced for therapeutic use as a lipid emulsion in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Propofol (Diprivan) received FDA approval in October 1989. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Uses == === Anesthesia === To induce general anesthesia, propofol is the drug used almost exclusively, having largely replaced sodium thiopental. It is often administered as part of an anesthesia maintenance technique called total intravenous anesthesia, using either manually programmed infusion pumps or computer-controlled infusion pumps in a process called target controlled infusion (TCI). Propofol is also used to sedate people who are receiving mechanical ventilation but not undergoing surgery, such as patients in the intensive care unit. In critically ill patients, propofol is superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost. Propofol is relatively inexpensive compared to medications of similar use due to shorter ICU stay length. One of the reasons propofol is thought to be more effective (although it has a longer half-life than lorazepam) is that studies have found that benzodiazepines like midazolam and lorazepam tend to accumulate in critically ill patients, prolonging sedation. Propofol has also been suggested as a sleep aid in critically ill adults in an ICU setting; however, the effectiveness of this medicine in replicating the mental and physical aspects of sleep for people in the ICU is not clear. Propofol can be administered via a peripheral IV or central line. Propofol is often paired with fentanyl (for pain relief) in intubated and sedated people. The two drugs are molecularly compatible in an IV mixture form. Propofol is also used to deepen anesthesia to relieve laryngospasm. It may be used alone or followed by succinylcholine. Its use can avoid the need for paralysis and in some instances the potential side-effects of succinylcholine. === Routine procedural sedation === Propofol is safe and effective for gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures (colonoscopies etc.). Its use in these settings results in a faster recovery compared to midazolam. It can also be combined with opioids or benzodiazepines. Because of its rapid induction and recovery time, propofol is also widely used for sedation of infants and children undergoing MRI procedures. It is also often used in combination with ketamine with minimal side effects. === COVID-19 === In March 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Propofol‐Lipuro 1% to maintain sedation via continuous infusion in people older than sixteen with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit ICU setting. During the public health emergency, it was considered unfeasible to limit Fresenius Propoven 2% Emulsion or Propofol-Lipuro 1% to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, so it was made available to all ICU patients under mechanical ventilation. This EUA has since been revoked. === Status epilepticus === Status epilepticus may be defined as seizure activity lasting beyond five minutes and needing anticonvulsant medication. Several guidelines recommend the use of propofol for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. === Other uses === ==== Assisted death in Canada ==== A lethal dose of propofol is used for medical assistance in dying in Canada to quickly induce deep coma and death, but rocuronium is always given as a paralytic ensuring death, even when the patient has died as a result of initial propofol overdose. ==== Capital punishment ==== The use of propofol as part of an execution protocol has been considered, although no individual has been executed using this agent. This is largely due to European manufacturers and governments banning the export of propofol for such use. ==== Recreational use ==== Recreational use of the drug via self-administration has been reported but is relatively rare due to its potency and the level of monitoring required for safe use. Critically, a steep dose-response curve makes recreational use of propofol very dangerous, and deaths from self-administration continue to be reported. The short-term effects sought via recreational use include mild euphoria, hallucinations, and disinhibition. Recreational use of the drug has been described among medical staff, such as anesthetists who have access to the drug. It is reportedly more common among anesthetists on rotations with short rest periods, as usage generally produces a well-rested feeling. Long-term use has been reported to result in addiction. Attention to the risks of off-label use of propofol increased in August 2009, after the release of the Los Angeles County coroner's report that musician Michael Jackson had died from a mixture of propofol and the benzodiazepine drugs lorazepam, midazolam, and diazepam on 25 June 2009. According to a 22 July 2009 search warrant affidavit unsealed by the district court of Harris County, Texas, Jackson's physician, Conrad Murray, administered 25 milligrams of propofol diluted with lidocaine shortly before Jackson's death. == Manufacturing == Propofol as a commercial sterile emulsified formulation is considered difficult to manufacture. It was initially formulated in Cremophor for human use, but this original formulation was implicated in an unacceptable number of anaphylactic events. It was eventually manufactured as a 1% emulsion in soybean oil. Sterile emulsions represent complex formulation, the stability of which is dependent on the interplay of many factors such as micelle size and distribution. == Side effects == One of propofol's most common side effects is pain on injection, especially in smaller veins. This pain arises from activation of the pain receptor, TRPA1, found on sensory nerves and can be mitigated by pretreatment with lidocaine. Less pain is experienced when infused at a slower rate in a large vein (antecubital fossa). Patients show considerable variability in their response to propofol, at times showing profound sedation with small doses. Additional side effects include low blood pressure related to vasodilation, transient apnea following induction doses, and cerebrovascular effects. Propofol has more pronounced hemodynamic effects relative to many intravenous anesthetic agents. Reports of blood pressure drops of 30% or more are thought to be at least partially due to inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity. This effect is related to the dose and rate of propofol administration. It may also be potentiated by opioid analgesics. Propofol can also cause decreased systemic vascular resistance, myocardial blood flow, and oxygen consumption, possibly through direct vasodilation. There are also reports that it may cause green discoloration of the urine. Although propofol is widely used in the adult ICU setting, the side effects associated with medication seem to be more concerning in children. In the 1990s, multiple reported deaths of children in ICUs associated with propofol sedation prompted the FDA to issue a warning. As a respiratory depressant, propofol frequently produces apnea. The persistence of apnea can depend on factors such as premedication, dose administered, and rate of administration, and may sometimes persist for longer than 60 seconds. Possibly as the result of depression of the central inspiratory drive, propofol may produce significant decreases in respiratory rate, minute volume, tidal volume, mean inspiratory flow rate, and functional residual capacity. Propofol administration also results in decreased cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. In addition, propofol may decrease intraocular pressure by as much as 50% in patients with normal intraocular pressure. A more serious but rare side effect is dystonia. Mild myoclonic movements are common, as with other intravenous hypnotic agents. Propofol appears to be safe for use in porphyria, and has not been known to trigger malignant hyperpyrexia. Propofol is also reported to induce priapism in some individuals, and has been observed to suppress REM sleep and to worsen the poor sleep quality in some patients. Rare side effects include: anxiety changes in vision cloudy urine coughing up blood delirium or hallucinations difficult urination difficulty swallowing dry eyes, mouth, nose, or throat As with any other general anesthetic agent, propofol should be administered only where appropriately trained staff and facilities for monitoring are available, as well as proper airway management, a supply of supplemental oxygen, artificial ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation. Because of propofol's formulation (using lecithin and soybean oil), it is prone to bacterial contamination, despite the presence of the bacterial inhibitor benzyl alcohol; consequently, some hospital facilities require the IV tubing (of continuous propofol infusions) to be changed after 12 hours. This is a preventive measure against microbial growth and potential infection. === Propofol infusion syndrome === A rare, but serious, side effect is propofol infusion syndrome. This potentially lethal metabolic derangement has been reported in critically ill patients after a prolonged infusion of high-dose propofol, sometimes in combination with catecholamines and/or corticosteroids. == Interactions == The respiratory effects of propofol are increased if given with other respiratory depressants, including benzodiazepines. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Propofol has been proposed to have several mechanisms of action, both through potentiation of GABAA receptor activity and therefore acting as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, thereby slowing the channel-closing time. At high doses, propofol may be able to activate GABAA receptors in the absence of GABA, behaving as a GABAA receptor agonist as well. Propofol analogs have been shown to also act as sodium channel blockers. Some research has also suggested that the endocannabinoid system may contribute significantly to propofol's anesthetic action and to its unique properties, as endocannabinoids also play an important role in the physiologic control of sleep, pain processing and emesis. An EEG study on patients undergoing general anesthesia with propofol found that it causes a prominent reduction in the brain's information integration capacity. Propofol is an inhibitor of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, which metabolizes the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). Activation of the endocannabinoid system by propofol, possibly via inhibition of AEA catabolism, generates a significant increase in the whole-brain content of AEA, contributing to the sedative properties of propofol via CB1 receptor activation. This may explain the psychotomimetic and antiemetic properties of propofol. By contrast, there is a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after administration of volatile anesthetics, which contribute to a significant decrease in the whole-brain content of AEA that can last up to forty minutes after induction. === Pharmacokinetics === Propofol is highly protein-bound in vivo and is metabolized by conjugation in the liver. The half-life of elimination of propofol has been estimated to be between 2 and 24 hours. However, its duration of clinical effect is much shorter, because propofol is rapidly distributed into peripheral tissues. When used for IV sedation, a single dose of propofol typically wears off within minutes. Onset is rapid, in as little as 15–30 seconds. Propofol is versatile; the drug can be given for short or prolonged sedation, as well as for general anesthesia. Its use is not associated with nausea as is often seen with opioid medications. These characteristics of rapid onset and recovery along with its amnestic effects have led to its widespread use for sedation and anesthesia. == History == John B. Glen, a veterinarian and researcher at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), spent thirteen years developing propofol, an effort for which he was awarded the 2018 Lasker Award for clinical research. Originally developed as ICI 35868, propofol was chosen after extensive evaluation and structure–activity relationship studies of the anesthetic potencies and pharmacokinetic profiles of a series of ortho-alkylated phenols. First identified as a drug candidate in 1973, propofol entered clinical trials in 1977, using a form solubilized in cremophor EL. However, due to anaphylactic reactions to cremophor, this formulation was withdrawn from the market and subsequently reformulated as an emulsion of a soya oil and propofol mixture in water. The emulsified formulation was relaunched in 1986 by ICI (whose pharmaceutical division later became a constituent of AstraZeneca) under the brand name Diprivan. The preparation contains 1% propofol, 10% soybean oil, and 1.2% purified egg phospholipid as an emulsifier, with 2.25% glycerol as a tonicity-adjusting agent, and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH. Diprivan contains EDTA, a common chelation agent, that also acts alone (bacteriostatically against some bacteria) and synergistically with some other antimicrobial agents. Newer generic formulations contain sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant and benzyl alcohol as an antimicrobial agent. Propofol emulsion is an opaque white fluid due to the scattering of light from the emulsified micelle formulation. == Developments == A water-soluble prodrug form, fospropofol, has been developed and tested with positive results. Fospropofol is rapidly broken down by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase to form propofol. Marketed as Lusedra, this formulation may not produce the pain at the injection site that often occurs with the conventional form of the drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the product in 2008. By incorporation of an azobenzene unit, a photoswitchable version of propofol (AP2) was developed in 2012 that allows for optical control of GABAA receptors with light. In 2013, a propofol binding site on mammalian GABAA receptors has been identified by photolabeling using a diazirine derivative. Additionally, it was shown that the hyaluronan polymer present in the synovia can be protected from free-radical depolymerization by propofol. Ciprofol is another derivative of propofol that is 4–6 times more potent than propofol. As of 2022 it is undergoing Phase III trials. Ciprofol appears to have a lower incidence of injection site pain and respiratory depression than propofol. Propofol has also been studied for treatment resistant depression. == Veterinary uses == In November 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration approved PropofolVet Multidose, the first generic propofol injectable emulsion for dogs. PropofolVet Multidose is approved for use as an injectable anesthetic in dogs. PropofolVet Multidose contains the same active ingredient (propofol injectable emulsion) as the approved brand name drug product, PropoFlo 28, which was first approved on 4 February 2011. In addition, the FDA determined that PropofolVet Multidose contains no inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient. PropofolVet Multidose is sponsored by Parnell Technologies Pty. Ltd. based in New South Wales, Australia. == References == == External links == GB patent 1472793, John B.

The clinically used form of cefamandole is the formate ester cefamandole nafate, a prodrug which is administered parenterally. Cefamandole is no longer available in the United States. The chemical structure of cefamandole, like that of several other cephalosporins, contains an N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) side chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Vitamin K supplement is recommended during therapy, and consumption of ethanol and ethanol-containing substances is discouraged.

2652,"('Helicid', 'Helicide', 'Helicidum', 'Hilicidum', 'Benzaldehyde, 4-(b-d-allopyranosyloxy)-')",Medical," Staphylocoagulase (Coa) plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The present study was undertaken to investigate the underlying mechanism which helicid (HEL) suppressed the virulence factor Coa, as well as to assess the synergistic inhibitory effects of HEL in conjunction with antibiotics, thereby establishing the potential of HEL as an antibacterial adjuvant. We employed coagulation and biofilm assays to comprehensively assess the inhibitory impact of HEL on S. aureus pathogenicity. The thermal shift assay demonstrated that HEL exerted a direct impact on the protein stability of Coa, evidenced by a 6 °C change in melting temperature (ΔTm) at a concentration of 100 μM. HEL binding to Coa proteins was further validated by molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence quenching. Molecular docking and point mutation assays identified S23 and D112 as crucial binding sites for HEL and Coa. Furthermore, HEL has been observed to potentiate the bactericidal properties of ceftaroline fosamil (CEF-F), concurrently diminishing the resistance exhibited by S. aureus towards CEF-F, as demonstrated by antibiotic synergy tests and resistance induction assays. The combination of HEL and CEF-F effectively reduced the number of bacteria and improved the survival of both Galleria mellonella larvae and mice. Additionally, a significant decrease was observed in the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ in mice broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Ultimately, our findings confirmed that the direct binding of HEL to Coa could diminish the pathogenicity of S. aureus. Moreover, the combination with CEF-F substantially reduced the lethality associated with S. aureus-infected pneumonia and extended the efficacy of the antibiotic. Increasing evidence has shown that apoptosis in the hippocampus is closely related to depressive-like behavior. We previously reported that helicid had good antidepressant activities, which manifested as the alleviation of depression-like behaviors and the reversal of the high expression of neurocalcin delta ( We developed the CUMS rat model using CUMS stimulation from week 0 to week 6.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are unclear. We have now investigated the effect of helicid on depression-related behaviors in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and have also explored possible underlying mechanisms that involve neurotrophin expression. After 6 weeks isolation, body weight and sucrose preference were significantly reduced in rats with CUMS-induced depression compared with controls. The CUMS rats also showed significant inhibition of locomotory parameters in open field tests (involving behavioral assays). Helicid significantly regulated levels of corticosterone (CORT), inflammatory cytokines and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Helicid also reversed CUMS-induced decreases of 5-HT1A receptor expression and promoted brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus The significant reversal of depressive-like behaviors by helicid is similar to that achieved by fluoxetine.

2653,"('Corticosterone', ""Kendall's compound b"", ""Reichstein's substance h"", 'Corticosteron', 'Compound b')","Endogenous, Medical","Corticosterone, also known as 17-deoxycortisol and 11β,21-dihydroxyprogesterone, is a 21-carbon steroid hormone of the corticosteroid type produced in the cortex of the adrenal glands. In the very rare case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency cortisol production is blocked. == Roles == In many species, including amphibians, reptiles, rodents and birds, corticosterone is a main glucocorticoid, involved in regulation of energy, immune reactions, and stress responses. However, in humans, cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid that is produced primarily in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Corticosterone has only weak glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid potencies in humans and is important mainly as an intermediate in the steroidogenic pathway from pregnenolone to aldosterone. Corticosterone is converted to aldosterone by aldosterone synthase, found only in the mitochondria of glomerulosa cells. Glomerulosa cells are found in the zona glomerulosa, which is the most superficial region of endocrine cells in the adrenal cortex. Corticosterone is the precursor molecule to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, one of the major homeostatic modulators of sodium and potassium levels in vivo. == Release or generation mechanisms == One example of a release pathway relates to UV-B stimulation on the skins of certain amphibians such as the Rough-skinned Newt, Taricha granulosa; this trigger seems to cause the internal generation of corticosterone in that species. == Corticosterone in birds == A sizable amount of research has been done on the effects of corticosterone in birds. A brief survey of this research is below. Corticosterone both inhibits protein synthesis and degrades proteins. Birds with increased levels of corticosterone will have slower feather growth during their molting period and an extended period of poor flight. As a result, many birds have reduced levels of corticosterone when they moult so as to prevent the degradation of their new feathers. Interestingly, higher levels of corticosterone are also associated with a wider range of exploration, despite beforementioned inhibited feather growth. Corticosterone has further developmental effects on birds. Increased levels of corticosterone in chicks leads to increased begging for food and aggressiveness. In the short term this leads to higher chance of obtaining food, but in the long term, increased corticosterone in early life compromises the birds cognitive functioning (problem solving, association of visual cue with food, etc.). Parental response to increased begging by chicks is an increased time foraging for food. This leaves the nest of chicks without protection for increased durations of time. To counter this, during extended periods of food shortage, chicks of some species may suppress corticosterone activity and thus reduce the negative effects elevated corticosterone induces. == Effect on memory == Corticosterone has multiple effects on memory. The main effects are seen through the impact of stress on emotional memories as well as long term memory (LTM). With emotional memories, corticosterone is largely associated with fear memory recognition. Studies have shown that when fear memories are reactivated or consolidated, levels of corticosterone increased. The increase in corticosterone is linked to anxiety relief. This finding depends on the time at which the administration of corticosterone took place as compared to when the fear conditioning took place; corticosterone can either facilitate or interrupt conditioned fear. Not only does corticosterone have effects on emotional memories but memory recognition and consolidation as well. With respect to recognition and long term memories, corticosterone has variable effects. Studies show that the modification of certain chemical and brain processes that affect corticosterone levels can also impact stress effects on memory. In studies on rats, the fluctuations of corticosterone concentration are shown to prevent stress' impairment of recognition memory in lower amounts. These lower levels seem to be linked to the rescue of stress-induced attenuation of CA1 long-term potentiation. When researchers looked at stress effects on LTM, they found many outcomes. In multiple studies, the formation of LTM (tested 24 h later) was found to be enhanced by corticosterone in some studies, while the persistence of LTM (tested at least 1 wk later) was only assisted by corticosterone in the late phase of memory consolidation and reconsolidation. Stress facilitates the consolidation but disrupts the reconsolidation of emotional memory. As mentioned previously, the persistence of LTM is selectively enhanced when stress and corticosterone are administered during the late phase after acquisition, but it is disrupted when stress and corticosterone are administered during the late phase after retrieval of memory. With regards to the persistence of LTM, there is a restricted time window between acquisition and retrieval where persistence is affected. These studies found that while persistence of LTM is selectively affected based on stage of memory, the formation of LTM is left intact after a certain length of time. Up to this point, studies have not agreed as to whether or not these processes are dependent on corticosterone or what even happens based on corticosterone in these processes and how memory is ultimately affected. In the end, corticosterone affects many processes in terms of memory as well as different types of memories themselves. == Additional images == == See also == 11-Deoxycortisol 11-Deoxycorticosterone Cortisol == References == == External links == Corticosterone MS Spectrum",Corticosterone,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.64708495605737e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.00858072005212307), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.3589766240329482e-05), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20144160091876984)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -4.961759259458631e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS;  ', [])"

In a packed bed reactor, a reaction coupling separation was realized and a production yield of steviolbioside reached 90% in 6 h. The hydrolysis product steviolbioside presented higher cytoxicity on human normal cells (hepatocytes cell L02 and intestinal epithelial cell T84) than stevioside did. Comparing to the typical chemotherapy agent, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), steviolbioside presents much lower cytotoxicity on all assayed human normal cells; it presented notable inhibition on human hepatocarcinoma cell Hep3B, human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and human pancreatic cancer cell BxPC-3. The remarkable inhibition on MDA-MB-231 cells makes steviolbioside a potential remedy for human breast cancer, when steviolbioside is served as a natural sweetener. 1,4-alpha-Glucosylation at the 13-O-glycosyl moiety of stevioside (S) and rubusoside (RU) results in a significant increase of sweetness. Saponification of the 19-COO-beta-glucosyl linkage of S and RU yielded steviolbioside (SB) (= 13-O-beta-sophorosyl-steviol) and steviolmonoside (SM) (= 13-O-beta-glucosyl-steviol), respectively, both of which are poorly soluble in an acetate buffer. It was found that the solubilities of SM and SB in the buffer solution were remarkably increased in the presence of gamma-cyclodextrin (gamma-CD). SB was solubilized in the buffer solution with the aid of gamma-CD, and the solution was subjected to 1,4-alpha-transglucosylation by using a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase-starch system to give a mixture of products which were glucosylated at the 13-O-glycosyl moiety. This mixture was acetylated, and the acetate was subjected to chemical beta-glucosylation of 19-COOH followed by deacetylation to afford compounds which have superior sweetness to S. In the same way, derivatives with superior sweetness were selectively prepared from RU through SM.

Compounds 2f, 2g and 4 of this series had favorable antibacterial effects, and were superior to penicillin G at inhibiting growth of Bacillus subtilis (BCRC 10029).

It was approved by the FDA in 2007, for use in dogs and in 2012, for cats. Maropitant mildly reduces intra-procedural inhaled anesthesia dose requirements but does not confer analgesia itself. == Veterinary uses == Injectable maropitant is used in dogs to treat and prevent acute vomiting; tablets are used for preventing vomiting from a variety of causes, though it requires a higher dose to prevent vomiting from motion sickness. The injectable version is also licensed for preventing and treating acute vomiting in cats. Maropitant is effective in treating vomiting from a variety of causes, including gastroenteritis, chemotherapy, and kidney failure; when given beforehand, it can prevent vomiting caused by using an opioid as a premedication. Some have claimed that maropitant is better at treating vomiting than nausea, pointing to cats with chronic kidney disease who, when receiving maropitant, had a reduction in vomiting but no corresponding increase in appetite. Maropitant has been used in acute cases of rapid or labored breathing to prevent vomiting that could lead to aspiration pneumonia. It has been given in combination with a benzodiazepine to cats prior to stressful events (such as a veterinary visit) to possibly relieve hypersensitivity. When compared to other antiemetics, maropitant has similar or greater effectiveness to chlorpromazine and metoclopramide for centrally mediated vomiting induced by apomorphine or xylazine. It works better than chlorpromazine and metoclopramide for vomiting peripherally induced induced with syrup of ipecac. Unlike dimenhydrinate and acepromazine, which are used for motion sickness, maropitant does not cause sedation. Maropitant has been used as an adjunct treatment in severe bronchitis due to its weak anti-inflammatory effects. It alleviates visceral pain and has been found to reduce the amount of general anesthesia (both sevoflurane and isoflurane) needed in some operations. Some believe that maropitant can be used in rabbits and guinea pigs to relieve pain caused by ileus (impaired bowel movements), though it lacks antiemetic effects in rabbits, who cannot vomit. Maropitant is given orally, subcutaneously, and intravenously. == Contraindications == Maropitant is only indicated for dogs at least 16 weeks old, as some very young puppies suffered bone marrow hypoplasia (incomplete development ). It should also be used with caution in animals with suspected GI obstruction or toxin ingestion, as it can mask symptoms, thereby delaying the diagnosis. It is not recommended to give maropitant for more than five consecutive days, as it tends to accumulate in the body due to one of the liver enzymes responsible for its metabolism, CYP2D15, becoming saturated. However, there have been studies where beagles who were given maropitant for two weeks in a row showed no signs of toxicity. Because maropitant is metabolized by the liver, caution should be taken when giving it to dogs with liver dysfunction. Caution should also be taken when giving it with other drugs that are also highly protein-bound, such as NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, and some behavior-modifying drugs; such drugs compete with maropitant for binding to plasma proteins, increasing the concentration of unbound maropitant in the blood. Maropitant should also not be used with calcium channel antagonists (used to treat high blood pressure) or in animals with heart disease, as it has a slight affinity for calcium and potassium channels. == Side effects == Maropitant is safer than other antiemetics used in veterinary medicine, in part because of its high specificity for its target and thus not binding to other receptors in the central nervous system. Side effects in dogs and cats include hypersalivation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Eight percent of dogs taking maropitant at doses meant to prevent motion sickness vomited right after, likely due to the local effects maropitant had on the gastrointestinal tract. Small amounts of food beforehand can prevent such post-administration vomiting. One of the most common side effects of subcutaneous administration is moderate to severe pain at the injection site. Although the manufacturer recommends keeping maropitant at room temperature, many people have noted that keeping it in the fridge reduces the sting upon injection. Only unbound maropitant causes pain – it is normally formulated with beta-cyclodextrin to increase solubility; at cooler temperatures, more of the maropitant remains bound to the cyclodextrin, leaving less maropitant unbound. While there is no pain related to the intravenous administration of maropitant, pushing a dose in too quickly can temporarily reduce blood pressure. Fewer than 1 in 10,000 dogs and cats experience anaphylactic reactions. == Overdose == Signs of maropitant overdose include lethargy, irregular or labored breathing, lack of muscle coordination, and tremors. Overdose of the oral formulation can cause salivation and nasal discharge, while overdose of intravenous maropitant can sometimes lead to reddish urine. The LD50 is high, being over 2,000 mg/kg for oral maropitant in rats. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Vomiting is caused when impulses from the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ) in the brain are sent to the vomiting center in the medulla. Motion sickness specifically occurs when signals to the CRTZ originate from the inner ear: motion is sensed by the fluid of the semicircular canals, which causes overstimulation. The signal travels to the brain's vestibular nuclei, then to the CRTZ, and finally to the vomiting center. Maropitant has a similar structure to substance P, the key neurotransmitter in causing vomiting, which allows it to act as an antagonist and bind to the substance P receptor neurokinin 1 (NK1). It is highly selective for NK1 over NK2 and NK3. Maropitant binds to the neurokinin receptors in the vagus nerves leaving the GI tract, as well as to receptors in the CRTZ and the vomiting center. By virtue of working at the last step in triggering vomiting, it can prevent a broader range of stimuli than most antiemetics can. It is effective against emetogens that act at the central nervous system (such as apomorphine in dogs and xylazine in cats), those that act in the periphery (e.g. syrup of ipecac), and those that act in both (e.g. cisplatin). === Pharmacokinetics === Maropitant's bioavailability is unaffected by the presence of food. Bioavailability is 91% at the standard subcutaneous dose but 24% at the standard oral dose; the standard oral dose is higher to partially compensate for incomplete bioavailability. It binds to plasma proteins at a rate of 99.5%; it has a low volume of distribution (9 L/kg) and is thus not extensively absorbed. Subcutaneously administered maropitant had peak plasma concentration around half an hour after administration; the mean half-life is 6–8 hours, and a single dose lasts 24 hours in dogs. Orally administered maropitant reached its peak plasma concentration within two hours. Maropitant undergoes 1st-pass metabolism by liver enzymes, mainly CYP2D15 (which has high affinity for maropitant and clears over 90% of it) but also by the lower-affinity CYP3A12. Repeat dosing of maropitant eventually saturates CYP2D15, causing the drug to accumulate due to reduced clearance. Thus, it is recommended to not use maropitant for more than five days straight, and to have a two-day rest period to allow maropitant to clear the body to prevent accumulation. Maropitant has over 21 metabolites, though its major one (produced by hydroxylation) is CJ-18,518. Maropitant clearance is slower in cats. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In February 2025, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the veterinary medicinal product Elmaro for cats and dogs. The applicant for this veterinary medicinal product is Elanco GmbH.

2657,"('Casein kinase ii inhibitor i', 'S5265')",Medical," Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), which was first detected by its binding to the kappa B site in the immunoglobulin kappa-gene enhancer, is important for the regulated expression of the kappa-gene and is partly responsible for the induction in appropriate cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 alpha receptor, beta-interferon and serum amyloid A protein. NF-kappa B is present as a nuclear DNA-binding protein in B lymphocytes and mature macrophages, but is found in the cytoplasm of many cells in a form unable to bind to DNA. The cytoplasmic form is bound to an inhibitor protein, I kappa B, from which it can be released in vitro by deoxycholate and other agents. Activation of cells by various agents, notably the phorbol esters that stimulate protein kinase C (PKC), leads to dissociation in vivo of the NF-kappa B/I kappa B complex and migration of NF-kappa B to the nucleus. Therefore, it acts as a second messenger system, transducing activation signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism of signal transfer, we have used an in vitro system in which addition of purified protein kinases to a partially purified NF-kappa B/I kappa B complex leads to the activation of the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B. Using gel retardation assays we found that PKC, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a haem-regulated eIF-2 kinase (HRI) could activate NF-kappa B in vitro, whereas casein kinase II was ineffective. To determine the target for the protein kinases we purified and characterized both NF-kappa B and I kappa B and found that I kappa B is phosphorylated and inactivated in the presence of PKC and HRI but not PKA.",Casein kinase ii inhibitor i,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.688212614681106e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.004351907875388861), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00204449356533587)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00033546582562848926)])","('INFO; ([merckmillipore.com](https://www.merckmillipore.com/ZA/en/product/Casein-Kinase-II-Inhibitor-I-CAS-17374-26-4-Calbiochem%2CEMD_BIO-218697?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=164, start_index=6, title='Casein Kinase II Inhibitor I - CAS 17374-26-4 - Calbiochem | 218697', type='url_citation', url='https://www.merckmillipore.com/ZA/en/product/Casein-Kinase-II-Inhibitor-I-CAS-17374-26-4-Calbiochem%2CEMD_BIO-218697?utm_source=openai')])"
2658,"('(r)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid', '(r)-proline', '(r)-2-carboxypyrrolidine', 'Proline', '(2r)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Proline (symbol Pro or P) is an organic acid classed as a proteinogenic amino acid (used in the biosynthesis of proteins), although it does not contain the amino group -NH2 but is rather a secondary amine. The secondary amine nitrogen is in the protonated form (NH2+) under biological conditions, while the carboxyl group is in the deprotonated −COO− form. The ""side chain"" from the α carbon connects to the nitrogen forming a pyrrolidine loop, classifying it as a aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it from the non-essential amino acid L-glutamate. It is encoded by all the codons starting with CC (CCU, CCC, CCA, and CCG). Proline is the only proteinogenic amino acid which is a secondary amine, as the nitrogen atom is attached both to the α-carbon and to a chain of three carbons that together form a five-membered ring. == History and etymology == Proline was first isolated in 1900 by Richard Willstätter who obtained the amino acid while studying N-methylproline, and synthesized proline by the reaction of sodium salt of diethyl malonate with 1,3-dibromopropane. The next year, Emil Fischer isolated proline from casein and the decomposition products of γ-phthalimido-propylmalonic ester, and published the synthesis of proline from phthalimide propylmalonic ester. The name proline comes from pyrrolidine, one of its constituents. == Biosynthesis == Proline is biosynthetically derived from the amino acid L-glutamate. Glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase (ATP-dependent) and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (which requires NADH or NADPH). This can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (using NADH or NADPH), or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase, followed by cyclisation by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline. == Biological activity == L-Proline has been found to act as a weak agonist of the glycine receptor and of both NMDA and non-NMDA (AMPA/kainate) ionotropic glutamate receptors. It has been proposed to be a potential endogenous excitotoxin. In plants, proline accumulation is a common physiological response to various stresses but is also part of the developmental program in generative tissues (e.g. pollen). A diet rich in proline was linked to an increased risk of depression in humans in a study from 2022 that was tested on a limited pre-clinical trial on humans and primarily in other organisms. Results were significant in the other organisms. == Properties in protein structure == The distinctive cyclic structure of proline's side chain gives proline an exceptional conformational rigidity compared to other amino acids. It also affects the rate of peptide bond formation between proline and other amino acids. When proline is bound as an amide in a peptide bond, its nitrogen is not bound to any hydrogen, meaning it cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor, but can be a hydrogen bond acceptor. Peptide bond formation with incoming Pro-tRNAPro in the ribosome is considerably slower than with any other tRNAs, which is a general feature of N-alkylamino acids. Peptide bond formation is also slow between an incoming tRNA and a chain ending in proline; with the creation of proline-proline bonds slowest of all. The exceptional conformational rigidity of proline affects the secondary structure of proteins near a proline residue and may account for proline's higher prevalence in the proteins of thermophilic organisms. Protein secondary structure can be described in terms of the dihedral angles φ, ψ and ω of the protein backbone. The cyclic structure of proline's side chain locks the angle φ at approximately −65°. Proline acts as a structural disruptor in the middle of regular secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets; however, proline is commonly found as the first residue of an alpha helix and also in the edge strands of beta sheets. Proline is also commonly found in turns (another kind of secondary structure), and aids in the formation of beta turns. This may account for the curious fact that proline is usually solvent-exposed, despite having a completely aliphatic side chain. Multiple prolines and/or hydroxyprolines in a row can create a polyproline helix, the predominant secondary structure in collagen. The hydroxylation of proline by prolyl hydroxylase (or other additions of electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine) increases the conformational stability of collagen significantly. Hence, the hydroxylation of proline is a critical biochemical process for maintaining the connective tissue of higher organisms. Severe diseases such as scurvy can result from defects in this hydroxylation, e.g., mutations in the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase or lack of the necessary ascorbate (vitamin C) cofactor. == Cis–trans isomerization == Peptide bonds to proline, and to other N-substituted amino acids (such as sarcosine), are able to populate both the cis and trans isomers. Most peptide bonds overwhelmingly adopt the trans isomer (typically 99.9% under unstrained conditions), chiefly because the amide hydrogen (trans isomer) offers less steric repulsion to the preceding Cα atom than does the following Cα atom (cis isomer). By contrast, the cis and trans isomers of the X-Pro peptide bond (where X represents any amino acid) both experience steric clashes with the neighboring substitution and have a much lower energy difference. Hence, the fraction of X-Pro peptide bonds in the cis isomer under unstrained conditions is significantly elevated, with cis fractions typically in the range of 3-10%. However, these values depend on the preceding amino acid, with Gly and aromatic residues yielding increased fractions of the cis isomer. Cis fractions up to 40% have been identified for aromatic–proline peptide bonds. From a kinetic standpoint, cis–trans proline isomerization is a very slow process that can impede the progress of protein folding by trapping one or more proline residues crucial for folding in the non-native isomer, especially when the native protein requires the cis isomer. This is because proline residues are exclusively synthesized in the ribosome as the trans isomer form. All organisms possess prolyl isomerase enzymes to catalyze this isomerization, and some bacteria have specialized prolyl isomerases associated with the ribosome. However, not all prolines are essential for folding, and protein folding may proceed at a normal rate despite having non-native conformers of many X–Pro peptide bonds. == Uses == Proline and its derivatives are often used as asymmetric catalysts in proline organocatalysis reactions. The CBS reduction and proline catalysed aldol condensation are prominent examples. In brewing, proteins rich in proline combine with polyphenols to produce haze (turbidity). L-Proline is an osmoprotectant and therefore is used in many pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications. The growth medium used in plant tissue culture may be supplemented with proline. This can increase growth, perhaps because it helps the plant tolerate the stresses of tissue culture. For proline's role in the stress response of plants, see § Biological activity. == Specialties == Proline is one of the two amino acids that do not follow along with the typical Ramachandran plot, along with glycine. Due to the ring formation connected to the beta carbon, the ψ and φ angles about the peptide bond have fewer allowable degrees of rotation. As a result, it is often found in ""turns"" of proteins as its free entropy (ΔS) is not as comparatively large to other amino acids and thus in a folded form vs. unfolded form, the change in entropy is smaller. Furthermore, proline is rarely found in α and β structures as it would reduce the stability of such structures, because its side chain α-nitrogen can only form one nitrogen bond. Additionally, proline is the only amino acid that does not form a red-purple colour when developed by spraying with ninhydrin for uses in chromatography. Proline, instead, produces an orange-yellow colour. == Synthesis == Racemic proline can be synthesized from diethyl malonate and acrylonitrile: == See also == Hyperprolinemia Inborn error of metabolism Prolidase deficiency Prolinol == References == == Further reading == == External links == Proline MS Spectrum Proline biosynthesis Proline biosynthesis",Proline,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0002285694790771231), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00026181264547631145), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.012153146788477898), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.288792165927589e-05), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.023293431848287582), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0007594323833473027), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06234883517026901)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -1.0325924449716695e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -2.15310683415737e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Proline,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00172 ', [])"

2660,"('Ethynodiol diacetate', 'Ethynodiol acetate', 'Femulen', 'Continuin', 'Ethinodiol diacetate')",Medical,"Etynodiol diacetate, or ethynodiol diacetate, sold under the brand name Ovulen among others, is a progestin medication which is used in birth control pills. The medication is available only in combination with an estrogen. It is taken by mouth. Etynodiol diacetate is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body, with etynodiol occurring as an intermediate. Etynodiol, a related compound, was discovered in 1954, and etynodiol diacetate was introduced for medical use in 1965. The combination ethynodiol with mestranol (Ovulen) was approved for medical use in the United States in 1966. The combination ethinylestradiol with ethynodiol (Demulen) was approved for medical use in the United States in 1970. In 2021, the combination with ethinylestradiol was the 276th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Etynodiol diacetate is used in combination with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol or mestranol in combined oral contraceptives for women for the prevention of pregnancy. == Side effects == == Pharmacology == Etynodiol diacetate is virtually inactive in terms of affinity for the progesterone and androgen receptors and acts as a rapidly converted prodrug of norethisterone, with etynodiol occurring as an intermediate. Upon oral administration and during first-pass metabolism in the liver, etynodiol diacetate is rapidly converted by esterases into etynodiol, which is followed by oxygenation of the C3 hydroxyl group to produce norethisterone. In addition to its progestogenic activity, etynodiol diacetate has weak androgenic activity, and, unlike most progestins but similarly to norethisterone and noretynodrel, also has some estrogenic activity. The pharmacokinetics of etynodiol diacetate have been reviewed. == Chemistry == Etynodiol diacetate, also known as 3β-hydroxy-17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 3β,17β-diaceate, 3β-hydroxynorethisterone 3β,17β-diacetate, or 17α-ethynylestr-4-ene-3β,17β-diol 3β,17β-diacetate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of 19-nortestosterone and 17α-ethynyltestosterone, or of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone), in which the C3 ketone group has been dehydrogenated into a C3β hydroxyl group and acetate esters have been attached at the C3β and C17β positions. Etynodiol diacetate is the 3β,17β-diacetate ester of etynodiol (17α-ethynylestr-4-ene-3β,17β-diol). === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of etynodiol diacetate have been published. Reduction of norethisterone (1) affords the 3,17-diol. The 3β-hydroxy compound is the desired product; since reactions at C3 do not show nearly the stereoselectivity as those at C17 by virtue of the relative lack of stereo-directing proximate substituents, the formation of the desired isomer is engendered by use of a bulky reducing agent, lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride. Acetylation of the 3β,17β-diol affords etynodiol diacetate (3). == History == Etynodiol was first synthesized in 1954, via reduction of norethisterone, and etynodiol diacetate was introduced for medical use in 1965. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Etynodiol diacetate is the generic name of the drug (the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of its free alcohol form is etynodiol), while ethynodiol diacetate is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is also known by its former developmental code names CB-8080 and SC-11800. === Brand names === Etynodiol diacetate is or has been marketed under brand names including Conova, Continuin, Demulen, Femulen, Kelnor, Lo-Malmorede, Luteonorm, Luto-Metrodiol, Malmorede, Metrodiol, Ovulen, Soluna, Zovia, and others. === Availability === Etynodiol diacetate is marketed in only a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Oman. == References ==",Continuin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.391981828026474e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005364783573895693)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/continuin ', [])"

Therefore we decided to investigate the antidepressant-like activity of the selective GABAB receptor antagonists CGP 36742 and CGP 51176, and a selective agonist CGP 44532 in models of depression in rats and mice. Effects of CGP 36742 and CGP 51176 as well as the agonist CGP 44532 were assessed in the forced swim test in mice. Both antagonists were also investigated in an olfactory bulbectomy (OB) model of depression in rats, while CGP 51176 was also investigated in the chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model of depression. The density of GABAB receptors in the mouse hippocampus after chronic administration of CGP 51176 was also investigated. The GABAB receptor antagonists CGP 36742 and CGP 51176 exhibited antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test in mice. The GABAB receptor agonist CGP 44532 was not effective in this test, however, it counteracted the antidepressant-like effects of CGP 51176. The antagonists CGP 36742 and CGP 51176 were effective in an OB model of depression in rats. CGP 51176 was also effective in the CMS rat model of depression. Administration of CGP 51176 increased the density of GABAB receptors in the mouse hippocampus. These data suggest that selective GABAB receptor antagonists may be useful in treatment of depression, and support an important role for GABA-ergic transmission in this disorder. Here, we show the modulation of somatostatin functions in the hippocampus by the orally active 'cognition enhancer' GABA(B) receptor antagonist, (3-aminopropyl)n-butylphosphinic acid (CGP-36742), both in vivo and in vitro. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray mass spectrometry, we measured a two-fold increase in the extracellular level of somatostatin to CGP-36742 application in the hippocampus of anaesthetised rats. The basal release of [125I]somatostatin in the synaptosomal fraction was increased by CGP-36742 in concentrations lower than 1 muM. Simultaneous measurement of [14C]Glu and [3H]gamma-aminobutyric-acid ([3H]GABA) showed that CGP-36742 increased their basal release. However, prior [125I]somatostatin application suppressed the increase in the basal release of [14C]Glu and induced a net decrease in the basal release of [3H]GABA. Somatostatin application had a similar effect. In slices, CGP-36742 increased the postsynaptic effect of somatostatin on CA1 pyramidal cells. These results suggest a pre- and postsynaptic functional 'cross-talk' between coexisting GABA(B) and somatostatin receptors in the rat hippocampus. We have evaluated the effect of the brain penetrating GABAb antagonist, CGP 36742 on GABAb receptors using in vivo microdialysis in the ventrobasal thalamus of freely moving rat. When a solution of 1 mM CGP 36742 in ACSF was dialyzed into the ventrobasal thalamus, 2-3-fold increases of extracellular Glu, Asp and Gly running parallel with significant decreases of contralateral extracellular Asp and Gly were observed. Unilateral applications of Glu receptor antagonists (0.5 mM MK801, 0.1 mM CNQX) evoked 2-3-fold decreases of CGP 36742-specific elevations of extracellular Asp, Glu and Gly. Administration of CNQX and MK801 in the absence of CGP 36742 did not alter the extracellular Glu and Gly concentrations whereas extracellular Asp concentrations diminished by 42-45% at both sides. By contrast, no changes of extracellular Gly accompanied the 5-10-fold enhancements of extracellular Asp and Glu, observed during application of the Glu uptake inhibitor, tPDC (1mM). Suspensions of resealed plasmalemma fragments from the rat thalamus were mixed rapidly with the membrane impermeant form of the fluorescence indicator, bis-fura-2 and the changes in fluorescence intensity in response to CGP 36742 (0.5 mM), and the GABAb agonist, baclofen (0.1 mM), were monitored on the time scale of 0.04 ms(-10)s. Progress of CGP 36742-mediated influx, and baclofen-mediated efflux of Ca++ ion, antagonized by CGP 36742, was observed in the 1 ms(-10s) period of time.

It forms a white crystalline solid when pure, or a yellow oil when even slightly impure. It can be produced by the hydrolysis of storax. Cinnamyl alcohol occurs naturally only in small quantities, so its industrial demand is usually fulfilled by chemical synthesis starting from cinnamaldehyde. == Properties == The compound is a solid at room temperature, forming colorless crystals that melt upon gentle heating. As is typical of most higher-molecular weight alcohols, it is sparingly soluble in water at room temperature, but highly soluble in most common organic solvents. == Uses == Cinnamyl alcohol has a distinctive odor described as ""sweet, balsam, hyacinth, spicy, green, powdery, cinnamic"" and is used in perfumery and as a deodorant. Cinnamyl alcohol is the starting material used in the synthesis of reboxetine. == Safety == Cinnamyl alcohol has been found to have a sensitizing effect on some people and as a result is the subject of a Restricted Standard issued by IFRA (International Fragrance Association). == Glycosides == Rosarin and rosavin are cinnamyl alcohol glycosides isolated from Rhodiola rosea. == References ==",Cinnamic alcohol,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.08238501101732254), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.06197217106819153), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.01816820353269577), (' INDUSTR', -0.0001093841710826382), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('P', -0.5043513774871826), ('ERSON', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -0.0001599660754436627), (',', -0.0031960143242031336), ('ĠINDU', -0.25920772552490234), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133481740951538)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.01416398212313652), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00033546582562848926), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD,PERSONAL CARE,INDUSTRIAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamyl_alcohol,https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/cinnamic-alcohol.php,https://www.landmarkind.com/products_details/6.html ', [])"

Effects are seen within an hour. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, dry mouth, constipation, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include angioedema, urinary retention, and QT prolongation. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding are of unclear safety. It works by blocking muscarinic receptors in the bladder thus decreasing bladder contractions. Tolterodine was approved for medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 271st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Detrusor overactivity (DO, contraction of the muscular bladder wall) is the most common form of urinary incontinence (UI) in older adults. It is characterized by uninhibited bladder contractions causing an uncontrollable urge to void. Urinary frequency, urge incontinence and nocturnal incontinence occur. Abnormal bladder contractions that coincide with the urge to void can be measured by urodynamic studies. Treatment is bladder retraining, pelvic floor therapy or with drugs that inhibit bladder contractions such as oxybutynin and tolterodine. == Side effects == Known side effects: Dry mouth Decreased gastric motility (upset stomach) Headache Constipation Dry eyes Sleepiness Urinary retention The following reactions have been reported in people who have taken tolterodine since it has become available: Allergic reactions including swelling Rapid heartbeat or abnormal heartbeat Accumulation of fluid in the arms and legs Hallucinations Tolterodine is not recommended for use in people with myasthenia gravis and angle closure glaucoma. == Pharmacology == Tolterodine acts on M2 and M3 subtypes of muscarinic receptors whereas older antimuscarinic treatments for overactive bladder act more specifically on M3 receptors. Tolterodine, although it acts on all types of receptors, has fewer side effects than oxybutynin (M3 and M1 selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) as tolterodine targets the bladder more than other areas of the body. == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is marketed by Pfizer in Canada and the United States under the brand name Detrol.

As emergency contraception it should be used within 120 hours of vaginally penetrating intercourse. For fibroids it may be taken for up to six months. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, nausea, feeling tired, and abdominal pain. It should not be used in women who are already pregnant. It is in the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) class of medications. It works by preventing the effects of progesterone, therefore preventing ovulation but not affecting fertilization or implantation. Ulipristal acetate was approved for medical use in the United States in 2010. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Emergency contraception === For emergency contraception a 30 mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 62–85% of expected pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel. Ulipristal acetate is available by prescription for emergency contraception in over 50 countries, with access through pharmacists without a prescription being tested in the United Kingdom. In November 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended availability of ellaOne emergency contraceptive without prescription in the European Union. In January 2015 the European Commission issued an implementing decision amending accordingly the marketing authorization of EllaOne in the EU. Since July 2016, it is available without prescription in Israel. === Uterine fibroids === Ulipristal acetate is used for pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age. The use of ulipristal acetate to treat fibroids was suspended in the European Union in March 2020. In November 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that ulipristal acetate be used only to treat uterine fibroids in premenopausal women for whom surgical procedures (including uterine fibroid embolization) are not appropriate or have not worked. In addition, the committee stated that ulipristal acetate must not be used for controlling symptoms of uterine fibroids while awaiting surgical treatment. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids. Two intermittent 3-months treatment courses of ulipristal acetate 10 mg resulted in amenorrhea at the end of the first treatment course in 79.5%, at the end of the second course in 88.5% of subjects. Mean myoma volume reduction observed during the first treatment course (−41.9%) was maintained during the second one (−43.7%). After two to four 3-months courses of treatment, UPA-treated fibroids shown about -70% in volume reduction. Volume reduction of uterine fibroid induced by ulipristal acetate was tentatively explained by the combination of multifactorial events involving control of proliferation of the tumor cells, induction of apoptosis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix under the action of matrix metalloproteinases. In May 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended measures to minimize the risk of rare but serious liver injury with ulipristal, including contraindication in women with known liver problems; liver tests before, during and after stopping treatment; a card for women to inform them about the need for liver monitoring and to contact their doctor should they develop symptoms of liver injury. In addition, use of the medicine for more than one treatment course has been restricted to women who are not eligible for surgery. === Abortion === A 2025 preliminary clinical study on 133 pregnant women indicated the possibility that ulipristal acetate, at a substantially higher dose than used for contraception and combined with misoprostol, could be used as a more widely available and similarly effective substitute for the abortifacient mifepristone. == Contraindications == Ulipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.: 33, 43 It is also not recommended for women with severe asthma receiving glucocorticoid treatment because it has shown antiglucocorticoid effects in animal studies.: 10, 44 === Pregnancy === Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies.: 16 Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded. The EMA proposed to avoid any allusion to a possible use as an abortifacient in the package insert to avert off-label use.: 41 Prior to the 2025 study mentioned above, it was considered unlikely that ulipristal acetate could effectively be used as an abortifacient, since it is used in much lower doses (30 mg) than the roughly equipotent mifepristone (600 mg), and since mifepristone has to be combined with a prostaglandin for the induction of abortion. However, data on embryotoxicity in humans are very limited, and it is not clear what the risk for an abortion or for teratogenicity (birth defects) is. Of the 29 women studied who became pregnant despite taking ulipristal acetate, 16 had induced abortions, six had spontaneous abortions, six continued the pregnancies, and one was lost to follow-up.: 37 === Lactation === It is not recommended to breast feed within seven days of taking the drug since ulipristal acetate is excreted into the breast milk, and possible effects on the infant have not been studied.: 43 == Side effects == The most common side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal pain (stomach ache), and dysmenorrhea (period pains). == Interactions == Ulipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir, therefore concomitant use with these agents is not recommended.: 12, 14 It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. Ulipristal acetate exhibits similar potency to antagonize progesterone receptor as mifepristone in vitro. It also binds to the androgen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid relative to flutamide and mifepristone, respectively. Ulipristal acetate has no relevant affinity to the estrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.: 22–23 === Pharmacokinetics === In animal studies, the drug was quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the gut. Intake of food delays absorption, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant.: 12, 20 Ulipristal acetate is metabolized in the liver, most likely by CYP3A4, and to a small extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. The two main metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically active, but less than the original drug. The main excretion route is via the feces.: 13–14, 21 == History == Ulipristal acetate was granted marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2009. In 2014, the EMA recommended ulipristal be made available without a prescription in the European Union. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for use in the United States on 13 August 2010, following the FDA advisory committee's recommendation. Watson Pharmaceuticals announced the availability of ulipristal acetate in the United States on 1 December 2010, in retail pharmacies, clinics, and one on-line pharmacy, KwikMed. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Ulipristal acetate is marketed as an emergency contraceptive (30 mg) in over 75 countries, under different brands such as ella, ellaOne, Dvella, FemelleOne, Femke, Lencya, Prevent One, ulip, Ulipristal Stada, Ulipristal Mylan, Ulipristal acetate Sandoz and others.

2670,"('Cytosine', 'Cytosinimine', 'Cyt', 'Cytosin', 'Zytosin')","Endogenous, Medical","Cytosine () (symbol C or Cyt) is one of the four nucleotide bases found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto group at position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine. In Watson–Crick base pairing, it forms three hydrogen bonds with guanine. == History == Cytosine was discovered and named by Albrecht Kossel and Albert Neumann in 1894 when it was hydrolyzed from calf thymus tissues. A structure was proposed in 1903, and was synthesized (and thus confirmed) in the laboratory in the same year. In 1998, cytosine was used in an early demonstration of quantum information processing when Oxford University researchers implemented the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm on a two qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC). In March 2015, NASA scientists reported the formation of cytosine, along with uracil and thymine, from pyrimidine under the space-like laboratory conditions, which is of interest because pyrimidine has been found in meteorites although its origin is unknown. == Chemical reactions == Cytosine can be found as part of DNA, as part of RNA, or as a part of a nucleotide. As cytidine triphosphate (CTP), it can act as a co-factor to enzymes, and can transfer a phosphate to convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In DNA and RNA, cytosine is paired with guanine. However, it is inherently unstable, and can change into uracil (spontaneous deamination). This can lead to a point mutation if not repaired by the DNA repair enzymes such as uracil glycosylase, which cleaves a uracil in DNA. Cytosine can also be methylated into 5-methylcytosine by an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase or be methylated and hydroxylated to make 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The difference in rates of deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine (to uracil and thymine) forms the basis of bisulfite sequencing. == Biological function == When found third in a codon of RNA, cytosine is synonymous with uracil, as they are interchangeable as the third base. When found as the second base in a codon, the third is always interchangeable. For example, UCU, UCC, UCA and UCG are all serine, regardless of the third base. Active enzymatic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine by the APOBEC family of cytosine deaminases could have both beneficial and detrimental implications on various cellular processes as well as on organismal evolution. The implications of deamination on 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, on the other hand, remains less understood. == Theoretical aspects == Until October 2021, Cytosine had not been found in meteorites, which suggested the first strands of RNA and DNA had to look elsewhere to obtain this building block. Cytosine likely formed within some meteorite parent bodies, however did not persist within these bodies due to an effective deamination reaction into uracil. In October 2021, Cytosine was announced as having been found in meteorites by researchers in a joint Japan/NASA project, that used novel methods of detection which avoided damaging nucleotides as they were extracted from meteorites. == References == == External links and citations == Cytosine MS Spectrum EINECS number 200-749-5 Shapiro R (1999).

2671,"('Mebendazole', 'Vermox', 'Telmin', 'Mebenvet', 'Pantelmin')",Medical,"Mebendazole (MBZ), sold under the brand name Vermox among others, is a medication used to treat a number of parasitic worm infestations. This includes ascariasis, pinworm infection, hookworm infections, guinea worm infections and hydatid disease, among others. It has been used for treatment of giardiasis but is not a preferred agent. It is taken by mouth. Mebendazole is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include headache, vomiting, and ringing in the ears. If used at large doses it may cause bone marrow suppression. It is unclear if it is safe in pregnancy. Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent of the benzimidazole type. Mebendazole came into use in 1971, after it was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Mebendazole is available as a generic medication. == Medical use == Mebendazole is a highly effective, broad-spectrum antihelmintic indicated for the treatment of nematode infestations, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm (pinworm), and the intestinal form of trichinosis prior to its spread into the tissues beyond the digestive tract. Other drugs are used to treat worm infections outside the digestive tract, as mebendazole is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream. Mebendazole is used alone in those with mild to moderate infestations. It kills parasites relatively slowly, and in those with very heavy infestations, it can cause some parasites to migrate out of the digestive system, leading to appendicitis, bile duct problems, or intestinal perforation. To avoid this, heavily infested patients may be treated with piperazine, either before or instead of mebendazole. Piperazine paralyses the parasites, causing them to pass in the feces. It is also used rarely in the treatment of cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease. Evidence for effectiveness for this disease, however, is poor. Mebendazole and other benzimidazole antithelmetics are active against both larval and adult stages of nematodes, and in the cases of roundworm and whipworm, kill the eggs, as well. Paralysis and death of the parasites occurs slowly, and elimination in the feces may require several days. === Special populations === Mebendazole has been shown to cause ill effects in pregnancy in animal models, and no adequate studies of its effects in human pregnancy have been conducted. Whether it can be passed by breastfeeding is unknown. == Adverse effects == Mebendazole sometimes causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes. In rare cases, it has been associated with a dangerously low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and hair loss, with a risk of agranulocytosis in rare cases. === Drug interactions === Carbamazepine and phenytoin lower serum levels of mebendazole. Cimetidine does not appreciably raise serum mebendazole (in contrast to the similar drug albendazole), consistent with its poor systemic absorption. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and the more severe toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur when mebendazole is combined with high doses of metronidazole. == Mechanism == Mebendazole works by selectively inhibiting the synthesis of microtubules via binding to the colchicine binding site of β-tubulin, thereby blocking polymerisation of tubulin dimers in intestinal cells of parasites. Disruption of cytoplasmic microtubules leads to blocking the uptake of glucose and other nutrients, resulting in the gradual immobilization and eventual death of the helminths. Poor absorption in the digestive tract makes mebendazole an efficient drug for treating intestinal parasitic infections with limited adverse effects. However mebendazole has an impact on mammalian cells, mostly by inhibiting polymeration of tubulin dimers, thereby disrupting essential microtubule structures such as mitotic spindle. Disassembly of the mitotic spindle then leads to apoptosis mediated via dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 which allows pro-apoptotic protein Bax to dimerize and initiate programmed cell death. == Society and culture == === Availability === Mebendazole is available as a generic medication. Mebendazole is distributed in international markets by Johnson and Johnson and a number of generic manufacturers. === Economics === In the United States, mebendazole is sometimes sold at about 200 times the price of the same medication in other countries. == References ==",Pantelmin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005589353386312723), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032219188287854195)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.12692810595035553)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2672,"('Sultamicillin (tosylate)', 'Sultamicillin', 'Sultamicilina', 'Sultamicillinum', 'Vd 1827')",Medical,"Sultamicillin, sold under the brand name Unasyn among others, is an oral form of the penicillin antibiotic combination ampicillin/sulbactam. It is used for the treatment of bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, the kidneys and urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, among other organs. It contains esterified ampicillin and sulbactam. Sultamicillin is better absorbed from the gut than ampicillin/sulbactam, decreasing the chances of diarrhea and dysentery. The inclusion of sulbactam extends ampicillin's spectrum of action to beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteria. Oral sulbactam with the intravenous form provides a regimen of continuous sulbactam therapy throughout the treatment, resulting in better clinical results. It was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in 1987. == Medical uses == Medical uses for sultamicillin include: Skin and soft tissue infections - furuncles, carbuncles, cellulitis, paronychia, impetigo contagiosa, diabetic foot ulcers and abscesses caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Upper respiratory tract infections - pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Acute and chronic sinusitis caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. progenies. Otitis media, particularly suppurative otitis media, with or without mastoiditis antrum. Lower respiratory tract infections - bacterial pneumonias, bronchitis, bronchiectasis caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and S. progenies. Acute exacerbations of COPD. Urinary tract infections - pyelonephritis, cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus. Surgical infections - prophylaxis and treatment of surgical site infections, peri-operative prophylaxis in orthopaedic and cardiovascular surgery. Gynecological infections - Caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of E. coli and Bacteroides sp. (including B. fragilis). Infections of the gastrointestinal tract - Bacterial esophagitis, treatment of H. pylori infections as a part of MDT in ulcer management. == Contraindications == Sultamicillin is contraindicated in people with penicillin allergy and those with mononucleosis, as these have an increased risk of developing severe rashes. == Adverse effects == The most common side effect, as with many other antibiotics, is diarrhoea and soft stool. In Japanese clinical trials, these occurred with a frequency of 3.7% and 1.1%, respectively; however, in studies outside Japan, diarrhoea was much more common at 10% to over 50% in patients taking sultamicillin. Other adverse effects occurring in the range of 1 to 10% of people include nausea, vomiting, stomach ache, headache, rashes, and infections with Candida albicans. Haemorrhagic colitis caused by Clostridioides difficile infections is a rare complication. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs are similar to other penicillins: allopurinol increases the risk for patients to develop rashes. Penicillins slow down the elimination of methotrexate, potentially increasing its adverse effects. Conversely, the elimination of sultamicillin's active constituents (ampicillin and sulbactam) is reduced by probenecid and probably by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin, indometacin and phenylbutazone. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Sultamicillin is a codrug or (mutual prodrug) of ampicillin and sulbactam. After oral intake, it is absorbed and hydrolytically cleaved to ampicillin and sulbactam by enzymes in the gut wall. These two substances are then released into the system in a 1:1 molar ratio. Their pharmacokinetic behaviour is similar (and practically independent of food intake): they reach peak concentrations after about one hour; their plasma protein binding is 26% (ampicillin) and 29% (sulbactam); and their elimination half-lives are 45–80 minutes and 40–70 minutes, respectively. Both drugs are mainly eliminated via the kidneys: within eight hours after intake, 46 to 80% of the ampicillin and 41 to 66% of the sulbactam are found in the urine. === Mechanism of action === Ampicillin, a semi-synthetic orally active broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic, exerts antibacterial activity against sensitive organisms by inhibiting biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide. Sulbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, irreversibly inhibits many beta-lactamases that occur in resistant bacteria strains. == Chemistry == Ampicillin and sulbactam are linked via a methylene group, forming two ester bonds (or more accurately acylal bonds). Sultamicillin is used in form of the tosylate salt. == References ==",Sultamicillin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5629668016335927e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010311071673640981)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2661196/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='Sultamicillin.

Antineoplaston A10 (3-pehnylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedion) is the first chemically identified antineoplastons and when it is administered orally it is hydrolysed in pancreatic juice to phenylactylglutamine and phenylacetylisoglutamine in the ration of 4 to 1. These metabolites are water soluble and have antitumor effect, they are further degraded to pehnylacetic acid. The mixture of phenylacetylglutamine and phenylacetylisoglutamine in the ratio of 4 to 1 was formulated as Antineoplaston A10 injectable formulation. The mixture of phenylacetylglutamine and phenylacetic acid in the ratio of 1 to 4 was also shown to have antitumor effect in tissue culture study, then formulated as Antineoplaston AS2-1. The reported cytostatic inhibitory effect of A10 on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and differentiation inducing effect of AS2-1 on various tumor cells suggest potential benefit for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma since this tumor recurs frequently despite initial successful treatment. We report here the effects of Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 on cell proliferation, cell morphology, cell cycle, and DNA in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Both agents inhibited cell proliferation and increased the number of cells in G0 and G1 phases and Antineoplaston AS2-1 induced apoptosis, we also describe our clinical experience of a hepatocellula carcinoma (HCC) patient whose tumor, after incomplete trancathere arterial embolization (TAE) for a 7cm 7cm HCC, has been stable for more than 15 months during which time he has been taking Antineoplaston AS2-1 continuously without any serious adverse effects. Antineoplaston A10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedion) is a naturally occurring substance and was the first antineoplaston in the human body to be chemically identified. The effect of antineoplaston A10 on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HepG2 and HLE has been examined. Antineoplaston A10 displayed anti-proliferative action inhibiting cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro as measured by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and clonogenic assays. Incubation with antineoplaston A10 for 48 h induced apoptotic events such as a typical apoptotic morphology, formation of a characteristic ladder pattern of DNA migration and accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells. Next, hepatoma xenografts in nude mice were employed to study the antitumor effects of antineoplaston A10 in vivo. Oral administration of antineoplaston A10 delayed the growth of HepG2 and HLE cells in the mice without a reduction in body weight. A higher proportion of apoptotic cells in xenografts was observed by means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. In addition, the level of expression of apoptotic marker p53 increased while that of anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 decreased, as evaluated with immunohistochemical staining in the xenografts. These results suggested that antineoplaston A10 may inhibit the growth of human hepatoma cells through the induction of apoptosis. A phase II study of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 was conducted to evaluate the antineoplastic activity in patients with recurrent diffuse intrinsic brain stem glioma. This report describes the results of treatment of the first 12 patients admitted to the study. Patients received escalating doses of antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 by intravenous bolus injections. The median duration of treatment was 6 months and the average dosage of antineoplaston A10 was 11.3 g/kg/day and of antineoplaston AS2-1 0.4 g/kg/day. Responses were assessed by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Of ten evaluable patients, complete response was determined in two cases (20%), partial response in three (30%), stable disease in three (30%) and progressive disease in two (20%). Survival at 2 years was 33.3%. Currently, of all 12 patients, two (17%) were alive and tumour free for over 5 years since initial diagnosis; one was alive for more than 5 years, and another for more than 4 years from the start of treatment. Only mild and moderate toxicities were observed, which included three cases of skin allergy, two cases of anaemia, fever and hypernatraemia, and single cases of agranulocytosis, hypoglycaemia, numbness, tiredness, myalgia and vomiting.

2675,"('Carbazochrome (sodium sulfonate)', 'Carbazochrome sulfonate', '(5e)-5-(2-carbamoylhydrazinylidene)-1-methyl-6-oxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1h-indole-2-sulfonic acid')",Medical," Carbazochrome sodium sulfonate (CSS) is conventionally administered to prevent post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) bleeding in many institutions, but research on its preventive efficacy is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the risk of post-ESD bleeding and the preventive efficacy of CSS administration. We retrospectively reviewed 304 lesions in 259 patients with gastric neoplasms who underwent ESD at Asahikawa Medical University Hospital from 2014 to 2021. In the CSS group, CSS 100 mg/day was intravenously infused with maintenance fluid replacement on postoperative days 0-2. The risk factors of post-ESD bleeding, including CSS administration, were investigated. The overall rate of post-ESD bleeding was 4.6% (14/304). The univariate analysis showed that atrial fibrillation (Af), warfarin intake, heparin replacement, and tumor location in the lower third were significant risk factors for increasing the likelihood of postoperative bleeding. In the multivariate analysis, Af (odds ratio [OR] 3.83, 95% CI 1.02-14.30; p &lt; 0.05), heparin replacement (OR 4.60, 95% CI 1.02-20.70; p &lt; 0.05), and tumor location in the lower third of the stomach (OR 6.67, 95% CI 1.43-31.00; p &lt; 0.05) were independent factors for post-ESD bleeding. Post-ESD bleeding was observed in 5.2% (9/174) of the CSS group and 3.8% (5/130) of the non-CSS group, with no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.783). Additionally, CSS was not shown to have preventive effects in groups with higher-risk factors, such as Af diagnosis, warfarin use, heparin replacement, and tumor location in the lower third of the stomach. CSS administration was not effective for the prevention of the post-ESD bleeding in the overall patient population as well as in higher-risk patients. This suggests that the administration of CSS for post-ESD bleeding prevention may need to be reconsidered. The hemostatic effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) combined with carbazochrome sodium sulfonate (CSS) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) has not been determined. Therefore we performed a randomized study aiming to evaluate the effects of CSS combined with TXA on perioperative blood loss and inflammatory response of THA. CSS combined with TXA can effectively reduce perioperative blood loss and immune response compared to TXA. This randomized placebo-controlled trial assigned 150 patients undergoing unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty who underwent direct anterior approach surgery to 3 groups: group A received TXA plus topical CSS; group B received TXA only; and group C received placebo. The main outcome was total blood loss. Secondary outcomes included reduction in hemoglobin concentration, coagulation parameters, inflammatory marker levels, perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, transfusion rates, postoperative hospital stay, and incidence of thromboembolic events. Total blood loss in group A (668.84±230.95ml) was lower than in group B (940.96±359.22ml) and C (1166.52±342.85ml, p<0.05). We also found that compared with group B, postoperative hip pain, biomarker level of inflammation, visual analogue score (VAS) pain score in group A were significantly improved. The transfusion rate and unit of group A were significantly lower than group C (8 patients; 17.5 units), but there was no statistical difference between group A (no transfusion) and group B (2 patients; 4 units). No differences were observed in thromboembolic and other outcomes among the groups. The combined application of topic CSS and TXA is more effective than TXA alone following THA in regard of reducing total blood loss. In addition, CSS combined with TXA is better than TXA alone in terms of improving postoperative hip pain and reducing the level of inflammatory factors. I; randomized controlled study. It is important to evaluate the effects of drugs considered to control hemorrhage. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients. Carbazochrome sodium sulfonate (CSS) is often used in combination with TXA; however, it is unknown whether CSS additionally improves the control of bleeding in trauma patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether CSS reduces blood transfusion and death in addition to TXA by improving the control of bleeding. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of trauma patients from 2011 to 2019. We included patients aged ≥16 years, with significant hemorrhage, and who received TXA within eight hours from injury as per CRASH-2 (Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage) study. The primary outcome was the total amount of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet concentrate (PC) received within the first 24 hours from injury. Secondary outcomes were death in hospital within four weeks after injury, vascular occlusive events, and treatment. During this retrospective evaluation period, 5764 admissions with trauma were registered. A total of 326 cases met the selection criteria: 259 cases who received CSS in addition to TXA (CSS group; n=259) and 67 cases who received only TXA (no-CSS group; n=67). The mortality rate was 6% in the no-CSS group and 15.1% in the CSS group. There was no significant difference in mortality and vascular occlusive events between the two groups. We performed multiple regression analyses, with the amount of blood transfusion for each type as explanatory variables. The administration of CSS was an independent factor for the reduction of RBC transfusion (standard partial regression coefficient -0.1, 95% CI [-3.1 to -0.1], p=0.04), but not for transfusion of FFP or PC. We also performed multiple logistic regression analysis, with death as an explanatory variable. CSS was not an independent factor for any cause of death. CSS decreased RBC transfusion in trauma patients, without increasing the risk of vascular occlusion. However, CSS did not decrease mortality. This study can contribute to managing bleeding with trauma, but further research aimed at clarifying the effect of CSS is needed.",Carbazochrome (sodium sulfonate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012242044613230973), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006727190222591162)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbazochrome?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Carbazochrome', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbazochrome?utm_source=openai')])"
