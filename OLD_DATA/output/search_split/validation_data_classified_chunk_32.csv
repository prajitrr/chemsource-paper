It has fallen into almost complete disuse due to toxicity and the introduction of improved anti-tuberculosis drugs like isoniazid. The drug has only weak activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is only useful in preventing resistance to more powerful drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin. It is never used on its own to treat tuberculosis; it is used in a similar way to ethambutol. There is no advantage to using thioacetazone if the regimen used already contains ethambutol, but many countries in sub-Saharan Africa still use thioacetazone because it is extremely cheap. Use of thioacetazone is declining because it can cause severe (sometimes fatal) skin reactions in HIV positive patients. The biological target of thioacetazone has proven elusive and its mechanism of action remains unknown, although it is thought to interfere with mycolic acid synthesis. == Adverse effects == One of the documented adverse effects of thioacetazone is the excessive accumulation of serum (or blood plasma) in the brain.

3176,"('Ergothioneine', 'Sympectothion', 'Ergothionine', 'Thioneine', 'Thiolhistidine-betaine')","Food, Medical","Ergothioneine is a naturally occurring amino acid and is a thiourea derivative of histidine, containing a sulfur atom on the imidazole ring. This compound occurs in relatively few organisms, notably actinomycetota, cyanobacteria, and certain fungi. Ergothioneine was discovered by Charles Tanret in 1909 and named after the ergot fungus from which it was first purified, with its structure being determined in 1911. In humans, ergothioneine is acquired exclusively through the diet and accumulates in erythrocytes, bone marrow, liver, kidney, seminal fluid, and eyes. Although the effect of ergothioneine in vivo is under preliminary research, its physiological role in humans is unknown. Ergothioneine is sold as a dietary supplement. == Metabolism and sources == Ergothioneine has been found in bacteria, plants, and animals, sometimes at millimolar levels. Foods found to contain ergothioneine include liver, kidney, black beans, kidney bean, and oat bran, with the highest levels in bolete and oyster mushrooms. Levels can be variable, even within species and some tissues can contain much more than others. In the human body, the largest amounts of ergothioneine are found in erythrocytes, eye lens, semen, and skin. Although many species contain ergothioneine, only a few make it; the others absorb it from their diet or, in the case of plants, from their environment. Biosynthesis has been detected in Actinomycetota, such as Mycobacterium smegmatis and certain fungi, such as Neurospora crassa. The metabolic pathway to produce ergothioneine starts with the methylation of histidine to produce histidine betaine (hercynine). The sulfur atom is then incorporated from cysteine. The biosynthetic genes of ergothioneine have been described in Mycobacterium smegmatis, Neurospora crassa, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Other species of bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus, as well as fungi in the Saccharomycotina cannot make ergothioneine. == Structure == Ergothioneine is a thiourea derivative of the betaine of histidine and contains a sulfur atom bonded to the 2-position of the imidazole ring. Typical of thioureas, ergothioneine is less reactive than typical thiols such as glutathione towards alkylating agents like maleimides. It also resists oxidation by air. However, ergothioneine can be slowly oxidized over several days to the disulfide form in acidic solutions. == Ergothioneine derivatives == Various derivatives of ergothioneine have been reported in the literature, such as S-methyl-ergothioneine or selenium-containing selenoneine. == Characteristics == Adaptogenic Antioxidant: Ergothioneine is an adaptogenic antioxidant that preferentially accumulates in cells and tissues exposed to oxidative stress and damage. The organic cation transporter OCTN1 (now known as SLC22A4, a transporter protein with 551 amino acids and three glycosylation sites) in the human body can transport ergothioneine to where it is needed. Regenerative Pathway: The human body has a regenerative pathway for ergothioneine. When ergothioneine combines with glutathione, it can regenerate, allowing it to react with singlet oxygen in a cyclical manner, achieving a more comprehensive and lasting antioxidant effect. Slow Excretion: Ergothioneine is excreted very slowly in the body, allowing it to be highly retained in the tissues and red blood cells of humans and other animals, thereby maximizing its effectiveness. Stable Form: Ergothioneine mainly exists in the form of thione, which has ideal thermal stability and pH stability. == Preliminary research == Although potential effects of ergothioneine are under preliminary research, its physiological role in vivo has not been determined. == Safe intake levels == The Panel on Dietetic Products for the European Food Safety Authority reported safe daily limits of 2.82 mg/kg of body weight for infants, 3.39 mg/kg for small children, and 1.31 mg/kg for adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women. == See also == Oxidative stress Reactive oxygen species Ovothiol == References == == External links == Ergothioneine Human Metabolome Database Ergothioneine KEGG Compound",Thiolhistidine-betaine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.1534346640110016), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.31331104040145874), (' PERSONAL', -0.06217897683382034), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.3198539614677429), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.014198473654687405), ('ĠEND', -0.2234112173318863), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10030245035886765)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3177,"('Eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester', 'Ethyl eicosapentaenoate', 'Ethyl icosapentate', 'Epadel', 'Vascepa')",Medical,"Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA, icosapent ethyl), sold under the brand name Vascepa among others, is a medication used to treat dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. It is used in combination with changes in diet in adults with hypertriglyceridemia ≥ 150 mg/dL. Further, it is often required to be used with a statin (maximally-tolerated dose). The most common side effects are musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema (swelling of legs and hands), atrial fibrillation, and arthralgia (joint pain). Other common side effects include bleeding, constipation, gout, and rash. It is made from the omega−3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the approval of icosapent ethyl in 2012 to Amarin Corporation, and it became the second fish oil-based medication after omega-3-acid ethyl esters (brand named Lovaza, itself approved in 2004). On 13 December 2019, the FDA also approved Vascepa as the first drug specifically ""to reduce cardiovascular risk among people with elevated triglyceride levels"". It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 229th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == In the European Union, icosapent ethyl is indicated to reduce cardiovascular risk as an adjunct to statin therapy. In the United States, icosapent ethyl is indicated as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with elevated triglyceride levels (≥ 150 mg/dL) and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It is also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adults with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega−3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (> 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500 mg/dL). It appears that both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower triglycerides; however, DHA alone appears to raise low-density lipoprotein (the variant which drives atherosclerosis; sometimes very inaccurately called ""bad cholesterol"") and LDL-C values (most typically only a calculated estimate and not measured by labs from person's blood sample for technical and cost reasons; however, this is accurately calculated with a less common NMR lipid panel lab), whilst eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone does not and instead lowers the parameters aforementioned. === Other fish-oil based drugs === There are other omega−3 fish-oil based drugs on the market that have similar uses and mechanisms of action: Omega-3-acid ethyl esters (brand names Omacor [renamed Lovaza in the U.S. to avoid confusion with Amicar and Omtryg]), and as of March 2016, four generic versions Omega-3-carboxylic acids (Epanova); the Epanova brand name was discontinued in the United States. === Effectiveness === Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid is a prescription medication in the US, but it closely resembles other marine based omega−3 dietary supplements. Evidence suggests that these supplements are able to reduce cardiovascular disease, and premature death. These effects may not carry over in other populations such as people who have diabetes. Compared to dietary supplements, the ingredients in prescription drugs are more carefully controlled and are typically fixed and tested in clinical trials. The prescription forms are also typically more concentrated, requiring fewer capsules to be taken and increasing the likelihood of compliance. == Side effects == Special caution should be taken with people who have fish and shellfish allergies. In addition, as with other omega−3 fatty acids, taking ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) puts people who are on anticoagulants at risk for prolonged bleeding time. The most commonly reported side effect in clinical trials has been joint pain; some people also reported pain in their mouth or throat. E-EPA has not been tested in pregnant women; it is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are not known. == Pharmacology == After ingestion, ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) is metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters circulation. Peak plasma concentration occurs about five hours after ingestion, and the half-life is about 89 hours. EPA is lipolyzed mostly in the liver. == Mechanism of action == Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the active metabolite of ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA), like other omega−3 fatty acid based drugs, appears to reduce production of triglycerides in the liver and to enhance clearance of triglycerides from circulating very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. The way it does that is not clear, but potential mechanisms include increased breakdown of fatty acids; inhibition of diglyceride acyltransferase, which is involved in biosynthesis of triglycerides in the liver; and increased activity of lipoprotein lipase in blood. == Chemistry == Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) is an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid, which is an omega−3 fatty acid. == History == In July 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) for severe hypertriglyceridemia as an adjunct to dietary measures; Amarin Corporation had developed the drug. Amarin Corporation challenged the FDA's authority to limit its ability to market the drug for off-label use and won its case on appeal in 2012, changing the way the FDA regulates the marketing of medication. Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) was the second fish-oil drug to be approved, after omega-3-acid ethyl esters (GlaxoSmithKline's Lovaza, which was approved in 2004.) Initial sales were not as robust as Amarin had hoped. The labels for the two drugs were similar, but doctors prescribed Lovaza for people who had triglycerides lower than 500 mg/dL based on some clinical evidence. Amarin wanted to actively market E-EPA for that population as well which would have greatly expanded its revenue and applied to the FDA for permission to do so in 2013, which the FDA denied. In response, in May 2015 Amarin sued the FDA for infringing its First Amendment rights, and in August 2015, a judge ruled that the FDA could not ""prohibit the truthful promotion of a drug for unapproved uses because doing so would violate the protection of free speech."" The ruling left open the question of what the FDA would allow Amarin to say about E-EPA, and in March 2016 the FDA and Amarin agreed that Amarin would submit specific marketing material to the FDA for the FDA to review (as is usual for prescription medications). If the parties disagreed on whether the material was truthful, they would seek a judge to mediate. In December 2019, the FDA approved the use of icosapent ethyl as an adjunctive (secondary) therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among adults with elevated triglyceride levels (a type of fat in the blood) of 150 milligrams per deciliter or higher. People must also have either established cardiovascular disease alone or diabetes along with two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Icosapent ethyl is the first FDA approved drug to reduce cardiovascular risk among people with elevated triglyceride levels as an add-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy. The efficacy and safety of icosapent ethyl were established in a study with 8,179 participants who were either 45 years and older with a documented history of coronary artery, cerebrovascular, carotid artery and peripheral artery disease or 50 years and older with diabetes and additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Participants who received icosapent ethyl were significantly less likely to experience a cardiovascular event, such as a stroke or heart attack. In clinical trials, icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (irregular heart rhythms) requiring hospitalization. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater among participants with a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Icosapent ethyl was also associated with an increased risk of bleeding events. The incidence of bleeding was higher among participants who were also taking other medications that increase the risk of bleeding, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin at the same time. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 28 January 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vazkepa, intended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people at high cardiovascular risk. The applicant for this medicinal product is Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2021. == References ==",Vascepa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.510157047363464e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002479576040059328)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_eicosapentaenoic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=106, start_index=9, title='Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_eicosapentaenoic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"
3178,"('Daunorubicin (hydrochloride)', 'Daunomycin (hydrochloride)', 'Rp 13057 (hydrochloride)', 'Rubidomycin (hydrochloride)', 'Daunorubicin')",Medical,"Daunorubicin, also known as daunomycin, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. Specifically it is used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Kaposi's sarcoma. It is administered by injection into a vein. A liposomal formulation known as liposomal daunorubicin also exists. Common side effects include hair loss, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and inflammation of the inside of the mouth. Other severe side effects include heart disease and tissue death at the site of injection. Use in pregnancy may harm the fetus. Daunorubicin is in the anthracycline family of medication. It works in part by blocking the function of topoisomerase II. Daunorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1979. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally isolated from bacteria of the Streptomyces type. == Medical uses == It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in the body. Treatment is usually performed together with other chemotherapy drugs (such as cytarabine), and its administration depends on the type of tumor and the degree of response. In addition to its major use in treating acute myeloid leukemia, daunorubicin is also used to treat neuroblastoma. Daunorubicin has been used with other chemotherapy agents to treat the blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Daunorubicin is also used as the starting material for semi-synthetic manufacturing of doxorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin. == Mechanism of action == Similar to doxorubicin, daunorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which relaxes supercoils in DNA; without action of topoisomerase II, these DNA supercoils interfere in transcription of DNA. Daunorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. On binding to DNA, daunomycin intercalates, with its daunosamine residue directed toward the minor groove. It has the highest preference for two adjacent G/C base pairs flanked on the 5' side by an A/T base pair. Crystallography shows that daunomycin induces a local unwinding angle of 8°, and other conformational disturbances of adjacent and second-neighbour base pairs. It can also induce histone eviction from chromatin upon intercalation. == History == In the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to isolate anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle in Apulia. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius which produced a red pigment was isolated, and an antibiotic was produced from this bacterium that was found to have good activity against murine tumors. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug saw success in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity. In 2015–16, a team at Ohio State University ""showed that, by carefully manipulating strands of viral DNA, an origami structure with complex folds can be created in just 10 minutes. Incredibly, these structures are only 100 nanometers across – that’s 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Small volumes of daunorubicin can be wrapped up in these minuscule pods, which can then be released into a leukemia cell-filled environment."" == Route of administration == Daunorubicin should only be administered in a rapid intravenous infusion. It should not be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, since it may cause extensive tissue necrosis. It should also never be administered intrathecally (into the spinal canal), as this will cause extensive damage to the nervous system and may lead to death. Daunorubicin has been used intravitreally (inside the eye) for the purposes of preventing proliferative vitreoretinopathy, a common complication following retinal detachment surgery, but has not been found to be effective and is not used for any other ophthalmic purposes at this time. == References ==",Daunorubicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.074220174108632e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005824061809107661)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/daunorubicin,go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00694, ', [])"

It was studied since 2014 in a clinical trial in children with SMA type 1 until the study was discontinued in 2021. In October 2020, Novartis announced that branaplam reduces the amount of huntingtin protein, which is one of the major therapeutic approaches in Huntington's disease. In 2021, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an orphan drug status to branaplam for treatment of Huntington's disease, and Novartis announced that they would start clinical trials in 2021. In August 2022, Novartis temporarily halted the dosing with branaplam in its clinical studies, and in December 2022 the company discontinued the study due to negative safety signals. == Use in biomedical research == Branaplam can be used as a so-called Xon inducer of splicing for control of gene expression. For example, branaplam was used as an Xon inducer to tightly control Cas9 expression with a modified branaplam-sensitive splicing cassette from the SF3B3 gene. == References ==",Branaplam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004078401252627373), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010179955279454589), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04863070696592331)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branaplam,https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novartis-cans-branaplam-after-seeing-huntingtons-safety-signal-delays-orphan-drug-over-slow,https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT02268552 ', [])"

3181,"('Esomeprazole magnesium', '(s)-omeprazole magnesium', 'Omeprazole magnesium', 'Omeprazole', 'Prilosec')",Medical,"Omeprazole, sold under the brand names Prilosec and Losec, among others, is a medication used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It is also used to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people who are at high risk. Omeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and its effectiveness is similar to that of other PPIs. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. It is also available in the fixed-dose combination medication omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate as Zegerid and as Konvomep. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, abdominal pain, and increased intestinal gas. Serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis, an increased risk of pneumonia, an increased risk of bone fractures, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. Whether it is safe for use in pregnancy is unclear. It works by blocking the release of stomach acid. Omeprazole was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the ninth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 52 million prescriptions. It is also available without a prescription in the United States. == Medical uses == Omeprazole can be used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, erosive esophagitis, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis. === Peptic ulcers === Peptic ulcers may be treated with omeprazole. Infection with Helicobacter pylori can be treated by taking omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin together for 7–14 days. Amoxicillin may be replaced with metronidazole in patients who are allergic to penicillin. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects occurring in at least 1% of people include: Central nervous system: headache (7%), dizziness (2%) Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection (2%), cough (1%) Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (4%), nausea (4%), vomiting (3%), flatulence (3%), acid regurgitation (2%), constipation (2%) Neuromuscular and skeletal: back pain (1%), weakness (1%) Dermatologic: rash (2%) Other concerns related to adverse effects are: Recurrence of Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea Osteoporosis-related fractures Hypomagnesemia Concern has been expressed regarding vitamin B12 and iron malabsorption, but effects seem to be insignificant, especially when supplement therapy is provided. Since their introduction, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, especially omeprazole) have also been associated with several cases of acute interstitial nephritis, an inflammation of the kidneys that often occurs as an adverse drug reaction. === Long-term use === Long-term use of PPIs is strongly associated with the development of benign polyps from fundic glands (which is distinct from fundic gland polyposis); these polyps do not cause cancer and resolve when PPIs are discontinued. No association is seen between PPI use and cancer, but use of PPIs may mask gastric cancers or other serious gastric problems and physicians should be aware of this effect. There is a possible association between long term use and dementia which requires further study to confirm. A review article in U.S. Pharmacist in 2013 states that long-term use of PPIs is associated with decreased calcium absorption (causing increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures), decreased magnesium absorption (causing electrolyte disturbances), and increased risk of certain infections such as C. difficile and community-acquired pneumonia. They hypothesize that this is due to decreased stomach acid production. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === The safety of using omeprazole has not been established in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Epidemiological data do not show an increased risk of major birth defects after maternal use of omeprazole during pregnancy. == Interactions == Important drug interactions are rare. However, the most significant major drug interaction concern is the decreased activation of clopidogrel when taken together with omeprazole. Although still controversial, this may increase the risk of stroke or heart attack in people taking clopidogrel to prevent these events. This interaction is possible because omeprazole is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form. Inhibition of CYP2C19 may block the activation of clopidogrel, which could reduce its effects. Almost all benzodiazepines are metabolised by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 pathways, and inhibition of these enzymes results in a higher area under the curve (i.e., the total effect over time of a given dose). Other examples of drugs dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism are escitalopram, warfarin, oxycodone, tramadol, and oxymorphone. The concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with omeprazole. Omeprazole is also a competitive inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, as are other PPIs. Drugs that depend on an acidic stomach environment (such as ketoconazole or atazanavir) may be poorly absorbed, whereas acid-labile antibiotics (such as erythromycin which is a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) may be absorbed to a greater extent than normal due to the more alkaline environment of the stomach. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and Ginkgo biloba significantly reduce plasma concentrations of omeprazole through induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate. == Pharmacology == Omeprazole irreversibly blocks the enzyme system on parietal cells that is needed for the secretion of gastric acid. It is a specific H+/K+ATPase inhibitor. This is the enzyme needed for the final step in the secretion of gastric acid. === Mechanism of action === Omeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor. It suppresses stomach acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase system found at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton, or H+) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole inhibits the final step of acid production. Omeprazole also inhibits both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus as it blocks the last step in acid secretion. The drug binds non-competitively so it has a dose-dependent effect. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole occurs within 1 hour after oral administration. The maximum effect occurs within 2 hours. The duration of inhibition is up to 72 hours. When omeprazole is stopped, baseline stomach acid secretory activity returns after 3 to 5 days. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion will plateau after 4 days of repeated daily dosing. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of omeprazole takes place in the small intestine and is usually completed within 3 to 6 hours. The systemic bioavailability of omeprazole after repeated doses is about 60%. Omeprazole has a volume of distribution of 0.4 L/kg. It has high plasma protein binding of 95%. Omeprazole, as well as other PPIs, are only effective on active H+/K+-ATPase pumps. These pumps are stimulated in the presence of food to aid in digestion. For this reason, patients should be advised to take omeprazole with a glass of water, before a meal. Additionally, most sources recommend that after taking omeprazole, at least 30 minutes should be allowed to elapse before eating (at least 60 minutes for immediate-release omeprazole plus sodium bicarbonate products, such as Zegerid). Omeprazole is completely metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, mainly in the liver, by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Identified metabolites are the sulfone, the sulfide, and hydroxy-omeprazole, which exert no significant effect on acid secretion. About 77% of an orally given dose is excreted as metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found in the feces, primarily originating from bile secretion. Omeprazole has a half life of 0.5 to 1 hour. == Chemistry == Omeprazole contains a tricoordinated sulfinyl sulfur in a pyramidal structure and therefore can exist as either the (S)- or (R)-enantiomers. Omeprazole is a racemate, an equal mixture of the two. In the acidic conditions of the canaliculi of parietal cells, both enantiomers are converted to achiral products (sulfenic acid and sulfenamide configurations) which react with a cysteine group in H+/K+ ATPase, thereby inhibiting the ability of the parietal cells to produce gastric acid. AstraZeneca also developed esomeprazole (Nexium) which is a eutomer, purely the (S)-enantiomer, rather than a racemate like omeprazole. Omeprazole undergoes a chiral shift in vivo which converts the inactive (R)-enantiomer to the active (S)-enantiomer, doubling the concentration of the active form. This chiral shift is accomplished by the CYP2C19 isozyme of cytochrome P450, which is not found equally in all human populations. Those who do not metabolize the drug effectively are called ""poor metabolizers"". The proportion of the poor metabolizer phenotype varies widely between populations, from 2.0 to 2.5% in African Americans and white Americans to >20% in Asians. Several pharmacogenomics studies have suggested that PPI treatment should be tailored according to CYP2C19 metabolism status. === Measurement in body fluids === Omeprazole may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients. Plasma omeprazole concentrations are usually in a range of 0.2–1.2 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically by the oral route and 1–6 mg/L in people with acute overdose. Enantiomeric chromatographic methods are available to distinguish esomeprazole from racemic omeprazole. == History == Omeprazole was first made in 1979 by Swedish AB Hässle, part of Astra AB. It was the first of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Astra AB, now AstraZeneca, launched it as an ulcer medicine under the name Losec in Sweden. It was first sold in the United States in 1989 under the brand name Losec. In 1990, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the brand name Losec was changed to Prilosec to avoid confusion with the diuretic Lasix (furosemide). The new name led to confusion between omeprazole (Prilosec) and fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant. == Society and culture == === Economics === When Prilosec's U.S. patent expired in April 2001, AstraZeneca introduced esomeprazole (Nexium) as a patented replacement drug. Many companies introduced generics as AstraZeneca's patents expired worldwide, which are available under many brand names. Omeprazole was a subject of a patent litigation in the U.S. The invention involved application of two different coatings to a drug in pill form to ensure that the omeprazole did not disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action in stomach. Although the solution by means of two coating was obvious, the patent was found valid, because the source of the problem was non-obvious and was discovered by the patentee. In September 2023, AstraZeneca announced it would pay $425 million to settle product liability litigations against Prilosec in the United States. === Brand names === Brand names include Losec, Prilosec, Zegerid, Miracid, and Omez. == Veterinary uses == In February 2025, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the veterinary medicinal product Omeprazole TriviumVet, gastro-resistant capsule, hard, intended for dogs. The applicant for this veterinary medicinal product is TriviumVet DAC. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012). ""Omeprazole Therapy and CYP2C19 Genotype"".

One category termed a glycerophospholipid and the other a sphingomyelin, or more specifically within the sphingomyelin class, a sphingophospholipid. Phosphorylethanolamine is a polyprotic acid with two pKa values at 5.61 and 10.39. Phosphorylethanolamine has been falsely promoted as a cancer treatment. == Effectiveness == As a potential drug, phosphorylethanolamine has undergone human clinical trials. These were halted when no evidence of benefit was found. Edzard Ernst has called phosphorylethanolamine ""the most peculiar case of Brazilian quackery"". == Legality == There has been ongoing controversy and litigation in Brazil with regard to its use as a cancer treatment without approval by the National Health Surveillance Agency. For years, Gilberto Chierice, a Chemistry Professor at the São Carlos campus of the University of São Paulo, used resources from a campus laboratory to unofficially manufacture, distribute, and promote the drug to cancer patients without it having gone through clinical testing. In September 2015, university administrators began preventing the Professor from continuing with this practice. In October 2015, several courts in Brazil ruled in favor of plaintiffs who wanted the right to try the compound. However, a state court overturned the lower courts' decision a month later. Jailson Bittencourt de Andrade, secretary for Brazil's science and technology ministry, said the ministry plans to fund further research on the compound, but that it will be years before a determination can be made about phosphorylethanolamine's safety and efficacy in humans. On April 14, 2016, a law was passed in Brazil allowing the use of synthetic phosphorylethanolamine for cancer treatment, despite opposition from the Brazilian Medical Association, the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology, and the regulatory agency Anvisa.

It can be formulated as the pivoxil prodrug adefovir dipivoxil. == Uses == It is used for treatment of hepatitis B. Trials of adefovir in patients with HIV have not shown any clear benefits. == History == Adefovir was invented in the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic by Antonín Holý, and the drug was developed by Gilead Sciences for HIV with the brand name Preveon. However, in November 1999, an expert panel advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to approve the drug due to concerns about the severity and frequency of kidney toxicity when dosed at 60 or 120 mg. The FDA followed that advice, refusing to approve adefovir as a treatment for HIV. Gilead Sciences discontinued its development for HIV treatment in December 1999, but continued to develop the drug for hepatitis B (HBV), where it is effective with a much lower dose of 10 mg. FDA approval for use in the treatment of hepatitis B was granted on September 20, 2002, and adefovir is sold for this indication under the brand name Hepsera.

For her career contribution to ""children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense"" she won the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award from the Swedish Arts Council in 2013, the biggest prize in children's literature. == Background == Isol was born in Buenos Aires where she lives to this day. She studied at the Escuela Nacional ""Rogelio Yrurtia"" to become a Fine Arts teacher, and spent a few years studying art at the University of Buenos Aires. At some point she abandoned teaching to work full-time as an illustrator and writer of children's books, a natural synthesis of her taste for comics, literature and visual arts. Her first book, Vida de perros (A dog's life) was published in 1997, following a Mention of Honour at the contest A la orilla del Viento, organized by FCE publishers (Fondo de Cultura Económica, Mexico). From that moment on she has continued to publish books as an integral author, and has in turn illustrated texts written by other authors, such as Graciela Montes and Paul Auster. Her personal style for telling stories by means of drawings (candid, yet sometimes ironic) has allowed her the good fortune of being published in Mexico, Spain, USA, France, Korea, Switzerland and Argentina. From 2000 to 2005 she published a weekly illustration each Sunday in the Clarín (Argentine newspaper) Sunday magazine, doubtlessly the most widely read paper in Argentina. Her section in the paper involved illustrations of well-known tales for children and young people by established authors.

The most common adverse reaction is nausea. Severe adverse reactions included elevations in liver enzymes among participants also infected with hepatitis B or C virus, and changes in the immune system (immune reconstitution syndrome). Fostemsavir is an HIV entry inhibitor and a prodrug of temsavir (BMS-626529). Fostemsavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120-directed attachment inhibitor. It was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020, and in the European Union in February 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Fostemsavir in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations. == Adverse effects == Fostemsavir may cause a serious condition called immune reconstitution syndrome, similar to other approved drugs for treatment of HIV-1 infection. This condition can happen at the beginning of HIV-1 treatment when the immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in the body for a long time. Other serious side effects include heart rhythm problems due to prolongation of heart electrical activity (QT prolongation) and an increase of liver enzymes in patients with hepatitis B or C virus co-infection. == History == It was under development by ViiV Healthcare / GlaxoSmithKline for use in the treatment of HIV infection. When the active form of fostemsavir binds to the gp120 protein of the virus, it prevents initial viral attachment to the host CD4+ T cell and entry into the host immune cell; its method of action is a first for HIV drugs. Because it targets a different step of the viral lifecycle, it offers promise for individuals with virus that has become highly resistant to other HIV drugs. Since the function of gp120 that this drug inhibits is highly conserved, the drug is unlikely to promote resistance to itself. Investigators found that enfuvirtide-resistant and ibalizumab-resistant HIV envelopes remained susceptible to fostemsavir. Conversely, fostemsavir-resistant HIV remained susceptible to all the entry inhibitors. Furthermore, HIV isolates that do not require the CD4 receptor for cell entry were also susceptible to fostemsavir, and the virus did not escape the attachment inhibitor by becoming CD4-independent. Prior in vitro studies showed that fostemsavir inhibits both CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic HIV. Fostemsavir was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020. The safety and efficacy of fostemsavir, taken twice daily by mouth, were evaluated in a clinical trial of 371 heavily treatment-experienced adult participants who continued to have high levels of virus (HIV-RNA) in their blood despite being on antiretroviral drugs. Two hundred seventy-two participants were treated in the main trial arm, and an additional 99 participants received fostemsavir in a different arm of the trial. Most participants had been treated for HIV for more than 15 years (71 percent), had been exposed to five or more different HIV treatment regimens before entering the trial (85 percent) and/or had a history of AIDS (86 percent). Participants in the main cohort of the trial received either fostemsavir or a placebo twice daily for eight days, in addition to their failing antiretroviral regimen. On the eighth day, participants treated with fostemsavir had a significantly greater decrease in levels of HIV-RNA in their blood compared to those taking the placebo. After the eighth day, all participants received fostemsavir with other antiretroviral drugs. After 24 weeks of fostemsavir plus other antiretroviral drugs, 53 percent of participants achieved HIV RNA suppression, where levels of HIV were low enough to be considered undetectable. After 96 weeks, 60 percent of participants continued to have HIV RNA suppression. The clinical trial (NCT02362503) was conducted at 108 sites in 23 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Taiwan and South Africa. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for fostemsavir fast track, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designations. The FDA granted the approval of Rukobia to ViiV Healthcare. On 10 December 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Rukobia, intended for the treatment of multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection.

Although the binding of MES was an adventitious result of the use of MES as a buffer in the crystallization mixture, MES was subsequently shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, with a Ki of 23 +/- 5 mM. MES binds in the same fashion to both of the molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit; both direct and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds to the protein and to the binuclear zinc cluster are observed, involving the oxygens of the sulfonic acid group and the nitrogen of the morpholino ring. In addition, there are hydrophobic interactions between the morpholino ring and residues in the flexible beta-strand of the enzyme between residues 26 and 36. Comparison of this structure with the previously reported unliganded structures of the same enzyme [Concha, N. O., Rasmussen, B. A., Bush, K., and Herzberg, O. (1996) Structure 4, 823-836; Carfi, A., Duée, E., Paul-Soto, R., Galleni, M., Frère, J. -M., and Dideberg, O. (1998) Acta Crystallogr. D54, 47-57] reveals that although the overall conservation of structure in the three different crystal lattices is very high, binding of MES is correlated with a significant change in the conformation of this beta-strand. The flexibility of this beta-strand will be an important consideration in the design of inhibitors of the metallo-beta-lactamases. Humic acid (HA) is a relatively stable product of organic matter decomposition and thus accumulates in environmental systems. Humic acid might benefit plant growth by chelating unavailable nutrients and buffering pH. We examined the effect of HA on growth and micronutrient uptake in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown hydroponically. Four root-zone treatments were compared: (i) 25 micromoles synthetic chelate N-(4-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (C10H18N2O7) (HEDTA at 0.25 mM C); (ii) 25 micromoles synthetic chelate with 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (C6H13N4S) (MES at 5 mM C) pH buffer; (iii) HA at 1 mM C without synthetic chelate or buffer; and (iv) no synthetic chelate or buffer. Ample inorganic Fe (35 micromoles Fe3+) was supplied in all treatments. There was no statistically significant difference in total biomass or seed yield among treatments, but HA was effective at ameliorating the leaf interveinal chlorosis that occurred during early growth of the nonchelated treatment. Leaf-tissue Cu and Zn concentrations were lower in the HEDTA treatment relative to no chelate (NC), indicating HEDTA strongly complexed these nutrients, thus reducing their free ion activities and hence, bioavailability. Humic acid did not complex Zn as strongly and chemical equilibrium modeling supported these results. Titration tests indicated that HA was not an effective pH buffer at 1 mM C, and higher levels resulted in HA-Ca and HA-Mg flocculation in the nutrient solution. Both iodoacetic acid and (R,S)-2-bromo-3-(5-imidazolyl)propionic acid (BrImPpOH) react with liver alcohol dehydrogenase in an affinity labelling mechanism between pH 6.1 and 10.5. The buffer-independent dissociation constants and the first-order rate constants have been determined as a function of pH. With BrImPpOH a pKa close to 9 for the free enzyme is assigned to the zinc-water ionization. The buffers used exerted a protective effect upon the inactivation of the enzyme by iodoacetic acid and BrImPpOH. Phosphate buffer showed a high degree of protection especially at lower pH, while zwitterionic buffers like Mes (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid), Pipes (1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid), Epps [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid] and Bicine [N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine] gave less protection to various degrees. An exception was Ches (cyclohexylaminoethanesulfonic acid) which had an anomalously high affinity for the iodoacetate binding site.

Volasertib is the second in a novel class of drugs called dihydropteridinone derivatives. Volasertib was awarded breakthrough drug status in September 2013 and orphan drug status for acute myeloid leukemia in April 2014. == Mechanism of action == Volasertib is a novel small-molecule targeted therapy that blocks cell division by competitively binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the PLK1 protein. PLK1 proteins are found in the nuclei of all dividing cells and control multiple stages of the cell cycle and cell division. The levels of the PLK1 protein are tightly controlled and are raised in normal cells that are dividing. Raised levels of the PLK1 protein are also found in many cancers including; breast, non-small cell lung, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, papillary thyroid, ovarian, head and neck and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Raised levels of PLK1 increase the probability of improper segregation of chromosomes which is a critical stage in the development of many cancers. Raised levels of PLK1 have been associated with a poorer prognosis and overall survival in some cancers In addition to its role in cell division, there is evidence that PLK1 also interacts with components of other pathways involved in cancer development including the K-Ras oncogene and the retinoblastoma and p53 tumour suppressors These observations have led to PLK1 being recognised as an important target in the treatment of cancer. Volasertib can be taken either orally or via intravenous infusion, once circulating in the blood stream it is distributed throughout the body, crosses the cell membrane and enters the nucleus of cells where it binds to its target; PLK1. Volasertib inhibits PLK1 preventing its roles in the cell-cycle and cell division which leads to cell arrest and programmed cell death. Volasertib binds to and inhibits PLK1 at nanomolar doses however, it has also been shown to inhibit other PLK family members; PLK2 and PLK3 at higher; micromolar doses. The roles of PLK2 and PLK3 are less well understood; however they are known to be active during the cell cycle and cell division. Volasertib inhibits PLK1 in both cancer and normal cells; however it only causes irreversible inhibition and cell death in cancer cells, because inhibition of PLK1 in cancer cells arrests the cell cycle at a different point to normal, non-cancer cells. In cancer cells PLK1 inhibition results in G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by programmed cell death, however, in normal cells inhibition of PLK1 only causes temporary, reversible G1 and G2 arrest without programmed cell death. This specificity for cancer cells improves the efficacy of the drug and minimizes the drug related toxicity. == Adverse effects == One of the undesirable effects of small-molecule drugs is that they can lack specificity for their target; hence bind to similar targets in other unrelated proteins, which can result in undesirable drug-related side effects. However, pre-clinical studies have shown volasertib binds in a highly selective manner to the kinase domain of the PLK family, without binding to other proteins with a kinase domain. Although it is now known to bind to phosphatidylionositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase. Clinical studies have shown that at the maximum tolerated dose, side effects of volasertib include; anaemia (22%), thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Common side effects as seen with other antimitotic agents such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes which include neuropathy, have not been observed with volasertib. == Studies == Preclinical studies on volasertib have demonstrated that it is highly effective at binding to and blocking PLK1 function and causing programmed cell death in colon and non-small cell lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Volasertib can also cause cell death in cancer cells that have are no longer sensitive to existing anti-mitotic drugs such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes. This suggests that volasertib may be effective when used as a second line treatment in patients who have developed resistance to vinca alkaloid and taxane chemotherapeutics. A first in man trial of volasertib in 65 patients with solid cancers reported that the drug is safe to administer to patients and is stable in the bloodstream. This study also reported favourable anti-cancer activity of the drug; three patients achieved a partial response, 48% of patients achieved stable disease and 6 patients achieved progression free survival of greater than 6 months. A further phase 1 trial of volasertib in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia reported that 5 of 28 patients underwent a complete response, 2 achieved a partial response and a further 6 patients no worsening of their disease. === Clinical trials === Volasertib is currently undergoing investigation in phase I and II trials and has yet to be licensed by the FDA. Volasertib may be effective in several malignancies evidenced by the fact that its target PLK1 is overexpressed in up to 80% of malignancies, where it has been associated with a poorer treatment outcome and reduced overall survival. Further phase 1 and 2 trials are active, investigating the effects of Volasertib both as a single agent and in combination with other agents in solid tumors and hematological malignancies including; ovarian cancer, urothelial cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia, lymphomas, myelodysplastic syndromes, and non-small call lung cancer. As of January 2017 it is in one phase III trial (for AML in over 65s), due to complete in February 2017. == References ==",Volasertib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004307884373702109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001736728590913117), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019365858752280474)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volasertib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Volasertib', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volasertib?utm_source=openai')])"
3192,"('Artemether', 'Dihydroqinghaosu methyl ether', 'Dihydroartemisinin methyl ether', 'Beta-artemether', 'Artemetherum')",Medical,"Artemether is a medication used for the treatment of malaria. The injectable form is specifically used for severe malaria rather than quinine. In adults, it may not be as effective as artesunate. It is given by injection in a muscle. It is also available by mouth in combination with lumefantrine, known as artemether/lumefantrine. Artemether causes relatively few side effects. An irregular heartbeat may rarely occur. While there is evidence that use during pregnancy may be harmful in animals, there is no evidence of concern in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore recommends its use during pregnancy. It is in the artemisinin class of medication. Artemether has been studied since at least 1981, and has been in medical use since 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Artemether is an antimalarial drug for uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum (and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum) or chloroquine-resistant P. vivax parasites. Artemether can also be used to treat severe malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum with artemisinin-based combination therapy. Given in combination with lumefantrine, it may be followed by a 14-day regimen of primaquine to prevent relapse of P. vivax or P. ovale malarial parasites and provide a complete cure. Artemether can also be used in treating and preventing trematode infections of schistosomiasis when used in combination with praziquantel. Artemether is rated category C by the FDA based on animal studies where artemisinin derivatives have shown an association with fetal loss and deformity. Some studies, however, do not show evidence of harm. == Side effects == Possible side effects include cardiac effects such as bradycardia and QT interval prolongation. Also, possible central nervous system toxicity has been shown in animal studies. == Drug interactions == Plasma artemether level was found to be lower when the combination product was used with lopinavir/ritonavir. There is also decreased drug exposure associated with concurrent use with efavirenz or nevirapine. Artemether/lumefantrine should not be used with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4. Hormonal contraceptives may not be as efficacious when used with artemether/lumefantrine. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === A possible mechanism of action is that artemisinin drugs exert their cidal action by inhibiting PfATP6. Since PfATP6 is an enzyme regulating cellular calcium concentration, its malfunctioning will lead to intracellular calcium accumulation, which in turns causes cell death. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption of artemether is improved 2- to 3-fold with food. It is highly bound to protein (95.4%). Peak concentrations of artemether are seen 2 hours after administration. Artemether is metabolized in the human body to the active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, primarily by hepatic enzymes CYP3A4/5. Both the parent drug and active metabolite are eliminated with a half-life of about 2 hours. == Chemistry == Artemether is a methyl ether derivative of artemisinin, which is a peroxide-containing lactone isolated from the antimalarial plant Artemisia annua. It is also known as dihydroartemisinin methyl ether, but its correct chemical nomenclature is (+)-(3-alpha,5a-beta,6-beta,8a-beta, 9-alpha,12-beta,12aR)-decahydro-10-methoxy-3,6,9-trimethyl-3,12-epoxy-12H-pyrano(4,3-j)-1,2-benzodioxepin. It is a relatively lipophilic and unstable drug, which acts by creating reactive free radicals in addition to affecting the membrane transport system of the plasmodium organism. == References ==",Beta-artemether,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.894321920000948e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009201106731779873)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

We used tri-isopropylsilyl thioglycosides as masked glycosyl thiol nucleophiles for the elaboration of two monofluorinated heterodimers, one difluorinated homodimer, and one difluorinated heterodimer. Moreover, we also present an alternative synthesis of 3-deoxy-3-fluorogalactose and 4-deoxy-4-fluorogalactose from a common precursor. Finally, this small set of more stable thiodigalactoside analogues could be interesting inhibitors of galactose-specific lectins. Cancer cells produce galectin-1 as a tumor promoting protein. Thiodigalactoside (TDG) as a non-metabolised small drug, is shown to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting multiple cancer enhancing activities of galectin-1, including immune cell dysregulation, angiogenesis and protection against oxidative stress. Thus, using B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 orthotopic breast cancer models, intratumoral injection of TDG significantly raised the levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) lymphocytes and reduced CD31(+) endothelial cell content, reducing tumor growth. TDG treatment of tumors in Balb/c nude mice (defective in T cell immunity) reduced angiogenesis and slowed tumor growth by a third less than in immunocompetent mice. Knocking down galectin-1 expression (G1KD) in both cancer cell types significantly impeded tumor growth and the sensitivity of the G1KD tumors to TDG was severely reduced, highlighting a specific role for galectin-1. Endothelial cells were protected by galectin-1 from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2), but TDG inhibited this antioxidant protective effect of galectin-1 and reduced tube forming activity in angiogenic assays. We show for the first time that the single agent, TDG, concurrently prevents many tumor promoting effects of galectin-1 on angiogenesis, immune dysregulation and protection against oxidative stress, providing a potent and novel small molecule as an anti-cancer drug. Inhibitors for galectin-1 and -3 were synthesized from thiodigalactoside and lactosamine by derivatization of the galactose C3.

It is required for membrane budding at a late stage during the transition from a fully formed pit to a pinched-off vesicle. Dynamin may also fulfill other roles during earlier stages of vesicle formation. We have screened about 16,000 small molecules and have identified 1, named here dynasore, that interferes in vitro with the GTPase activity of dynamin1, dynamin2, and Drp1, the mitochondrial dynamin, but not of other small GTPases. Dynasore acts as a potent inhibitor of endocytic pathways known to depend on dynamin by rapidly blocking coated vesicle formation within seconds of dynasore addition. Two types of coated pit intermediates accumulate during dynasore treatment, U-shaped, half formed pits and O-shaped, fully formed pits, captured while pinching off. Thus, dynamin acts at two steps during clathrin coat formation; GTP hydrolysis is probably needed at both steps. Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are clinically severe respiratory disorders without available pharmacological therapies. Dynasore is a cell-permeable molecule that inhibits GTPase activity and exerts protective effects in several disease models. However, whether dynasore can alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI is unknown. This study investigated the effect of dynasore on macrophage activation and explored its potential mechanisms in LPS-induced ALI in vitro and in vivo. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were activated classically with LPS or subjected to NLRP3 inflammasome activation with LPS+ATP. A mouse ALI model was established by the intratracheal instillation (i.t.) of LPS. The expression of PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3), caspase-1, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) protein was detected by Western blots. Inflammatory mediators were analyzed in the cell supernatant, in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Morphological changes in lung tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. F4/80, Caspase-1 and GSDMD distribution in lung tissue was detected by immunofluorescence. Dynasore downregulated nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro and inhibited the production and release of interleukin (IL)-1β, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and macrophage pyroptosis through the Drp1/ROS/NLRP3 axis. Dynasore significantly reduced lung injury scores and proinflammatory cytokine levels in both BALF and serum in vivo, including IL-1β and IL-6. Dynasore also downregulated the co-expression of F4/80, caspase-1 and GSDMD in lung tissue. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that dynasore could alleviate LPS-induced ALI by regulating macrophage pyroptosis, which might provide a new therapeutic strategy for ALI/ARDS. Dynamin is a GTPase protein that is essential for membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis in eukaryotic cells. Dynasore is a GTPase inhibitor that rapidly and reversibly inhibits dynamin activity, which prevents endocytosis. However, comparison between cells treated with dynasore and RNA interference of genes encoding dynamin, reveals evidence that dynasore reduces labile cholesterol in the plasma membrane, and disrupts lipid raft organization, in a dynamin-independent manner. To explore the role of dynamin it is important to use multiple dynamin inhibitors, alongside the use of dynamin mutants and RNA interference targeting genes encoding dynamin. On the other hand, dynasore provides an interesting tool to explore the regulation of cholesterol in plasma membranes.",Dynasore,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.4741019308567047), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6931842565536499), (' INDUSTR', -8.065608562901616e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.38967517018318176), ('ICAL', -3.3378546504536644e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6931720972061157)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.004084574058651924), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16740485/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18413242/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25889964/ ', [])"

It is an indole-tetramic acid that serves as a toxin due to its ability to inhibit calcium-dependent ATPases found in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum. This inhibition disrupts the muscle contraction-relaxation cycle and the calcium gradient that is maintained for proper cellular activity in cells. Cyclopiazonic acid is known to contaminate multiple foods because the molds that produce them are able to grow on different agricultural products, including but not limited to grains, corn, peanuts, and cheese. Due to this contamination, α-CPA can be harmful to both humans and farm animals that were exposed to contaminated animal feeds. However, α-CPA needs to be introduced in very high concentrations to produce mycotoxicosis in animals. Due to this, α-CPA is not a potent acute toxin. Chemically, CPA is related to ergoline alkaloids. CPA was originally isolated from Penicillium cyclopium and subsequently from other fungi including Penicillium griseofulvum, Penicillium camemberti, Penicillium commune, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus versicolor. CPA only appears to be toxic in high concentrations. Ingestion of CPA causes anorexia, dehydration, weight loss, immobility, and signs of spasm when near death. CPA can be found in molds, corns, peanuts, and other fermented products, such as cheese and sausages. Biologically, CPA is a specific inhibitor of SERCA ATPase in intracellular Ca2+ storage sites. CPA inhibits SERCA ATPase by keeping it in one specific conformation, thus, preventing it from forming another. CPA also binds to SERCA ATPase at the same site as another inhibitor, thapsigargin (TG). In this way, CPA lowers the ability of SERCA ATPase to bind an ATP molecule. == Toxicity == Cases of α-CPA mycotoxicosis in humans are rare. However, the occurrence of α-CPA in foods consumed by humans suggests that the toxin is indeed ingested by humans, though at concentrations low enough to be of no serious health concern. Even if its toxicity in humans is rare, large doses of α-CPA have been seen to adversely affect animals such as mice, rats, chickens, pigs, dogs, and rabbits. Cyclopiazonic acid's toxicity mirrors that of antipsychotic drugs when taken up these animals. This mycotoxin has been extensively studied in mice to discern its toxic properties. The severity of toxicity is dose-dependent, and exposure to α-CPA has led to hypokinesia, hypothermia, catalepsy, tremors, irregular respiration, ptosis, weight loss, and eventual death in mice. The adverse health effects of α-CPA studied in mice are similar to those found in other animals. == Biosynthesis == Three enzymes are utilized in the biosynthesis of α-CPA: the polypeptide CpaS, dimethylallyltransferase (CpaD), and flavoprotein oxidocyclase (CpaO). CpaS is the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway and is a hybrid polyketide synthase- nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS). It uses the precursors acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and tryptophan to produce cyclo-acetoaceytl-L-tryptophan (cAATrp). The intermediate cAATrp is then prenylated with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) by the enzyme CpaD to form the intermediate β-CPA. CpaD has high substrate specificity and will not catalyze prenylation in the presence of DMAPP's isomer isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) or the derivatives of cAATrp. The third enzyme, CpaO, then acts on β-CPA through a redox mechanism that allows for intramolecular cyclization to form α-CPA. === Mechanism of Action of CpaS === CpaS is made of several domains that belong either to the PKS portion or the NRPS portion of the 431 kDa protein. The PKS portion is made up of three catalytically important domains and three additional tailoring domains that are common to polyketide synthases but not used in the biosynthesis of α-CPA. The catalytically important acyl carrier protein domain (ACP), acyl transferase domain (AT), and ketosynthase domain (KS) work together to form acetoacetyl-CoA from the precursors acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The acetoacetyl-CoA is then acted on by the NRPS portion of CpaS. The NRPS portion, like the PKS portion, contains many catalytically active domains. The adenylation domain (A) acts first to activate the amino acid tryptophan and subsequently transfer it to the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain (T). Following this, the condensation domain (C) catalyzes an amide bond formation between the acetoacetyl moiety attached to the ACP and tryptophan attached to the PCP. The releasing domain (R) catalyzes a Dieckmann condensation to both cyclize and release the cAATrp product. === Formation of β-CPA === The second enzyme, CpaD, converts the cAATrp produced by CpaS to β-CPA. CpaD, also known as cycloacetoacetyltyptophanyl dimethylallyl transferase, places DMAPP at the tryptophan indole ring, specifically at position C-4. CpaD then catalyzes selective prenylation at position C-4 through a Friedel-Craft alkylation, producing β-CPA. It is important to note here that the biosynthesis of α-CPA is dependent on other pathways, specifically the mevalonate pathway, which serves to form DMAPP. === Formation of α-CPA === The final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, CpaO, converts β-CPA to α-CPA. CpaO is a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. FAD oxidizes β-CPA in a two-electron process, subsequently allowing for ring closure and formation of α-CPA.

3203,"('Icaritin', 'Anhydroicaritin', 'Cycloicaritin', 'Icartin', 'Anhydroicaritin;')",Medical," Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the deadliest malignancies worldwide and still a pressing clinical problem. Icaritin, a natural compound obtained from the Epimedium genus plant, has garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic drug for HCC therapies. Mitophagy plays a crucial role in mitochondrial quality control through efficiently eliminating damaged mitochondria. However, the specific mechanisms of the interplay between mitophagy and apoptosis in HCC is still unclear. We aimed to explore the cross-talk between icaritin-induced mitophagy and apoptosis in HCC cells and investigate its potential mechanisms. Firstly, we confirmed that icaritin inhibits proliferation and migration while inducing mitochondrial damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HCC cells. Secondly, based on proteomics analysis, we discovered that icaritin inhibits the growth of tumor cells and disrupts their mitochondrial homeostasis through the regulation of both mitophagy and apoptosis. Thirdly, icaritin causes mitophagy mediated by PINK1-Parkin signaling via regulating feedforward loop. Furthermore, knockdown of PINK1/Parkin leads to inhibition of mitophagy, which promotes cell death induced by icaritin in HCC cells. Finally, autophagy/mitophagy inhibitors remarkably enhance icaritin-induced cell death and anticancer efficacy. Collectively, our findings reveal that icaritin suppresses growth, proliferation and migration of HCC cell through induction of mitophagy and apoptosis, while inhibition of mitophagy significantly increased the anti-cancer and pro-apoptotic effects of icaritin, indicating that targeting autophagy or mitophagy is a novel approach to overcome drug resistance and enhance anticancer therapies. Inflammation and immunity dysregulation have received widespread attention in recent years due to their occurrence in the pathophysiology of many conditions. In this regard, several pharmacological studies have been conducted aiming to evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of phytochemicals. Epimedium, a traditional Chinese medicine, is often used as a tonic, aphrodisiac, and anti-rheumatic agent. Icariin (ICA) is the main active ingredient of Epimedium and is, once ingested, mainly metabolized into Icaritin (ICT). Data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that ICA and its metabolite (ICT) regulated the functions and activation of immune cells, modulated the release of inflammatory factors, and restored aberrant signaling pathways. ICA and ICT were also involved in anti-inflammatory and immune responses in several diseases, including multiple sclerosis, asthma, atherosclerosis, lupus nephritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Yet, data showed that ICA and ICT exhibited similar but not identical pharmacokinetic properties. Therefore, based on their higher solubility and bioavailability, as well as trends indicating that single-ingredient compounds offer broader and safer therapeutic capabilities, ICA and ICT delivery systems and treatment represent interesting avenues with promising clinical applications. In this study, we reviewed the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms, as well as the pharmacokinetic properties of ICA and its metabolite ICT. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resistant to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy is among the deadliest malignancies. Doxorubicin widely used in transarterial chemotherapy in HCC can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), but the resulting immunogenicity is still weak. We aim to seek a strategy for improving the efficacy of ICD in HCC based on an immunoregulatory drug called icaritin. Icaritin induced mitophagy and apoptosis to provoke ICD both in mouse Hepa1-6 and human Huh7 HCC cells. A combination of icaritin and doxorubicin with a molar ratio of 1:2 played a synergistic role in ICD induction.

3204,"('Avoralstat', 'Avoralstat [inn]')",Medical," Drugs targeting host proteins can act prophylactically to reduce viral burden early in disease and limit morbidity, even with antivirals and vaccination. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human protease required for SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry and may represent such a target. We hypothesized that drugs selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool named 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Several candidate compounds, avoralstat, PCI-27483, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human airway epithelial cells. In an in vivo proof of principle, avoralstat significantly reduced lung tissue titers and mitigated weight loss when administered prophylactically to mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, indicating its potential to be repositioned for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prophylaxis in humans. Effective inhibition of plasma kallikrein may have significant benefits for patients with hereditary angioedema due to deficiency of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH-HAE) by reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks. Avoralstat is a small molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. This study (OPuS-2) evaluated the efficacy and safety of prophylactic avoralstat 300 or 500 mg compared with placebo. OPuS-2 was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were administered avoralstat 300 mg, avoralstat 500 mg, or placebo orally 3 times per day for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the angioedema attack rate based on adjudicator-confirmed attacks. A total of 110 subjects were randomized and dosed. The least squares (LS) mean attack rates per week were 0.589, 0.675, and 0.593 for subjects receiving avoralstat 500 mg, avoralstat 300 mg, and placebo, respectively. Overall, 1 subject in each of the avoralstat groups and no subjects in the placebo group were attack-free during the 84-day treatment period. The LS mean duration of all confirmed attacks was 25.4, 29.4, and 31.4 hours for the avoralstat 500 mg, avoralstat 300 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Using the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL), improved QoL was observed for the avoralstat 500 mg group compared with placebo. Avoralstat was generally safe and well tolerated. Although this study did not demonstrate efficacy of avoralstat in preventing angioedema attacks in C1-INH-HAE, it provided evidence of shortened angioedema episodes and improved QoL in the avoralstat 500 mg treatment group compared with placebo. Avoralstat is a potent small-molecule oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor under development for treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). This first-in-human study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of avoralstat. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose cohort trial evaluated avoralstat single doses of 50, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 mg and multiple doses up to 2400 mg daily (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg every 8 h [q8 h] up to 7 days). Avoralstat (n = 71) was generally well tolerated with no signals for a safety concern; there were no serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuations due to AEs, and compared to placebo (n = 18), no notable difference in AEs. Four moderate severity AEs were reported in two subjects; syncope after a single 250 mg dose (one subject) and abdominal pain, back pain, and eczema after multiple doses of 800 mg avoralstat (one subject). For multiple-dose cohorts, the incidence of gastrointestinal AEs was highest at the 2400 mg/day dose. Elimination of avoralstat was bi-exponential with a terminal half-life of 12-31 h. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein was observed at all doses, and the degree of inhibition was highly correlated with avoralstat concentrations (R = 0.93). Mean avoralstat concentrations at doses ≥400 mg q8 h met or exceeded plasma kallikrein EC Avoralstat was well tolerated, and drug exposure was sufficient to meet target levels for inhibition of plasma kallikrein.

3205,"('Pravastatin (sodium)', 'Pravastatin', 'Pravastatina', 'Pravastatine', 'Pravastatinum')",Medical,"Pravastatin, sold under the brand name Pravachol among others, is a statin medication, used for preventing cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treating abnormal lipids. It is suggested to be used together with diet changes, exercise, and weight loss. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include joint pain, diarrhea, nausea, headaches, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Like all statins, pravastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol. Pravastatin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 37th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 16 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Pravastatin is primarily used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels. Pravastatin has been found to have a similar effectiveness at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as fluvastatin but evidence indicates that pravastatin may not be as effective as other statin medications. The beneficial effect of pravastatin is dependent on the dose and the potential for side effects or unwanted effects from this medication are not clear from clinical trials. == Adverse effects and contraindications == Pravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40 mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients. Contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding. Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism. == Drug interactions == Medications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to: Cimetidine (Tagamet) Colchicine (Colcrys) Cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) Ketoconazole (Nizoral) Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: fenofibrate (Tricor), gemfibrozil (Lopid), cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and niacin (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan); Specific HIV protease inhibitors such as: lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra), and ritonavir (Norvir) taken with darunavir (Prezista); and spironolactone (Aldactone). The combination of fenofibrate with pravastatin is approved for use in the European Union. == Mechanism of action == Pravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, pravastatin sterically hinders the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream. == Pharmacokinetics == Oral bioavailability of pravastatin ranges from 17-34% with peak plasma concentration achieved 1-1.5 hours after administration. Absorption of drug is modestly decreased when taken with food however this does not reduce the clinical lipid-lowering effect. The 3α-hydroxyisomeric metabolite of pravastatin is also an active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with approximately 2.5-10% the potency of the parent compound. Pravastatin has a plasma half-life of 1.8 hours whereas this active metabolite has a half-life up to 77 hours. == History == Initially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s by researchers of the Sankyo Pharma Inc. It is being marketed outside Japan by the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved generic pravastatin for use in the United States in April 2006.

In this research, the kinetics of hydrolysis for myristyl nicotinate was studied in an aqueous phosphate buffer solution within a 5-10 pH range and constant ionic strength at a high temperature which was 80 °C to perform accelerated hydrolysis experiments. The effect of temperature, ionic strength, buffer concentrations, and buffer type was studied. The degradation was monitored using a validated HPLC method. The kinetics of hydrolysis of myristyl nicotinate was also studied in skin and liver homogenates. The hydrolysis was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. The rate constant was calculated from the slope of a linear plot of Ln transformation (Ln) of the remaining parent prodrug concentration versus time. The hydrolysis was found pH- dependent, and a pH rate profile was constructed. Moreover, the hydrolysis rate of the prodrug was found to be buffer species dependent. Carbonate buffer has the most catalytic effect over borate and phosphate buffers. The effect of temperature on the kinetics of hydrolysis of myristyl nicotinate in phosphate buffer at pH 9 at 343, 348, 353, and 358°K was studied. The hydrolysis was found to follow the Arrhenius equation. From the Arrhenius plot, the half-life at 25 °C, and the activation energy were calculated and were found to be 466.5 days and 24.57 kcal mol Myristyl nicotinate is an ester prodrug under development for delivery of nicotinic acid to skin for treatment and prevention of conditions that involve skin barrier impairment such as chronic photodamage and atopic dermatitis or for mitigating skin barrier impairment that results from therapy such as retinoids or steroids. The formulation stability of myristyl nicotinate is crucial because even small amounts of free nicotinic acid cause skin flushing, an effect that is not harmful but would severely limit tolerability. We report here reversed-phase HPLC methods for the rapid analysis of myristyl nicotinate and nicotinic acid in dermatological preparations. Because of the large differences in polarity, myristyl nicotinate and nicotinic acid were analyzed by different chromatographic conditions, but they can be rapidly extracted from cream formulations using HPLC mobile phase as a solvent followed by HPLC analysis in less than 10 min. The methods were validated in terms of linearity, precision and accuracy and mean recovery of myristyl nicotinate from topical creams ranged from 97.0-101.2%. Nicotinic acid at levels of 0.01% in the formulations could be quantified. Stability studies show that myristyl nicotinate formulations are stable at room temperature for 3 years with less than 0.05% conversion to nicotinic acid. These methods will be effective for routine analysis of myristyl nicotinate stability in dermatological formulations. Myristyl nicotinate (Nia-114) is an ester prodrug being developed for delivery of nicotinic acid (NIC) into the skin for prevention of actinic keratosis and its progression to skin cancer. To facilitate dermal studies of Nia-114, a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) as a deproteinization solvent was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of Nia-114, NIC, and nicotinamide (NAM) in rabbit plasma. NAM is the principal metabolite of NIC, which is also expected to have chemopreventive properties. The analytes were chromatographically separated using a Spherisorb Cyano column under isocratic conditions, and detected by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive-ion electrospray ionization mode with a run time of 9 min. The method utilized a plasma sample volume of 0.2 ml and isotope-labeled D4 forms of each analyte as internal standards. The method was linear over the concentration range of 2-1000, 8-1000, and 75-1000 ng/ml, for Nia-114, NIC, and NAM, respectively. The intra- and inter-day assay accuracy and precision were within +/-15% for all analytes at low, medium, and high quality control standard levels. The relatively high value for the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of NAM was demonstrated to be due to the high level of endogenous NAM in the rabbit plasma (about 350 ng/ml).

3208,"('Aminopterin', 'Aminopteridine', 'Aminopterine', 'Aminotrexate', 'Aminopteroylglutamic acid')",Medical,"Aminopterin (or 4-aminopteroic acid), the 4–amino derivative of folic acid, is an antineoplastic drug with immunosuppressive properties often used in chemotherapy. Aminopterin is a synthetic derivative of pterin. Aminopterin works as an enzyme inhibitor by competing for the folate binding site of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Its binding affinity for dihydrofolate reductase effectively blocks tetrahydrofolate synthesis. This results in the depletion of nucleotide precursors and inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. == Uses == Discovered by Yellapragada Subbarow, the drug was first used by Sidney Farber in 1947 to induce remissions among children with leukemia. Aminopterin was later marketed by Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, New York) in the United States from 1953 to 1964 for the indication of pediatric leukemia. The closely related antifolate methotrexate was simultaneously marketed by the company during the same period. Aminopterin was discontinued by Lederle Laboratories in favor of methotrexate due to manufacturing difficulties of the former. During the period Aminopterin was marketed, the agent was used off-label to safely treat over 4,000 patients with psoriasis in the United States, producing dramatic clearing of lesions. The use of aminopterin in cancer treatment was supplanted in the 1950s by methotrexate due to the latter's better therapeutic index in a rodent tumor model. Now in a more pure preparation and supported by laboratory evidence of superior tumor cell uptake in vitro, aminopterin is being investigated in clinical trials in leukemia as a potentially superior antifolate to methotrexate. The compound was explored as an abortifacient in the 1960s and earlier, but was associated with congenital malformations. Similar congenital abnormalities have been documented with methotrexate, and collectively their teratogenic effects have become known as the fetal aminopterin syndrome. When a similar cluster of anomalies appears in the absence of exposure to antifolates it is referred to as aminopterin-like syndrome without aminopterin. The reference to the use of Aminopterin as a rodenticide (i.e. rat poison) dates back to a 1951 patent issued to the American Cyanamid Company that is commonly cited by a variety of reference textbooks including the Merck Manual, although the use of aminopterin as a rodenticide was later disputed. The preparation of the molecule is complex and expensive. It is also unstable in the environment due to degradation by light and heat. The apparently mistaken association of aminopterin with its use as a rodenticide likely dates back to a 1951 patent issued to the American Cyanamid Company (then the holding company of Lederle Laboratories) that is commonly cited by a variety of reference textbooks. Aminopterin has a single-dose LDLo of 2.5 mg/kg when orally administered to rats. Aminopterin is widely used in selection media (such as HAT medium) for cell culture, particularly in the development of hybridomas, which secrete monoclonal antibodies. == Implication in 2007 Menu Foods recall == On March 23, 2007, ABC News reported that aminopterin was the chemical linked to the 2007 Menu Foods pet food contamination incident. The incident resulted in a massive recall of the affected foods. The link to aminopterin was confirmed by New York State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker and Dr. Donald Smith, Dean of Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, in a statement released on the same day. On March 27, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center expressed concern that the problem may not yet be fully understood and that other contaminants may be involved, noting that ""clinical signs reported in cats affected by the contaminated foods are not fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin"". On March 30 it was widely reported that the United States Food and Drug Administration had found melamine in wheat gluten that was used in the pet foods in question. These same reports stated that the FDA had failed to find evidence of aminopterin in the wheat gluten. Tests at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada detected aminopterin in some pet food samples, but only in concentrations of parts per billion or parts per trillion, amounts too low to cause the symptoms seen. == Exposure and treatment == Symptoms of exposure in humans include: nausea vomiting anorexia weight loss chills fever stomatitis – inflammation of the oral mucosa pharyngitis – inflammation of the pharynx erythematous rashes – red rashes on the skin hyperpigmentation – increased pigmentation associated with cleared psoriatic lesions gastrointestinal hemorrhage renal failure – in high doses necessarily involving concomitant leucovorin rescue abortions in pregnant women Supralethal doses of aminopterin may be rescued with the antidote Leucovorin (also known as folinic acid), a reduced form of folic acid which bypasses dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme inhibited by aminopterin. Leucovorin has been used in rats, dogs and humans to rescue aminopterin toxicity. Leucovorin rescue is a therapeutic maneuver intentionally employed with antifolates to achieve tumoricidal drug concentrations that would otherwise be lethal to the patient. In humans, leucovorin rescue at overdosages lower than 10 mg aminopterin in an average 70 kg adult should comprise an initial leucovorin dose of at least 20 mg (10.0 mg/m2), given intravenously (preferably), or orally. Subsequent doses of 20 mg (which may be taken orally) should be given at 6 hour intervals until hematological abnormalities are improved. Massive aminopterin overdosage in humans (i.e. > 40 mg AMT in an average 70 kg adult), should be approached with an initial leucovorin dose of 100 mg (50 mg/m2), given intravenously and continued at 6 hour intervals until the hematological abnormalities are improved (likely 8–12 courses or more). Additionally, to prevent reversible aminopterin-mediated nephrotoxicity manifesting as increases in serum creatinine and which further delays drug elimination, urinary alkalinization with NaHCO3 and volume expansion should be considered in cases of massive aminopterin overdosage, particularly those involving greater than 100 mg AMT in an average 70 kg adult human. Consistent with the known enterohepatic cycling of the related antifolate methotrexate, oral activated charcoal, and saline cathartic or sorbitol may promote excretion if an overdose of aminopterin is suspected. However, rescue with leucovorin should form the backbone of treatment. The vitamin folic acid is an oxidized precursor to reduced folates that is upstream of the blockade at dihydrofolate reductase, and compared to leucovorin is recognized as a very weak antidote to the toxic effects of antifolates that is inappropriate for use in cases of acute intoxication. Minnich et al. dosed mongrel dogs subcutaneously with aminopterin and folic acid simultaneously to test whether folic acid can rescue animals from the lethality and toxicity of aminopterin Dogs were given 0.020, 0.046, 0.044 escalated to 0.088, and 0.097 mg/kg aminopterin each day for 7 to 12 days. Folic acid was given in a weight ratio to aminopterin of 200:1 to 800:1. All animals survived. In contrast, animals given aminopterin in an amount of 0.041 mg/kg/day x 6 days without folic acid died. Thus, when the ratio of folic acid to aminopterin was 200:1 and greater, all of the subjects survived on regimens that would have otherwise been uniformly fatal to all subjects. Similar effects have been noted in rodent species as well, where the range for rescue by folic acid was fairly narrow and highly dependent on the timing (optimal of 1 hour prior to aminopterin) of administration in relation to aminopterin. The temporal relationship between folic acid administration and rescue has been interpreted as the necessary period of time required for the vitamin to be converted in vivo to reduced forms. == References ==",Aminopteroylglutamic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -9.209963900502771e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011052182875573635), (' INDUSTR', -4.11996734328568e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0007738456479273736), ('ICAL', -1.0371154530730564e-05), (',', -0.38690581917762756), ('ĠINDU', -0.0029147067107260227), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005274428054690361)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009114635176956654), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL,INDUSTRIAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopterin ', [])"

Pre-clinical studies indicate that the compound acts as an activator of the Nrf2 pathway and an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway. A phase 3 clinical trial evaluating bardoxolone methyl for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was terminated in October 2012 after patients treated with the drug were found to have experienced a higher rate of heart-related adverse events, including heart failure, hospitalizations, and deaths. An advisory committee meeting of experts voted unanimously that bardoxolone methyl was not effective in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease in Alport syndrome and that its benefits did not outweigh its risks. A Complete Response Letter from FDA stated a similar opinion. == Clinical development == Investigations of bardoxolone methyl have been conducted by Reata Pharmaceuticals in a partnership with Abbvie and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. The UK based company e-Therapeutics has announced in late 2020 the possible development of Bardoxolone for anti-viral treatment of COVID-19(Coronavirus), and announced a possible phase 3 program to follow (https://www.etherapeutics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/RNAi-Press-Release.pdf accessed 16 Feb 2021). === Phase 1 === A Phase 1 clinical trial, sponsored by Reata, was conducted to determine the safety profile of and appropriate dosing for subsequent phase II studies, as well as to evaluate antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumor or lymphoid malignancy. Grade 3 reversible liver transaminase elevations were reported. The maximum tolerated dose was 900 mg/day. NQO1 mRNA levels, indicative of Nrf2 pathway activation, were increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and tumor biopsies showed decreased levels of NF-κB and cyclin D1. An improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients treated with bardoxolone methyl was noted, and based on this finding it was suggested by the authors that the drug might be beneficial for patients with CKD. === Phase 2 === A Reata-funded, Phase 2 multi-center RCT (BEAM) in patients with moderate to severe CKD and type 2 diabetes reported that eGFR was increased (> 10 ml/min/1.73 m2) in patients treated with bardoxolone methyl for 24 months. An analysis of secondary endpoints showed that approximately three-quarters of bardoxolone methyl-treated patients experienced at least a 10 percent increase in eGFR, and one-quarter of the patients had an improvement of 50%. Adverse events in bardoxolone methyl-treated patients were generally manageable and mild to moderate in severity, with muscle spasm being reported most frequently. In 2014, Reata announced the initiation of a placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study (LARIAT), to assess the effects of bardoxolone methyl in pulmonary arterial hypertension. === Phase 3 === A Phase 3 multinational RCT (BEACON) designed to test the effect of bardoxolone methyl on progression to end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular death in patients with stage 4 CKD and type 2 diabetes was initiated by Reata in June 2011 and halted in October 2012 after bardoxolone methyl-treated patients were found to have experienced a higher rate of heart-related adverse events, including heart failure, hospitalizations, and deaths. A retrospective post-hoc analyses of the Phase 3 data, conducted by Reata, identified prior hospitalization for heart failure and the baseline level of brain natriuretic peptide, a marker of fluid retention, as predictors of heart failure hospitalizations in the BEACON trial. For patients without these baseline characteristics, the risk for heart failure events among bardoxolone methyl- and placebo-treated patients was similar. == Mechanism of action == Bardoxolone methyl is an activator of the KEAP1-Nrf2 pathway in mice.

3217,"('Diacerein', 'Diacerhein', 'Diacetylrhein', 'Artrodar', 'Fisiodar')",Medical,"Diacerein (INN), also known as diacetylrhein, is a slow-acting medicine of the class anthraquinone used to treat joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. It works by inhibiting interleukin-1 beta. An updated 2014 Cochrane review found diacerein had a small beneficial effect on pain. Diacerein-containing medications are registered in some European Union and Asian countries and included as a treatment option on several international therapeutic guidelines. == Synthesis == Various synthetic routes to diacerein have been developed, most of which utilize aloin as a precursor. The hydroxyl groups of aloin are acetylated, and the intermediates are subsequently oxidized using chromic anhydride in an acetic acid solvent system.. A less common method uses rhein as the starting compound. It involves diacetylation of the hydroxyl groups at positions C4 and C5 of rhein. == Pharmacology == Diacerein works by blocking the actions of interleukin-1 beta, a protein involved in the inflammation and destruction of cartilage that plays a role in the development of symptoms of degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. Due to its specific mode of action, which does not involve the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, diacerein has been shown to have anti-osteoarthritis and cartilage stimulating properties in vitro and animal models. == Side effects == The most common side effects of diacerein treatment are gastrointestinal symptoms including soft stools and diarrhea. These are generally mild to moderate and occur more frequently in the first 2 weeks, and lessen with continued treatment. Based on review by European Medicines Agency (EMA), diacerein-containing medicines use is restricted due to severe diarrhoea and liver disorders in patients. An uncommon side effect is hepatic adverse events (most frequently reported as liver function test abnormalities). These have been described as mild/moderate cases of elevated liver enzymes in the blood. Mild skin reactions (rash, pruritus and eczema) have also been reported with diacerein treatment. Discoloration of urine (yellow or pink) is another side effect of diacerein. This effect is due to the elimination of rhein metabolites via the urine and no clinical significance has been found; it may also be dependent on general fluid intake. == Special warning == In 2014 the European Medicines Agency (EMA’s) Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) performed a review of diacerein-containing medicines over concerns about its gastrointestinal and liver effects. As a result, the PRAC has introduced additional proposals to manage diacerein’s risks and was satisfied that with new restrictions diacerein’s benefit on pain outweighs the side effects for osteoarthritis treatment. The following recommendations have been made around the use of diacerein: Due to the potential complications that can occur as a result of diarrhea in older adults, diacerein is no longer recommended in patients aged 65 years and above. It is also advised that patients start treatment on half the normal dose (i.e. 50 mg daily instead of 100 mg daily), and should stop taking diacerein if diarrhea occurs. It should not be used in any patient with liver disease or a history of liver disease, and doctors should be monitoring their patients for early signs of liver problems. The use of diacerein is to be limited to treating symptoms of osteoarthritis affecting the hip or knee. Diacerein should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation. The PRAC concluded that the benefit-risk balance of diacerein-containing medicinal products remained favourable in the symptomatic treatment osteoarthritis, subject to the agreed changes to the product information and conditions. == Dosage and administration == The recommended starting dose is 50 mg once daily with evening meal for the first 2 to 4 weeks of treatment, after which the recommended daily dose is 50 mg twice daily. == See also == Rhein == References ==",Diacerein,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.136476854910143e-05), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02325988933444023)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacerein?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Diacerein', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacerein?utm_source=openai')])"
3218,"('Erythromycin estolate', 'Erythromycin propionate', 'Propionylerythromycin', ""Erythromycin, 2'-propanoate"", ""Erythromycin 2'-propionate"")",Medical,"Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis. It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn, and to improve delayed stomach emptying. It can be given intravenously and by mouth. An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn. Common side effects include abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin also appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding, its use by the mother during the first two weeks of life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family of antibiotics and works by decreasing bacterial protein production. Erythromycin was first isolated in 1952 from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 271st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Erythromycin can be used to treat bacteria responsible for causing infections of the skin and upper respiratory tract, including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus and Corynebacterium genera. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae: 0.015 to 256 μg/ml Staphylococcus aureus: 0.023 to 1024 μg/ml Streptococcus pyogenes: 0.004 to 256 μg/ml Corynebacterium minutissimum: 0.015 to 64 μg/ml It may be useful in treating gastroparesis due to this promotility effect. It has been shown to improve feeding intolerances in those who are critically ill. Intravenous erythromycin may also be used in endoscopy to help clear stomach contents to enhance endoscopic visualization, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and subsequent management. === Available forms === Erythromycin is available in enteric-coated tablets, slow-release capsules, oral suspensions, ophthalmic solutions, ointments, gels, enteric-coated capsules, non enteric-coated tablets, non enteric-coated capsules, and injections. The following erythromycin combinations are available for oral dosage: erythromycin base (capsules, tablets) erythromycin estolate (capsules, oral suspension, tablets), contraindicated during pregnancy erythromycin ethylsuccinate (oral suspension, tablets) erythromycin stearate (oral suspension, tablets) For injection, the available combinations are: erythromycin gluceptate erythromycin lactobionate For ophthalmic use: erythromycin base (ointment) == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are very common because erythromycin is a motilin agonist. More serious side effects include arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals, including torsades de pointes, and reversible deafness. Allergic reactions range from urticaria to anaphylaxis. Cholestasis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome are some other rare side effects that may occur. Studies have shown evidence both for and against the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) has been linked to an increased probability of pyloric stenosis in young infants. Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Erythromycin estolate has been associated with reversible hepatotoxicity in pregnant women in the form of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and is not recommended during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations. It can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares, and night sweats. == Interactions == Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily. The activity of the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g., dexamethasone), which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, including erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor) — are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels and the potential for rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated. Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Interactions with theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, were also shown. Erythromycin and doxycycline can have a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency than the sum of the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately. It may alter the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills because of its effect on the gut flora. A review found that when erythromycin was given with certain oral contraceptives, there was an increase in the maximum serum concentrations and AUC of estradiol and dienogest. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means it can have a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Erythromycin displays bacteriostatic activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited. Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action. Erythromycin increases gut motility by binding to motilin receptor, thus it is a motilin receptor agonist in addition to its antimicrobial properties. It can be therefore administered intravenously as a stomach emptying stimulant. === Pharmacokinetics === Erythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or esters, such as erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of erythromycin are released. === Metabolism === Most of erythromycin is metabolised by demethylation in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%–15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5–2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food. Erythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk. The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding. Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients. == Chemistry == === Composition === Standard-grade erythromycin is primarily composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can be present in varying amounts and can differ by lot. Erythromycin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity, followed by erythromycin B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as erythromycin A. Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually. === Synthesis === Over the three decades after the discovery of erythromycin A and its activity as an antimicrobial, many attempts were made to synthesize it in the laboratory. The presence of 10 stereogenic carbons and several points of distinct substitution has made the total synthesis of erythromycin A a formidable task. Complete syntheses of erythromycins’ related structures and precursors such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B have been accomplished, giving way to possible syntheses of different erythromycins and other macrolide antimicrobials. Woodward successfully completed the synthesis of erythromycin A, which was published in 1981. == History == In 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer at Eli Lilly. Aguilar managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of Streptomyces erythreus (designation changed to Saccharopolyspora erythraea) found in the samples. Aguilar received no further credit or compensation for his discovery. The scientist was allegedly promised a trip to the company's manufacturing plant in Indianapolis, but it was never fulfilled. In a letter to the company's president, Aguilar wrote: “A leave of absence is all I ask as I do not wish to sever my connection with a great company which has given me wonderful breaks in life.” The request was not granted. Aguilar reached out to Eli Lilly again in 1993, requesting royalties from sales of the drug over the years, intending to use them to put up a foundation for poor and sickly Filipinos. This request was also denied. He died in September of the same year. Lilly filed for patent protection on the compound which was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the Philippine region of Iloilo where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin. The antibiotic clarithromycin was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin. == Society and culture == === Economics === It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, in 2014, the price increased to seven dollars per 500mg tablet. The US price of erythromycin rose three times between 2010 and 2015, from 24 cents per 500mg tablet in 2010 to $8.96 in 2015. In 2017, a Kaiser Health News study found that the per-unit cost of dozens of generics doubled or even tripled from 2015 to 2016, increasing spending by the Medicaid program. Due to price increases by drug manufacturers, Medicaid paid on average $2,685,330 more for Erythromycin in 2016 compared to 2015 (not including rebates). In the US by 2018, generic drug prices had climbed another 5% on average. The UK price listed in the BNF for erythromycin 500mg tablets was £36.40 for 100 tablets (36.4 pence each) as of August 2024. This price is not paid by NHS patients: there is no NHS prescription charge in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; while NHS patients in England without an exemption are liable for a flat rate prescription charge. As of May 2024, that charge was £9.90 for each prescribed medicine. === Brand names === Brand names include Robimycin, E-Mycin, E.E.S. Granules, E.E.S.-200, E.E.S.-400, E.E.S.-400 Filmtab, Erymax, Ery-Tab, Eryc, Ranbaxy, Erypar, EryPed, Eryped 200, Eryped 400, Erythrocin Stearate Filmtab, Erythrocot, E-Base, Erythroped, Ilosone, MY-E, Pediamycin, Zineryt, Abboticin, Abboticin-ES, Erycin, PCE Dispertab, Stiemycine, Acnasol, and Tiloryth. == Veterinary uses == Erythromycin is also used in fishcare for the ""broad spectrum treatment and control of bacterial disease"". Body slime, mouth fungus, furunculosis, bacterial gill illness, and hemorrhagic septicaemia are all examples of bacterial diseases in fish that may be treated and controlled with this therapy. The usage of Erythromycin in fishcare is mainly limited to therapies targeting gram-positive bacteria. == References ==",Erythromycin estolate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010191874753218144), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019374187104403973)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

3220,"('Genistein', 'Prunetol', 'Genisterin', 'Genisteol', 'Sophoricol')","Food, Medical","Genistein (C15H10O5) is a naturally occurring compound that structurally belongs to a class of compounds known as isoflavones. It is described as an angiogenesis inhibitor and a phytoestrogen. It was first isolated in 1899 from the dyer's broom, Genista tinctoria; hence, the chemical name. The compound structure was established in 1926, when it was found to be identical with that of prunetol. It was chemically synthesized in 1928. It has been shown to be the primary secondary metabolite of the Trifolium species and Glycine max. == Natural occurrences == Isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein are found in a number of plants including lupin, fava beans, soybeans, kudzu, and psoralea being the primary food source, also in the medicinal plants, Flemingia vestita and F. macrophylla, and coffee. It can also be found in Maackia amurensis cell cultures. == Biological effects == Besides functioning as an antioxidant and anthelmintic, many isoflavones have been shown to interact with animal and human estrogen receptors, causing effects in the body similar to those caused by the hormone estrogen. Isoflavones also produce non-hormonal effects. === Molecular function === Genistein influences multiple biochemical functions in living cells: full agonist of ERβ (EC50 = 7.62 nM) and, to a much lesser extent (~20-fold), full agonist or partial agonist of ERα agonist of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (affinity of 133 nM) activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) inhibition of several tyrosine kinases inhibition of topoisomerase inhibition of AAAD direct antioxidation with some pro oxidative features activation of Nrf2 antioxidative response stimulation of autophagy inhibition of the mammalian hexose transporter GLUT1 contraction of several types of smooth muscles modulation of CFTR channel, potentiating its opening at low concentration and inhibiting it a higher doses. inhibition of cytosine methylation inhibition of DNA methyltransferase inhibition of the glycine receptor inhibition of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor === Activation of PPARs === Isoflavones genistein and daidzein bind to and transactivate all three PPAR isoforms, α, δ, and γ. For example, membrane-bound PPARγ-binding assay showed that genistein can directly interact with the PPARγ ligand binding domain and has a measurable Ki of 5.7 mM. Gene reporter assays showed that genistein at concentrations between 1 and 100 uM activated PPARs in a dose dependent way in KS483 mesenchymal progenitor cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells, T47D cells and MDA-MD-231 cells, murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, endothelial cells and in Hela cells. Several studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influenced each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dose-dependent way. The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions. === Tyrosine kinase inhibitor === The main known activity of genistein is tyrosine kinase inhibitor, mostly of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Tyrosine kinases are less widespread than their ser/thr counterparts but implicated in almost all cell growth and proliferation signal cascades. === Redox-active—not only antioxidant === Genistein may act as direct antioxidant, similar to many other isoflavones, and thus may alleviate damaging effects of free radicals in tissues. The same molecule of genistein, similar to many other isoflavones, by generation of free radicals poison topoisomerase II, an enzyme important for maintaining DNA stability. Human cells turn on beneficial, detoxifying Nrf2 factor in response to genistein insult. This pathway may be responsible for observed health maintaining properties of small doses of genistein. === Anthelmintic === The root-tuber peel extract of the leguminous plant Flemingia vestita is the traditional anthelmintic of the Khasi tribes of India. While investigating its anthelmintic activity, genistein was found to be the major isoflavone responsible for the deworming property. Genistein was subsequently demonstrated to be highly effective against intestinal parasites such as the poultry cestode Raillietina echinobothrida, the pork trematode Fasciolopsis buski, and the sheep liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. It exerts its anthelmintic activity by inhibiting the enzymes of glycolysis and glycogenolysis, and disturbing the Ca2+ homeostasis and NO activity in the parasites. It has also been investigated in human tapeworms such as Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus metacestodes that genistein and its derivatives, Rm6423 and Rm6426, are potent cestocides. === Atherosclerosis === Genistein protects against pro-inflammatory factor-induced vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction and inhibits leukocyte-endothelium interaction, thereby modulating vascular inflammation, a major event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. === Cancer links === Genistein and other isoflavones have been identified as angiogenesis inhibitors, and found to inhibit the uncontrolled cell growth of cancer, most likely by inhibiting the activity of substances in the body that regulate cell division and cell survival (growth factors). Various studies have found that moderate doses of genistein have inhibitory effects on cancers of the prostate, cervix, brain, breast and colon. It has also been shown that genistein makes some cells more sensitive to radio-therapy; although, timing of phytoestrogen use is also important. Genistein's chief method of activity is as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases are less widespread than their ser/thr counterparts but implicated in almost all cell growth and proliferation signal cascades. Inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II also plays an important role in the cytotoxic activity of genistein. The observation that transition of normal lymphocytes from quiescence (G0) to the G1 phase of the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to genistein prompted the authors to suggest that this isoflavone may be potential immunosuppressant. Genistein has been used to selectively target pre B-cells via conjugation with an anti-CD19 antibody. Studies on rodents have found genistein to be useful in the treatment of leukemia, and that it can be used in combination with certain other antileukemic drugs to improve their efficacy. === Estrogen receptor — more cancer links === Due to its structure similarity to 17β-estradiol (estrogen), genistein can compete with it and bind to estrogen receptors. However, genistein shows much higher affinity toward estrogen receptor β than toward estrogen receptor α. Data from in vitro and in vivo research confirms that genistein can increase rate of growth of some ER expressing breast cancers. Genistein was found to increase the rate of proliferation of estrogen-dependent breast cancer when not cotreated with an estrogen antagonist. It was also found to decrease efficiency of tamoxifen and letrozole - drugs commonly used in breast cancer therapy. Genistein was found to inhibit immune response towards cancer cells allowing their survival. === Effects in males === Isoflavones can act like estrogen, stimulating development and maintenance of female characteristics, or they can block cells from using cousins of estrogen. In vitro studies have shown genistein to induce apoptosis of testicular cells at certain levels, thus raising concerns about effects it could have on male fertility; however, one study found that isoflavones had ""no observable effect on endocrine measurements, testicular volume or semen parameters over the study period."" in healthy males given isoflavone supplements daily over a 2-month period. === Carcinogenic and toxic potential === Genistein was, among other flavonoids, found to be a strong topoisomerase inhibitor, similarly to some chemotherapeutic anticancer drugs ex. etoposide and doxorubicin. In high doses it was found to be strongly toxic to normal cells. This effect may be responsible for both anticarcinogenic and carcinogenic potential of the substance. It was found to deteriorate DNA of cultured blood stem cells, which may lead to leukemia. Genistein among other flavonoids is suspected to increase risk of infant leukemia when consumed during pregnancy. === Sanfilippo syndrome treatment === Genistein decreases pathological accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in Sanfilippo syndrome. In vitro animal studies and clinical experiments suggest that the symptoms of the disease may be alleviated by adequate dose of genistein. Genistein was found to also possess toxic properties toward brain cells.

It was designed for increased oral bioavailability over gabapentin, and human trials showed it to produce extended release of gabapentin with almost twice the overall bioavailability, especially when taken with a fatty meal. Gabapentin enacarbil has passed human clinical trials for the treatment of restless legs syndrome, and initial results have shown it to be well tolerated and reasonably effective. Gabapentin enacarbil was denied approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010, citing concerns about possible increased cancer risk shown by some animal studies. Similar concerns had been raised about gabapentin itself in the past, but were felt to be outweighed by its clinical utility as an anticonvulsant, whereas the treatment of restless legs syndrome was not seen to justify the same kind of risk. On April 6, 2011, Xenoport received FDA approval for Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome.

3222,"('Carbidopa', '(s)-carbidopa', 'Lodosyn', 'Carbidopa anhydrous', 'S-carbidopa')",Medical,"Carbidopa, sold under the brand name Lodosyn, is a medication given to people with Parkinson's disease in order to inhibit peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This property is significant in that it allows a greater proportion of administered levodopa to cross the blood–brain barrier for central nervous system effect, instead of being peripherally metabolised into substances unable to cross said barrier. == Pharmacology == Carbidopa inhibits aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase or DDC), an enzyme important in the biosynthesis of serotonin from L-tryptophan and in the biosynthesis of dopamine (DA) from L-DOPA. DDC exists both outside of (body periphery) and within the confines of the blood–brain barrier. Carbidopa is used in the treatment of, among other diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Increased dopamine availability may increase the effectiveness of the remaining neurons and alleviate symptoms for a time. The pharmacologic objective is to get an exogenous dopamine-precursor known as levodopa/L-DOPA into the dopamine-deficient brains of PD patients. Levodopa/L-DOPA can cross the blood–brain barrier, but dopamine cannot. The use of carbidopa seems counter-intuitive in Parkinson's disease (PD) in that it prevents DDC conversion of levodopa/L-DOPA to dopamine. However, exogenously provided, levadopa/L-DOPA gets metabolized peripherally to its active metabolite dopamine before reaching the blood–brain barrier. Therefore, the PD brain, which is deficient in dopamine, will not receive as much of its prodrug precursor levodopa/L-DOPA due to peripheral DDC breakdown. However, carbidopa can decrease peripheral DDC conversion of levodopa/L-DOPA before it crosses the blood–brain barrier. Carbidopa acts as a peripheral DDC inhibitor, as carbidopa, itself, cannot cross the blood–brain barrier. In other words, carbidopa has no effect on brain DDC conversion of levodopa/L-DOPA to dopamine. Ultimately, a greater proportion of the exogenously provided levodopa/L-DOPA reaches the brain. Commercially, carbidopa/levodopa combinations are available in the treatment of central dopamine deficiencies. Along with carbidopa, other DDC inhibitors are benserazide (Ro-4-4602), difluoromethyldopa, and α-methyldopa. == Pharmacology 2 == Carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 244.3. It is designated chemically as N-amino-α-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. Its empirical formula is C10H14N2O4•H2O. Used in tandem with L-DOPA (also known as levodopa, a dopamine precursor converted in the body to dopamine), it increases the plasma half-life of levodopa from 50 minutes to 1½ hours. Carbidopa cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, so it inhibits only peripheral DDC. It thus prevents the conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine peripherally. This reduces the side effects caused by dopamine on the periphery, as well as increasing the concentration of L-DOPA and dopamine in the brain. The combination of carbidopa/levodopa carries the brand names of Kinson, Sinemet, Pharmacopa and Atamet; while Stalevo is a combination with entacapone, which enhances the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa. Carbidopa is most commonly used as a method to inhibit the activity of DOPA decarboxylase. This is an enzyme that breaks down L-DOPA in the periphery and converts it to dopamine. This results in the newly formed dopamine being unable to cross the blood–brain barrier and the effectiveness of L-DOPA treatments is greatly decreased. Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid. Elimination half-life of levodopa in the presence of carbidopa is about 1.5 hours. Following SINEMET CR, the apparent half-life of levodopa may be prolonged because of continuous absorption. This is extremely useful in the treatment of Parkinsons disease symptoms because the amount of levodopa administered to the patient can be greatly reduced. This reduction in dosage is extremely useful due to the side effects that may occur from an overdose of L-DOPA within the body. Carbidopa is also used in combination with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a naturally occurring amino acid which is a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin and an intermediate in tryptophan metabolism. Carbidopa, which is used in PD to prevent conversion of the levodopa to dopamine, prevents the metabolism of 5-HTP in the liver and causes decreased levels of serotonin in the blood. Research shows that co-administration of 5-HTP and carbidopa greatly increases plasma 5-HTP levels. Several cases of scleroderma-like illness have been reported in patients using carbidopa and 5-HTP. In Europe, 5-HTP is prescribed with carbidopa to prevent the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin until it reaches the brain. == Synthesis == The synthesis begins with a modified Strecker reaction using hydrazine and potassium cyanide on arylacetone (1) to give 2. This is then hydrolyzed with cold HCl to give carboxamide 3. More vigorous hydrolysis with 48% HBr cleaves the amide bond and the aryl ether group to produce carbidopa (4). == References == == External links == Lodosyn prescribing information Sinemet datasheet for New Zealand",Carbidopa anhydrous,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.936446541454643e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024827865418046713)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/carbidopa.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Carbidopa Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/carbidopa.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3223,"('Icariin', 'Ieariline', 'Icariine', 'Horny goat weed', 'Icariin;')",Medical,"Epimedium, also known as barrenwort, bishop's hat, fairy wings, horny goat weed, or yin yang huo (Chinese: 淫羊藿; pinyin: Yínyánghùo; Wade–Giles: Yin²-yang²-huo⁴), is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. The majority of the species are endemic to China, with smaller numbers elsewhere in Asia, and a few in the Mediterranean region. Epimedium species are deciduous or evergreen hardy perennials. The majority have four-parted ""spider-like"" flowers in spring. The species used as a dietary supplement is Epimedium grandiflorum. It contains icariin, which is a weak PDE5 inhibitor, in vitro. Its clinical effects are unknown. While there is little clinical evidence to date, as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil – sold under the brand names Viagra, Levitra and Cialis – are all based on (stronger) PDE5 inhibitory action, it is thought to have erectogenic properties and is found in some men's sexual health supplements. == Description == Species of Epimedium are herbaceous perennials, growing from an underground rhizome. Their growth habits are somewhat variable. Some have solitary stems, others have a ""tufted"" habit, with multiple stems growing close together. There may be several leaves to a stem or the leaves may be solitary, produced from the base of the plant. Individual leaves are generally compound, often with three leaflets, but also with more. Leaflets usually have spiny margins. The leaves may be annual, making the plant deciduous, or longer lasting, so that the plant is evergreen. The inflorescence is an open raceme or panicle, the number of flowers varying by species. Individual flowers have parts in fours. There are four smaller outer sepals, usually greenish and shed when the flower opens. Moving inwards, these are followed by four larger petal-like inner sepals, often brightly coloured. Inside the sepals are four true petals. These may be small and flat, but often have a complex shape including a nectar-producing ""spur"" that may be longer than the sepals. There are four stamens. One of the common names for the genus, bishop's hat, arises from the shape of the flowers, particularly where the spurs are longer than the sepals. == Taxonomy == The genus was given its name by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in describing the European species E. alpinum. The name is a Latinized version of a Greek name for an unidentifiable plant, epimedion, that is mentioned in Pliny's Natural History (xxvii.57). The meaning of the original name is unclear. Accepted species (65) === Hybrids === Some artificial hybrids are cultivated in gardens. These include: E. × cantabrigiense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pubigerum E. × perralchicum Stearn, hybrid between E. perralderianum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum E. × rubrum Morr., hybrid between E. alpinum and E. grandiflorum E. × versicolor Morr., hybrid between E. grandiflorum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum E. × warleyense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum E. × youngianum Fisch & C.A.Mey, hybrid between E. diphyllum and E. grandiflorum == Cultivation == Some varieties and hybrids have been in Western cultivation for the last 100 to 150 years. There is now a wide array of new Chinese species being cultivated in the West, many of which have only recently been discovered, and some of which have yet to be named. There are also many older Japanese hybrids and forms, extending the boundaries of the genus in cultivation. The majority of the Chinese species have not been fully tested for hardiness nor indeed for any other aspect of their culture. The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation. The cultivar 'Amber Queen' is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. === Propagation === While they can be successfully propagated in early spring, epimediums are best divided in late summer, with the aim of promoting rapid re-growth of roots and shoots before the onset of winter. Several breeders (in particular Darrell Diano Probst, Tim Branney & Robin White) have also undertaken their own hybridization programmes with the genus. Various new nursery selections are gradually appearing in the horticulture trade, the best of which extend the colour and shape range of the flowers available to the gardener. == Chemistry == Epimedium wushanense contains a number of flavonoids. 37 compounds were characterized from the underground and aerial parts of the plant. Among them, 28 compounds were prenylflavonoids. The predominant flavonoid, epimedin C, ranged from 1.4 to 5.1% in aerial parts and 1.0 to 2.8% in underground parts. == Citations == == General and cited references == == External links == Media related to Epimedium at Wikimedia Commons Data related to Epimedium at Wikispecies",Horny goat weed,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0481133870780468), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.004080897197127342), (' PERSONAL', -0.0009368319297209382), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4679127633571625), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011566719971597195)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -4.961759259458631e-06), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.31326761841773987), (' MED', -0.008627460338175297), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('INFO; ([opss.org](https://www.opss.org/article/horny-goat-weed-dietary-supplements?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5644024/?utm_source=openai), [medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/699.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=283, start_index=6, title='Horny Goat Weed in Dietary Supplements', type='url_citation', url='https://www.opss.org/article/horny-goat-weed-dietary-supplements?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=283, start_index=6, title='Icariin, an Anti-atherosclerotic Drug from Chinese Medicinal Herb Horny Goat Weed - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5644024/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=283, start_index=6, title='Horny Goat Weed: MedlinePlus Supplements', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/699.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It was patented in 1996 and approved for medical use in 2002. == Approval == In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a letter of non-approval for parecoxib in the United States. No reasons were ever documented publicly for the non-approval, although one study noted increased occurrences of heart attacks following cardiac bypass surgery compared to placebo when high doses of parecoxib were used to control pain after surgery. Importantly, rare but severe allergic reactions (Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Lyell syndrome) have been described with valdecoxib, the molecule to which parecoxib is converted. The drug is not approved for use after cardiac surgery in Europe. All anti-inflammatory medications in the US carry the same warning regarding skin reactions, and none are approved for use during CABG surgery, so the reason for the FDA denying the approval of parecoxib remains unknown, but was likely related to political pressure from the US Congress to not approve another COX-2 selective inhibitor in the wake of the Vioxx affair. No COX-2 selective inhibitor has been approved in the US since that time, regardless of the safety profile of parecoxib in Europe. Efforts to find out the scientific rationale, or more likely the lack thereof, that the FDA used to justify the non-approval of parecoxib in the USA have proven futile due to secrecy issues. The political motivation to not approve parecoxib was further supported by a 2017 pooled analysis of safety data in 28 published studies, which showed after 69,567,300 units of parecoxib, skin rash and cardiac complications were minimal, if at all, different from placebo. Parecoxib, along with other COX-2 selective inhibitors, celecoxib, valdecoxib, and mavacoxib, were discovered by a team at the Searle division of Monsanto led by John Talley. Parecoxib is the first parenteral COX-2 selective inhibitor available for clinical use in pain management.

3225,"('Deferiprone', 'Ferriprox', 'Deferiprone (inn)', 'Ferriprox (tn)', 'Deferidone')",Medical,"Deferiprone, sold under the brand name Ferriprox among others, is a medication that chelates iron and is used to treat iron overload in thalassaemia major. It was first approved and indicated for use in treating thalassaemia major in 1994 and had been licensed for use in the European Union for many years while awaiting approval in Canada and in the United States. On 14 October 2011, it was approved for use in the US under the FDA's accelerated approval program. The most common side effects include red-brown urine (showing that iron is being removed through the urine), nausea (feeling sick), abdominal pain (stomach ache) and vomiting. Less common but more serious side effects are agranulocytosis (very low levels of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell) and neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infections). == Medical uses == Deferiprone monotherapy is indicated in the European Union for the treatment of iron overload in those with thalassaemia major when current chelation therapy is contraindicated or inadequate. Deferiprone in combination with another chelator is indicated in the European Union in those with thalassaemia major when monotherapy with any iron chelator is ineffective, or when prevention or treatment of life-threatening consequences of iron overload (mainly cardiac overload) justifies rapid or intensive correction. The researchers found that the oral drug, deferiprone, reactivates the “altruistic suicide response” of an HIV-infected cell, killing the HIV RNA it carries. Effective suppression of HIV-1 generation and induction of apoptosis both require deferiprone at a concentration around 150 μM in infected T-cell lines. Since a 0.5 log10 decrement in HIV-1 RNA corresponds to an additional 2 years of AIDS-free survival and a 0.3 log10 decrement reduces the annual risk of progression to AIDS-related death by 25%, the measurements suggested biological significance. == Controversy == Deferiprone was at the center of a protracted struggle between Nancy Olivieri, a Canadian haematologist and researcher, and the Hospital for Sick Children and the pharmaceutical company Apotex, that started in 1996, and delayed approval of the drug in North America. Olivieri's data suggested that deferiprone can lead to progressive liver failure. == History == Deferiprone was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 1999. It was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2011. Generic versions were approved in August 2019. The safety and effectiveness of deferiprone is based on an analysis of data from twelve clinical studies in 236 participants. Participants in the study did not respond to prior iron chelation therapy. Deferiprone was considered a successful treatment for participants who experienced at least a 20 percent decrease in serum ferritin, a protein that stores iron in the body for later use. Half of the participants in the study experienced at least a 20 percent decrease in ferritin levels. == References ==",Ferriprox,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.764281842042692e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004468158003874123)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/ferriprox.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Ferriprox: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/ferriprox.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3228,"('Rimantadine (hydrochloride)', 'Rimantadine', 'Alpha-methyl-1-adamantanemethylamine', 'Alpha-methyladamantanemethylamine', '.alpha.-methyladamantanemethylamine')",Medical,"Rimantadine (INN, sold under the trade name Flumadine) is an orally administered antiviral drug used to treat, and in rare cases prevent, influenzavirus A infection. When taken within one to two days of developing symptoms, rimantadine can shorten the duration and moderate the severity of influenza. Rimantadine can mitigate symptoms, including fever. Both rimantadine and the similar drug amantadine are derivates of adamantane. Rimantadine is found to be more effective than amantadine because when used the patient displays fewer symptoms. Rimantadine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994. Rimantadine was approved for medical use in 1993. Seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to rimantadine, and it is no longer recommended to prescribe for treatment of the flu. == Medical uses == === Influenza A === Rimantadine inhibits influenza activity by binding to amino acids in the M2 transmembrane channel and blocking proton transport across the M2 channel. Rimantadine is believed to inhibit influenza's viral replication, possibly by preventing the uncoating of the virus's protective shells, which are the envelope and capsid. The M2 channel is known to be responsible for viral replication in the influenza virus. Genetic studies suggest that the virus M2 protein, an ion channel specified by virion M2 gene, plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine. Rimantadine is bound inside the pore to amantadine specific amino acid binding sites with hydrogen binding and van der Waals interactions. The ammonium group (with neighboring water molecules) is positioned towards the C terminus with the amantadane group is positioned towards the N-terminus when bound inside the M2 pore. ==== Influenza resistance ==== Resistance to rimantadine can occur as a result of amino acid substitutions at certain locations in the transmembrane region of M2. This prevents binding of the antiviral to the channel. The mutation S31N binding site with rimantadine is shown in the image to the left. It shows rimantadine binding into lumenal (top) or peripheral (bottom) binding sites with influenza M2 channel Serine 31 (gold) or Asparagine 31 (blue). ==== Rimantadine enantiomers interactions with M2 ==== Rimantadine, when sold as flumadine, is present as a racemic mixture; the R and S states are both present in the drug. Solid state NMR studies have shown that the R enantiomer has a stronger binding affinity to the M2 channel pore than the S-enantiomer of rimantadine. Antiviral assay and electrophysiology studies show that there is no significant difference between the R and S enantiomers in binding affinity to amino acids in the M2 channel. Since the enantiomers have similar binding affinity, they also have similar ability to block the channel pore and work as an effective antiviral. Rimantadine enantiomers R and S are pictured interacting with the M2 pore below to the right. This image shows that there is not a significant modeled difference between the R and S enantiomers. === Parkinson's disease === Rimantadine, like its antiviral cousin amantadine, possesses antiparkinsonian activity and can be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, in general, neither rimantadine nor amantadine is a preferred agent for this therapy and would be reserved for cases of the disease that are less responsive to front-line treatments. === Others === Rimantadine is shown to be effective against other RNA-containing viruses. It can treat arboviruses like Saint Louis encephalitis and Sindbis. Other viruses that can be treated with Rimantadine include respiratory synctial and parainfluenza viruses. Rimantadine has also been shown to treat chronic hepatitis C. == Side effects == Rimantadine can produce gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects. Approximately 6% of patients (compared to 4% of patients taking a placebo) reported side-effects at a dosage of 200 mg/d. Common side effects include: Nausea Upset stomach Nervousness Tiredness Lightheadedness Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Difficulty concentrating Confusion Rimantadine shows fewer CNS symptoms than its sister drug amantadine. == Interactions == Taking paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) while taking rimantadine is known to reduce the body's uptake of rimantadine by approximately 12%. Cimetidine also affects the body's uptake of rimantadine. Taking anticholinergic drugs with amantadine may increase underlying seizure disorders and aggravate congestive heart failure. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The related drugs memantine and to a much lesser extent amantadine are known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists. The affinity of rimantadine for the NMDA receptor does not seem to have been reported. Analogues of rimantadine are known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === 1-carboxyadamatanones are reduced with sodium borohydride to create racemic hydroxy acid. Excess methyllithium is then added to create methyl ketones which when reduced with lithium aluminum hydride gives the amine group. The synthesis pictured to the left is a synthesis of rimantadine as synthesized in Europe. == History == Rimantadine was discovered in 1963 and patented in 1965 in the US by William W. Prichard in Du Pont & Co., Wilmington, Delaware (patent on new chemical compound U.S. patent 3,352,912, 1965 and on the first method of synthesis U.S. patent 3,592,934, 1967).

3229,"('Zonisamide', 'Ad 810', 'Ci 912', 'Zonegran', 'Exceglan')",Medical,"Zonisamide, sold under the brand name Zonegran among others, is a medication used to treat the symptoms of epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Chemically it is a sulfonamide. It serves as an anticonvulsant used primarily as an adjunctive therapy in adults with Parkinson's disease, partial-onset seizures; infantile spasm, mixed seizure types of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic and generalized tonic clonic seizure. Despite this it is also sometimes used as a monotherapy for partial-onset seizures. In 2020, it was the 276th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Epilepsy === Zonisamide is approved in the United States, and United Kingdom for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults and Japan for both adjunctive and monotherapy for partial seizures (simple, complex, secondarily generalized), generalized (tonic, tonic-clonic (grand mal), and atypical absence) and combined seizures. In Australia it is marketed as both an adjunctive therapy and monotherapy for partial seizures only. === Parkinson's disease === It has been approved for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), as an adjunct to levodopa, in a few countries such as Japan. In Japan, zonisamide has been used as an adjunct to levodopa treatment since 2009. In addition, there is clinical evidence that zonisamide in combination with levodopa control of motor symptoms of PD but evidence for the treatment of the non motor symptoms of PD lacking. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects by incidence: Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include: Incidence unknown Reproductive toxic effects === Interactions === Zonisamide and other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide have been known to interfere with amobarbital, which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. Zonisamide may also interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis. Additionally, the metabolism of zonisamide is inhibited by ketoconazole, ciclosporin, miconazole, fluconazole and carbamazepine (in descending order of inhibition) due to their effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme. Zonisamide is not known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes when present at therapeutic concentrations. == Mechanism of action == Zonisamide is an antiseizure drug chemically classified as a sulfonamide and unrelated to other antiseizure agents. The precise mechanism by which zonisamide exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although it is believed that the drug blocks sodium and T-type calcium channels, which leads to the suppression of neuronal hypersynchronization (that is, seizure-form activity). It is also known to be a weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (similarly to the anticonvulsant topiramate). It is also known to modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Variable, yet relatively rapid rate of absorption with a time to peak concentration of 2.8–3.9 hours. Bioavailability is close to 100% and food has no effect on the bioavailability of zonisamide but may affect the rate of absorption. === Metabolism === Zonisamide is metabolized mostly by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, but also CYP3A7 and CYP3A5, to 2-(sulphamoylacetyl)-phenol via reductive cleavage of the 1,2-benzisoxazole ring. == History == Zonisamide was discovered by Uno and colleagues in 1972 and launched by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma (formerly Dainippon Pharmaceutical) in 1989 as Excegran in Japan. It was marketed by Élan in the United States starting in 2000 as Zonegran, before Élan transferred their interests in zonisamide to Eisai Co., Ltd. in 2004. Eisai also markets Zonegran in Asia (China, Taiwan, and fourteen others) and Europe (starting in Germany and the United Kingdom). == Research == === Tardive dyskinesia === In an open-label trial zonisamide attenuated the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. === Obesity === It has also been studied for obesity with significant positive effects on body weight loss and there are three ongoing clinical trials for this indication. It was to be sold, when combined with bupropion, under the brand name Empatic, until its development was discontinued. === Migraine === Zonisamide has been studied for and used as a migraine preventative medication, when topiramate is either ineffective or cannot be continued due to side effects. === Bipolar depression === It has also been used off-label by psychiatrists as a mood stabilizer to treat bipolar depression. == References ==",Exceglan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.008129963040119e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06750839203596115), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1275348663330078)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3230,"('Deferoxamine (mesylate)', 'Desferrioxamine b mesylate', 'Deferoxamine', 'Desferrioxamine b', 'Deferoxamine b')",Medical,"Deferoxamine (DFOA), also known as desferrioxamine and sold under the brand name Desferal, is a medication that binds iron and aluminium. It is specifically used in iron overdose, hemochromatosis either due to multiple blood transfusions or an underlying genetic condition, and aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis. It is used by injection into a muscle, vein, or under the skin. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, hearing loss, and eye problems. Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and low blood pressure may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. Deferoxamine is a siderophore from the bacteria Streptomyces pilosus. Deferoxamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Deferoxamine is used to treat acute iron poisoning, especially in small children. This agent is also frequently used to treat hemochromatosis, a disease of iron accumulation that can be either genetic or acquired. Acquired hemochromatosis is common in patients with certain types of chronic anemia (e.g. thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) who require many blood transfusions, which can greatly increase the amount of iron in the body. Treatment with iron-chelating drugs such as deferoxamine reduces mortality in persons with sickle cell disease or β‐thalassemia who are transfusion dependent. Administration for chronic conditions is generally accomplished by subcutaneous injection over a period of 8–12 hours each day. Administration of deferoxamine after acute intoxication may color the urine a pinkish red, a phenomenon termed ""vin rosé urine"". Apart from iron toxicity, deferoxamine can be used to treat aluminium toxicity (an excess of aluminium in the body) in selected patients. In US, the drug is not FDA-approved for this use. Deferoxamine is also used to minimize doxorubicin's cardiotoxic side effects and in the treatment of patients with aceruloplasminemia. Deferoxamine may be effective for improving neurologic outcomes in persons with intracranial hemorrhage, although the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety for this indication was weak. Some published manuscripts suggesting the use of deferoxamine for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 because of the high level of ferritin among them. == Adverse effects == It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Chronic use of deferoxamine may increase the risk of hearing loss in patients with thalassemia major. Chronic use of deferoxamine may cause ocular symptoms, growth retardation, local reactions and allergy. == Mechanism == Deferoxamine is produced by removal of the trivalent iron moiety from ferrioxamine B, an iron-bearing sideramine produced by the actinomycetes, Streptomyces pilosus. Its discovery was a serendipitous result of research conducted by scientists at Ciba in collaboration with scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the University Hospital in Freiburg, Germany Deferoxamine acts by binding free iron in the bloodstream and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron from persons with hemochromatosis, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver. Also, it speeds healing of nerve damage (and minimizes the extent of recent nerve trauma). Deferoxamine may modulate expression and release of inflammatory mediators by specific cell types. == Research == Deferoxamine is being studied as a treatment for spinal cord injury and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is also used to induce hypoxia-like environment in mesenchymal stem cells. Since the terminal amine group of Deferoxamine does not participate in metal chelation, it has been used to immobilize Deferoxamine to surfaces and substrates for various industrial and biomedical applications. == See also == Chelation therapy == References ==",Deferoxamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.0278701160568744e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008640049956738949)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferoxamine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Deferoxamine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferoxamine?utm_source=openai')])"

3233,"('Topotecan (hydrochloride)', 'Topotecan', 'Topotecan lactone', 'Hycamptamine', 'Hycamptin')",Medical,"Topotecan, sold under the brand name Hycamtin among others, is a chemotherapeutic agent medication that is a topoisomerase inhibitor. It is a synthetic, water-soluble analog of the natural chemical compound camptothecin. It is used in the form of its hydrochloride salt to treat ovarian cancer, lung cancer and other cancer types. After GlaxoSmithKline received final FDA approval for topotecan on 15 October 2007, it became the first topoisomerase I inhibitor for oral use. == Uses == Ovarian cancer (FDA May 1996). Cervical cancer (FDA June 2006). Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (FDA Oct 2007). === Experimental uses === As of 2016, experiments were under way for Neuroblastoma, Brainstem glioma, Ewing's sarcoma and Angelman's syndrome. In addition, topotecan is experimentally treating Non-small cell lung cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Breast cancer, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Endometrial cancer, and Oligodendroglioma. === Angelman's syndrome === Angelman's syndrome is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delays, seizures, speech impairments and physical impairments. It is an epigenetic disease and other treatments focus on symptoms. It is caused by a deletion or mutation of the maternal allele for the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A. UBE3A is expressed in most body tissues. However, in neurons only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed. UBE3A is located on chromosome 15 and the paternal copy for the gene is genetically imprinted and is silenced by an antisense RNA transcript. The maternal copy control center of the gene is methylated, suppressing transcription in the antisense direction while the paternal copy control center is unmethylated. Treatment involves unsilencing the paternal allele allowing the normal paternal UBE3A allele to be transcribed. UBE3A, in normal function, adds ubiquitin chains to proteins to target unnecessary or damaged proteins for degradation by the proteasome. 16 topoisomerase inhibitors unsilence paternal UBE3A. Topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate the unwinding of DNA. Of these 16 inhibitors, topotecan was found to induce the strongest upregulation of UBE3A. The enzymes bind to the DNA and cut the phosphate backbone, allowing the DNA to be unwound. Topotecan unsilences the paternal UBE2A allele by reducing the transcription of an antisense transcript. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase I restoring UBE3A levels to wild-type range in cultured mince neurons. Transgenic mice with a fluorescently tagged UBE3A were used to test the effectiveness of unsilencing the paternal copy. When tested on mice in vivo, topotecan affected the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex but not the cerebellum unless a higher dose was administered (21.6 micrograms/hour for five days). The study suggested that the topoisomerase inhibitors have the potential to produce a normally functioning UBE3A protein. Most symptoms due to Angelman's syndrome are traditionally treated by speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Anti-seizure medication is often prescribed as seizures are a common symptom of Angelman's syndrome. These treatments target only symptoms. This drug has been administered to cancer patients. It was well tolerated when administered to pediatric and adult patients. == Mechanism of action == Topotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecin is a natural product extracted from the bark of the tree Camptotheca acuminata. Topoisomerase-I is a nuclear enzyme that relieves torsional strain in DNA by opening single strand breaks. Once topoisomerase-I creates a single strand break, the DNA can rotate in front of the advancing replication fork. In physiological environments, topotecan is in equilibrium with its inactive carboxylate form. Topotecan's active lactone form intercalates between DNA bases in the topoisomerase-I cleavage complex. The binding of topotecan in the cleavage complex prevents topoisomerase-I from religating the nicked DNA strand after relieving the strain. This intercalation therefore traps the topoisomerase-I in the cleavage complex bound to the DNA. When the replication-fork collides with the trapped topoisomerase-I, DNA damage occurs. The unbroken DNA strand breaks and mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks. The accumulation of trapped topoisomerase-I complexes is a known response to apoptotic stimuli. This disruption prevents DNA replication and ultimately leads to cell death. This process leads to breaks in the DNA strand resulting in apoptosis. Administration of topotecan down-regulates its target, topoisomerase-I; therefore, it is dosed to maximize efficacy and minimize related toxicity. Topotecan is often given in combination with paclitaxel as first line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. == Side effects == Myelosuppression, specifically neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and constipation Increased susceptibility to infections Asthenia == Generic versions == Two generic versions have been approved in the European Union.

It is also being studied for possible treatment of breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. == Medical uses == Bazedoxifene is used in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Osteoporosis represents a major public health concern, especially as the number of postmenopausal women continues to rise. As a result, the need for innovative treatments has become increasingly important. Bazedoxifene (BZA) has emerged as a promising option for postmenopausal osteoporosis due to its demonstrated effectiveness in reducing bone loss and fractures, as well as its strong safety and tolerability profile. For women who cannot or prefer not to use bisphosphonates, owing to gastrointestinal side effects, safety risks, or contraindications, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like BZA may serve as a suitable alternative. SERMs may also benefit younger women who are at higher risk of fractures and require long-term treatment.

It is a component of the peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), which itself is a component of coenzyme A. β-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid. === Precursor of carnosine === β-Alanine is the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, which is to say carnosine levels are limited by the amount of available β-alanine, not histidine. Supplementation with β-alanine has been shown to increase the concentration of carnosine in muscles, decrease fatigue in athletes, and increase total muscular work done. Simply supplementing with carnosine is not as effective as supplementing with β-alanine alone since carnosine, when taken orally, is broken down during digestion to its components, histidine and β-alanine. Hence, by weight, only about 40% of the dose is available as β-alanine. Because β-alanine dipeptides are not incorporated into proteins, they can be stored at relatively high concentrations. Occurring at 17–25 mmol/kg (dry muscle), carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is an important intramuscular buffer, constituting 10-20% of the total buffering capacity in type I and II muscle fibres. In carnosine, the pKa of the imidazolium group is 6.83, which is ideal for buffering. === Receptors === Even though much weaker than glycine (and, thus, with a debated role as a physiological transmitter), β-alanine is an agonist next in activity to the cognate ligand glycine itself, for strychnine-sensitive inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) (the agonist order: glycine ≫ β-alanine > taurine ≫ alanine, L-serine > proline). β-alanine has five known receptor sites, including GABA-A, GABA-C a co-agonist site (with glycine) on NMDA receptors, the aforementioned GlyR site, and blockade of GAT protein-mediated glial GABA uptake, making it a putative ""small molecule neurotransmitter."" == Athletic performance enhancement == There is evidence that β-alanine supplementation can increase exercise and cognitive performance, for some sporting modalities, and exercises within a 0.5–10 min time frame. β-alanine is converted within muscle cells into carnosine, which acts as a buffer for the lactic acid produced during high-intensity exercises, and helps delay the onset of neuromuscular fatigue. Ingestion of β-alanine can cause paraesthesia, reported as a tingling sensation, in a dose-dependent fashion. Aside from this, no important adverse effect of β-alanine has been reported, however, there is also no information on the effects of its long-term usage or its safety in combination with other supplements, and caution on its use has been advised. Furthermore, many studies have failed to test for the purity of the supplements used and check for the presence of banned substances. == Metabolism == β-Alanine can undergo a transamination reaction with pyruvate to form malonate-semialdehyde and L-alanine. The malonate semialdehyde can then be converted into malonate via malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Malonate is then converted into malonyl-CoA and enter fatty acid biosynthesis. Alternatively, β-alanine can be diverted into pantothenic acid and coenzyme A biosynthesis. == References == == External links == KEGG map of β-alanine metabolism Archived 2009-03-02 at the Wayback Machine",Beta alanine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.029830902814865112), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.00043102685594931245), (' FOOD', -0.13634097576141357), (',', -0.005241225939244032), (' PERSONAL', -0.010141338221728802), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.6942620873451233), (' INDUSTR', -0.02054644376039505), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.2921895682811737), ('OD', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.0007256020326167345), ('ĠEND', -0.7503109574317932), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', 0.0), (',', -0.313312292098999), ('ĠMED', -0.6100372076034546), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16025547683238983)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.038100466132164), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.0016639928799122572), (',', -0.00861468818038702), (' PERSONAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-015-0090-y,https://www.americaninternationalfoods.com/ingredient-categories/amino-acids/beta-alanine/,https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/beta-alanine ', [])"
3236,"('Streptomycin (sulfate)', 'Streptomycin', 'Streptomycin a', 'Strepcen', 'Gerox')",Medical,"Streptomycin is an antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, endocarditis, brucellosis, Burkholderia infection, plague, tularemia, and rat bite fever. For active tuberculosis it is often given together with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. It is administered by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include vertigo, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. Use during pregnancy may result in permanent deafness in the developing baby. Use appears to be safe while breastfeeding. It is not recommended in people with myasthenia gravis or other neuromuscular disorders. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside. It works by blocking the ability of 30S ribosomal subunits to make proteins, which results in bacterial death. Albert Schatz first isolated streptomycin in 1943 from Streptomyces griseus. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies it as critically important for human medicine. == Uses == === Medication === Infective endocarditis: An infection of the endocardium caused by enterococcus; used when the organism is not sensitive to gentamicin Tuberculosis: Used in combination with other antibiotics. For active tuberculosis it is often given together with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. It is not the first-line treatment, except in medically under-served populations where the cost of more expensive treatments is prohibitive. It may be useful in cases where resistance to other drugs is identified. Plague (Yersinia pestis): Has historically been used as the first-line treatment. However streptomycin is approved for this purpose only by the US Food and Drug Administration. In veterinary medicine, streptomycin is the first-line antibiotic for use against gram negative bacteria in large animals (horses, cattle, sheep, etc.). It is commonly combined with procaine penicillin for intramuscular injection. Tularemia infections have been treated mostly with streptomycin. Streptomycin is traditionally given intramuscularly, and in many nations is only licensed to be administered intramuscularly, though in some regions the drug may also be administered intravenously. === Pesticide === Streptomycin also is used as a pesticide, to combat the growth of bacteria beyond human applications. Streptomycin controls bacterial diseases of certain fruit, vegetables, seed, and ornamental crops. A major use is in the control of fireblight on apple and pear trees. As in medical applications, extensive use can be associated with the development of resistant strains. Streptomycin could potentially be used to control cyanobacterial blooms in ornamental ponds and aquaria. While some antibacterial antibiotics are inhibitory to certain eukaryotes, this seems not to be the case for streptomycin, especially in the case of anti-fungal activity. === Cell culture === Streptomycin, in combination with penicillin, is used in a standard antibiotic cocktail to prevent bacterial infection in cell culture. === Protein purification === When purifying protein from a biological extract, streptomycin sulfate is sometimes added as a means of removing nucleic acids and ribonuclear proteins. Since it binds to ribosomes and precipitates out of solution, it serves as a method for removing rRNA, mRNA, and even DNA if the extract is from a prokaryote. == Side effects == The most concerning side effects, as with other aminoglycosides, are kidney toxicity and ear toxicity. Transient or permanent deafness may result. The vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII (the vestibulocochlear nerve) can be affected, resulting in tinnitus, vertigo, ataxia, kidney toxicity, and can potentially interfere with diagnosis of kidney malfunction. Common side effects include vertigo, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. Fever and rashes may result from persistent use. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. Congenital deafness has been reported in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Use appears to be okay while breastfeeding. It is not recommended in people with myasthenia gravis. == Mechanism of action == Streptomycin functions as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to the small 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit irreversibly, interfering with the binding of formyl-methionyl-tRNA to the 30S subunit. This causes codon misreading, inhibition of protein synthesis, and ultimately death of the cell through mechanisms that are not well understood. Speculation indicates that the binding of the molecule to the 30S subunit interferes with 30S subunit association with the mRNA strand. This results in an unstable ribosomal-mRNA complex, leading to premature stopping of protein synthesis, leading to cell death. As human and bacteria both have ribosomes, streptomycin has significant side effects in humans. At low concentrations, however, streptomycin inhibits only bacterial growth. Streptomycin is an antibiotic that inhibits both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and is therefore a useful broad-spectrum antibiotic. == History == Streptomycin was first isolated on October 19, 1943, by Albert Schatz, a PhD student in the laboratory of Selman Abraham Waksman at Rutgers University in a research project funded by Merck and Co. Waksman and his laboratory staff discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, and candidin. Of these, streptomycin and neomycin found extensive application in the treatment of numerous infectious diseases. Streptomycin was the first antibiotic cure for tuberculosis (TB). In 1952 Waksman was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition ""for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic active against tuberculosis"". Waksman was later accused of playing down the role of Schatz who did the work under his supervision, claiming that Elizabeth Bugie had a more important role in its development. Schatz sued both Dr. Waksman and the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation, wanting to be given credit as co-discover and to receive the royalties for the streptomycin. By the end of the settlement, Waksman would receive a 10% royalty, while Schatz got 3% and compensation for his missed royalties. The rest of the lab shared the remaining 7% of the royalties, in which Bugie received 0.2%. Bugie was pursuing a master's degree in Waksman's lab at Rutgers University at this time. Prior to this, she received her bachelor's degree in microbiology at New Jersey College for Women. Although Bugie was considered to be the second author on the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology paper, she was not listed on the patent submission. Bugie's contributions to Waksman's lab were great. In addition to her work on streptomycin, she also helped develop other antimicrobial substances, had two peer-reviewed publications, and researched the use of antimicrobials against plant pathogens, among several other important contributions to the scientific field, particularly in regard to microbiology. The Rutgers team reported streptomycin in the medical literature in January 1944. Within months they began working with William Feldman and H. Corwin Hinshaw of the Mayo Clinic with hopes of starting a human clinical trial of streptomycin in tuberculosis.: 209–241 The difficulty at first was even producing enough streptomycin to do a trial, because the research laboratory methods of creating small batches had not yet been translated to commercial large-batch production. They managed to do an animal study in a few guinea pigs with just 10 grams of the scarce drug, demonstrating survival.: 209–241 This was just enough evidence to get Merck & Co. to divert some resources from the young penicillin production program to start work toward streptomycin production.: 209–241 At the end of World War II, the United States Army experimented with streptomycin to treat life-threatening infections at a military hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan. The first person who was treated with streptomycin did not survive; the second person survived but became blind as a side effect of the treatment. In March 1946, the third person—Robert J. Dole, later Majority Leader of the United States Senate and presidential nominee—experienced a rapid and robust recovery. The first randomized trial of streptomycin against pulmonary tuberculosis was carried out in 1946 through 1948 by the MRC Tuberculosis Research Unit under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Marshall (1887–1982). The trial was neither double-blind nor placebo-controlled. It is widely accepted to have been the first randomized curative trial. Results showed efficacy against TB, albeit with minor toxicity and acquired bacterial resistance to the drug. === New Jersey === Because streptomycin was isolated from a microbe discovered on New Jersey soil, and because of its activity against tuberculosis and Gram negative organisms, and in recognition of both the microbe and the antibiotic in the history of New Jersey, S. griseus was nominated as the Official New Jersey state microbe. The draft legislation was submitted by Senator Sam Thompson (R-12) in May 2017 as bill S3190 and Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-20) in June 2017 as bill A31900. The bill was passed on 2018-01-08 The bill designates Streptomyces griseus as New Jersey State Microbe (New Jersey Senate Bill 3190 (2017).

3237,"('Solriamfetol', '(r)-2-amino-3-phenylpropyl carbamate', '(2r)-2-amino-3-phenylpropyl carbamate', 'Solriamfetol (usan)', 'Solriamfetol [usan]')",Medical,"Solriamfetol, sold under the brand name Sunosi, is a wakefulness-promoting medication used in the treatment of excessive sleepiness related to narcolepsy and sleep apnea. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of solriamfetol include headache, nausea, anxiety, and trouble sleeping. It is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and is thought to work by increasing levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. Solriamfetol has also been found to act as a TAAR1 agonist, an action that may also be involved in its effects. The drug was discovered by a subsidiary of SK Group, which licensed rights outside of eleven countries in Asia to Aerial Pharma in 2011. In addition to its approved indication of excessive sleepiness, solriamfetol is under development for certain other uses including the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), binge eating disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. == Medical uses == Solriamfetol is used to promote wakefulness in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea in adults. It appears to be more effective in improving excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea than certain other wakefulness-promoting agents including modafinil, armodafinil, and pitolisant. === Available forms === Solriamfetol is available in the form of 75 and 150 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == Side effects of solriamfetol include headache, nausea, decreased appetite, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, feeling jittery, dizziness, chest discomfort, heart palpitations, dry mouth, increased sweating, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. === Misuse potential === Solriamfetol at higher-than-approved doses—specifically doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg, which are 2 to 4 times the maximum recommended dose—produces drug-liking responses, including elevated mood and feelings of relaxation, that are similar in degree to those of phentermine (a Schedule IV controlled substance). Elevated mood occurred in 2.4% with placebo, 8 to 24% with solriamfetol, and 10 to 18% with phentermine, while feelings of relaxation occurred in 5% with placebo, 5 to 19% with solriamfetol, and 15 to 20% with phentermine. As such, solriamfetol has significant misuse potential and is a controlled substance in the United States. However, solriamfetol showed less misuse potential than Schedule II controlled stimulants like amphetamine and cocaine. Consequently, the misuse potential of solriamfetol was rated as low and it was placed in the Schedule IV controlled substance category alongside phentermine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Solriamfetol is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) with affinities (Ki) of 14.2 μM and 3.7 μM, respectively. It inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine with IC50 values of 2.9 μM and 4.4 μM, respectively. It has weak affinity for the serotonin transporter (Ki = 81.5 μM) and does not appreciably inhibit serotonin reuptake (IC50 > 100 μM). In addition to its dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, solriamfetol has been found to act as an agonist of the human and rodent TAAR1 (EC50 = 10–16 μM) at clinically relevant concentrations similar to those of its DAT and NET inhibition. Solriamfetol has no appreciable affinity for a variety of other targets, including the dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic, GABA, adenosine, histamine, orexin, benzodiazepine, and acetylcholine receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of solriamfetol is approximately 95%. The median time to peak levels of solriamfetol is 2 hours, with a range of 1.25 to 3.0 hours. A high-fat meal has minimal influence on the peak and total concentrations of solriamfetol, but does delay time to peak levels by approximately 1 hour. The apparent volume of distribution of solriamfetol is approximately 199 L. The plasma protein binding of solriamfetol is 13.3% to 19.4% over a concentration range of 0.059 to 10.1 μg/mL. Solriamfetol is minimally metabolized in humans. It shows first-order elimination with oral administration and has an elimination half-life of about 7.1 hours. The half-life of solriamfetol increases in the context of renal impairment. Approximately 95% of a dose of solriamfetol is eliminated in urine as unchanged solriamfetol and 1% or less is eliminated as the minor inactive metabolite N-acetylsolriamfetol. == Chemistry == Solriamfetol is a substituted phenethylamine derived from d-phenylalanine and D-phenylalaninol. Its chemical name is (R)-2-amino-3-phenylpropylcarbamate. It is also known as O-carbamoyl-D-phenylalaninol. == History == The drug was discovered by a subsidiary of SK Group, which licensed rights outside of eleven countries in Asia to Aerial Pharma in 2011. Aerial ran two Phase II trials of the drug in narcolepsy before selling the license to solriamfetol to Jazz in 2014; Jazz Pharmaceuticals paid Aerial $125 million up front and will pay Aerial and SK up to $272 million in milestone payments, and will pay double-digit royalties to SK. In 2019, solriamfetol was approved in the United States to improve wakefulness in adults with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It was granted orphan drug designation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved solriamfetol based primarily on evidence from five clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT02348593, Trial 2/NCT02348606, Trial 3/NCT02348619, Trial 4/NCT02348632, Trial 5 NCT01681121) of 622 patients with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The trials were conducted in Canada, Europe, and the United States. Solriamfetol was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020. In March 2022, it was announced that Axsome Therapeutics would be acquiring Solriamfetol, under the brand name Sunosi, from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, for an upfront sum of $53 million. Jazz will receive a high single-digit royalty on Axsome's U.S. net sales of Sunosi in the current indication, and a mid-single-digit royalty in the future indications. Axsome will also assume the commitments of Jazz to SK Biopharmaceuticals and Aerial Biopharma. == Society and culture == === Names === During development it has been called SKL-N05, ADX-N05, ARL-N05, and JZP-110. === Legal status === In the United States, solriamfetol is a Schedule IV controlled substance, meaning that it has an accepted medical use and a low potential for abuse, but that abuse may lead to physical or psychological dependence. A prescription is required, and can only be refilled up to five times in a six-month period. In countries of the European Union, a prescription is required. == Research == Solriamfetol is under development for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), binge eating disorder, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. As of September 2023, it is in phase 3 clinical trials for ADHD and phase 2 clinical trials for binge eating disorder and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A case report of solriamfetol for the treatment of ADHD has been published. Solriamfetol was also under development for the treatment of depressive disorders, but development for this indication was discontinued. In May 2024, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a trial of solriamfetol for the treatment of long COVID. == References ==",Solriamfetol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00020966715237591416)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solriamfetol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Solriamfetol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solriamfetol?utm_source=openai')])"
3238,"(""Adenosine 5'-monophosphate monohydrate"", ""Adenosine 5'-monophosphate"", 'Adenosine phosphate', 'Adenosine monophosphate', 'Adenylic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also known as 5'-adenylic acid, is a nucleotide. AMP consists of a phosphate group, the sugar ribose, and the nucleobase adenine. It is an ester of phosphoric acid and the nucleoside adenosine. As a substituent it takes the form of the prefix adenylyl-. AMP plays an important role in many cellular metabolic processes, being interconverted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), as well as allosterically activating enzymes such as myophosphorylase-b. AMP is also a component in the synthesis of RNA. AMP is present in all known forms of life. == Production and degradation == AMP does not have the high energy phosphoanhydride bond associated with ADP and ATP. AMP can be produced from ADP by the myokinase (adenylate kinase) reaction when the ATP reservoir in the cell is low: 2 ADP → ATP + AMP Or AMP may be produced by the hydrolysis of one high energy phosphate bond of ADP: ADP + H2O → AMP + Pi AMP can also be formed by hydrolysis of ATP into AMP and pyrophosphate: ATP + H2O → AMP + PPi When RNA is broken down by living systems, nucleoside monophosphates, including adenosine monophosphate, are formed. AMP can be regenerated to ATP as follows: AMP + ATP → 2 ADP (adenylate kinase in the opposite direction) ADP + Pi → ATP (this step is most often performed in aerobes by the ATP synthase during oxidative phosphorylation) AMP can be converted into inosine monophosphate by the enzyme myoadenylate deaminase, freeing an ammonia group. In a catabolic pathway, the purine nucleotide cycle, adenosine monophosphate can be converted to uric acid, which is excreted from the body in mammals. == Physiological role in regulation == === AMP-activated kinase regulation === The eukaryotic cell enzyme 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, utilizes AMP for homeostatic energy processes during times of high cellular energy expenditure, such as exercise. Since ATP cleavage, and corresponding phosphorylation reactions, are utilized in various processes throughout the body as a source of energy, ATP production is necessary to further create energy for those mammalian cells. AMPK, as a cellular energy sensor, is activated by decreasing levels of ATP, which is naturally accompanied by increasing levels of ADP and AMP. Though phosphorylation appears to be the main activator for AMPK, some studies suggest that AMP is an allosteric regulator as well as a direct agonist for AMPK. Furthermore, other studies suggest that the high ratio of AMP:ATP levels in cells, rather than just AMP, activate AMPK. For example, the AMP-activated kinases of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster were found to have been activated by AMP, while yeast and plant kinases were not allosterically activated by AMP. AMP binds to the γ-subunit of AMPK, leading to the activation of the kinase, and then eventually a cascade of other processes such as the activation of catabolic pathways and inhibition of anabolic pathways to regenerate ATP. Catabolic mechanisms, which generate ATP through the release of energy from breaking down molecules, are activated by the AMPK enzyme while anabolic mechanisms, which utilize energy from ATP to form products, are inhibited. Though the γ-subunit can bind AMP/ADP/ATP, only the binding of AMP/ADP results in a conformational shift of the enzyme protein. This variance in AMP/ADP versus ATP binding leads to a shift in the dephosphorylation state for the enzyme. The dephosphorylation of AMPK through various protein phosphatases completely inactivates catalytic function. AMP/ADP protects AMPK from being inactivated by binding to the γ-subunit and maintaining the dephosphorylation state. == cAMP == AMP can also exist as a cyclic structure known as cyclic AMP (or cAMP). Within certain cells the enzyme adenylate cyclase makes cAMP from ATP, and typically this reaction is regulated by hormones such as adrenaline or glucagon. cAMP plays an important role in intracellular signaling. In skeletal muscle, cyclic AMP, triggered by adrenaline, starts a cascade (cAMP-dependent pathway) for the conversion of myophosphorylase-b into the phosphorylated form of myophoshorylase-a for glycogenolysis. == See also == == References == == Further reading == == External links == GMD MS Spectrum",Adenylic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.9743012671824545e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.03205627202987671), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.38693344593048096), ('ĠFOOD', -0.264986515045166), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519782483577728)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3239,"('Thalidomide', 'Thalomid', 'Sedoval', 'Contergan', 'Pantosediv')",Medical,"Thalidomide, sold under the brand names Contergan and Thalomid among others, is an oral medication used to treat a number of cancers (e.g., multiple myeloma), graft-versus-host disease, and many skin disorders (e.g., complications of leprosy such as skin lesions). Thalidomide has been used to treat conditions associated with HIV: aphthous ulcers, HIV-associated wasting syndrome, diarrhea, and Kaposi's sarcoma, but increases in HIV viral load have been reported. Common side effects include sleepiness, rash, and dizziness. Severe side effects include tumor lysis syndrome, blood clots, and peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen and carries an extremely high risk of severe, life-threatening birth defects if administered or taken during pregnancy. It causes skeletal deformities such as amelia (absence of legs and/or arms), absence of bones, and phocomelia (malformation of the limbs). A single dose of thalidomide, regardless of dosage, is enough to cause teratogenic effects. Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany, where it was available over-the-counter. When first released, thalidomide was promoted for anxiety, trouble sleeping, ""tension"", and morning sickness. While it was initially thought to be safe in pregnancy, concerns regarding birth defects arose, resulting in its removal from the market in Europe in 1961. The total number of infants severely harmed by thalidomide use during pregnancy is estimated at over 10,000, possibly 20,000, of whom about 40% died around the time of birth. Those who survived had limb, eye, urinary tract, and heart problems. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey, a reviewer at the FDA. The birth defects caused by thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries. It was approved in the United States in 1998 for use as a treatment for cancer. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Thalidomide is used as a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone or with melphalan and prednisone to treat acute episodes of erythema nodosum leprosum, as well as for maintenance therapy. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) is related to leprosy. Thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where standard TB drugs and corticosteroids are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain. It is used as a second-line treatment to manage graft-versus-host disease and aphthous stomatitis in children and has been prescribed for other conditions in children, including actinic prurigo and epidermolysis bullosa; the evidence for these uses is weak. It is recommended only as a third line treatment in graft-versus-host-disease in adults because of lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials. == Contraindications == Prescriptions of thalidomide are accompanied by strict measures to avoid any possibility of use during pregnancy, and thalidomide should be avoided in women wanting to conceive. In the United States, the prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used and that regular pregnancy tests are taken. == Adverse effects == Thalidomide causes birth defects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable risk evaluation and mitigation strategy that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to both men and women, as the drug can be transmitted in semen. There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive blood clots. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with the production of several types of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via neutropenia, leukopenia, and lymphopenia, and risks that blood will not clot via thrombocytopenia. There is also a risk of anemia via lack of red blood cells. The drug can also damage nerves, causing potentially irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Thalidomide has several adverse cardiovascular effects, including risk of heart attacks, pulmonary hypertension, and changes in heart rhythm, such as syncope, bradycardia, and atrioventricular block. Thalidomide can cause liver damage and severe skin reactions like Stevens–Johnson syndrome. It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk when driving and operating other machinery. As it kills cancer cells, it can cause tumor lysis syndrome. Thalidomide can prevent menstruation. In addition, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema. Common adverse effects (reported by 1–10% of people) include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness. === Interactions === There are no expected pharmacokinetic interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on P-glycoprotein and the cytochrome P450 family. It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action and bradycardic agents, like beta-blockers, due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment of thalidomide with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy. The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with various contraceptives, and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are taking thalidomide. === Overdose === As of 2013, eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 14.4 grams, none of them fatal. No specific antidote for overdose exists and treatment is purely supportive. == Pharmacology == The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide was not known until the twenty-first century, although efforts to identify thalidomide's teratogenic action generated more than 2,000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000. The primary mechanism of action of thalidomide and its analogs in both their anti-cancer and teratogenic effects is now known to be as cereblon E3 ligase modulators. Thalidomide also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen of some capacity. In accordance, it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men. === Chirality and biological activity === Thalidomide is provided as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers; while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood. The (R)-enantiomer has the desired sedative effect while the (S)-enantiomer harbors embryo-toxic and teratogenic effects. Attempting to extract solely R-thalidomide does not remove the risk of birth defects, as it was demonstrated that the ""safe"" R-thalidomide undergoes an in vivo chiral inversion to the ""teratogenic"" S-thalidomide. Under biological conditions, the enantiomers interconvert (bidirectional chiral inversion – (R)- to (S)- and vice versa). == Chemistry == Thalidomide is racemic; while S-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule, the individual enantiomers can racemize to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the chiral centre, which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent. The racemization process can occur in vivo. The process of conversion of one enantiomer to its mirror-image version with no other change in the molecule is called chiral inversion. Celgene Corporation originally synthesized thalidomide using a three-step sequence starting with L-glutamic acid treatment, but this has since been reformed by the use of L-glutamine. As shown in the image below, N-carbethoxyphthalimide (1) can react with L-glutamine to yield N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine (2). Cyclization of N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine occurs using carbonyldiimidazole, which then yields thalidomide (3). Celgene Corporation's original method resulted in a 31% yield of S-thalidomide, whereas the two-step synthesis yields 85–93% product that is 99% pure. In 2023, it is reported that phthalic anhydride and L-glutamine under suitable conditions can react directly to form thalidomide. In the procedure, phthalic anhydride and L-glutamine are grounded and added into toluene solvent. The solution, along with triethylamine and acetic anhydride, is refluxed at ~110°C for 9 hours; after that the solution goes through a simple vacuum filtration procedure to obtain the product. == History == In 1952, thalidomide was synthesised by Chemical Industry Basel, but was found ""to have no effect on animals"" and was discarded on that basis. In 1957, it was acquired by Chemie Grünenthal in Germany. The German company had been established as a soap maker after World War II ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Heinrich Mückter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research. While preparing reagents for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product that was recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of glutethimide, a sedative. The medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug: the result was thalidomide. The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative, but it was never tested on pregnant women. Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal found that thalidomide was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on morning sickness. On 1 October 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began marketing it under the trade name Contergan. It was proclaimed a ""wonder drug"" for insomnia, coughs, colds and headaches. During that period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the fetus. Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing fetus. There soon appeared reports of abnormalities in children being born to mothers using thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter. While initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public. Experts estimate that thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, with over half of them in West Germany. The regulatory authorities in East Germany never approved thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for teratogenic effects. They were tested for toxicity on rodents only, as was usual at the time. In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd (now part of Diageo plc), marketed thalidomide throughout the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, under the brand name Distaval, as a remedy for morning sickness. Their advertisement claimed that ""Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child ... Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country."" Globally, more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. Thalidomide was available in 46 countries under many different brand names. In the US, representatives from Chemie Grünenthal approached Smith, Kline & French (SKF), now GlaxoSmithKline, with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum, rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the FDA, shows that in 1956–57, as part of its in-licensing approach, Smith, Kline and French conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the US involving 875 people, including pregnant women. In 1956, researchers involved in clinical trials at SKF noted that, even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice. When administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by Chemie Grünenthal to be ""sleep-inducing"", the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans. After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. In 1958, Chemie Grünenthal reached an agreement with the William S. Merrell Company in Cincinnati, Ohio (later Richardson-Merrell, now part of Sanofi), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the US. The US FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September 1960. The official in charge of the FDA review, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times and was refused each time. The distribution for ""testing"" resulted in 17 children born in the US with thalidomide-induced malformations. Oldham Kelsey was awarded the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by President Kennedy in 1962 for not allowing thalidomide to be approved for sale in the US. She was also inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. Canada's Food and Drug Directorate approved the sale of thalidomide by prescription in November 1960. There were many different forms sold: Kevadon, produced by the William S. Merrell Company seeking approval for its thalidomide product, was released on the market in April 1961, and the most common variant (Horner's Talimol) was put on the market on October 23 of the same year. Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects. It was not until March 1962 that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the directorate, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies. === Leprosy treatment === In 1964, Israeli physician Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. The treatment was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, and the results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed. Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965. Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests. Despite this, cases of thalidomide embryopathy continue, with at least 100 cases identified in Brazil between 2005 and 2010. Nearly 6 million thalidomide pills were distributed throughout Brazil in this time period, and these cases have occurred despite the controls. In 1998, the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL. Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that Celgene Corporation, which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name Thalomid, establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug. In 2010, the World Health Organization stated that it did not recommend thalidomide for leprosy due to the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of clofazimine. === Cancer treatment === Shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive. Little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s. Judah Folkman pioneered studies into the role of angiogenesis (the proliferation and growth of blood vessels) in the development of cancer, and in the early 1970s had shown that solid tumors could not expand without it. In 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing the same was true of blood cancers, and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer, but especially high in people with blood cancers, and other evidence emerged as well. Meanwhile, a member of his lab, Robert D'Amato, who was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors, discovered in 1994 that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis and was effective in suppressing tumor growth in rabbits. Around that time, the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed, called Folkman asking him about his anti-angiogenesis ideas. Folkman persuaded the patient's doctor to try thalidomide, and that doctor conducted a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment. The results of that trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999. After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the US Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. It was also evaluated whether thalidomide can be combined with melphalan and prednisone for patients with multiple myeloma. This combination of drugs probably increases the overall survival. == Society and culture == === Birth defect crisis === In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities, such as phocomelia, as a consequence of thalidomide use. The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment, with the time-sensitive window occurring approximately between day 20 and day 36 post-fertilisation. Thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000. Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962. === Notable cases === Lorraine Mercer MBE of the United Kingdom, born with phocomelia of both arms and legs, is the only thalidomide survivor to carry the Olympic Torch. Thomas Quasthoff, an internationally acclaimed bass-baritone, describes himself: ""1.34 meters tall, short arms, seven fingers — four right, three left — large, relatively well-formed head, brown eyes, distinctive lips; profession: singer"". Niko von Glasow produced a documentary called NoBody's Perfect, based on the lives of 12 people affected by the drug, which was released in 2008. Mercédes Benegbi, born with phocomelia of both arms, drove the successful campaign for compensation from her government for Canadians who were affected by thalidomide. Mat Fraser, born with phocomelia of both arms, is an English rock musician, actor, writer and performance artist. He produced a 2002 television documentary ""Born Freak"", which looked at this historical tradition and its relevance to modern disabled performers. This work has become the subject of academic analysis in the field of disability studies. Sue Kent, born in 1963 with phocomelia of both arms, eight inches long, no thumbs, and seven fingers – three on one hand, four on the other - has appeared as a presenter on the BBC TV show Gardener's World since 2020, demonstrating her ability to garden using her feet and toes where others would use their hands. Christian Lohr, born in 1962 with phocomelia of both arms and both legs, is a Swiss politician in the legislature in the Canton Thurgau including 2 years as its president and has been a member of the national legislature since 2011. === Change in drug regulations === The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the 1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment (US), 1965 Directive 65/65/EEC1 (EU), and the Medicines Act 1968 (UK). In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing. The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market. === Impact on research involving women === In 1977 the US Federal Drug Administration published a clinical trial guideline that excluded women of ""childbearing potential"" from the early phases of most clinical trials, which in practice led to their exclusion from later trial phases as well. This 1977 FDA guideline was implemented in response to a protectionist climate caused by the thalidomide tragedy. In the 1980s, a US task force on women's health concluded that a lack of women's health research (in part due to the FDA guideline) had compromised the amount and quality of information available about diseases and treatments affecting women. This led to the National Institute of Health policy that women should, when beneficial, be included in clinical trials. === Quality of life === In the 1960s, thalidomide was successfully marketed as a safer alternative to barbiturates. Due to a successful marketing campaign, thalidomide was widely used by pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, thalidomide is a teratogenic substance, and a proportion of children born during the 1960s had thalidomide embryopathy (TE). Of these babies born with TE, ""about 40% of them died before their first birthday"". The surviving individuals are now middle-aged and they report experiencing challenges (physical, psychological, and socioeconomic) related to TE. Individuals born with TE frequently experience a wide variety of health problems secondary to their TE. These health conditions include both physical and psychological conditions. When compared to individuals of similar demographic profiles, those born with TE report less satisfaction with their quality of life and their overall health. Access to healthcare services can also be a challenge for these people, and women, in particular, have experienced difficulty in locating healthcare professionals who can understand and embrace their needs. === Brand names === Brand names include Contergan, Thalomid, Talidex, Talizer, Neurosedyn, Distaval, and many others. == Research == Research efforts have been focused on determining how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide. === Thalidomide analogs === The exploration of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide analogs. Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects — except for greater myelosuppression. In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA-approved. Additionally, apremilast was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions. Interest turned to pomalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide marketed by Celgene. It is a very active anti-angiogenic agent and also acts as an immunomodulator. Pomalidomide was approved in February 2013 by the FDA as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. It received a similar approval from the European Commission in August 2013, and is expected to be marketed in Europe under the brand name Imnovid. === Clinical research === There is no conclusive evidence that thalidomide or lenalidomide is useful to bring about or maintain remission in Crohn's disease. Thalidomide was studied in a Phase II trial for Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare soft-tissue cancer most commonly seen in the immunocompromised, that is caused by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). == References == == Further reading == == External links == Daemmrich A (7 December 2015).

3240,"('Mianserin (hydrochloride)', 'Org gb 94', 'Mianserin', 'Mianserine', 'Mianseryna [polish]')",Medical,"Mianserin, sold under the brand name Tolvon among others, is an atypical antidepressant that is used primarily in the treatment of depression in Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA). Mianserin is closely related to mirtazapine, both chemically and in terms of its actions and effects, although there are significant differences between the two drugs (for example, its higher noradrenergic activity and lower 5-HT3 receptor antagonism). == Medical uses == Mianserin at higher doses (30–90 mg/day) is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It can also be used at lower doses (around 10 mg/day) to treat insomnia. == Contraindications == It should not be given, except if based on clinical need and under strict medical supervision, to people younger than 18 years old, as it can increase the risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thinking, and it can increase aggressiveness. While there is no evidence that it can harm a fetus from animal models, there are no data showing it safe for pregnant women to take. People with severe liver disease should not take mianserin, and it should be used with caution for people with epilepsy or who are at risk for seizures, as it can lower the threshold for seizures. If based on clinical decision, normal precautions should be exercised and the dosages of mianserin and any concurrent therapy kept under review and adjusted as needed. == Side effects == Very common (incidence > 10%) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, and drowsiness at the beginning of treatment. Common (1% < incidence ≤ 10%) adverse effects include drowsiness during maintenance therapy, tremor, headache, dizziness, vertigo, and weakness. Uncommon (0.1% < incidence ≤ 1%) adverse effects include weight gain. === Withdrawal === Abrupt or rapid discontinuation of mianserin may provoke a withdrawal, the effects of which may include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, decreased appetite or anorexia, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and flu-like symptoms, such as allergies or pruritus, among others. == Overdose == Overdose of mianserin is known to produce sedation, coma, hypotension or hypertension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation. == Interactions == Mianserin may enhance the sedative effects of drugs such as alcohol, anxiolytics, hypnotics, or antipsychotics when co-administered. It may decrease the efficacy of antiepileptic medications. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital will cause the body to metabolize mianserin faster and may reduce its effects. There is a risk of dangerously low blood pressure if people take mianserin along with diazoxide, hydralazine, or nitroprusside. Mianserin can make antihistamines and antimuscarinics have stronger effects. Mianserin should not be taken with apraclonidine, brimonidine, sibutramine, or the combination drug of artemether with lumefantrine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mianserin appears to exert its effects via antagonism of histamine and serotonin receptors, and inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake. More specifically, it is an antagonist/inverse agonist at most, if not all sites of the histamine H1 receptor, serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, and adrenergic α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors, and additionally a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. As an H1 receptor inverse agonist with high affinity, mianserin has strong antihistamine effects (e.g., sedation). Conversely, it has low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence lacks anticholinergic properties. Mianserin has been found to be a low affinity but potentially significant partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 1.7 μM; EC50 = 0.53 μM), similarly to some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Blockade of the H1 and possibly α1-adrenergic receptors has sedative effects, and also antagonism of the 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptors inhibits activation of intracellular phospholipase C (PLC), which seems to be a common target for several different classes of antidepressants. By antagonizing the somatodendritic and presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors, which function predominantly as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, mianserin disinhibits the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine in various areas of the brain and body. Along with mirtazapine, although to a lesser extent in comparison, mianserin has sometimes been described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). However, the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of mianserin is 20 to 30%. Its plasma protein binding is 95%. Mianserin is metabolized in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme via N-oxidation and N-demethylation. Its elimination half-life is 21 to 61 hours. The drug is excreted 4 to 7% in the urine and 14 to 28% in feces. == Chemistry == Mianserin is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine. Mirtazapine was developed by the same team of organic chemists and differs via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. (S)-(+)-Mianserin is approximately 200–300 times more active than its enantiomer (R)-(−)-mianserin; hence, the activity of mianserin lies in the (S)-(+) isomer. == History == It was developed but not discovered by Organon International; the first patents were issued in The Netherlands in 1967, and it was launched in France in 1979 under the brand name Athymil, and soon thereafter in the UK as Norval. Investigators conducting clinical trials in the US submitted fraudulent data, and it was never approved in the US.: 21 : 318 Mianserin was one of the first antidepressants to reach the UK market that was less dangerous than the tricyclic antidepressants in overdose; as of 2012 it was not prescribed much in the UK. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Mianserin is the English and German generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while mianserin hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in French and its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française are miansérine, in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are mianserina, and in Latin is mianserinum. === Brand names === Mianserin is marketed in many countries mainly under the brand name Tolvon.

Increased propionylcarnitine (C3) is regarded as a biomarker of vitamin B12 deficiency. The retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether increased propionylcarnitine and low methionine in newborns are associated with hypospadias. 41 newborns with hypospadias and 90 control newborns without congenital anomalies were investigated. Whole blood propionylcarnitine and methionine concentrations were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of propionylcarnitine was higher in newborns with hypospadias compared with newborns without congenital anomalies (p = 0.026). The mean methionine level in cases was insignificantly lower than in controls. There appears to be an association between decreased vitamin B12, as indexed by an increase of propionylcarnitine, and hypospadias in the investigated group of patients. Amniotic fluid samples from pregnancies complicated by foetal methylmalonic aciduria and from metabolically normal pregnancies were obtained at 16-18 weeks of gestation and analysed for total, free and acylcarnitine and individual carnitine esters. The amniotic fluid concentrations of total acylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine were higher in pregnancies with higher in pregnancies with methylmalonic aciduria than in normal pregnancies. The predominant carnitine ester was propionylcarnitine in the methylmalonic aciduria group and acetylcarnitine in the normal group. These findings suggest that in methylmalonic aciduria, abnormalities of carnitine metabolism already occur early in gestation. The amount of propionylcarnitine in amniotic fluid may be useful as an additional indicator of foetal methylmalonic aciduria. We report three patients with elevations of propionylcarnitine (C3), one without elevations of 2-methylcitrate and 3-hydroxypropionate in urine organic acid analysis, and the other two showing only mild elevations, all of whom were subsequently confirmed to have propionic acidemia by molecular analysis of PCCA and PCCB genes. To date, they have had a mild clinical course. These cases illustrate the importance of considering high C3 as the only biochemical abnormality in a diagnosis of propionic acidemia.

CC-223 is a novel and potent mTOR kinase inhibitor. Its activity against human HNSCC cells is studied here. In established SCC-9 cells and primary human oral cavity carcinoma (OCC) cells, CC-223 treatment at only nM concentrations significantly inhibited survival, proliferation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, CC-223 provoked apoptosis activation in human HNSCC cells. CC-223 is more efficient in killing HNSCC cells than other known Akt-mTOR inhibitors: RAD001, MK-2206 and AZD-2014. CC-223 was however non-cytotoxic to the primary human oral epithelial cells. Further studies demonstrate that CC-223 almost completely blocked mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 activation in SCC-9 cells and primary OCC cells. In vivo, oral administration of CC-223 at well-tolerated doses potently inhibited SCC-9 xenograft tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice. mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation was largely inhibited in CC-223-treated tumor tissues. Overall, targeting the mTOR kinase by CC-223 inhibits human HNSCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. CC-223 might have a translational value for the treatment of HNSCC. mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and survival. mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex-2 (mTORC2) are critical mediators of the PI3K-AKT pathway, which is frequently mutated in many cancers, leading to hyperactivation of mTOR signaling. Although rapamycin analogues, allosteric inhibitors that target only the mTORC1 complex, have shown some clinical activity, it is hypothesized that mTOR kinase inhibitors, blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, will have expanded therapeutic potential. Here, we describe the preclinical characterization of CC-223. CC-223 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of mTOR kinase, demonstrating inhibition of mTORC1 (pS6RP and p4EBP1) and mTORC2 [pAKT(S473)] in cellular systems. Growth inhibitory activity was demonstrated in hematologic and solid tumor cell lines. mTOR kinase inhibition in cells, by CC-223, resulted in more complete inhibition of the mTOR pathway biomarkers and improved antiproliferative activity as compared with rapamycin. Growth inhibitory activity and apoptosis was demonstrated in a panel of hematologic cancer cell lines. Correlative analysis revealed that IRF4 expression level associates with resistance, whereas mTOR pathway activation seems to associate with sensitivity. Treatment with CC-223 afforded in vivo tumor biomarker inhibition in tumor-bearing mice, after a single oral dose. CC-223 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in multiple solid tumor xenografts. Significant inhibition of mTOR pathway markers pS6RP and pAKT in CC-223-treated tumors suggests that the observed antitumor activity of CC-223 was mediated through inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. CC-223 is currently in phase I clinical trials. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related human mortalities. Over-activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is important for HCC tumorigenesis and progression. The current study assessed the potential anti-HCC activity by a novel mTOR kinase inhibitor, CC-223. We demonstrate that CC-223, at nM concentrations, induced profound cytotoxic and anti-proliferative activities against established HCC cell lines (HepG2, KYN-2 and Huh-7) and primary human HCC cells. Meanwhile, CC-223 activated caspase-3/-9 and apoptosis in the above HCC cells. CC-223 concurrently blocked mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, and its cytotoxicity against HCC cells was much more potent than the traditional mTORC1 inhibitors (RAD001 and rapamycin). Further studies demonstrated that CC-223 disrupted mitochondrial function, and induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. On the other hand, ROS scavengers and mPTP blockers (cyclosporin A or sanglifehrin A) largely attenuated CC-223-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that oral administration of CC-223 dramatically inhibited growth of HepG2 xenografts in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice. mTORC1/2 activation was also blocked in xenografts with CC-223 administration. Together, CC-223 simultaneously blocks mTORC1/2 and efficiently inhibits human HCC cells.",Cc 223,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.15310683415737e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005501013249158859), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014183077029883862)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It can be used in the treatment of asthma, hay fever, rhinitis, and urticaria, but is now less common as it has been replaced by newer antihistamines. The drug was patented at CIBA, which merged with Geigy into Ciba-Geigy, and eventually becoming Novartis. == Medical uses == Where and when it is/was in common use, tripelennamine is used much like other mildly-anticholinergic antihistamines to treat conditions of the upper respiratory tract arising from illnesses and hay fever. It can be used alone or in combination with other agents to have the desired effect. Cough medicines of the general formula tripelennamine + codeine/dihydrocodine/hydrocodone ± expectorant ± decongestant(s) are popular where available. Among these are the Pyribenzamine cough syrups which contain codeine, with and without decongestants, listed in the 1978 Physicians' Desk Reference; the codeine-tripelennamine synergy is well-known and makes such mixtures more useful for their intended purposes. == Side effects == Tripelennamine is mildly sedating. Other side effects can include irritation, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tripelennamine acts primarily as an antihistamine, or H1 receptor antagonist. It has little to no anticholinergic activity, with 180-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor over the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (for comparison, diphenhydramine had 20-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor). In addition to its antihistamine properties, tripelennamine also acts as a weak serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of tripelennamine is 4 to 6 hours. In a clinical study, the half-life of tripelennamine following intramuscular injection of 50 to 100 mg was 2.9 to 4.4 hours. == History == Tripelennamine was patented in 1946 by Carl Djerassi and colleagues, working at CIBA in New Jersey. == Society and culture == === Availability === Tripelennamine is no longer available in the United States. == See also == Chloropyramine Mepyramine Pheniramine Pentazocine == References ==",Tripelennamin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.90866428258596e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005571481888182461)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00792?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Tripelennamine: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00792?utm_source=openai')])"

A white, water-soluble solid, it contains both an amine and a thiol functional groups. It is often used as salts of the ammonium derivative [HSCH2CH2NH3]+ including the hydrochloride, phosphocysteamine, and the bitartrate.The intermediate pantetheine is broken down into cysteamine and pantothenic acid. It is biosynthesized in mammals, including humans, by the degradation of coenzyme A. It is the biosynthetic precursor to the neurotransmitter hypotaurine. == Medical uses == As a medication, cysteamine, sold under the brand name Cystagon among others, is indicated to treat cystinosis, a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of cystine, the oxidized dimer of the amino acid cysteine. It removes the excessive cystine that builds up in cells of people with the disease. It is available by mouth (capsule and extended release capsule) and in eye drops. When applied topically it can lighten skin that's been darkened as a result of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, sun exposure and melasma. Tentative evidence suggests that it may be a more effective depigmentation agent than hydroquinone, retinoids and topical corticosteroids in individuals with chronic skin discoloration. Topical application of cysteamine cream has also demonstrated similar efficacy to intradermal tranexamic acid injections for the treatment of Melasma but with much fewer adverse effects. == Adverse effects == === Topical use === Cysteamine is better tolerated than alternative skin lightening treatments with similar efficacy. === Oral use === The label for oral formulations of cysteamine carry warnings about symptoms similar to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, severe skin rashes, ulcers or bleeding in the stomach and intestines, central nervous symptoms including seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy, low white blood cell levels, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension that can cause headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, double or blurry vision, loss of vision, and pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. Additional adverse effects of oral cysteamine include bad breath, skin odor, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. The risks of cysteamine to a fetus are not known but it harms babies in animal models at doses less than those given to people. For eye drops, the most common adverse effects are sensitivity to light, redness, and eye pain, headache, and visual field defects. == Interactions == There are no drug interactions for normal capsules or eye drops, but the extended release capsules should not be taken with drugs that affect stomach acid like proton pump inhibitors or with alcohol, as they can cause the drug to be released too quickly. It does not inhibit any cytochrome P450 enzymes. == Pharmacology == People with cystinosis lack a functioning transporter (cystinosin) which transports cystine from the lysosome to the cytosol. This ultimately leads to buildup of cystine in lysosomes, where it crystallizes and damages cells. Cysteamine enters lysosomes and converts cystine into cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome. Cysteamine also promotes the transport of L-cysteine into cells. == History == The therapeutic effect of cysteamine on cystinosis was reported in the 1950s. Cysteamine was approved as a drug for cystinosis in the US in 1994. An extended release form was approved in 2013. == Society and culture == It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). === Economics === In 2013, the regular capsule of cysteamine cost about $8,000 per year; the extended release form that was introduced that year was priced at $250,000 per year. == Research == It was studied in in vitro and animal models for radiation protection in the 1950s, and in similar models from the 1970s onwards for sickle cell anemia, effects on growth, its ability to modulate the immune system, and as a possible inhibitor of HIV. In the 1970s, it was tested in clinical trials for Paracetamol toxicity which it failed, and in clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus in the 1990s and early 2000s, which it also failed. Clinical trials in Huntington's disease were begun in the 1990s and were ongoing as of 2015.

3247,"('Tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(ii) dimer', 'Carbon monoxide', 'Carbon monooxide', 'Carbonic oxide', 'Carbon(ii) oxide')",Medical,"Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CO2. It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater. It is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change. Its concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase. Carbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere. CO2, or the carbon it holds, is eventually sequestered (stored for the long term) in rocks and organic deposits like coal, petroleum and natural gas. Nearly all CO2 produced by humans goes into the atmosphere. Less than 1% of CO2 produced annually is put to commercial use, mostly in the fertilizer industry and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery. Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.: 3 == Chemical and physical properties == === Structure, bonding and molecular vibrations === The symmetry of a carbon dioxide molecule is linear and centrosymmetric at its equilibrium geometry. The length of the carbon–oxygen bond in carbon dioxide is 116.3 pm, noticeably shorter than the roughly 140 pm length of a typical single C–O bond, and shorter than most other C–O multiply bonded functional groups such as carbonyls. Since it is centrosymmetric, the molecule has no electric dipole moment. As a linear triatomic molecule, CO2 has four vibrational modes as shown in the diagram. In the symmetric and the antisymmetric stretching modes, the atoms move along the axis of the molecule. There are two bending modes, which are degenerate, meaning that they have the same frequency and same energy, because of the symmetry of the molecule. When a molecule touches a surface or touches another molecule, the two bending modes can differ in frequency because the interaction is different for the two modes. Some of the vibrational modes are observed in the infrared (IR) spectrum: the antisymmetric stretching mode at wavenumber 2349 cm−1 (wavelength 4.25 μm) and the degenerate pair of bending modes at 667 cm−1 (wavelength 15.0 μm). The symmetric stretching mode does not create an electric dipole so is not observed in IR spectroscopy, but it is detected in Raman spectroscopy at 1388 cm−1 (wavelength 7.20 μm), with a Fermi resonance doublet at 1285 cm−1. In the gas phase, carbon dioxide molecules undergo significant vibrational motions and do not keep a fixed structure. However, in a Coulomb explosion imaging experiment, an instantaneous image of the molecular structure can be deduced. Such an experiment has been performed for carbon dioxide. The result of this experiment, and the conclusion of theoretical calculations based on an ab initio potential energy surface of the molecule, is that none of the molecules in the gas phase are ever exactly linear. This counter-intuitive result is trivially due to the fact that the nuclear motion volume element vanishes for linear geometries. This is so for all molecules except diatomic molecules. === In aqueous solution === Carbon dioxide is soluble in water, in which it reversibly forms H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which is a weak acid, because its ionization in water is incomplete. CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3 The hydration equilibrium constant of carbonic acid is, at 25 °C: K h = [ H 2 CO 3 ] [ CO 2 ( aq ) ] = 1.70 × 10 − 3 {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {h} }={\frac {{\ce {[H2CO3]}}}{{\ce {[CO2_{(aq)}]}}}}=1.70\times 10^{-3}} Hence, the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid, but remains as CO2 molecules, not affecting the pH. The relative concentrations of CO2, H2CO3, and the deprotonated forms HCO−3 (bicarbonate) and CO2−3(carbonate) depend on the pH. As shown in a Bjerrum plot, in neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH > 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (>50%) becoming the most prevalent (>95%) at the pH of seawater. In very alkaline water (pH > 10.4), the predominant (>50%) form is carbonate. The oceans, being mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2–8.5, contain about 120 mg of bicarbonate per liter. Being diprotic, carbonic acid has two acid dissociation constants, the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate (also called hydrogen carbonate) ion (HCO−3): H2CO3 ⇌ HCO−3 + H+ Ka1 = 2.5 × 10−4 mol/L; pKa1 = 3.6 at 25 °C. This is the true first acid dissociation constant, defined as K a 1 = [ HCO 3 − ] [ H + ] [ H 2 CO 3 ] {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {a1} }={\frac {{\ce {[HCO3- ][H+]}}}{{\ce {[H2CO3]}}}}} where the denominator includes only covalently bound H2CO3 and does not include hydrated CO2(aq). The much smaller and often-quoted value near 4.16 × 10−7 (or pKa1 = 6.38) is an apparent value calculated on the (incorrect) assumption that all dissolved CO2 is present as carbonic acid, so that K a 1 ( a p p a r e n t ) = [ HCO 3 − ] [ H + ] [ H 2 CO 3 ] + [ CO 2 ( aq ) ] {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {a1} }{\rm {(apparent)}}={\frac {{\ce {[HCO3- ][H+]}}}{{\ce {[H2CO3] + [CO2_{(aq)}]}}}}} Since most of the dissolved CO2 remains as CO2 molecules, Ka1(apparent) has a much larger denominator and a much smaller value than the true Ka1. The bicarbonate ion is an amphoteric species that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH of the solution. At high pH, it dissociates significantly into the carbonate ion (CO2−3): HCO−3 ⇌ CO2−3 + H+ Ka2 = 4.69 × 10−11 mol/L; pKa2 = 10.329 In organisms, carbonic acid production is catalysed by the enzyme known as carbonic anhydrase. In addition to altering its acidity, the presence of carbon dioxide in water also affects its electrical properties. When carbon dioxide dissolves in desalinated water, the electrical conductivity increases significantly from below 1 μS/cm to nearly 30 μS/cm. When heated, the water begins to gradually lose the conductivity induced by the presence of C O 2 {\displaystyle \mathrm {CO_{2}} } , especially noticeable as temperatures exceed 30 °C. The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of fully deionized water without CO2 saturation is comparably low in relation to these data. === Chemical reactions === CO2 is a potent electrophile having an electrophilic reactivity that is comparable to benzaldehyde or strongly electrophilic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. However, unlike electrophiles of similar reactivity, the reactions of nucleophiles with CO2 are thermodynamically less favored and are often found to be highly reversible. The reversible reaction of carbon dioxide with amines to make carbamates is used in CO2 scrubbers and has been suggested as a possible starting point for carbon capture and storage by amine gas treating. Only very strong nucleophiles, like the carbanions provided by Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with CO2 to give carboxylates: MR + CO2 → RCO2M where M = Li or MgBr and R = alkyl or aryl. In metal carbon dioxide complexes, CO2 serves as a ligand, which can facilitate the conversion of CO2 to other chemicals. The reduction of CO2 to CO is ordinarily a difficult and slow reaction: CO2 + 2 e− + 2 H+ → CO + H2O The redox potential for this reaction near pH 7 is about −0.53 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode. The nickel-containing enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase catalyses this process. Photoautotrophs (i.e. plants and cyanobacteria) use the energy contained in sunlight to photosynthesize simple sugars from CO2 absorbed from the air and water: n CO2 + n H2O → (CH2O)n + n O2 === Physical properties === Carbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations, the gas is odorless; however, at sufficiently high concentrations, it has a sharp, acidic odor. At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg/m3, about 1.53 times that of air. Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below 0.51795(10) MPa (5.11177(99) atm). At a pressure of 1 atm (0.101325 MPa), the gas deposits directly to a solid at temperatures below 194.6855(30) K (−78.4645(30) °C) and the solid sublimes directly to a gas above this temperature. In its solid state, carbon dioxide is commonly called dry ice. Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above 0.51795(10) MPa (5.11177(99) atm); the triple point of carbon dioxide is 216.592(3) K (−56.558(3) °C) at 0.51795(10) MPa (5.11177(99) atm) (see phase diagram). The critical point is 304.128(15) K (30.978(15) °C) at 7.3773(30) MPa (72.808(30) atm). Another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an amorphous glass-like solid. This form of glass, called carbonia, is produced by supercooling heated CO2 at extreme pressures (40–48 GPa, or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a diamond anvil. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like silicon dioxide (silica glass) and germanium dioxide. Unlike silica and germania glasses, however, carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts to gas when pressure is released. At temperatures and pressures above the critical point, carbon dioxide behaves as a supercritical fluid known as supercritical carbon dioxide. Table of thermal and physical properties of saturated liquid carbon dioxide: Table of thermal and physical properties of carbon dioxide (CO2) at atmospheric pressure: == Biological role == Carbon dioxide is an end product of cellular respiration in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars, fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism. This includes all plants, algae and animals and aerobic fungi and bacteria. In vertebrates, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the skin (e.g., amphibians) or the gills (e.g., fish), from where it dissolves in the water, or to the lungs from where it is exhaled. During active photosynthesis, plants can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release in respiration. === Photosynthesis and carbon fixation === Carbon fixation is a biochemical process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated by plants, algae and cyanobacteria into energy-rich organic molecules such as glucose, thus creating their own food by photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars from which other organic compounds can be constructed, and oxygen is produced as a by-product. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase, commonly abbreviated to RuBisCO, is the enzyme involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, the production of two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate from CO2 and ribulose bisphosphate, as shown in the diagram at left. RuBisCO is thought to be the single most abundant protein on Earth. Phototrophs use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the biosynthesis of more complex organic molecules, such as polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. These are used for their own growth, and also as the basis of the food chains and webs that feed other organisms, including animals such as ourselves. Some important phototrophs, the coccolithophores synthesise hard calcium carbonate scales. A globally significant species of coccolithophore is Emiliania huxleyi whose calcite scales have formed the basis of many sedimentary rocks such as limestone, where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales. Plants can grow as much as 50% faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. Elevated CO2 levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops, with wheat, rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of 12–14% under elevated CO2 in FACE experiments. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water-use efficiency. Studies using FACE have shown that CO2 enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants. This may have knock-on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein. The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can also be altered in plants exposed to high concentrations of CO2. Plants also emit CO2 during respiration, and so the majority of plants and algae, which use C3 photosynthesis, are only net absorbers during the day. Though a growing forest will absorb many tons of CO2 each year, a mature forest will produce as much CO2 from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens (e.g., fallen branches) as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants. Contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral, mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon and remain valuable carbon sinks, helping to maintain the carbon balance of Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, and crucially to life on earth, photosynthesis by phytoplankton consumes dissolved CO2 in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. === Toxicity === Carbon dioxide content in fresh air (averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level, i.e., about 30 km (19 mi) altitude) varies between 0.036% (360 ppm) and 0.041% (412 ppm), depending on the location. In humans, exposure to CO2 at concentrations greater than 5% causes the development of hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour. Concentrations of more than 10% may cause convulsions, coma, and death. CO2 levels of more than 30% act rapidly leading to loss of consciousness in seconds. Because it is heavier than air, in locations where the gas seeps from the ground (due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity) in relatively high concentrations, without the dispersing effects of wind, it can collect in sheltered/pocketed locations below average ground level, causing animals located therein to be suffocated. Carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed. Children have been killed in the same way near the city of Goma by CO2 emissions from the nearby volcano Mount Nyiragongo. The Swahili term for this phenomenon is mazuku. Adaptation to increased concentrations of CO2 occurs in humans, including modified breathing and kidney bicarbonate production, in order to balance the effects of blood acidification (acidosis). Several studies suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces (e.g. a submarine) since the adaptation is physiological and reversible, as deterioration in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days. Yet, other studies show a decrease in cognitive function even at much lower levels. Also, with ongoing respiratory acidosis, adaptation or compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse the condition. ==== Below 1% ==== There are few studies of the health effects of long-term continuous CO2 exposure on humans and animals at levels below 1%. Occupational CO2 exposure limits have been set in the United States at 0.5% (5000 ppm) for an eight-hour period. At this CO2 concentration, International Space Station crew experienced headaches, lethargy, mental slowness, emotional irritation, and sleep disruption. Studies in animals at 0.5% CO2 have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure. A study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant negative effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1% (1000 ppm) CO2 likely due to CO2 induced increases in cerebral blood flow. Another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at 1000 ppm, when compared to 500 ppm. However a review of the literature found that a reliable subset of studies on the phenomenon of carbon dioxide induced cognitive impairment to only show a small effect on high-level decision making (for concentrations below 5000 ppm). Most of the studies were confounded by inadequate study designs, environmental comfort, uncertainties in exposure doses and differing cognitive assessments used. Similarly a study on the effects of the concentration of CO2 in motorcycle helmets has been criticized for having dubious methodology in not noting the self-reports of motorcycle riders and taking measurements using mannequins. Further when normal motorcycle conditions were achieved (such as highway or city speeds) or the visor was raised the concentration of CO2 declined to safe levels (0.2%). ==== Ventilation ==== Poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive CO2 concentrations in closed spaces, leading to poor indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions (when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that CO2 concentration has stabilized) are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person. Higher CO2 concentrations are associated with occupant health, comfort and performance degradation. ASHRAE Standard 62.1–2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor concentrations up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions. Thus if the outdoor concentration is 400 ppm, indoor concentrations may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard. Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000 ppm). Miners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as ""blackdamp"", ""choke damp"" or ""stythe"". Before more effective technologies were developed, miners would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The Davy lamp could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while methane, another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly. In February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen CO2) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down. A similar accident occurred in 2018 when a woman died from CO2 fumes emanating from the large amount of dry ice she was transporting in her car. ==== Indoor air ==== Humans spend more and more time in a confined atmosphere (around 80-90% of the time in a building or vehicle). According to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) and various actors in France, the CO2 rate in the indoor air of buildings (linked to human or animal occupancy and the presence of combustion installations), weighted by air renewal, is ""usually between about 350 and 2,500 ppm"". In homes, schools, nurseries and offices, there are no systematic relationships between the levels of CO2 and other pollutants, and indoor CO2 is statistically not a good predictor of pollutants linked to outdoor road (or air, etc.) traffic. CO2 is the parameter that changes the fastest (with hygrometry and oxygen levels when humans or animals are gathered in a closed or poorly ventilated room). In poor countries, many open hearths are sources of CO2 and CO emitted directly into the living environment. ==== Outdoor areas with elevated concentrations ==== Local concentrations of carbon dioxide can reach high values near strong sources, especially those that are isolated by surrounding terrain. At the Bossoleto hot spring near Rapolano Terme in Tuscany, Italy, situated in a bowl-shaped depression about 100 m (330 ft) in diameter, concentrations of CO2 rise to above 75% overnight, sufficient to kill insects and small animals. After sunrise the gas is dispersed by convection. High concentrations of CO2 produced by disturbance of deep lake water saturated with CO2 are thought to have caused 37 fatalities at Lake Monoun, Cameroon in 1984 and 1700 casualties at Lake Nyos, Cameroon in 1986. == Human physiology == === Content === The body produces approximately 2.3 pounds (1.0 kg) of carbon dioxide per day per person, containing 0.63 pounds (290 g) of carbon. In humans, this carbon dioxide is carried through the venous system and is breathed out through the lungs, resulting in lower concentrations in the arteries. The carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the partial pressure, which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume. In humans, the blood carbon dioxide contents are shown in the adjacent table. === Transport in the blood === CO2 is carried in blood in three different ways. Exact percentages vary between arterial and venous blood. Majority (about 70% to 80%) is converted to bicarbonate ions HCO−3 by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells, by the reaction: CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + HCO−3 5–10% is dissolved in blood plasma 5–10% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds Hemoglobin, the main oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the CO2 bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO2 decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the Haldane Effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of CO2 or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the Bohr effect. === Regulation of respiration === Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local autoregulation of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue. Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of CO2 in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis, while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation, which can cause respiratory alkalosis. Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing air hunger. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the oxygen mask to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness. The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial CO2 pressure of 40 mmHg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20 mmHg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving. == Concentrations and role in the environment == === Atmosphere === === Oceans === ==== Ocean acidification ==== Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), bicarbonate (HCO−3), and carbonate (CO2−3). There is about fifty times as much carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans as exists in the atmosphere. The oceans act as an enormous carbon sink, and have taken up about a third of CO2 emitted by human activity. ==== Hydrothermal vents ==== Carbon dioxide is also introduced into the oceans through hydrothermal vents. The Champagne hydrothermal vent, found at the Northwest Eifuku volcano in the Mariana Trench, produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide, one of only two known sites in the world as of 2004, the other being in the Okinawa Trough. The finding of a submarine lake of liquid carbon dioxide in the Okinawa Trough was reported in 2006. == Sources == The burning of fossil fuels for energy produces 36.8 billion tonnes of CO2 per year as of 2023. Nearly all of this goes into the atmosphere, where approximately half is subsequently absorbed into natural carbon sinks. Less than 1% of CO2 produced annually is put to commercial use.: 3 === Biological processes === Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the fermentation of sugar in the brewing of beer, whisky and other alcoholic beverages and in the production of bioethanol. Yeast metabolizes sugar to produce CO2 and ethanol, also known as alcohol, as follows: C6H12O6 → 2 CO2 + 2 CH3CH2OH All aerobic organisms produce CO2 when they oxidize carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to cellular respiration, anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis. The equation for the respiration of glucose and other monosaccharides is: C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O Anaerobic organisms decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds. Regardless of the type of organic material, the production of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern. Carbon dioxide comprises about 40–45% of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills (termed ""landfill gas""). Most of the remaining 50–55% is methane. ==== Combustion ==== The combustion of all carbon-based fuels, such as methane (natural gas), petroleum distillates (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, propane), coal, wood and generic organic matter produces carbon dioxide and, except in the case of pure carbon, water. As an example, the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O Iron is reduced from its oxides with coke in a blast furnace, producing pig iron and carbon dioxide: Fe2O3 + 3 CO → 3 CO2 + 2 Fe ==== By-product from hydrogen production ==== Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the industrial production of hydrogen by steam reforming and the water gas shift reaction in ammonia production. These processes begin with the reaction of water and natural gas (mainly methane). ==== Thermal decomposition of limestone ==== It is produced by thermal decomposition of limestone, CaCO3 by heating (calcining) at about 850 °C (1,560 °F), in the manufacture of quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO), a compound that has many industrial uses: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 Acids liberate CO2 from most metal carbonates. Consequently, it may be obtained directly from natural carbon dioxide springs, where it is produced by the action of acidified water on limestone or dolomite. The reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) is shown below: CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + H2CO3 The carbonic acid (H2CO3) then decomposes to water and CO2: H2CO3 → CO2 + H2O Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling, or both, as the gas is released. They have widespread uses in industry because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams. == Commercial uses == Around 230 Mt of CO2 are used each year, mostly in the fertiliser industry for urea production (130 million tonnes) and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery (70 to 80 million tonnes).: 3 Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.: 3 Technology exists to capture CO2 from industrial flue gas or from the air. Research is ongoing on ways to use captured CO2 in products and some of these processes have been deployed commercially. However, the potential to use products is very small compared to the total volume of CO2 that could foreseeably be captured. The vast majority of captured CO2 is considered a waste product and sequestered in underground geologic formations. === Precursor to chemicals === In the chemical industry, carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of urea, with a smaller fraction being used to produce methanol and a range of other products. Some carboxylic acid derivatives such as sodium salicylate are prepared using CO2 by the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction. Captured CO2 could be to produce methanol or electrofuels. To be carbon-neutral, the CO2 would need to come from bioenergy production or direct air capture.: 21–24 === Fossil fuel recovery === Carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells, usually under supercritical conditions, when it becomes miscible with the oil. This approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by 7–23% additional to primary extraction. It acts as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground crude oil, significantly reduces its viscosity, and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well. Most CO2 injected in CO2-EOR projects comes from naturally occurring underground CO2 deposits. Some CO2 used in EOR is captured from industrial facilities such as natural gas processing plants, using carbon capture technology and transported to the oilfield in pipelines. === Agriculture === Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis. The atmospheres of greenhouses may (if of large size, must) be enriched with additional CO2 to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth. At very high concentrations (100 times atmospheric concentration, or greater), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse. Some plants respond more favorably to rising carbon dioxide concentrations than others, which can lead to vegetation regime shifts like woody plant encroachment. === Foods === Carbon dioxide is a food additive used as a propellant and acidity regulator in the food industry. It is approved for usage in the EU (listed as E number E290), US, Australia and New Zealand (listed by its INS number 290). A candy called Pop Rocks is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas at about 4,000 kPa (40 bar; 580 psi). When placed in the mouth, it dissolves (just like other hard candy) and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop. Leavening agents cause dough to rise by producing carbon dioxide. Baker's yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids. ==== Beverages ==== Carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water. Traditionally, the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide. With the exception of British real ale, draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide, sometimes mixed with nitrogen. The taste of soda water (and related taste sensations in other carbonated beverages) is an effect of the dissolved carbon dioxide rather than the bursting bubbles of the gas. Carbonic anhydrase 4 converts carbon dioxide to carbonic acid leading to a sour taste, and also the dissolved carbon dioxide induces a somatosensory response. ==== Winemaking ==== Carbon dioxide in the form of dry ice is often used during the cold soak phase in winemaking to cool clusters of grapes quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous fermentation by wild yeast. The main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the sugar concentration in the grape must, and thus the alcohol concentration in the finished wine. Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for carbonic maceration, the process used to produce Beaujolais wine. Carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other storage vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation, though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine, making a previously still wine slightly fizzy. For this reason, other gases such as nitrogen or argon are preferred for this process by professional wine makers. ==== Stunning animals ==== Carbon dioxide is often used to ""stun"" animals before slaughter. ""Stunning"" may be a misnomer, as the animals are not knocked out immediately and may suffer distress. === Inert gas === Carbon dioxide is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding, although in the welding arc, it reacts to oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres. When used for MIG welding, CO2 use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as CO2 can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern. Carbon dioxide is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 bar (870 psi; 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. Aluminium capsules of CO2 are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for air guns, paintball markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making carbonated water. High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in supercritical drying of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for scanning electron microscopy and in the decaffeination of coffee beans. === Fire extinguisher === Carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some fire extinguishers, especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because they do not cool the burning substances significantly, and when the carbon dioxide disperses, they can catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. They are mainly used in server rooms. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire-protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space. International Maritime Organization standards recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide-based fire-protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of CO2 systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries. === Supercritical CO2 as solvent === Liquid carbon dioxide is a good solvent for many lipophilic organic compounds and is used to decaffeinate coffee. Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the pharmaceutical and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as organochlorides. It is also used by some dry cleaners for this reason. It is used in the preparation of some aerogels because of the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide. === Refrigerant === Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important refrigerants, especially in the food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called ""dry ice"" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature. Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the use of dichlorodifluoromethane (R12, a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compound). CO2 might enjoy a renaissance because one of the main substitutes to CFCs, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a, a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) compound) contributes to climate change more than CO2 does. CO2 physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 bars (1,900 psi; 13,000 kPa), CO2 systems require highly mechanically resistant reservoirs and components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50°, CO2 (R744) operates more efficiently than systems using HFCs (e.g., R134a). Its environmental advantages (GWP of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, and heat pump water heaters, among others. Coca-Cola has fielded CO2-based beverage coolers and the U.S. Army is interested in CO2 refrigeration and heating technology. === Minor uses === Carbon dioxide is the lasing medium in a carbon-dioxide laser, which is one of the earliest type of lasers. Carbon dioxide can be used as a means of controlling the pH of swimming pools, by continuously adding gas to the water, thus keeping the pH from rising. Among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling (more hazardous) acids. Similarly, it is also used in the maintaining reef aquaria, where it is commonly used in calcium reactors to temporarily lower the pH of water being passed over calcium carbonate in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely, where it is used by some corals to build their skeleton. Used as the primary coolant in the British advanced gas-cooled reactor for nuclear power generation. Carbon dioxide induction is commonly used for the euthanasia of laboratory research animals. Methods to administer CO2 include placing animals directly into a closed, prefilled chamber containing CO2, or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of CO2. The American Veterinary Medical Association's 2020 guidelines for carbon dioxide induction state that a displacement rate of 30–70% of the chamber or cage volume per minute is optimal for the humane euthanasia of small rodents.: 5, 31 Percentages of CO2 vary for different species, based on identified optimal percentages to minimize distress.: 22 Carbon dioxide is also used in several related cleaning and surface-preparation techniques. == History of discovery == Carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance. In about 1640, the Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont observed that when he burned charcoal in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a ""gas"" (from Greek ""chaos"") or ""wild spirit"" (spiritus sylvestris). The properties of carbon dioxide were further studied in the 1750s by the Scottish physician Joseph Black. He found that limestone (calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called ""fixed air"". He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through limewater (a saturated aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, English chemist Joseph Priestley published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air in which he described a process of dripping sulfuric acid (or oil of vitriol as Priestley knew it) on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide, and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas. Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday. The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) was given by the French inventor Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier, who in 1835 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a ""snow"" of solid CO2. Carbon dioxide in combination with nitrogen was known from earlier times as Blackdamp, stythe or choke damp. Along with the other types of damp it was encountered in mining operations and well sinking. Slow oxidation of coal and biological processes replaced the oxygen to create a suffocating mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. == See also == == Notes == == References == == External links == Current global map of carbon dioxide concentration CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Carbon Dioxide Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (NOAA) The rediscovery of CO2: History, What is Shecco? - as refrigerant",Carbonic oxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4071279764175415)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('IN', -0.6212306618690491), ('DU', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('ST', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('RI', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.005250118672847748), ('ĠFOOD', -0.049813657999038696), (',', -0.12706789374351501), ('ĠEND', -0.14896747469902039), ('OG', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048897627741098404)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.4740770161151886), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3248,"('Gabapentin', 'Neurontin', 'Gabapentine', 'Aclonium', 'Gabapetin')",Medical,"Gabapentin, sold under the brand name Neurontin among others, is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat neuropathic pain and also for partial seizures of epilepsy. It is a commonly used medication for the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central pain. It is moderately effective: about 30–40% of those given gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia have a meaningful benefit. Gabapentin, like other gabapentinoid drugs, acts by decreasing activity of the α2δ-1 protein, coded by the CACNA2D1 gene, first known as an auxiliary subunit of voltage gated calcium channels. However, see Pharmacodynamics, below. By binding to α2δ-1, gabapentin reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters (primarily glutamate) and as a result, reduces excess excitation of neuronal networks in the spinal cord and brain. Sleepiness and dizziness are the most common side effects. Serious side effects include respiratory depression, and allergic reactions. As with all other antiepileptic drugs approved by the FDA, gabapentin is labeled for an increased risk of suicide. Lower doses are recommended in those with kidney disease. Gabapentin was first approved for use in the United Kingdom in 1993. It has been available as a generic medication in the United States since 2004. It is the first of several other drugs that are similar in structure and mechanism, called gabapentinoids. In 2022, it was the tenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 40 million prescriptions. During the 1990s, Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of Pfizer, used a number of illegal techniques to encourage physicians in the United States to prescribe gabapentin for unapproved uses. They have paid out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits regarding these activities. == Medical uses == Gabapentin is recommended for use in focal seizures and neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is prescribed off-label in the US and the UK, for example, for the treatment of non-neuropathic pain, anxiety disorders, sleep problems and bipolar disorder. In recent years, gabapentin has seen increased use, particularly in the elderly. There is concern regarding gabapentin's off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for its efficacy in multiple conditions, its proven side effects and its potential for misuse and physical/psychological dependency. Some harms, including nervous system harms, have been underreported in published trials of gabapentin, potentially resulting in the underestimation of harms in guidelines for the use of gabapentin. === Seizures === Gabapentin is approved for the treatment of focal seizures; however, it is not effective for generalized epilepsy. === Neuropathic pain === Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic neuropathic pain by various medical authorities. This is a general recommendation applicable to all neuropathic pain syndromes except for trigeminal neuralgia, where it may be used as a second- or third-line agent. Regarding the specific diagnoses, a systematic review has found evidence for gabapentin to provide pain relief for some people with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Gabapentin is approved for the former indication in the US. In addition to these two neuropathies, European Federation of Neurological Societies guideline notes gabapentin effectiveness for central pain. A combination of gabapentin with an opioid or nortriptyline may work better than either drug alone. Gabapentin shows substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or a patient global impression of change (PGIC) ""very much improved"") for neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia or peripheral diabetic neuropathy) in 30–40% of subjects treated as compared to those treated with placebo. Evidence finds little or no benefit and significant risk in those with chronic low back pain or sciatica. Gabapentin is not effective in HIV-associated sensory neuropathy and neuropathic pain due to cancer. === Anxiety === There is a small amount of research on the use of gabapentin for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Gabapentin is effective for the long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder and in reducing preoperative anxiety. In a controlled trial of breast cancer survivors with anxiety, and a trial for social phobia, gabapentin significantly reduced anxiety levels. For panic disorder, gabapentin has produced mixed results. === Sleep === Gabapentin is effective in treating sleep disorders such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome that are the result of an underlying illness, but comes with some risk of discontinuation and withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at higher doses. Gabapentin enhances slow-wave sleep in people with primary insomnia. It also improves sleep quality by elevating sleep efficiency and decreasing spontaneous arousal. === Drug dependence === Gabapentin is moderately effective in reducing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and associated craving. The evidence in favor of gabapentin is weak in the treatment of alcoholism: it does not contribute to the achievement of abstinence, and the data on the relapse of heavy drinking and percent of days abstinent do not robustly favor gabapentin; it only decreases the percent days of heavy drinking. Gabapentin is ineffective in cocaine dependence and methamphetamine use, and it does not increase the rate of smoking cessation. While some studies indicate that gabapentin does not significantly reduce the symptoms of opiate withdrawal, there is increasing evidence that gabapentinoids are effective in controlling some of the symptoms during opiate detoxification. A clinical study in Iran, where heroin dependence is a significant social and public health problem, showed gabapentin produced positive results during an inpatient therapy program, particularly by reducing opioid-induced hyperalgesia and drug craving. There is insufficient evidence for its use in cannabis dependence. === Other === Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment of the acquired pendular nystagmus, torsional nystagmus, and infantile nystagmus; however, it does not work in periodic alternating nystagmus. Gabapentin decreases the frequency of hot flashes in both menopausal women and people with breast cancer. However, antidepressants have similar efficacy, and treatment with estrogen more effectively prevents hot flashes. Gabapentin reduces spasticity in multiple sclerosis and is prescribed as one of the first-line options. It is an established treatment of restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin alleviates itching in kidney failure (uremic pruritus) and itching of other causes. It may be an option in essential or orthostatic tremor. Gabapentin does not appear to provide benefit for bipolar disorder, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical pain, or tinnitus, or prevent episodic migraine in adults. == Contraindications == Gabapentin should be used carefully and at lower doses in people with kidney problems due to possible accumulation and toxicity. It is unclear if it is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. == Side effects == Dizziness and somnolence are the most frequent side effects. Fatigue, ataxia, peripheral edema (swelling of extremities), and nystagmus are also common. A 2017 meta-analysis found that gabapentin also increased the risk of difficulties in mentation and visual disturbances as compared to a placebo. Gabapentin is associated with a weight gain of 2.2 kg (4.9 lb) after 1.5 months of use. Case studies indicate that it may cause anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as well as myoclonus that disappear after discontinuing gabapentin or replacing it with other medication. Fever, swollen glands that do not go away, eyes or skin turning yellow, unusual bruises or bleeding, unexpected muscle pain or weakness, rash, long-lasting stomach pain which may indicate an inflamed pancreas, hallucinations, anaphylaxis, respiratory depression, and increased suicidal ideation are rare but serious side effects. === Suicide === As with all antiepileptic drugs approved in the US, gabapentin label contains a warning of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This warning is based on a meta-analysis of all approved antiepileptic drugs in 2008, and not with gabapentin alone. According to an experimental meta-analysis of insurance claims database, gabapentin use is associated with about 40% increased risk of suicide, suicide attempt and violent death as compared with a reference anticonvulsant drug topiramate. The risk is increased for people with bipolar disorder or epilepsy. Another study has shown an approximately doubled rate of suicide attempts and self-harm in people with bipolar disorder who are taking gabapentin versus those taking lithium. A large Swedish study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. On the other hand, a study published by the Harvard Data Science Review found that gabapentin was associated with a significantly reduced rate of suicide. === Respiratory depression === Serious breathing suppression, potentially fatal, may occur when gabapentin is taken together with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other depressants, or by people with underlying lung problems such as COPD. Gabapentin and opioids are commonly prescribed or abused together, and research indicates that the breathing suppression they cause is additive. For example, gabapentin use before joint replacement or laparoscopic surgery increased the risk of respiratory depression by 30–60%. A Canadian study showed that use of gabapentin and other gabapentinoids, whether for epilepsy, neuropathic pain or other chronic pain was associated with a 35–58% increased risk for severe exacerbation of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. === Withdrawal and dependence === Withdrawal symptoms typically occur 1–2 days after abruptly stopping gabapentin (almost unambiguously due to extended use and during a very short-term rebound phenomenon) — similar to, albeit less intense than most benzodiazepines. Agitation, confusion and disorientation are the most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal complaints and sweating, and more rare tremor, tachycardia, hypertension and insomnia. In some cases, users experience withdrawal seizures after chronic or semi-chronic use in the absence of periodic cycles or breaks during repeating and consecutive use. All these symptoms subside when gabapentin is re-instated or tapered off gradually at an appropriate rate. On its own, gabapentin appears to not have a substantial addictive power. In human and animal experiments, it shows limited to no rewarding effects. The vast majority of people abusing gabapentin are current or former abusers of opioids or sedatives. In these persons, gabapentin can boost the opioid ""high"" as well as decrease commonly experienced opioid-withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety. == Overdose == Through excessive ingestion, accidental or otherwise, persons may experience overdose symptoms including drowsiness, sedation, blurred vision, slurred speech, somnolence, uncontrollable jerking motions, and anxiety. A very high amount taken is associated with breathing suppression, coma, and possibly death, particularly if combined with alcohol or opioids. == Pharmacology == === Animal Models === Gabapentin, prevents seizures in a dose-related manner in several laboratory animal models. These models include spinal extensor seizures from low-intensity electroshock to the forebrain in mice, maximal electroshock in rats, spinal extensor seizures in DBA/2 mice with a genetic sensitivity to seizures induced by loud noise, and in rats ""kindled"" to produce focal seizures by repeated prior electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. Gabapentin slightly increased spontaneous absence-like seizures in a genetically susceptible strain recorded with electroencephalography. All of these effects of gabapentin were seen at dosages at or below the threshold for producing ataxia. Gabapentin also has been tested in a wide variety of animal models that are relevant for analgesic actions. Generally, gabapentin is not active to prevent pain-related behaviors in models of acute nociceptive pain, but it prevents pain-related behaviors when animals are made sensitive by prior peripheral inflammation or peripheral nerve damage (inflammatory or neuropathic conditions). === Pharmacodynamics === Gabapentin is a ligand of the α2δ calcium channel subunit. The α2δ-1 protein is coded by the CACNA2D1 gene. α2δ was first described as an auxiliary protein connected to the main α1 subunit (the channel-forming protein) of high voltage activated voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-type, N-type, P/Q type, and R-type). The same α2δ protein has more recently been shown to interact directly with some NMDA-type and AMPA-type glutamate receptors at presynaptic sites and also with thrombospondin (an extracellular matrix protein secreted by astroglial cells). Gabapentin is not a direct calcium channel blocker: it exerts its actions by disrupting the regulatory function of α2δ and its interactions with other proteins. Gabapentin reduces delivery of intracellular calcium channels to the cell membrane, reduces the activation of the channels by the α2δ subunit, decreases signaling leading to neurotransmitters release, and disrupts interactions of α2δ with voltage gated calcium channels but also with NMDA receptors, neurexins, and thrombospondin. These proteins are found as mutually interacting parts of the presynaptic active zone, where numerous protein molecules interact with each other to enable and to regulate the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic vesicles into the synaptic space. Out of the four known isoforms of α2δ protein, gabapentin binds with similar high affinity to two: α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. All of the pharmacological properties of gabapentin tested to date are explained by its binding to just one isoform – α2δ-1. The endogenous α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, which resemble gabapentin in chemical structure, bind α2δ with similar affinity to gabapentin and are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at micromolar concentrations. They may be the endogenous ligands of the α2δ subunit, and they competitively antagonize the effects of gabapentin. Accordingly, while gabapentin has nanomolar affinity for the α2δ subunit, its potency in vivo is in the low micromolar range, and competition for binding by endogenous L-amino acids is likely to be responsible for this discrepancy. Gabapentin is a potent activator of voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ3 and KCNQ5, even at low nanomolar concentrations. However, this activation is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of gabapentin's therapeutic effects. Gabapentin is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter glutamate and competitively inhibits branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), slowing down the synthesis of glutamate. In particular, it inhibits BCAT-1 at high concentrations (Ki = 1 mM), but not BCAT-2. At very high concentrations gabapentin can suppress the growth of cancer cells, presumably by affecting mitochondrial catabolism, however, the precise mechanism remains elusive. Even though gabapentin is a structural GABA analogue, and despite its name, it does not bind to the GABA receptors, does not convert into GABATooltip γ-aminobutyric acid or another GABA receptor agonist in vivo, and does not modulate GABA transport or metabolism within the range of clinical dosing. In vitro gabapentin has been found to very weakly inhibit the GABA aminotransferase enzyme (Ki = 17–20 mM), however, this effect is so weak it is not clinically relevant at prescribed doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Gabapentin is absorbed from the intestines by an active transport process mediated via an amino acid transporter, presumably, LAT2. As a result, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin is dose-dependent, with diminished bioavailability and delayed peak levels at higher doses. The oral bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 80% at 100 mg administered three times daily once every 8 hours, but decreases to 60% at 300 mg, 47% at 400 mg, 34% at 800 mg, 33% at 1,200 mg, and 27% at 1,600 mg, all with the same dosing schedule. Drugs that increase the transit time of gabapentin in the small intestine can increase its oral bioavailability; when gabapentin was co-administered with oral morphine, the oral bioavailability of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin increased by 50%. Gabapentin at a low dose of 100 mg has a Tmax (time to peak levels) of approximately 1.7 hours, while the Tmax increases to 3 to 4 hours at higher doses. Food does not significantly affect the Tmax of gabapentin and increases the Cmax and area-under-curve levels of gabapentin by approximately 10%. Gabapentin can cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. Gabapentin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is approximately 9–14% of its blood plasma concentration. Due to its low lipophilicity, gabapentin requires active transport across the blood–brain barrier. The LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier and transports gabapentin across into the brain. As with intestinal absorption mediated by an amino acid transporter, the transport of gabapentin across the blood–brain barrier by LAT1 is saturable. Gabapentin does not bind to other drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) or OCTN2 (SLC22A5). It is not significantly bound to plasma proteins (<1%). Gabapentin undergoes little or no metabolism. Gabapentin is generally safe in people with liver cirrhosis. Gabapentin is eliminated renally in the urine. It has a relatively short elimination half-life, with the reported average value of 5 to 7 hours. Because of its short elimination half-life, gabapentin must be administered 3 to 4 times per day to maintain therapeutic levels. Gabapentin XR (brand name Gralise) is taken once a day. == Chemistry == Gabapentin is a 3,3-disubstituted derivative of GABA. Therefore, it is a GABA analogue, as well as a γ-amino acid. It is similar to several other compounds that collectively are called gabapentinoids. Specifically, it is a derivative of GABA with a pentyl disubstitution at 3 position, hence, the name - gabapentin, in such a way as to form a six-membered ring. After the formation of the ring, the amine and carboxylic groups are not in the same relative positions as they are in the GABA; they are more conformationally constrained. Although it has been known for some time that gabapentin must bind to the α2δ-1 protein in order to act pharmacologically (see Pharmacodynamics), the three-dimensional structure of the α2δ-1 protein with gabapentin bound (or alternatively, the native amino acid, L-Isoleucine bound) has only recently been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. A figure of this drug-bound structure is shown in the Chemistry section of the entry on gabapentinoid drugs. This study confirms other findings to show that both compounds alternatively can bind at a single extracellular site (somewhat distant from the calcium conducting pore of the voltage gated calcium channel α1 subunit) on the calcium channel and chemotaxis (Cache1) domain of α2δ-1. === Synthesis === A process for chemical synthesis and isolation of gabapentin with high yield and purity starts with conversion of 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic anhydride to 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic acid monoamide and is followed by a 'Hofmann' rearrangement in an aqueous solution of sodium hypobromite prepared in situ. == History == GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. By the early 1970s, it was appreciated that there are two main classes of GABA receptors, GABAA and GABAB and also that baclofen was an agonist of GABAB receptors. Gabapentin was designed, synthesized and tested in mice by researchers at the pharmaceutical company Goedecke AG in Freiburg, Germany (a subsidiary of Parke-Davis). It was meant to be an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA that could more easily cross the blood–brain barrier. It was first synthesized in 1974/75 and described in 1975 by Satzinger and Hartenstein. The first pharmacology findings published were sedating properties and prevention of seizures in mice evoked by the GABA antagonist, thiosemicarbazide. Shortly after, gabapentin was shown in vitro to reduce the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine from slices of rat caudate nucleus (striatum). This study provided evidence that the action of gabapentin, unlike baclofen, did not arise from the GABAB receptor. Initial clinical trials utilizing small numbers of subjects were for treatment of spasticity and migraine but neither study had statistical power to allow conclusions. In 1987, the first positive results with gabapentin were obtained in a clinical trial using three dose groups versus pre-treatment seizure frequency for 75 days, as add-on treatment in patients who still had seizures despite taking other medications. This study did not show statistically significant results, but it did show a strong dose-related trend to decreased frequency of seizures. Under the brand name Neurontin, it was first approved in the United Kingdom in May 1993, for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration followed in December 1993, also for use as an adjuvant (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs) medication to control partial seizures in adults; that indication was extended to children in 2000. Subsequently, gabapentin was approved in the United States for the treatment of pain from postherpetic neuralgia in 2002. A generic version of gabapentin first became available in the United States in 2004. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration, under the brand name Gralise, was approved in the United States for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in January 2011. In recent years, gabapentin has been prescribed for an increasing range of disorders and is one of the more common medications used, particularly in elderly people. == Society and culture == === Legal status === ==== United Kingdom ==== Effective April 2019, the United Kingdom reclassified the drug as a class C controlled substance. ==== United States ==== Gabapentin is not a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Effective 1 July 2017, Kentucky classified gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance statewide. Gabapentin is scheduled V drug in other states such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Utah, and Virginia. === Off-label promotion === Although some small, non-controlled studies in the 1990s—mostly sponsored by gabapentin's manufacturer—suggested that treatment for bipolar disorder with gabapentin may be promising, the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is not effective. ==== Franklin v. Parke-Davis case ==== After the corporate acquisition of the original patent holder, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer admitted that there had been violations of FDA guidelines regarding the promotion of unproven off-label uses for gabapentin in the Franklin v. Parke-Davis case. While off-label prescriptions are common for many drugs, marketing of off-label uses of a drug is not. In 2004, Warner-Lambert (which subsequently was acquired by Pfizer) agreed to plead guilty for activities of its Parke-Davis subsidiary, and to pay $430 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges regarding the marketing of Neurontin for off-label purposes. The 2004 settlement was one of the largest in U.S. history up to that point, and the first off-label promotion case brought successfully under the False Claims Act. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan sued Pfizer Inc., alleging that the pharmaceutical company had misled Kaiser by recommending Neurontin as an off-label treatment for certain conditions (including bipolar disorder, migraines, and neuropathic pain). In 2010, a federal jury in Massachusetts ruled in Kaiser's favor, finding that Pfizer violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and was liable for US$47.36 million in damages, which was automatically trebled to just under $142.1 million. Aetna, Inc. and a group of employer health plans prevailed in their similar Neurontin-related claims against Pfizer. Pfizer appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the verdict, and in 2013, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. ==== Gabasync ==== Gabasync, a treatment consisting of a combination of gabapentin and two other medications (flumazenil and hydroxyzine) as well as therapy, is an ineffective treatment promoted for methamphetamine addiction, though it had also been claimed to be effective for dependence on alcohol or cocaine. It was marketed as PROMETA. While the individual drugs had been approved by the FDA, their off-label use for addiction treatment has not. Gabasync was marketed by Hythiam, Inc. which is owned by Terren Peizer, a former junk bond salesman who has since been convicted of securities fraud relative to another company. Hythiam charges up to $15,000 per patient to license its use (of which half goes to the prescribing physician, and half to Hythiam). In a November 2005 article entitled ""Curb Your Cravings For This Stock"", Barrons wrote: ""If the venture works out for patients and the investing public, it'll be a rare success for Peizer, who's promoted a series of disappointing small-cap medical or technology stocks ... since his days at Drexel"". 60 Minutes, NBC News, and The Dallas Morning News criticized Peizer after the company bypassed clinical studies and government approval when bringing to market Prometa; the addiction drug proved to be completely ineffective. CBS News journalist Scott Pelley said to Peizer in 2007: ""Depending on who you talk to, you're either a revolutionary or a snake oil salesman."" Journalist Adam Feuerstein opined: ""most of what Peizer says is dubious-sounding hype"". In November 2011, the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (financed by Hythiam and carried out at UCLA) were published in the peer-reviewed journal Addiction. It concluded that Gabasync is ineffective: ""The PROMETA protocol, consisting of flumazenil, gabapentin and hydroxyzine, appears to be no more effective than placebo in reducing methamphetamine use, retaining patients in treatment or reducing methamphetamine craving."" ==== Usage trends ==== The period from 2008 to 2018 saw a significant increase in the consumption of gabapentinoids. A study published in Nature Communications in 2023 highlights this trend, demonstrating a notable escalation in sales of gabapentinoids. The study, which analyzed healthcare data across 65 countries/ regions, found that the consumption rate of gabapentinoids had doubled over the decade, driven by their use in a wide range of indications. === Brand names === Gabapentin was originally marketed under the brand name Neurontin. Since it became generic, it has been marketed worldwide using over 300 different brand names. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration was introduced in 2011, for postherpetic neuralgia under the brand name Gralise. In the US, Neurontin is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Related drugs === Parke-Davis developed a drug called pregabalin, which is related in structure to gabapentin, as a successor to gabapentin. Another similar drug atagabalin has been unsuccessfully tried by Pfizer as a treatment for insomnia. A prodrug form (gabapentin enacarbil) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). === Recreational use === When taken in excess, gabapentin can induce euphoria, a sense of calm, a cannabis-like high, improved sociability, and reduced alcohol or cocaine cravings. Also known on the streets as ""Gabbies"", gabapentin was reported in 2017 to be increasingly abused and misused for these euphoric effects. About 1 percent of the responders to an Internet poll and 22 percent of those attending addiction facilities had a history of abuse of gabapentin. Gabapentin misuse, toxicity, and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased from 2013 to 2017. After Kentucky implemented stricter legislation regarding opioid prescriptions in 2012, there was an increase in gabapentin-only and multi-drug use from 2012 to 2015. The majority of these cases were from overdose in suspected suicide attempts. These rates were also accompanied by increases in abuse and recreational use. Withdrawal symptoms, often resembling those of benzodiazepine withdrawal, play a role in the physical dependence some users experience. Its misuse predominantly coincides with the usage of other CNS depressant drugs, namely opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. == Veterinary use == In cats, gabapentin can be used as an analgesic in multi-modal pain management, anxiety medication to reduce stress during travel or vet visits, and anticonvulsant. Veterinarians may prescribe gabapentin as an anticonvulsant and pain reliever in dogs. It has beneficial effects for treating epilepsy, different kinds of pain (chronic, neuropathic, and post-operative pain), and anxiety, lip-licking behaviour, storm phobia, fear-based aggression. It is also used to treat chronic pain-associated nerve inflammation in horses and dogs. Side effects include tiredness and loss of coordination, but these effects generally go away within 24 hours of starting the medication. == See also == Medicine portal == References == == External links ==",Aclonium,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0010437668533995748)])","('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.09707586467266083), (',', -0.31625840067863464), ('ĠMED', -0.0012849654303863645), ('ICAL', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003928445279598236)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/gabapentin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Gabapentin | GABA Receptor |GABA analog| CAS 60142-96-3 | seizures and neuropathic pain| Neurontin; Aclonium; Convalis; Gabapentin Stada| InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/gabapentin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a hypoxia-activated prodrug designed to target and kill hypoxic cells within tumors. It functions by releasing the DNA crosslinking agent bromo-isophosphoramide mustard under low oxygen conditions, making it potentially effective against tumor regions where standard chemotherapy and radiation therapies are less effective due to hypoxia. Commercialization has not been pursued due to the failure of several clinical trials. == Pharmacology == Evofosfamide is a 2-nitroimidazole prodrug of the cytotoxin bromo-isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM). Evofosfamide is activated by a process that involves a 1-electron (1 e−) reduction mediated by ubiquitous cellular reductases, such as the NADPH cytochrome P450, to generate a radical anion prodrug: A) In the presence of oxygen (normoxia) the radical anion prodrug reacts rapidly with oxygen to generate the original prodrug and superoxide. Therefore, evofosfamide is relatively inert under normal oxygen conditions, remaining intact as a prodrug. B) When exposed to severe hypoxic conditions (< 0.5% O2; hypoxic zones in many tumors), however, the radical anion undergoes irreversible fragmentation, releasing the active drug Br-IPM and an azole derivative. The released cytotoxin Br-IPM alkylates DNA, inducing intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks. Evofosfamide is largely inactive under normal oxygen levels. In areas of hypoxia, evofosfamide becomes activated and converts to an alkylating cytotoxic agent resulting in DNA cross-linking. This renders cells unable to replicable their DNA and divide, leading to apoptosis. This investigational therapeutic approach of targeting the cytotoxin to hypoxic zones in tumors may cause less broad systemic toxicity that is seen with untargeted cytotoxic chemotherapies. The activation of evofosfamide to the active drug Br-IPM and the mechanism of action (MOA) via cross-linking of DNA is shown schematically below: == Drug development history == Phosphorodiamidate-based, DNA-crosslinking, bis-alkylator mustards have long been used successfully in cancer chemotherapy and include e.g. the prodrugs ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide. To demonstrate that known drugs of proven efficacy could serve as the basis of efficacious hypoxia-activated prodrugs, the 2-nitroimidizole HAP of the active phosphoramidate bis-alkylator derived from ifosfamide was synthesized. The resulting compound, TH-281, had a high HCR (hypoxia cytotoxicity ratio), a quantitative assessment of its hypoxia selectivity. Subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies showed that replacement of the chlorines in the alkylator portion of the prodrug with bromines improved potency about 10-fold. The resulting, final compound is evofosfamide (TH-302) which was developed by Threshold Pharmaceuticals Inc. . Threshold Pharmaceuticals Inc. applied for a patent on evofosfamide in 2006 which was granted in 2011. In 2012, Threshold signed a global license and co-development agreement for evofosfamide with Merck KGaA. Threshold was responsible for the development of evofosfamide in the soft tissue sarcoma indication in the United States. In all other cancer indications, Threshold and Merck KGaA developed evofosfamide together. After evofosfamide failed to improve longevity in patients in phase three clinical trials, Merck abandoned attempts to commercialize evofosfamide in 2015. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Evofosfamide synthesis involves several steps, starting with the preparation of 2-nitroimidazole derivatives: Preparation of 2-nitroimidazole: This is the key bioreductive group used in the synthesis. Formation of the prodrug: The 2-nitroimidazole is linked to a brominated derivative of isophosphoramide mustard. Activation under hypoxic conditions: In low oxygen environments, typical of solid tumors, the prodrug is activated to release the cytotoxic agent. The activation under hypoxic conditions allows evofosfamide to target hypoxic tumor cells selectively, making it a candidate in for cancer treatment. == Clinical trials == === Overview and results === Evofosfamide (TH-302) was evaluated in clinical studies as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy agents and other targeted cancer drugs. The indications were a broad spectrum of solid tumor types and blood cancers. Evofosfamide clinical trials (as of 16 March 2025): === Soft tissue sarcoma === Evofosfamide was tested in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The study TH-CR-403 was a single arm trial investigating evofosfamide in combination with doxorubicin. Evofosfamide was further tested in the Phase 3 clinical trial TH-CR-406/SARC021 with results published in 2017 indicating no improvement in patient mortality rates. === Metastatic pancreatic cancer === Evofosfamide was studied in combination with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study TH-CR-404 compared gemcitabine with gemcitabine plus evofosfamide. The study showed comparable efficacy profiles for evofosfamide and nab-paclitaxel when combined with gemcitabine; however, the hematologic toxicity was higher for patients given evofosfamide vs. nab-paclitaxel. In the Phase 3 MAESTRO study, patients with previously untreated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with evofosfamide in combination with gemcitabine did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. === Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma === Oxygen deficient conditions are linked to tumor progression throughout the body and poses an issue in cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) function in hypoxic conditions and inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Evofosfamide is a HAP that targets tumor progression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissues by inhibiting the overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In this study , the efficacy of Evofosfamide along with cisplastin (DDP) in blocking cell progression was measured. ""The combination of evofosfamide with DDP had a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity in the NPC cell lines by combination index values assessment. Cell cycle G2 phase was arrested after treated with 0.05 μmol/L evofosfamide under hypoxia. Histone H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) (a marker of DNA damage) expression increased while HIF-1α expression suppressed after evofosfamide treatment under hypoxic conditions"". These findings allow for evidence for Evofosfamide to be pushed towards clinical trials to further investigate the potential to be developed as an FDA approved anticancer drug. == See also == Hypoxia-activated prodrugs Hypoxia PR-104 CP-506 == References ==",Evofosfamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1269545704126358), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005656072753481567), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018168339505791664)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evofosfamide ', [])"
3250,"('Inosine',)","Endogenous, Medical","Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. It was discovered in 1965 in analysis of RNA transferase. Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition. == Reactions == Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine. Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements. == Clinical significance == Subsequent studies in humans suggest that inosine supplementation has no effect on athletic performance. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury and for administration after stroke, because observation suggests that inosine induces axonal rewiring. After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients. With phase II trials for Parkinson's disease completed, inosine will continue to phase III trials. Earlier trials suggested that patients with the highest serum urate levels had slower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL). Alseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the use of inosine to treat stroke and was investigating the drug in the MS setting. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral. == Binding == Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor. == Biotechnology == When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with any natural base. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytosine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double-stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches. == Fitness == Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. == Feeding stimulant == Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine 5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively small. == See also == Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase Inosine pranobex Nucleobase == References == == External links == PDR health study",Inosine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.28465592861175537), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.688212614681106e-05), (' MED', -0.28272396326065063), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.008633950725197792), (' FOOD', -0.22801315784454346), (',', -0.10030878335237503), (' PERSONAL', -0.0011034219060093164), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.46604108810424805), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -3.0278701160568744e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.3996559679508209), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.014166269451379776), ('ĠFOOD', -0.014400484971702099), (',', -0.4740981459617615), ('ĠINDU', -0.09902619570493698), ('ST', -4.5536911784438416e-05), ('RI', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25198712944984436)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD', [('END', -0.00016957100888248533), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -7.493430894101039e-05), (' MED', -0.5764615535736084), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.06196846812963486), (' FOOD', -5.512236498361744e-07)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000019,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9316764/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9708727/ ', [])"
3251,"('Cytarabine', 'Cytosine œ≤-d-arabinofuranoside', 'Cytosine arabinoside', 'Ara-c', 'Arabinocytidine')",Medical,"Cytarabine, also known as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), is a chemotherapy medication used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is given by injection into a vein, under the skin, or into the cerebrospinal fluid. There is a liposomal formulation for which there is tentative evidence of better outcomes in lymphoma involving the meninges. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, vomiting, diarrhea, liver problems, rash, ulcer formation in the mouth, and bleeding. Other serious side effects include loss of consciousness, lung disease, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Cytarabine is in the antimetabolite and nucleoside analog families of medication. It works by blocking the function of DNA polymerase. Cytarabine was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and in lymphomas, where it is the backbone of induction chemotherapy. Cytarabine also possesses antiviral activity, and it has been used for the treatment of generalised herpesvirus infection. However, cytarabine is not very selective in this setting and causes bone marrow suppression and other severe side effects. Therefore, ara-C is not a useful antiviral agent in humans because of its toxic profile. Cytarabine is also used in the study of the nervous system to control the proliferation of glial cells in cultures, the amount of glial cells having an important impact on neurons. Recently, cytarabine was reported to promote robust and persistent neuronal differentiation in NSC-34 motor neuron-like cell line. Cytarabine is permissive, dispensable, and mostly irreversible in priming NSC-34 cells for neurite initiation and regeneration after mechanical dislodgement. == Side effects == One of the unique toxicities of cytarabine is cerebellar toxicity when given in high doses, which may lead to ataxia. Cytarabine may cause granulocytopenia and other impaired body defenses, which may lead to infection, and thrombocytopenia, which may lead to hemorrhage. Toxicity: pancreatitis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, GI disturbances, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, fever, and dermatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Rarely, myelopathy has been reported after high dose or frequent intrathecal Ara-C administration. When used in protocols designated as high dose, cytarabine can cause cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, ocular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, severe GI ulceration and peripheral neuropathy (rare). To prevent the side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency, various derivatives of these drugs (including amino acid, peptide, fatty acid and phosphates) have been evaluated, as well as different delivery systems. == Mechanism of action == Cytosine arabinoside combines a cytosine base with an arabinose sugar. It is an antimetabolic agent with the chemical name of 1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Certain sponges, where similar compounds were originally found, use arabinoside sugars for chemical defense. Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human deoxycytosine to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for mitosis, are therefore most affected. Cytosine arabinoside also inhibits both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of nucleosides. Other cancer drugs modify the base. Cytarabine is often given by continuous intravenous infusion, which follows a biphasic elimination – initial fast clearance rate followed by a slower rate of the analog. Cytarabine is transported into the cell primarily by hENT-1. It is then monophosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and eventually cytarabine-5´-triphosphate, which is the active metabolite being incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis. Several mechanisms of resistance have been reported. Cytarabine is rapidly deaminated by cytidine deaminase in the serum into the inactive uracil derivative. Cytarabine-5´-monophosphate is deaminated by deoxycytidylate deaminase, leading to the inactive uridine-5´-monophosphate analog. Cytarabine-5´-triphosphate is a substrate for SAMHD1. Furthermore, SAMHD1 has been shown to limit the efficacy of cytarabine efficacy in patients. When used as an antiviral, cytarabine-5´-triphosphate functions by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is able to inhibit herpesvirus and vaccinia virus replication in cells during tissue culture. However, cytarabine treatment was only effective for herpesvirus infection in a murine model. In mice, Ara-CTP (cytarabine-5'-triphosphate) blocks memory consolidation, but not short-term memory, of a context fear conditioning event. The blockage of memory consolidation was proposed to be due to the inhibition by Ara-CTP of the DNA non-homologous end joining pathway. Thus transient DNA breakage followed by non-homologous end joining appear to be necessary steps in the formation of a long-term memory of an event. == History == Isolation of arabinose-containing nucleotides from the Caribbean sponge Cryptotheca crypta (now Tectitethya crypta) together with the realization that these compounds could act as DNA synthesis chain terminators led to exploration of these novel nucleotides as potential anticancer therapeutics. Cytarabine was first synthesized in 1959 by Richard Walwick, Walden Roberts, and Charles Dekker at the University of California, Berkeley. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June 1969, and was initially marketed in the US by Upjohn under the brand name Cytosar-U. == Names == It is also known as ara-C (arabinofuranosyl cytidine).

In vitro, it is bactericidal against C. difficile and suppresses bacterial toxin production; the mechanism of action is thought to involve inhibition of cell division. It has properties which are desirable for the treatment of CDI, namely that it is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic which exhibits activity against C. difficile while having little impact on other normal intestinal flora and that it is only minimally absorbed systemically after oral administration. At the time ridinilazole was developed, there were only three antibiotics in use for treating CDI: vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole. The recurrence rate of CDI is high, which has spurred research into other treatment options with the aim to reduce the rate of recurrence. As of 2019, two phase II trials have been completed and two phase III trials comparing ridinilazole to vancomycin for CDI are expected to be completed in September 2021.

3254,"('Ropinirole (hydrochloride)', 'Ropinirole', 'Ropinirol', 'Requip', 'Ropinirolum')",Medical,"Ropinirole, sold under the brand name Requip among others, is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS). It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, vomiting, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include pathological gambling, hypersexuality, low blood pressure with standing and hallucinations. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is a dopamine agonist and works by triggering dopamine D2 receptors. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 163rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ropinirole is prescribed for mainly Parkinson's disease, restless legs syndrome, and extrapyramidal symptoms. It can also reduce the side effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Parkinsonism syndrome as well as sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction caused by either SSRIs or antipsychotics. A 2008 meta-analysis found that ropinirole was less effective than pramipexole in the treatment of restless legs syndrome. == Side effects == Ropinirole can cause nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, orthostatic hypotension, and sudden sleep attacks during the daytime. Unusual side effects specific to D3 agonists such as ropinirole and pramipexole can include hypersexuality, punding and compulsive gambling, even in patients without a history of these behaviours. Ropinirole is also known to cause an effect known as ""augmentation"" when used to treat restless legs syndrome, where over time treatment with dopamine agonists will cause restless legs syndrome symptoms to become more severe. This usually leads to constant dosage increases in an attempt to offset the symptom progression. Symptoms will return to the level of severity they were experienced at before treatment was initiated if the drug is stopped; however, both ropinirole and pramipexole are known to cause painful withdrawal effects when treatment is stopped and the process of taking a patient who has been using the medication long-term off of these drugs is often very difficult and generally should be supervised by a medical professional. == Pharmacology == Ropinirole acts as a D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptor agonist with highest affinity for D3, which are mostly found in the limbic areas. It is weakly active at the 5-HT2, and α2 receptors and is said to have virtually no affinity for the 5-HT1, GABA, mAChRs, α1-, and β-adrenoreceptors. It is a potent agonist of the 5-HT2B receptor, but shows biased agonism at this receptor and does not appear to pose a risk of cardiac valvulopathy. Ropinirole is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 to form two metabolites; SK&F-104557 and SK&F-89124, both of which are renally excreted, and at doses higher than clinical, is also metabolized by CYP3A4. At doses greater than 24 mg, CYP2D6 may be inhibited, although this has been tested only in vitro. == Society and culture == It is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Cipla, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical. The discovery of the drug's utility in restless legs syndrome has been used as an example of successful drug repurposing. === Lawsuit === In November 2012, GlaxoSmithKline was ordered by a Rennes appeals court to pay Frenchman Didier Jambart 197,000 euros ($255,824); Jambart had taken ropinirole from 2003 to 2010 and exhibited risky hypersexual behavior and gambled excessively until stopping the medication.

The study group comprised 82 tinnitus subjects, 42 (51%) of whom received trimetazidine dihydrochloride and 40 (49%) who received placebo. There was no significant difference between placebo and trimetazidine groups in THI grade and VAS (both pre- and posttreatment scores) (P>0.05) and no significant improvement was observed in subjective loudness score in either group (P>0.05). Additionally there was no significant difference between groups in pre- and posttreatment pure tone hearing thresholds at all measured frequencies (P>0.05). Trimetazidine dihydrochloride therapy was ineffective for relieving chronic tinnitus. Metabolic re-wiring with preferential fatty acid oxidation has been observed in lung cancer cells. Whether the use of trimetazidine, an anti-anginal agent that inhibits fatty acid oxidation, alters clinical outcomes in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients with lung cancers is unknown. We carried out this territory-wide, retrospective cohort study of 279,894 IHD patients prescribed with trimetazidine or long-acting oral nitrates in Hong Kong (population coverage of 7.5 millions, January 1999 - December 2020). A total of 6561 patients with pre-existing or de novo lung cancers were identified. Clinical outcomes of all-cause mortality were longitudinally compared between lung cancer patients who received trimetazidine (n = 547) versus non-users (control, n = 6014). Over 902.9 ± 1410.6 days, lower incidence of deaths occurred in the trimetazidine group (79.0 %, n = 432/547) compared to controls (90.5 %, n = 5442/6014, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that trimetazidine use was associated with significantly higher survival from all-cause mortality in IHD patients (trimetazidine: mean survival = 1840.6 [95 %CI 1596.0-2085.3], versus control: 1056.7 [95 %CI 1011.3-1102.0] days, Log Rank = 69.4, P < 0.001). Cox regression showed that trimetazidine use was significantly associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality in crude (HR = 0.60 [95 %CI: 0.53 to 0.68], P < 0.001) and multivariable models (HR = 0.65 [95 % CI: 0.57 to 0.74], P < 0.001). Pre-specified analyses amongst patients with pre-existing lung cancers yielded similar findings (HR = 0.49 [95 %CI: 0.35 to 0.67], P < 0.001). Survival benefits related to trimetazidine use was predominantly restricted to non-cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.001). Trimetazidine use is associated with higher overall survival in IHD patients with lung cancers, particularly from non-cardiovascular death. These findings need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials. This research work aimed to target the early morning peak symptoms of chronic stable angina through formulating antianginal drug, Trimetazidine (TMZ) in a pulsatile-release tablet. The core formulae were optimized using 22 .31 factorial design to minimize disintegration time (DT) and maximize drug release after 5 minutes (Q5min). Different ratios of Eudragit S100 and Eudragit L100 were used as a coating mixture for the selected core with or without a second coating layer of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E50). The different formulation variables were statistically optimized for their effect on lag time and drug release after 7 hours (Q7h) using BoxBehnken design. The optimized formula (PO) was subjected to stability study and pharmacokinetic assessment on New Zealand rabbits. The optimal core (F8) was found to have 1.76 min disintegration time and 61.45% Q5min PO showed a lag time of 6.17 h with 94.80% Q7h and retained good stability over three months. The pharmacokinetics study confirmed the pulsatile-release pattern with Cmax of 206.19 ng/ml at 5.33 h (Tmax) and 95.85% relative bioavailability compared to TMZ solution. Overall pulsatile-release tablets of TMZ successfully released the drug after a desirable lag time, providing a promising approach for early morning anginal symptoms relief.",Trimetazidine (dihydrochloride),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001541257370263338), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024949158541858196)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

As a noun, Pound uses ""periplum"" simply to refer to a voyage or journey, as in canto 74, line 3: ""The great periplum brings in the stars to our shore."" Here the ""great periplum"" refers to the daily journey made by the Sun God, Helios. ""Periplum"" is also used in The Cantos adverbially, as we see in this example from canto 59: Periplum, not as land looks on a map But as sea bord seen by men sailing. (Line 82-4) In his book ABC of Reading, Pound describes the geography of Homer's Odyssey as ""correct geography; not as you would find it if you had a geography book and a map, but as it would be in 'periplum,' that is, as a coasting sailor would find it."" That is to say that Homer's geography is understood from the point of view of a sailor who is actually ""in periplum"" or in the midst of the voyage itself. In The Cantos, Pound similarly perceives space from the point of view of a poet in the midst of experience rather than from an a posteriori position.

3259,"('Cotinine', '(s)-cotinine', 'Cotinina', 'Cotininum', 'Cotinine (-)')",Medical,"Cotinine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and is also the predominant metabolite of nicotine, typically used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Cotinine is currently being studied as a treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Cotinine was developed as an antidepressant as a fumaric acid salt, cotinine fumarate, to be sold under the brand name Scotine, but it was never marketed. Similarly to nicotine, cotinine binds to, activates, and desensitizes neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, though at much lower potency in comparison. It has demonstrated nootropic and antipsychotic-like effects in animal models. Cotinine treatment has also been shown to reduce depression, anxiety, and fear-related behavior as well as memory impairment in animal models of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, treatment with cotinine in humans was reported to have no significant physiologic, subjective, or performance effects in one study, though others suggest that this may not be the case. Because cotinine is the main metabolite to nicotine and has been shown to be pharmacologically active, it has been suggested that some of nicotine's effects in the nervous system may be mediated by cotinine and/or complex interactions with nicotine itself. == Pharmacology == A few studies indicate that the affinity for cotinine to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is about 100 times lower than nicotine's. Some work suggests that cotinine may be a positive allosteric modulator of α7 nAChRs. If this is true, cotinine would facilitate endogenous neurotransmission without directly stimulating nAChRs. === Pharmacokinetics === Cotinine has an in vivo half-life of approximately 20 hours, and is typically detectable for several days (up to one week) after the use of tobacco. The level of cotinine in the blood, saliva, and urine is proportionate to the amount of exposure to tobacco smoke, so it is a valuable indicator of tobacco smoke exposure, including secondary (passive) smoke. People who smoke menthol cigarettes may retain cotinine in the blood for a longer period because menthol can compete with enzymatic metabolism of cotinine. African American smokers generally have higher plasma cotinine levels than Caucasian smokers. Males generally have higher plasma cotinine levels than females. These systematic differences in cotinine levels were attributed to variation in CYP2A6 activity. At steady state, plasma cotinine levels are determined by the amount of cotinine formation and the rate of cotinine removal, which are both mediated by the enzyme CYP2A6. Since CYP2A6 activity differs by sex (estrogen induces CYP2A6) and genetic variation, cotinine accumulates in individuals with slower CYP2A6 activity, resulting in substantial differences in cotinine levels for a given tobacco exposure. === Detection in body fluids === Drug tests can detect cotinine in the blood, urine, or saliva. Salivary cotinine concentrations are highly correlated to blood cotinine concentrations, and can detect cotinine in a low range, making it the preferable option for a less invasive method of tobacco exposure testing. Urine cotinine concentrations average four to six times higher than those in blood or saliva, making urine a more sensitive matrix to detect low-concentration exposure. Cotinine levels <10 ng/mL are considered to be consistent with no active smoking. Values of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL are associated with light smoking or moderate passive exposure, and levels above 300 ng/mL are seen in heavy smokers — more than 20 cigarettes a day. In urine, values between 11 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 500 ng/mL or more. In saliva, values between 1 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated with light smoking or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 100 ng/mL or more. Cotinine assays provide an objective quantitative measure that is more reliable than smoking histories or counting the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Cotinine also permits the measurement of exposure to second-hand smoke (passive smoking). However, tobacco users attempting to quit with the help of nicotine replacement therapies (i.e., gum, lozenge, patch, inhaler, and nasal spray) will also test positive for cotinine, since all common NRT therapies contain nicotine that is metabolized in the same way. Therefore, the presence of cotinine is not a conclusive indication of tobacco use. Cotinine levels can be used in research to explore the question of the amount of nicotine delivered to the user of e-cigarettes, where laboratory smoking machines have many problems replicating real-life conditions. Serum cotinine concentration has been used for decades in US population surveys of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to monitor tobacco use, to monitor levels and trends in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and to study the relationship between tobacco smoke and chronic health conditions. An estimated one in four nonsmokers (approximately 58 million persons) were exposed to secondhand smoke during 2013-2014. Nearly 40% of children aged 3–11 years were exposed as were 50% of non-Hispanic blacks. == References ==",Cotinine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.13292722404003143)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.08668778836727142), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), (',', -0.005248102825134993), ('ĠEND', -0.06942633539438248), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25215139985084534)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0005535095697268844), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotinine ', [])"

Gimatecan produced excellent outcomes orally with prolonged, low-dose, daily treatments. The aim of this study was to assess the antitumor efficacy of i.v. administered gimatecan. The antitumor activity of gimatecan delivered i.v. q4dx4 was evaluated in nude mice bearing human tumors and compared to clinically available anticancer drugs. Intravenous administration of gimatecan showed superior efficacy with remarkable achievements at well tolerated doses. Moreover, prolonged treatments with i.v. administered gimatecan showed efficacy in models of cancer refractory to current therapeutic approaches, like an orthotopic brain tumor. Although the oral route is practical for gimatecan administration, the results support the interest in developing a suitable i.v. formulation in an attempt to further exploit the therapeutic potential of the compound. Sigma-Tau Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite SpA and Novartis AG are developing oral gimatecan, a camptothecin derivative, for the potential treatment of tumors, including glioblastoma. The realization that position 7 of camptothecin allows several options in chemical manipulation of the drug has stimulated a systematic investigation of a variety of substituents in this position. These efforts resulted in the identification of a novel series of 7-oxyiminomethyl derivatives. Among compounds of this series we have selected a promising lipophilic derivative, gimatecan, for further development. The relevant features of gimatecan are: (i) marked cytotoxic potency, likely related to multiple factors, including a potent inhibition of topoisomerase I, a persistent stabilization of the cleavable complex, an increased intracellular accumulation and a peculiar subcellular localization; (ii) lack of recognition by known resistance-related transport systems; (iii) increased lactone stability and favorable pharmacokinetics; (iv) good oral bioavailability; and (v) an impressive antitumor efficacy in a large panel of human tumor xenografts, with various treatment schedules. Phase I clinical studies with oral administration support the preclinical results of the novel camptothecin. Using different schedules and dosing durations, gimatecan exhibited an acceptable toxicity profile, with myelotoxicity being the dose-limiting toxic effect. An appreciable number of tumor responses was achieved and favorable pharmacokinetics with a very long terminal half-life was observed. The clinical development of gimatecan is currently ongoing, with phase II studies in diverse tumor types (colon, lung, breast carcinoma and pediatric tumors).",Gimatecan,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003620922507252544), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024905160535126925)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232808/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='A phase II trial of oral gimatecan for recurrent glioblastoma - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23232808/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, discovered and developed by the National Institutes of Health and Pfizer. Common side effects include diarrhea, headache, and high blood pressure. Serious side effects may include infections, cancer, and pulmonary embolism. In 2019, the safety committee of the European Medicines Agency began a review of tofacitinib and recommended that doctors temporarily not prescribe the 10 mg twice-daily dose to people at high risk for pulmonary embolism. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also released warnings about the risk of blood clots. An important side effect of Jakinibs is serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections. In the phase III trials of tofacitinib among opportunistic infections, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 3 cases all of which were initially negative upon screening for TB. It was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2012. The extended release version was approved in February 2016. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Rheumatoid arthritis === Tofacitinib citrate is approved for medical use in the United States with an indication ""to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate."" In the European Union, in combination with methotrexate, tofacitinib citrate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. It can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate. === Ulcerative colitis === In May 2018, the FDA approved tofacitinib citrate ""for the treatment of adult patients in the U.S. with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis."" Tofacitinib citrate is the first oral JAK inhibitor approved for use in chronic ulcerative colitis. == Adverse effects == Tofacitinib was initially not approved by European regulatory agencies because of concerns over efficacy and safety, although by 2018, the European Commission had approved it. Animal studies with tofacitinib conducted prior to human trials showed some carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during the first three months in controlled clinical trials (occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with tofacitinib citrate monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, headache, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis (the ""common cold""). Tofacitinib is required by the FDA to have a boxed warning on its label about possible injury and death due to problems such as infections, lymphoma, and other malignancies, which can arise from use of this drug. Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients receiving tofacitinib. Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder has been observed at an increased rate in renal transplant patients treated with tofacitinib while on immunosuppressive medications. Patients are warned to avoid use of tofacitinib citrate during an ""active serious infection, including localized infections."" Doctors are advised to use it with caution in patients who may be at increased risk of gastrointestinal perforations. Laboratory monitoring is recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes, and lipids. Tofacitinib claims to have no contraindications, but doctors are advised to reduce the patient's dosage when combined with ""potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4),"" such as ketoconazole, or one or more combined medications that result in both moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 and potent inhibition of CYP2C19 such as fluconazole. Furthermore, immunizations with live vaccines should be avoided by tofacitinib users. According to postmarketing research, tofacitinib may also increase the risk for pulmonary embolism. Prescribers should consider risk factors for pulmonary embolism, including age, obesity, smoking, and immobilization before prescribing this medication. Patients taking this medication, irrespective of indication or risk factors, should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism. == Mechanism == It is an inhibitor of the enzyme janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and janus kinase 3 (JAK 3), which means that it interferes with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which transmits extracellular information into the cell nucleus, influencing DNA transcription. In a mouse model of established arthritis, tofacitinib rapidly improved disease by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and suppressing STAT1-dependent genes in joint tissue. This efficacy in this disease model correlated with the inhibition of both JAK1 and JAK3 signaling pathways, suggesting that tofacitinib may exert therapeutic benefit via pathways that are not exclusive to inhibition of JAK3. == History == The potential significance of JAK3 inhibition was first discovered in the laboratory of John O'Shea, an immunologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 1994, Pfizer was approached by the NIH to form a public-private partnership to evaluate and bring to market experimental compounds based on this research. Pfizer initially declined the partnership, but agreed in 1996, after the elimination of an NIH policy dictating that the market price of a product resulting from such a partnership would need to be commensurate with the investment of public taxpayer revenue and the ""health and safety needs of the public."" Pfizer worked with O'Shea's laboratory to define the structure and function of JAK3 and its receptors, and then handled the drug discovery, preclinical development, and clinical development of tofacitinib in-house. The drug was coded as CP-690,550 during development. Its original recommended International nonproprietary name (rINN) was tasocitinib, but that was overruled during the INN approval process as being not optimally differentiable from other existing INNs, so the name ""tofacitinib"" was proposed and became the INN. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A 2014 study showed that tofacitinib treatment was able to convert white fat tissues into more metabolically active brown fat, suggesting it may have potential applications in the treatment of obesity. In November 2012, the FDA approved tofacitinib to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, methotrexate. The FDA approved only the five-mg, twice-daily dose on the grounds that a higher dose was not considered to have an adequate risk-to-benefit ratio. In September 2020, the FDA approved tofacitinib for the treatment of children and adolescents two years of age and older with active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis. In December 2021, the FDA approved tofacitinib for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis. As of June 2021, tofacitinib is available as a generic medicine in the US. == Society and culture == === Economics === Pfizer reported revenue of US$1.703 billion for Xeljanz in 2023. In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Xeljanz as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Xeljanz's wholesale acquisition cost rose by 6%, leading to an additional $72 million in costs to U.S. payers. === Names === Tofacitinib is marketed as Xeljanz except for Russia, where it is marketed as Jaquinus. == Research == As of August 2024, recent research on tofacitinib confirms its effectiveness in treating moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. New studies are exploring its safety profile, expanding indications (such as ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis), and comparing it with other treatments. Ongoing research also focuses on optimizing dosage and evaluating combination therapies. For the latest findings, consult recent peer-reviewed studies and clinical guidelines. It has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis in phase III studies. As of November 2013 it was studied in immunological diseases, as well as for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. === Psoriasis === Tofacitinib is an investigational drug in psoriasis. As of October 2015, it demonstrated its effectiveness for plaque psoriasis in phase III, randomized, controlled trials in comparison to placebo and to etanercept. In particular, a ten-mg, twice-daily dose of tofacitinib was shown to be not inferior to etanercept 50 mg, subcutaneously, twice weekly. In October 2015, the FDA rejected approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of psoriasis due to safety concerns. === Alopecia areata === Based on preclinical studies in a mouse model of the disease, tofacitinib has been investigated for the treatment of alopecia areata. Early case reports suggested potential efficacy, as did a phase II open-label clinical trial, published in tandem with a phase II clinical trial showing the same for ruxolitinib. === Vitiligo === In a June 2015 case report, a 53-year-old woman with vitiligo showed noticeable improvement after taking tofacitinib for five months. === Atopic dermatitis === The results of using tofacitinib in six patients with recalcitrant atopic dermatitis was published in September 2015. All saw improvement in their atopic dermatitis without any adverse events. === Ankylosing spondylitis === In 2021 and 2022, results of a phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were reported, that showed significant improvements for patients with active ankylosing spondylitis compared to placebo. === Ulcerative colitis === As of November 2013, it was studied for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.The FDA approved tofacitinib in May 2018 for treatment of ulcerative colitis. == References ==",Tasocitinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02464781142771244), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.030792580917477608)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofacitinib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Tofacitinib', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofacitinib?utm_source=openai')])"

It is also an important active metabolite of spironolactone, and partially accounts for its therapeutic effects. == Medical uses == Canrenone has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women. === Heart failure === Two studies of canrenone in people with heart failure have shown a mortality benefit compared to placebo. In the evaluation which studied people with chronic heart failure (CHF), people that were treated with canrenone displayed a lower number of deaths compared to the placebo group, indicating a death and morbidity benefit of the medication. One study compared 166 treated with canrenone to 336 given conventional therapy lasting 10 years. Differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed between both patient groups where, patients treated with canrenone, showed a lower blood pressure compared to conventional therapy. Uric acid was lower in the group treated with canrenone; however, no differences were seen in potassium, sodium, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Left ventricular mass was also lower in the group treated with canrenone and a greater progression of NYHA class was observed in the control group compared to patients treated with canrenone. Another study concluded that treatment with canrenone in patients with chronic heart failure improves diastolic function and further decreased BNP levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Canrenone is reportedly more potent as an antimineralocorticoid relative to spironolactone, but is considerably less potent and effective as an antiandrogen. Similarly to spironolactone, canrenone inhibits steroidogenic enzymes such as 11β-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, and 21-hydroxylase, but once again, is comparatively less potent in doing so. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of canrenone is about 16.5 hours. === As a metabolite === Canrenone is an active metabolite of spironolactone, canrenoic acid, and potassium canrenoate, and is considered to be partially responsible for their effects. It has been found to have approximately 10 to 25% of the potassium-sparing diuretic effect of spironolactone, whereas another metabolite, 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), accounts for around 80% of the potassium-sparing effect of the drug. == History == Canrenone was described and characterized in 1959.

L-Homoserine is not one of the common amino acids encoded by DNA. It differs from the proteinogenic amino acid serine by insertion of an additional −CH2− unit into the backbone. Homoserine, or its lactone form, is the product of a cyanogen bromide cleavage of a peptide by degradation of methionine. Homoserine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of three essential amino acids: methionine, threonine (an isomer of homoserine), and isoleucine. Its complete biosynthetic pathway includes glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) or citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle), and the aspartate metabolic pathway. It forms by two reductions of aspartic acid via the intermediacy of aspartate semialdehyde. Specifically, the enzyme homoserine dehydrogenase, in association with NADPH, catalyzes a reversible reaction that interconverts L-aspartate-4-semialdehyde to L-homoserine. Then, two other enzymes, homoserine kinase and homoserine O-succinyltransferase use homoserine as a substrate and produce phosphohomoserine and O-succinyl homoserine respectively. == Applications == Commercially, homoserine can serve as precursor to the synthesis of isobutanol and 1,4-butanediol. Purified homoserine is used in enzyme structural studies. Also, homoserine has played important roles in studies to elucidate peptide synthesis and synthesis of proteoglycan glycopeptides. Bacterial cell lines can make copious amounts of this amino acid. == Biosynthesis == Homoserine is produced from aspartate via aspartate-4-semialdehyde, which is produced from β-phosphoaspartate. By the action of homoserine dehydrogenases, the semialdehyde is converted to homoserine. L-Homoserine is substrate for homoserine kinase, yielding phosphohomoserine (homoserine-phosphate), which is converted to by threonine synthase to yield L-threonine. Homoserine is converted to O-succinyl homoserine by homoserine O-succinyltransferase, a precursor to L-methionine. Homoserine allosterically inhibits aspartate kinase and glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate dehydrogenase reversibly converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and α-ketoglutarate coverts to oxaloacetate through the citric cycle. Threonine acts as another allosteric inhibitor of aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase, but it is a competitive inhibitor of homoserine kinase. == References ==",Homoserine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00599954416975379)])","('ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('EN', -0.32280799746513367), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -5.864924969500862e-05), ('OUS', -2.622600959512056e-06), (',', -0.10026244074106216), ('ĠINDU', -0.08126354217529297), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02328667603433132)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.38694050908088684)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoserine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Homoserine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoserine?utm_source=openai')])"

Its main effect is to reduce the activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. It does not have much antiemetic effect when symptoms are due to motion sickness. This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors. Dolasetron breaks down slowly, staying in the body for a long time. One dose is usually administered once or twice daily and lasts 4 to 9 hours. This drug is removed from the body by the liver and kidneys. It was patented in 1986 and approved for medical use in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are the primary drugs used to treat and prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Many times they are given intravenously about 30 minutes before beginning therapy. Post-operative and post-radiation nausea and vomiting Is a possible therapy for nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute gastroenteritis Unlike most other 5HT3 antagonists, data is lacking for use of dolasetron with aprepitant in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is also sometimes used as an antiemetic (anti-vomiting medication) in veterinary medicine for dogs and cats. == Adverse effects == Dolasetron is a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. Headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use. There is a potential for prolonging of the QT interval to occur as well. There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use. Dolasetron is broken down by the liver's cytochrome P450 system and has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system. Intravenous dolasetron is contraindicated in Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are as emetogenic as cisplatin, and preventive drugs should always be considered. The 5HT3 agonists are the mainstays of prevention and are frequently used in combination with other drugs such as corticosteroids and the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. However, the US FDA issued a drug communication stating that the injection form of dolasetron, a 5HT3 agonist, should no longer be used in adult or pediatric patients with CINV. Dolasetron injection can increase the risk of developing torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm. Patients with underlying heart conditions or existing heart rate or rhythm problems are at increased risk. Although the oral form of this agent can still be used, careful monitoring and correction of potassium and magnesium levels should be initiated prior to and during treatment. In addition, in older patients and in patients with heart failure, a slow heart rate, underlying cardiac disease, and those with renal impairment, monitoring with electrocardiography is indicated when this drug is used. Congenital long-QT syndrome and drugs that prolong the PR or QRS interval are contraindications to dolasetron therapy. Dolasetron injection may still be used for the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting, per Food and Drug Administration guidelines. == See also == 5-HT3 receptor antagonist: Drug discovery and development Ondansetron == References == == Further reading ==",Dolasetron,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007270314963534474)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601001.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Dolasetron: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601001.html?utm_source=openai')])"
