1092,"('Zanamivir', 'Relenza', 'Zanamavir', 'Gr 121167x', 'Zanamivir (relenza)')",Medical,"Zanamivir, sold under the brand name Relenza among others, is an anti-viral medication used to treat and prevent influenza caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. It is a neuraminidase inhibitor and was developed by the Australian biotech firm Biota Holdings. It was licensed to Glaxo Wellcome in 1990 and approved in the US in 1999, only for use as a treatment for influenza. In 2006, it was approved for prevention of influenza A and B. Zanamivir is the first neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed. It was developed by GlaxoSmithKline. == Medical uses == Zanamivir is used for the treatment of infections caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses, but in otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small. It decreases the risk of one contracting symptomatic, but not asymptomatic influenza. The combination of diagnostic uncertainty, the risk for virus strain resistance, possible side effects and financial cost outweigh the small benefits of zanamivir for the prophylaxis and treatment of healthy individuals. === Treatment === In otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small. Zanamivir shortens the duration of symptoms of influenza-like illness (unconfirmed influenza or 'the flu') by less than a day. In children with asthma there was no clear effect on the time to first alleviation of symptoms. Whether it affects the risk of one's need to be hospitalized or the risk of death is not clear. There is no proof that zanamivir reduced hospitalizations or pneumonia and other complications of influenza, such as bronchitis, middle ear infection, and sinusitis. Zanamivir did not reduce the risk of self reported investigator mediated pneumonia or radiologically confirmed pneumonia in adults. The effect on pneumonia in children was also not significant. === Prevention === Low to moderate evidence indicates it decreases the risk of one's getting influenza by 1 to 12% in those exposed. Prophylaxis trials showed that zanamivir reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza in individuals and households, but there was no evidence of an effect on asymptomatic influenza or on other, influenza-like illnesses. Also there was no evidence of reduction of risk of person-to-person spread of the influenza virus. The evidence for a benefit in preventing influenza is weak in children, with concerns of publication bias in the literature. === Resistance === As of 2009, no influenza had shown any signs of resistance in the US. A meta-analysis from 2011 found that zanamivir resistance had been rarely reported. Antiviral resistance can emerge during or after treatment with antivirals in certain people (e.g., immunosuppressed). In 2013 genes expressing resistance to zanamivir (and oseltamivir) were found in Chinese patients infected with avian influenza A H7N9. == Adverse effects == Dosing is limited to the inhalation route. This restricts its usage, as treating asthmatics could induce bronchospasms. In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that breathing problems (bronchospasm), including deaths, were reported in some patients after the initial approval of Relenza. Most of these patients had asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Relenza therefore was not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 2009, the zanamivir package insert contains precautionary information regarding risk of bronchospasm in patients with respiratory disease. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and FDA notified healthcare professionals of a report of the death of a patient with influenza having received zanamivir inhalation powder, which was solubilized and administered by mechanical ventilation. In adults there was no increased risk of reported adverse events in trials. There was little evidence of the possible harms associated with the treatment of children with zanamivir. Zanamivir has not been known to cause toxic effects and has low systemic exposure to the human body. == Mechanism of action == Zanamivir works by binding to the active site of the neuraminidase protein, rendering the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others. It is also an inhibitor of influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo. In clinical trials, zanamivir was found to reduce the time-to-symptom resolution by 1.5 days if therapy was started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. The bioavailability of zanamivir is 2%. After inhalation, zanamivir is concentrated in the lungs and oropharynx, where up to 15% of the dose is absorbed and excreted in urine. == History == Zanamivir was first made in 1989 by scientists led by Peter Colman and Joseph Varghese at the Australian CSIRO, in collaboration with the Victorian College of Pharmacy and Monash University. Zanamivir was the first of the neuraminidase inhibitors. The discovery was initially funded by the Australian biotechnology company Biota and was part of Biota's ongoing program to develop antiviral agents through rational drug design. Its strategy relied on the availability of the structure of influenza neuraminidase by X-ray crystallography. It was also known, as far back as 1974, that 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), a sialic acid analogue, is an inhibitor of neuraminidase. Computational chemistry techniques were used to probe the active site of the enzyme, in an attempt to design derivatives of DANA that would bind tightly to the amino acid residues of the catalytic site, so would be potent and specific inhibitors of the enzyme. The GRID software by Molecular Discovery was used to determine energetically favourable interactions between various functional groups and residues in the catalytic site canyon. This investigation showed a negatively charged zone occurs in the neuraminidase active site that aligns with the C4 hydroxyl group of DANA. This hydroxyl is, therefore, replaced with a positively charged amino group; the 4-amino DANA was shown to be 100 times better as an inhibitor than DANA, owing to the formation of a salt bridge with a conserved glutamic acid (119) in the active site. Glu 119 was also noticed to be at the bottom of a conserved pocket in the active site that is just big enough to accommodate the larger, but more basic guanidine functional group. Zanamivir, a transition-state analogue inhibitor of neuraminidase, was the result. In 1999, the zanamivir was approved in the US and the European Union for the treatment of influenza A and B. The FDA advisory committee recommended by a vote 13 to 4 that it should not be approved, because it lacked efficacy and was no more effective than placebo when the patients were on other drugs such as paracetamol. But the FDA leadership overruled the committee. In 2006, zanamivir was approved in the US and the European Union for prevention of influenza A and B. == References ==",Relenza,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.179073458653875e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000161038784426637)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/relenza.html,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/relenza-zanamivir-information,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/relenza ', [])"
1093,"('Nifurtimox', 'Lampit', 'Bayer 2502', 'Nifurtimoxum', 'Nifurtimox [inn:ban]')",Medical,"Nifurtimox, sold under the brand name Lampit, is a medication used to treat Chagas disease and sleeping sickness. For sleeping sickness it is used together with eflornithine in nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment. In Chagas disease it is a second-line option to benznidazole. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, headache, nausea, and weight loss. There are concerns from animal studies that it may increase the risk of cancer but these concerns have not been found in human trials. Nifurtimox is not recommended in pregnancy or in those with significant kidney or liver problems. It is a type of nitrofuran. Nifurtimox came into medication use in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not available commercially in Canada. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. In regions of the world where the disease is common nifurtimox is provided for free by the World Health Organization (WHO). == Medical uses == Nifurtimox has been used to treat Chagas disease, when it is given for 30 to 60 days. However, long-term use of nifurtimox does increase chances of adverse events like gastrointestinal and neurological side effects. Due to the low tolerance and completion rate of nifurtimox, benznidazole is now being more considered for those who have Chagas disease and require long-term treatment. In the United States nifurtimox is indicated in children and adolescents (birth to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 2.5 kilograms (5.5 lb) for the treatment of Chagas disease (American Trypanosomiasis), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Nifurtimox has also been used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), and is active in the second stage of the disease (central nervous system involvement). When nifurtimox is given on its own, about half of all patients will relapse, but the combination of melarsoprol with nifurtimox appears to be efficacious. Trials are awaited comparing melarsoprol/nifurtimox against melarsoprol alone for African sleeping sickness. Combination therapy with eflornithine and nifurtimox is safer and easier than treatment with eflornithine alone, and appears to be equally or more effective. It has been recommended as first-line treatment for second-stage African trypanosomiasis. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use of nifurtimox should be avoided in pregnant women due to limited use. There is limited data shown that nifurtimox doses up to 15 mg/kg daily can cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. Other authors do not consider breastfeeding a contraindication during nifurtimox use. == Side effects == Side effects occur following chronic administration, particularly in elderly people. Major toxicities include immediate hypersensitivity such as anaphylaxis and delayed hypersensitivity reaction involving icterus and dermatitis. Central nervous system disturbances and peripheral neuropathy may also occur. Most common side effects anorexia weight loss nausea vomiting headache dizziness amnesia Less common effects rash depression anxiety confusion fever sore throat chills seizures impotence tremors muscle weakness numbness of hands or feet === Contraindications === Nifurtimox is contraindicated in people with severe liver or kidney disease, as well as people with a background of neurological or psychiatric disorders. == Mechanism of action == Nifurtimox forms a nitro-anion radical metabolite that reacts with nucleic acids of the parasite causing significant breakdown of DNA. Its mechanism is similar to that proposed for the antibacterial action of metronidazole. Nifurtimox undergoes reduction and creates oxygen radicals such as superoxide. These radicals are toxic to T. cruzi. Mammalian cells are protected by presence of catalase, glutathione, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide to cytotoxic levels results in parasite death. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Nifurtimox is licensed for use in Argentina, the United States, Turkey and Germany amongst others. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. === Names === == Research == Nifurtimox is in a phase-II clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. == References == == External links == ""Nifurtimox"".

Evidence shows that it can improve quality of life and prevent hospitalization in those with COPD. However, it does not appear to affect the risk of death or the frequency steroids are needed. It is unclear if it differs from the similar medication tiotropium or other commonly used medications from the class of LAMAs. Aclidinium is delivered via a multidose dry powder inhaler, the Genuair inhaler. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Adverse effects == The substance is generally well tolerated. Common side effects (in more than 1% of patients) are sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, diarrhoea and nausea. The latter is less common under the drug than under placebo. Skin reactions such as rash, as well as side effects that are typical of muscarinic antagonists (fast heart rate, palpitations, and urinary retention), occur in less than 1% of patients. A small increase of cardiovascular risk cannot be excluded from available data. Patients with relevant cardiovascular diseases were excluded from studies. == Interactions == No systematic interaction studies have been performed. It is expected that adverse effects of aclidinium increase if it is combined with other muscarinic antagonists. In clinical practice, no interactions with other COPD medications such as glucocorticoids, β2-adrenergic agonists and theophylline have been described. As aclidinium does not relevantly interact with cytochrome P450 liver enzymes or P-glycoprotein, and is quickly metabolized as soon as it reaches the bloodstream, it is considered to have a very low potential for interactions. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Aclidinium is a long-acting, reversible antagonist at muscarinic receptors, with similar affinity to all five subtypes, but with a dissociation half-life from subtype M3 of 29.2 hours, or six times longer than that from M2. For comparison, M3 dissociation half-lives of the related drugs ipratropium and tiotropium are 0.47 hours and 62.2 hours, respectively. Its action at subtype M3 at the smooth muscle of the bronchioles is responsible for its desired effect: it reduces contraction of these muscles and improves the airflow. M2 affinity is the main reason for adverse effects at the heart. === Pharmacokinetics === About 30% of inhaled aclidinium are deposited in the lung. Its action there lasts for more than 24 hours. From the lung, it is absorbed into the bloodstream, reaching highest blood plasma concentrations after five minutes in healthy persons and after 10 to 15 minutes in COPD patients. The substance is quickly hydrolysed to the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, so that less than 5% of the inhaled dose are found unchanged in the plasma. Hydrolysis is both non-enzymatic and enzymatic, the latter mainly by butyrylcholinesterase. The acid metabolite has a plasma protein binding of 87%, and the alcohol of 15%. These metabolites are found to 65% in the urine and to 33% in the faeces. Elimination half-life is two to three hours. Unchanged aclidinium accounts for only 0.1% of the excreted dose. == Chemistry == Aclidinium is a quaternary ammonium cation with an asymmetric carbon atom. It is used as the pure R-enantiomer. The salt, aclidinium bromide, is a crystalline powder that is hardly soluble in water or ethanol. == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is marketed under the brand name Tudorza Pressair in the US, Eklira Genuair in the UK, and Tudorza Genuair in Canada; licensed to Menarini under the brand name Bretaris Genuair for majority of EU member states. An inhalable combination with formoterol is marketed as Brimica Genuair and Duaklir Genuair in the European Union. == References ==",Aclidinium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3708974620385561e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007354891858994961)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aclidinium_bromide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Aclidinium bromide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aclidinium_bromide?utm_source=openai')])"
1095,"('Galanthamine', 'Galantamine', 'Lycoremin', 'Lycoremine', 'Reminyl')",Medical,"Galantamine is a type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is an alkaloid extracted from the bulbs and flowers of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop), Galanthus caucasicus (Caucasian snowdrop), Galanthus woronowii (Voronov's snowdrop), and other members of the family Amaryllidaceae, such as Narcissus (daffodil), Leucojum aestivum (snowflake), and Lycoris including Lycoris radiata (red spider lily). It can also be produced synthetically. Galantamine is primarily known for its potential to slow cognitive decline. It is used clinically for treating early-stage Alzheimer's disease and memory impairments, although it has had limited success with the more advanced condition of dementia. It works by increasing the amount of a type of neurotransmitter named acetylcholine by the inhibiting activity of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase known for breaking down acetylcholine. This elevates and prolongs acetylcholine levels boosting acetylcholine's neuromodulatory functionality, subsequently enhancing functionality of the various cognitions that acetylcholine is involved in, such as memory processing, reasoning, and thinking. Galantamine may cause serious adverse effects, such as stomach bleeding, liver injury or chest pain. Galantamine was isolated for the first time from bulbs of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop) in the Soviet Union in the 1940s. The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The first industrial process was developed in 1959. However, it was not until the 1990s when full-scale synthesis was upscaled and optimized. == Medical uses == Galantamine, sold under the brand name Razadyne among others, is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The first person to extract galantamine and theorize its usefulness in medicine, was the Bulgarian chemist Dimitar Paskov in 1959. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia. Galantamine may not be effective for treating mild cognitive impairment. === Alzheimer's disease === Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for use of galantamine as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Galantamine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, galantamine binds to the allosteric sites of nicotinic receptors, which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the nicotinic receptor's response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine's competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action. To reduce the prevalence of negative side effects associated with galantamine, such as nausea and vomiting, a dose-escalation scheme may be used. The use of a dose-escalation scheme has been well accepted in countries where galantamine is used. A dose-escalation scheme for Alzheimer's treatment involves a recommended starting dosage of 4 mg galantamine tablets given twice a day (8 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks, the dosage may then be increased to 8 mg given twice a day (16 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, the treatment may be increased to 12 mg given twice a day (24 mg/day). Dosage increases are based upon the assessment of clinical benefit as well as tolerability of the previous dosage. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, the process is usually restarted, beginning at the starting dosage, and re-escalating to the current dose. It has been found that a dosage between 16–24 mg/day is the optimal dosage. In December 2023, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for a pro-drug of galantamine called ALPHA-1062. In July 2024, The FDA approved benzgalantamine (Zunveyl, a derivative of galantamine), previously known as ALPHA-1062, to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. == Side effects == The adverse effect profile of galantamine includes potential for allergic reaction, including hives, swelling of the face or throat, and skin rash. Using galantamine may cause chest pain, bloody urine, stomach bleeding, and liver injury, among other side effects. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache are considered common side effects. A gradual titration over more than three months may enable long-term tolerability in some people. Galantamine has a wide spectrum of interactions with other medications and medical disorders, requiring close assessment between the physician and patient. == Pharmacology == Galantamine's chemical structure contains a tertiary amine. At a neutral pH, this tertiary amine will often bond to a hydrogen, and appear mostly as an ammonium ion. Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) α4β2, α3β4, and α6β4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs α7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain. By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine. This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released. However, recent studies suggest that Galantamine does not functionally act at human nAChRs α4β2 or α7 as a positive allosteric modulator. Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine's effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Galantamine in its pure form is a white powder. The atomic resolution 3D structure of the complex of galantamine and its target, acetylcholinesterase, was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1999 (PDB code: 1DX6; see complex). There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption of galantamine is rapid and complete and shows linear pharmacokinetics. It is well absorbed with absolute oral bioavailability between 80 and 100%. It has a terminal elimination half-life of seven hours. Peak effect of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8 mg in some healthy volunteers. The coadministration of food delays the rate of galantamine absorption, but does not affect the extent of absorption. Plasma protein binding of galantamine is about 18%, which is relatively low. == Metabolism == Approximately 75% of a dose of galantamine is metabolised in the liver. In vitro studies have shown that hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are involved in galantamine metabolism. Within 24 hours of intravenous or oral administration approximately 20% of a dose of galantamine will be excreted unreacted in the urine. In humans, several metabolic pathways for galantamine exist. These pathways lead to the formation of a number of different metabolites. One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the glucuronidation of galantamine. Additionally, galantamine may undergo oxidation or demethylation at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites. Galantamine can undergo demethylation at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation. Lastly, galantamine may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing demethylation or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or demethylation and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom. == Drug interactions == Since galantamine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, inhibiting either of these isoenzymes will increase the cholinergic effects of galantamine. Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects. It was found that paroxetine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 40%. The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 30% and 12%, respectively. == Extraction and synthesis == Since the alkaloid is isolated from botanical sources containing low amounts (0.1%) by weight, extraction yields are low. Although galantamine can be produced from natural resources, it also has many industrial syntheses, such as by Janssen, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Shire, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. == Research == === Organophosphate poisoning === The toxicity of organophosphates results primarily from their action as irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase causes an increase in acetylcholine, as the enzyme is no longer available to catalyze its breakdown. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine accumulation can cause an overstimulation of muscarinic receptors followed by a desensitization of nicotinic receptors. This leads to severe skeletal muscle fasciculations (involuntary contractions). The effects on the central nervous system include anxiety, restlessness, confusion, ataxia, tremors, seizures, cardiorespiratory paralysis, and coma. As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine has the potential to serve as an effective organophosphate poisoning treatment by preventing irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Additionally, galantamine has anticonvulsant properties which may make it even more desirable as an antidote. Research supported in part by the US Army has led to a US patent application for the use of galantamine and/or its derivatives for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The indications for use of galantamine in the patent application include poisoning by nerve agents ""including but not limited to soman, sarin, and VX, tabun, and Novichok agents"". Galantamine was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote atropine. According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between galantamine and atropine in an amount of 6 mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of galantamine from 5 to 8 mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5 times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals. === Autism === Galantamine given in addition to risperidone to autistic children has been shown to improve some of the symptoms of autism such as irritability, lethargy, and social withdrawal. Additionally, the cholinergic and nicotinic receptors are believed to play a role in attentional processes. Some studies have noted that cholinergic and nicotinic treatments have improved attention in autistic children. As such, it is hypothesized that galantamine's dual action mechanism might have a similar effect in treating autistic children and adolescents. === Anesthesia === Galantamine may have some limited use in reducing the side-effects of anesthetics ketamine and diazepam. In one study, a control group of patients were given ketamine and diazepam and underwent anesthesia and surgery. The experimental group was given ketamine, diazepam, and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is galantamine). The degree of drowsiness and disorientation of the two groups was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery. The group that had taken nivalin were found to be more alert 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the surgery. === Oneirogen === Galantamine is known to have oneirogenic properties. Research has demonstrated its potential to increase dream recall, dream self-awareness and dream vividness. The enhancement of such dream properties can facilitate the induction of lucid dreams. == References ==",Reminyl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.36574100604048e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00042465253500267863), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3869072198867798)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([alzforum.org](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/galantamine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Galantamine | ALZFORUM', type='url_citation', url='https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/galantamine?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It acts by irreversibly binding the S12 protein in the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, after being actively transported across the cell membrane, which interferes with the initiation complex between the mRNA and the bacterial ribosome. This leads to the synthesis of defective, nonfunctional proteins, which results in the bacterial cell's death. It causes ototoxicity, which is why it is no longer used in humans. == See also == Translation (biology) == References == == External links == Dihydrostreptomycin | C21H41N7O12 - PubChem",Dihydrostreptomycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.13363605737686157)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003669780562631786), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16027913987636566)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrostreptomycin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=6, title='Dihydrostreptomycin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrostreptomycin?utm_source=openai')])"

In addition, these compounds demonstrate antiviral activity towards bacteriophages and poxviruses. == Structure == They are named ansamycins (from the Latin ansa, handle) because of their unique structure, which consists of an aromatic moiety bridged by an aliphatic chain. The main difference between various derivatives of ansamycins is the aromatic moiety, which can be a naphthalene ring or a naphthoquinone ring as in rifamycin and the naphthomycins. Another variation consists of benzene or a benzoquinone ring system as in geldanamycin or ansamitocin. Ansamycins were first discovered in 1959 by Sensi et al. from Amycolatopsis mediterranei, an actinomycete bacterium. == Examples == Rifamycins are a subclass of ansamycins with high potency against mycobacteria.

Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood. Autophagy is the main mechanism at the molecular level, but evidence has been found for other mechanisms, including inflammation reduction, lipid metabolism, and regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and death. Spermidine has been theorized to promote autophagy via the MAPK pathway by inhibiting phosphorylation of raf, or possibly by inhibiting cytosolic autophagy-related protein acetylation by EP300 and thereby increasing acetylation of tubulin. Spermidine is known to regulate plant growth, assisting the in vitro process of transcribing RNA, and inhibition of NOS. Also, spermidine is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and thermospermine, some of which contribute to tolerance against drought and salinity in plants. Spermidine has been tested and discovered to encourage hair shaft elongation and lengthen hair growth. Spermidine has also been found to “upregulate expression of the epithelial stem cell-associated keratins K15 and K19, and dose-dependently modulated K15 promoter activity in situ and the colony forming efficiency, proliferation and K15 expression of isolated human K15-GFP+ cells in vitro.” == Biochemical actions == Spermidine's known actions include: Inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) Binds and precipitates DNA Polyamine plant growth regulator == Sources == Good dietary sources of spermidine are aged cheese, mushrooms, soy products, legumes, corn, and whole grains. Spermidine is plentiful in a Mediterranean diet. For comparison: The spermidine content in human seminal plasma varies between approx. 15 and 50 mg/L (mean 31 mg/L). Note: spermidine content varies by source and age. See ref for details. In grains, the endosperm contains most of the spermidine. One of the best known grain dietary sources is wheat germ, containing as much as 243 mg/kg. == Uses == Spermidine can be used in electroporation while transferring the DNA into the cell under the electrical impulse. May be used for purification of DNA-binding proteins. Spermidine is also used, along with calcium chloride, for precipitating DNA onto microprojectiles for bombardment with a gene gun. Spermidine has also been reported to protect the heart from aging and prolong the lifespan of mice, while in humans it was correlated with lower blood pressure. It also was found to reduce the amount of aging in yeast, flies, worms, and human immune cells by inducing autophagy. Spermidine may play a role in male and female fertility. Fertile men have higher spermidine levels than men who are infertile, and spermidine supplementation has been shown to help maintain a healthy hormone balance and reduce oxidative stress. Spermidine is commonly used for in vitro molecular biology reactions, particularly, in vitro transcription by phage RNA polymerases, in vitro transcription by human RNA polymerase II, and in vitro translation. Spermidine increases specificity and reproducibility of Taq-mediated PCR by neutralizing and stabilizing the negative charge on DNA phosphate backbone. == See also == Norspermidine – chemical compoundPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback Putrescine – Foul-smelling organic chemical compound Spermine – Polyamine involved in cellular metabolism == References == == External links == Safety Data Sheet",Spermidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.0019928740803152323), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0005542247672565281), ('US', 0.0), (',', -6.704273118884885e-07), (' FOOD', -0.00021998681768309325), (',', -0.018169023096561432), (' PERSONAL', -0.11648546159267426), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.07902616262435913), (' INDUSTR', -0.0046227299608290195), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.022225230932235718), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('OUS', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -8.11782301752828e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0015899409772828221), (',', -0.4741424322128296), ('ĠMED', -0.49484121799468994), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16026797890663147)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.0004306692280806601)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermidine ', [])"

It's becoming more and more urgent to conduct additional research and investigations into efficient treatments. Ethyl ferulate (EF) is a naturally occurring substance with cardioprotective properties. However, the extent of its impact and the underlying mechanism of its treatment for myocardial fibrosis after MI remain unknown. The goal of this study was to look into how EF affected the signaling of the TGF-receptor 1 (TGFBR1) in myocardial fibrosis after MI. Echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome staining were employed to assess the impact of EF on heart structure and function in MI-affected mice in vivo. Cell proliferation assay (MTS), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and western blot techniques were employed to examine the influence of EF on native cardiac fibroblast (CFs) proliferation and collagen deposition. Molecular simulation and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) were utilized to explore TGFBR1 and EF interaction. Cardiac-specific Tgfbr1 knockout mice (Tgfbr1 In vivo experiments revealed that EF alleviated myocardial fibrosis, improved cardiac dysfunction after MI and downregulated the TGFBR1 signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in vitro experiments revealed that EF significantly inhibited CFs proliferation, collagen deposition and TGFBR1 signaling followed by TGF-β1 stimulation. More specifically, molecular simulation, molecular dynamics, and SPRi collectively showed that EF directly targeted TGFBR1. Lastly, knocking down of Tgfbr1 partially reversed the inhibitory activity of EF on myocardial fibrosis in MI mice. EF attenuated myocardial fibrosis post-MI by directly suppressing TGFBR1 and its downstream signaling pathway.

Results from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and promoter assays reveal that HX-1171 increased the expression of NQO1 and HMOX1, encoding antioxidant-related enzymes, in A549 human lung epithelial cells. The activity of nuclear factor-E2-related factor (Nrf2), a key transcriptional factor for antioxidative enzymes, was examined in HX-1171-treated cells. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting showed that HX-1171 effectively induced the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of Nrf2.

Many studies have reported that nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a main regulator of antioxidant expression, prevents and improves diabetes-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the antidiabetic effect of the newly discovered Nrf2 activator, HX-1171, in the STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. HX-1171 enhanced insulin secretion by reducing STZ-induced cell apoptosis, and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by upregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes through Nrf2 activation in INS-1 pancreatic beta cells. In STZ-induced diabetic mice, HX-1171 administration significantly lowered blood glucose levels and restored blood insulin levels. In the STZ-only injected mice, the pancreatic islets showed morphological changes and loss of function, whereas the HX-1171-treated group was similar to that of the control group. These results suggest that HX-1171 may be developed as a promising therapeutic agent for diabetes-related diseases.

1103,"('Allylestrenol', 'Gestanin', 'Gestanon', 'Gestanol', 'Orageston')",Medical,"Allylestrenol, sold under the brand names Gestanin and Turinal among others, is a progestin medication which is used to treat recurrent and threatened miscarriage and to prevent premature labor in pregnant women. However, except in the case of proven progesterone deficiency, its use for such purposes is no longer recommended. It is also used in Japan to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. The medication is used alone and is not formulated in combination with an estrogen. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of allylestrenol are few and have not been well-defined, but are assumed to be similar to those of related medications. Allylestrenol is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of 17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone (3-ketoallylestrenol) in the body. Allylestrenol was first described in 1958 and was introduced for medical use by 1961. It has been marketed widely throughout the world in the past, but today its availability and usage are relatively limited. It remains available in a few European countries and in a number of Asian countries. == Medical uses == Allylestrenol is used in the treatment of recurrent and threatened miscarriage and to prevent premature labor. However, except in the case of proven progesterone deficiency, its use for such indications is no longer recommended. Allylestrenol is one of only a handful of progestogens that has commonly been used for such purposes, the others including progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, and dydrogesterone. The medication has also been studied in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as amenorrhea, irregular menstruation, and premenstrual syndrome. Unlike other progestins, allylestrenol has not been used in hormonal contraception or in menopausal hormone therapy. In one study, it was found to be inadequate for endometrial transformation in women in combination with estradiol valerate. On the other hand, allylestrenol was found to be effective in the treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. Allylestrenol has been commonly used in Japan at high dosages, typically 50 mg/day but as much as 100 mg/day, to treat BPH in men. Related medications that have similarly been used to treat BPH, particularly in Japan, include chlormadinone acetate, gestonorone caproate, and oxendolone. Allylestrenol has also been studied in the treatment of prostate cancer in Japan. The medication has been studied as a puberty blocker in the treatment of precocious puberty as well. === Available forms === Allylestrenol is available in the form of 5 mg oral tablets. It is typically used at a dosage of 5 to 40 mg/day. In Japan, a 25 mg allylestrenol oral tablet, under the brand name Perselin, is marketed for the treatment of BPH. == Side effects == Allylestrenol should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using allylestrenol. Side effects of allylestrenol are few and have not been well-defined, but are assumed to be similar to those of related medications (i.e., other progestins). When used at high dosages in the treatment of BPH in men, allylestrenol can cause symptoms of hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction. The medication indeloxazine may be able to counteract allylestrenol-associated sexual dysfunction. Allylestrenol has no androgenic or other off-target hormonal side effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Progestogenic and off-target activities ==== Allylestrenol is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR). It is lacking the keto group at the C3 position (part of the important 3-keto-4-ene structure) that is common in progestogens and is considered to be necessary for activity, and in relation to this, is thought to be a prodrug of 17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone (3-ketoallylestrenol). Allylestrenol is a far less potent progestogen than many other 19-nortestosterone derivatives. The effective ovulation-inhibiting or contraceptive dosage of allylestrenol in women has been studied, albeit limitedly. At 20 mg/day allylestrenol, ovulation occurred in 50% of 6 cycles, and at 25 mg/day, ovulation occurred in 0% of 3 cycles. The total endometrial transformation dosage of allylestrenol in women across the cycle is 150 to 250 mg. Unlike virtually all other 19-nortestosterone derivatives, allylestrenol is reported to be a pure progestogen and hence to be devoid of androgenic, estrogenic, and glucocorticoid activity. As such, it appears to have properties more similar to those of natural progesterone. The binding and activity profiles of allylestrenol and its major active metabolite at steroid hormone receptors and related proteins have been studied. Allylestrenol has less than 0.2% of the affinity of ORG-2058 and less than 2% of the affinity of progesterone for the PR. Similarly, it has less than 0.2% of the affinity of testosterone for the androgen receptor (AR), less than 0.2% of the affinity of estradiol for the estrogen receptor (ER), less than 0.2% of the affinity of dexamethasone for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and 0.9% of the affinity of testosterone for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Conversely, its metabolite 17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone has 24% of the affinity of ORG-2058 and 186% of the affinity of progesterone for the PR, 4.5% of the affinity of testosterone for the AR, 9.8% of the affinity of dexamethasone for the GR, and 2.8% of the affinity of testosterone for SHBG, while it similarly has less than 0.2% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER. The affinity of 17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone for the AR was less than that of norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate and its affinity for SHBG was much lower than that of norethisterone. These findings may help to explain the absence of teratogenic effects of allylestrenol on the external genitalia of female and male rat fetuses. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Similarly to other progestogens, allylestrenol has potent antigonadotropic effects. It is able to considerably decrease circulating concentrations of luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone in men. At a dosage of 50 mg/day, allylestrenol has been found to suppress circulating testosterone levels by 78% in men with BPH. This is about the maximum that progestogens are known to be able to suppress testosterone levels in men. In accordance, the reduction of testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels with allylestrenol in men has been found in a study to be equivalent to that of chlormadinone acetate and oxendolone. However, another study found a significantly lower decrease in testosterone levels with 50 mg/day allylestrenol relative to 50 mg/day chlormadinone acetate of about 49–52% versus 76–85%, respectively. Animal research suggests that allylestrenol produces its beneficial effects in BPH via its antigonadotropic effects and consequent suppression of androgen levels and inhibition of prostate gland growth, similarly to other progestins. Some studies have found that allylestrenol is less effective for BPH than chlormadinone acetate but also produces fewer side effects and sexual dysfunction. Allylestrenol therapy for BPH is associated with a significant decrease in prostate-specific antigen levels, which may mask the detection of prostate cancer. ==== Other activities ==== Allylestrenol is not a significant 5α-reductase inhibitor. In one study, it showed about 80,000-fold lower potency for inhibition of 5α-reductase in vitro than the established 5α-reductase inhibitor epristeride (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 11.3 nM for epristeride and 890 μM for allylestrenol). In another study, there was 70% inhibition of 5α-reductase by allylestrenol at a concentration of 60 μM. This difference may have been due to different experimental conditions, but is still much lower than epristeride. === Pharmacokinetics === Following oral administration, peak levels of allylestrenol occur after 2 to 4 hours. The medication shows considerable plasma protein binding. It has relatively low affinity for SHBG, much lower than that of norethisterone. Allylestrenol is metabolized in the liver, via reduction, hydroxylation, and conjugation. It is known to be a substrate of CYP3A4. It is thought to be a prodrug of 17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone (3-ketoallylestrenol), which, in accordance, is a known active metabolite of allylestrenol. The biological half-life of allylestrenol has been reported to be ""several hours"" or, presumably in its active form, reportedly about 10 hours. In the blood, unchanged allylestrenol accounted for 15 to 40% of radioactivity, an unconjugated metabolite accounted for 4 to 10% of radioactivity, and the rest of the radioactivity corresponded to conjugated metabolites. Allylestrenol is eliminated mainly in urine, 44% by 24 hours and 67% within 4 days. It is excreted almost completely as conjugates, with 75% of these being sulfate conjugates and 24% being glucuronide conjugates. == Chemistry == Allylestrenol, also known as 3-deketo-17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-allylestr-4-en-17β-ol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is a member of the estrane subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins, but unlike most other 19-nortestosterone progestins, is not a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). This is because it possesses an allyl group at the C17α position rather than the usual ethynyl group. As such, along with altrenogest (17α-allyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone), allylestrenol is a derivative of 17α-allyltestosterone rather than of 17α-ethynyltestosterone. Allylestrenol is also unique among most 19-nortestosterone progestins in that it lacks the ketone at the C3 position. It shares this property with lynestrenol (17α-ethynylestr-4-en-17β-ol), desogestrel (11-methylene-17α-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol), and the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) ethylestrenol (17α-ethylestr-4-en-17β-ol). Allylestrenol is the C17α allyl and C3 deketo derivative of the AAS nandrolone (19-nortestosterone), as well as the C17α allyl and C3 deketo analogue of the AAS normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and norethandrolone (17α-methyl-19-nortestosterone). === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of allylestrenol have been published. == History == Allylestrenol was patented in 1958 and has been marketed for medical use since 1961. It was developed by Organon Laboratories. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Allylestrenol is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while allylestrénol is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and allilestrenolo is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. The BANTooltip British Approved Name was originally allyloestrenol, but it was eventually changed. The medication is also known by its developmental code name SC-6393. === Brand names === The major brand names of allylestrenol include Gestanin, Gestanon, Perselin, and Turinal. It has also been marketed under a variety of other brand names, including Alese, Alilestrenol, Allynol, Allytry, Alynol, Anin, Arandal, Astanol, Cobarenol, Crestanon, Elmolan, Fetugard, Foegard, Fulterm, Gestanin, Gestanin, Gestanol, Gestanyn, Gestin, Geston, Gestormone, Gestrenol, Gravida, Gravidin, Gravinol, Gravion, Gravynon, Gynerol, Gynonys, Iugr, Lestron, Loestrol, Maintane, Meieston, Moresafe, Nidagest, Orageston, Pelias, Preabor, Pregnolin, Pregtenol, Pregular, Prelab, Premaston, Prenolin, Prestrenol, Profar, Progeston, Protanon, and Shegest. === Availability === Allylestrenol has been marketed widely throughout the world, including in Europe, Southern, Eastern, and Southeastern Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. However, although it has been widely marketed in the past, the availability of allylestrenol is relatively limited today. It appears to still be available in Bangladesh, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lithuania, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan. Previously, allylestrenol has also been available in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Montenegro). However, it seems to have been discontinued in these countries. It does not seem to have been marketed in the United States or Canada. == References ==",Orageston,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0029467991553246975), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005272649694234133)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3868710398674011), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugcentral.org](https://drugcentral.org/drugcard/125?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=9, title='allylestrenol', type='url_citation', url='https://drugcentral.org/drugcard/125?utm_source=openai')])"

It has been reported to act as a subunit-selective negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and antagonizes in animals and humans some but not all of the GABAA receptor-mediated effects of allopregnanolone, such as anesthesia, sedation, and reduced saccadic eye movements, but not learning impairment. Isopregnanolone has no hormonal effects and appears to have no effect on the GABAA receptor by itself; it selectively antagonizes allopregnanolone and does not affect the effects of other types of GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Isopregnanolone is synthesized from progesterone in the body by the actions of the enzymes 5α-reductase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (with 5α-dihydroprogesterone as the intermediate in this two-step transformation) and can be reversibly metabolized into allopregnanolone by the enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Levels of isopregnanolone, progesterone, and allopregnanolone are highly correlated across the menstrual cycle and throughout pregnancy. The concentrations of isopregnanolone are significantly less than those of progesterone and allopregnanolone; about half of those of allopregnanolone, to be precise. Isopregnanolone has a relatively long serum elimination half-life of 14 hours in humans. Isopregnanolone (developmental code name UC-1010) is under development for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

However, a disadvantage of the biotin/biotin-binding protein interaction is that it is essentially irreversible under physiological conditions. Desthiobiotin is a biotin analogue that binds less tightly to biotin-binding proteins and is easily displaced by biotin. We synthesized an amine-reactive desthiobiotin derivative for labeling proteins and a desthiobiotin-agarose affinity matrix. Conjugates labeled with desthiobiotin are equivalent to their biotinylated counterparts in cell-staining and antigen-labeling applications. They also bind to streptavidin and other biotin-binding protein-based affinity columns and are recognized by anti-biotin antibodies. Fluorescent streptavidin conjugates saturated with desthiobiotin, but not biotin, bind to a cell-bound biotinylated target without further processing. Streptavidin-based ligands can be gently stripped from desthiobiotin-labeled targets with buffered biotin solutions. Thus, repeated probing with fluorescent streptavidin conjugates followed by enzyme-based detection is possible. In all applications, the desthiobiotin/biotin-binding protein complex is easily dissociated under physiological conditions by either biotin or desthiobiotin. Thus, our desthiobiotin-based reagents and techniques provide some distinct advantages over traditional 2-iminobiotin, monomeric avidin, or other affinity-based techniques. One-third of all proteins are estimated to require metals for structural stability and/or catalytic activity. Desthiobiotin probes containing metal binding groups can be used to capture metalloproteins with exposed active-site metals under mild conditions so as to prevent changes in metallation state.

1107,"('Emetine (dihydrochloride hydrate)', 'Emetin', 'Cephaeline methyl ether', 'Methyl cephaeline', 'Cephaline-o-methyl ether')",Medical," The widespread introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy has contributed to recent reductions in malaria mortality. Combination therapies have a range of advantages, including synergism, toxicity reduction, and delaying the onset of resistance acquisition. Unfortunately, antimalarial combination therapy is limited by the depleting repertoire of effective drugs with distinct target pathways. To fast-track antimalarial drug discovery, we have previously employed drug-repositioning to identify the anti-amoebic drug, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate, as a potential candidate for repositioned use against malaria. Despite its 1000-fold increase in in vitro antimalarial potency (ED50 47 nM) compared with its anti-amoebic potency (ED50 26-32 uM), practical use of the compound has been limited by dose-dependent toxicity (emesis and cardiotoxicity). Identification of a synergistic partner drug would present an opportunity for dose-reduction, thus increasing the therapeutic window. The lack of reliable and standardised methodology to enable the in vitro definition of synergistic potential for antimalarials is a major drawback. Here we use isobologram and combination-index data generated by CalcuSyn software analyses (Biosoft v2.1) to define drug interactivity in an objective, automated manner. The method, based on the median effect principle proposed by Chou and Talalay, was initially validated for antimalarial application using the known synergistic combination (atovaquone-proguanil). The combination was used to further understand the relationship between SYBR Green viability and cytocidal versus cytostatic effects of drugs at higher levels of inhibition. We report here the use of the optimised Chou Talalay method to define synergistic antimalarial drug interactivity between emetine dihydrochloride hydrate and atovaquone. The novel findings present a potential route to harness the nanomolar antimalarial efficacy of this affordable natural product. Drug repurposing or repositioning refers to the usage of existing drugs in diseases other than those it was originally used for. For diseases like malaria, where there is an urgent need for active drug candidates, the strategy offers a route to significantly shorten the traditional drug development pipelines. Preliminary high-throughput screens on patent expired drug libraries have recently been carried out for Plasmodium falciparum. This study reports the systematic and objective further interrogation of selected compounds reported in these studies, to enable their repositioning as novel stand-alone anti-malarials or as combinatorial partners. SYBR Green flow cytometry and micro-titre plate assays optimized in the laboratory were used to monitor drug susceptibility of in vitro cultures of P. falciparum K1 parasite strains. Previously described fixed-ratio methods were adopted to investigate drug interactions. Emetine dihydrochloride hydrate, an anti-protozoal drug previously used for intestinal and tissue amoebiasis was shown to have potent inhibitory properties (IC₅₀ doses of ~ 47 nM) in the multidrug resistant K1 strain of P. falciparum. The sum 50% fractional inhibitory concentration (∑FIC₅₀, ₉₀) of the interaction of emetine dihydrochloride hydrate and dihydroartemisinin against the K1 strains of P. falciparum ranged from 0.88-1.48. The results warrant further investigation of emetine dihydrochloride hydrate as a potential stand-alone anti-malarial option. The interaction between the drug and the current front line dihydroartemisinin ranged from additive to mildly antagonistic in the fixed drug ratios tested.",Emetine (dihydrochloride hydrate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008724193088710308), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10024583339691162)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/emetine-dihydrochloride_7342?utm_source=openai), [ahajournals.org](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313309?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=205, start_index=9, title='Emetine dihydrochloride | RNA Polymerase | Tocris Bioscience', type='url_citation', url='https://www.tocris.com/products/emetine-dihydrochloride_7342?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=205, start_index=9, title='Identification of Emetine as a Therapeutic Agent for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension | Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/ATVBAHA.119.313309?utm_source=openai')])"
1108,"('Liothyronine', 'Triiodothyronine', 'Liothyronin', 'Tresitope', 'O-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenyl)-3,5-diiodo-l-tyrosine')",Medical,"Liothyronine is a manufactured form of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). It is most commonly used to treat hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Side effects may occur from excessive doses. This may include weight loss, fever, headache, anxiety, trouble sleeping, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally safe. Liothyronine was approved for medical use in 1956. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 204th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Liothyronine may be used when there is an impaired conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. The dose of liothyronine for hypothyroidism is a lower amount than levothyroxine due it being a higher concentrated synthetic medication. About 25 μg of liothyronine is equivalent to 100 μg of levothyroxine. In thyroid cancer or Graves' disease, ablation therapy with radioactive iodine (131I) can be used to remove trace thyroid tissue that may remain after thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). For 131I therapy to be effective, the trace thyroid tissue must be avid to iodine, which is achieved by elevating the person's TSH levels. For patients taking levothyroxine, TSH may be boosted by discontinuing levothyroxine for 3–6 weeks. This long period of hormone withdrawal is required because of levothyroxine's relatively long biological half-life, and may result in symptoms of hypothyroidism in the patient. The shorter half-life of liothyronine permits a withdrawal period of two weeks, which may minimize hypothyroidism symptoms. One protocol is to discontinue levothyroxine, then prescribe liothyronine while the T4 levels are falling, and finally stop the liothyronine two weeks before the radioactive iodine treatment. Liothyronine may also be used for myxedema coma because of its quicker onset of action when compared to levothyroxine. Use for the treatment of obesity is not recommended. === Depression === Adding liothyronine to tricyclic antidepressants appears useful, especially in women. An algorithm developed from the STAR*D trial recommends liothyronine as an option when people have failed two antidepressant medications. === Pregnancy === Thyroid hormone is minimally transferred to the fetus or placenta, however as of October 2014, studies have not shown any adverse effects to the fetus. Hypothyroid mothers should continue to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy throughout pregnancy to avoid adverse events. === Nursing === Breastmilk contains a low amount of thyroid hormone, so it is important to exercise caution when breastfeeding while taking liothyronine. === Elderly === Older people should be started on lower doses of liothyronine. Plasma T3 concentrations in this population are decreased by 25% to 40%. TSH must be routinely monitored since there is a risk of coronary artery disease, hyperthyroidism and excessive bone loss from inadequate or abnormal thyroid replacement. == Contraindications == Any person with a hypersensitivity to liothyronine sodium or any active ingredient of the formulation should not be on this medication. If there is uncorrected adrenal insufficiency or thyrotoxicosis, a different approach to therapy must be considered. == Side effects == Liothyronine may cause a number of side effects, mostly similar to symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which include: weight loss tremor headache upset stomach vomiting diarrhea stomach cramps nervousness irritability insomnia excessive sweating increased appetite fever changes in menstrual cycle sensitivity to heat === Boxed warning === The package insert contains the following boxed warning, as do all thyroid hormones: Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects. == Pharmacology == Liothyronine is the most potent form of thyroid hormone. Liothyronine sodium, a salt of triiodothyronine (T3), is chemically similar and pharmacologically equivalent to T3. As such, it acts on the body to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. As monotherapy or in combination therapy with SSRIs, liothyronine may also enhance generation of new neurons in the central nervous system. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. In comparison to levothyroxine (T4), liothyronine has a faster onset of action as well as a shorter biological half-life, which may be due to less plasma protein binding to thyroxine-binding globulin and transthyretin. == Society and culture == === Economics === The British Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the alleged ""excessive and unfair pricing"" of liothyronine tablets in 2017. It alleged that Advanz Pharma overcharged the NHS from before 2007 to July 2017. The price of a pack increased by almost 1,600% from £4.46 before it was debranded in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017. == References ==",Tresitope,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.861651490908116e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.020589664578437805), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07902216166257858)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://www.targetmol.com/compound/liothyronine ', [])"
1109,"('Disulfiram', 'Tetraethylthiuram disulfide', 'Antabuse', 'Bis(diethylthiocarbamoyl) disulfide', 'Antabus')",Medical,"Disulfiram is a medication used to support the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (drinking alcohol). Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (specifically ALDH2), causing many of the effects of a hangover to be felt immediately following alcohol consumption. Disulfiram plus alcohol, even small amounts, produces flushing, throbbing in the head and neck, a throbbing headache, respiratory difficulty, nausea, copious vomiting, sweating, thirst, chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, hyperventilation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, fainting, marked uneasiness, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, and confusion. In severe reactions there may be respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack, acute congestive heart failure, unconsciousness, convulsions, and death. In the body, alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is then broken down by ALDH2. When the dehydrogenase enzyme is inhibited, acetaldehyde builds up, causing unpleasant side effects. The clinical use of disulfiram mimics the genetic predisposition to alcohol intolerance found in East Asian populations due to the mutation of the ALDH2 gene. == Medical uses == Disulfiram is used as a second-line treatment, behind acamprosate and naltrexone, for alcohol dependence. Under normal metabolism, alcohol is broken down in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, which is then converted by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to a harmless acetic acid derivative (acetyl coenzyme A). Disulfiram blocks this reaction at the intermediate stage by blocking acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. After alcohol intake under the influence of disulfiram, the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood may be five to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone. As acetaldehyde is one of the major causes of the symptoms of a hangover, this produces immediate and severe negative reaction to alcohol intake. About 5 to 10 minutes after alcohol intake, the patient may experience the effects of a severe hangover for a period of 30 minutes up to several hours. Symptoms usually include flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, low blood pressure, nausea, and vomiting. Uncommon adverse events include shortness of breath, throbbing headache, visual disturbance, mental confusion, postural syncope, and circulatory collapse. Disulfiram should not be taken if alcohol has been consumed in the last 12 hours. There is no tolerance to disulfiram: the longer it is taken, the stronger its effects. As disulfiram is absorbed slowly through the digestive tract and eliminated slowly by the body, the effects may last for up to two weeks after the initial intake; consequently, medical ethics dictate that patients must be fully informed about the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. Disulfiram does not reduce alcohol cravings, so a major problem associated with this drug is extremely poor compliance. Methods to improve compliance include subdermal implants, which release the drug continuously over a period of up to 12 weeks, and supervised administration practices, for example, having the drug regularly administered by one's spouse. Although disulfiram remained the most common pharmaceutical treatment of alcohol abuse until the end of the 20th century, today it is often replaced or accompanied with newer drugs, primarily the combination of naltrexone and acamprosate, which directly attempt to address physiological processes in the brain associated with alcohol abuse. == Side effects == The most common side effects in the absence of alcohol are headache, and a metallic or garlic taste in the mouth, though more severe side effects may occur. Tryptophol, a chemical compound that induces sleep in humans, is formed in the liver after disulfiram treatment. Less common side effects include decrease in libido, liver problems, skin rash, and nerve inflammation. Liver toxicity is an uncommon but potentially serious side effect, and risk groups e.g. those with already impaired liver function should be monitored closely. That said, the rate of disulfiram-induced hepatitis are estimated to be in between 1 per 25,000 to 1 in 30,000, and rarely the primary cause for treatment cessation. Cases of disulfiram neurotoxicity have also occurred, causing extrapyramidal and other symptoms. Disulfiram can produce neuropathy in daily doses of less than the usually recommended 500 mg. Nerve biopsies showed axonal degeneration and the neuropathy is difficult to distinguish from that associated with ethanol abuse. Disulfiram neuropathy occurs after a variable latent period (mean 5 to 6 months) and progresses steadily. Slow improvement may occur when the drug's use is stopped; often there is complete recovery eventually. Disulfiram disrupts metabolism of several other compounds, including paracetamol (acetaminophen), theophylline and caffeine. Disulfiram is a potent CYP2E1 inhibitor, explaining how it reduces the metabolism of several other medicines. The clinical use of disulfiram mimics the genetic predisposition to alcohol intolerance that is found in East Asian populations due to the mutation of the ALDH2 gene. == Similarly acting substances == In medicine, the term ""disulfiram effect"" refers to an adverse effect of a particular medication in causing an unpleasant hypersensitivity to alcohol, similar to the effect caused by disulfiram administration. Examples: Antibiotics (nitroimidazoles), e.g., metronidazole First-generation sulfonylureas, e.g., tolbutamide and chlorpropamide Several cephalosporin drugs, including cefoperazone, cefamandole and cefotetan, that have a N-methylthio-tetrazole moiety Griseofulvin, an oral antifungal drug Procarbazine Temposil, or citrated calcium carbimide, has the same function as disulfiram, but is weaker and safer. Coprine, which metabolizes to 1-aminocyclopropanol, a chemical having the same metabolic effects as disulfiram. It occurs naturally in the otherwise edible common ink cap mushroom (Coprinopsis atramentaria), hence its colloquial name ""tippler's bane"". Similar reactions have been recorded with Clitocybe clavipes and Suillellus luridus, although the agent in those species is unknown. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Disulfiram acts as an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. ALDH is an enzyme that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes. It is known to inactivate acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol. By inhibiting ALDH, disulfiram prevents the inactivation and detoxification of acetaldehyde and thereby induces a variety of unpleasant symptoms when alcohol is consumed. Besides inhibiting ALDH, disulfiram is a dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. DBH is an enzyme that converts the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine into norepinephrine. By inhibiting DBH, disulfiram may increase dopamine levels in the brain and periphery but decrease levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite epinephrine in the brain and periphery. However, it is also possible that disulfiram may actually decrease brain dopamine levels. DBH inhibition by disulfiram may explain its possible therapeutic benefits in cocaine dependence as well as cases of psychosis and mania associated with the drug. There are also cases of disulfiram producing stimulant psychosis in combination with the psychostimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine. DBH inhibition by disulfiram might also explain the hypotension side effect when alcohol is ingested in people taking disulfiram. Disulfiram is also known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP1A2. == History == The synthesis of disulfiram, originally known as tetraethylthiuram disulfide, was first reported in 1881. By around 1900, it was introduced to the industrial process of sulfur vulcanization of rubber and became widely used. In 1937, a plant physician in the American rubber industry described adverse reactions to alcohol in workers exposed to tetramethylthiuram monosulfide and disulfide, and proposed that this effect of disulfiram and related compounds might lead to ”the cure for alcoholism”; the effect was also noticed in workers at a Swedish rubber boot factory. In the early 1940s it had been tested as a treatment for scabies, a parasitic skin infection, as well as intestinal worms. Around that time, during the German occupation of Denmark, Erik Jacobsen and Jens Hald at the Danish drug company Medicinalco picked up on that research and began exploring the use of disulfiram to treat intestinal parasites. The company had a group of enthusiastic self-experimenters that called itself the ""Death Battalion"", and in the course of testing the drug on themselves, accidentally discovered that drinking alcohol while the drug was still in their bodies made them mildly sick.: 98–105 They made that discovery in 1945, and did nothing with it until two years later, when Jacobsen gave an impromptu talk and mentioned that work, which was discussed afterwards in newspapers at the time, leading them to further explore the use of the drug for that purpose.: 98–105 That work included small clinical trials with Oluf Martensen-Larsen, a doctor who worked with alcoholics. They published their work starting in 1948. The chemists at Medicinalco discovered a new form of disulfiram while trying to purify a batch that had been contaminated with copper. This form turned out to have better pharmacological properties, and the company patented it and used that form for the product that was introduced as Antabus (later anglicized to Antabuse). This work led to renewed study of the human metabolism of ethanol. It was already known that ethanol was mostly metabolized in the liver, with it being converted first to acetaldehyde and then acetaldehyde to acetic acid and carbon dioxide, but the enzymes involved were not known. By 1950 the work led to the knowledge that ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and that disulfiram works by inhibiting ALDH, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde, which is what causes the negative effects in the body. The drug was first marketed in Denmark and as of 2008, Denmark is the country where it is most widely prescribed. It was approved by the FDA in 1951. The FDA later approved other drugs for treatment of alcoholism, namely naltrexone in 1994 and acamprosate in 2004. == Society and culture == Though the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the US has not set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for disulfiram in the workplace, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2 mg/m3 and recommended that workers avoid concurrent exposure to ethylene dibromide. == Research == Disulfiram has been studied as a possible treatment for cancer, parasitic infections, anxiety disorder, obesity and latent HIV infection. === Cancer === When disulfiram creates complexes with metals (dithiocarbamate complexes), it is a proteasome inhibitor and as of 2016 it had been studied in in vitro experiments, model animals, and small clinical trials as a possible treatment for liver metastasis, metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer. === Parasitic infections === In the body, disulfiram is metabolized to diethyldithiocarbamate (ditiocarb), which binds to metal ions such as zinc or copper to form zinc or copper diethyldithiocarbamate (zinc or copper ditiocarb). The zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (zinc-ditiocarb) metabolite of disulfiram is extremely potent against the diarrhea and liver abscess-causing parasite Entamoeba histolytica and might be active against other deadly parasites. === HIV === Disulfiram has also been identified by systematic high-throughput screening as a potential HIV latency reversing agent (LRA). Reactivation of latent HIV infection in patients is part of an investigational strategy known as ""shock and kill"" which may be able to reduce or eliminate the HIV reservoir. Recent phase II dose-escalation studies in patients with HIV who are controlled on antiretroviral therapy have observed an increase in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA with increasing exposure to disulfiram and its metabolites. Disulfiram is also being investigated in combination with vorinostat, another investigational latency reversing agent, to treat HIV. == References == == External links == ""Disulfiram"".

1110,"('Doripenem (monohydrate)', 'S 4661 monohydrate', 'Doripenem', 'Doribax', 'Finibax')",Medical,"Doripenem (Doribax, Finibax) is an antibiotic drug in the carbapenem class. It is a beta-lactam antibiotic drug able to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Doripenem can be used for bacterial infections such as: complex abdominal infections, pneumonia within the setting of a hospital, and complicated infections of the urinary tract including kidney infections with sepsis. The greater stability of doripenem in aqueous solution compared to earlier members of the carbapenem class allows it to be administered as an infusion over 4 hours or more, which may be advantageous in the treatment of certain difficult-to-treat infections. It may present a lower risk of inducing seizures than other carbapenems. == Chemistry and pharmacology == Doripenem is a beta-lactam antibiotic agent belonging to the carbapenem group, with a broad spectrum of bacterial sensitivity including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In vivo, doripenem inhibits the synthesis of cell walls by attaching itself to penicillin-binding proteins, also known as PBPs. However it is not active against MRSA. It is stable against beta-lactamases including those with extended spectrum, but it is susceptible to the action of carbapenemases. Doripenem is also more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than other carbapenems. == Physicochemical properties == Doripenem appears as crystalline powder, with colour anywhere from a white to somewhat yellowish. Doripenem is moderately soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol, and virtually insoluble in ethanol. Doripenem is also soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide. Doripenem's chemical configuration has 6 asymmetrical carbon atoms (6 stereocentres) and is most commonly supplied as one pure isomer. In terms of doripenem for injection, the crystallized powdered drug can form a monohydrate when mixed with water. However, doripenem has not been proven to possess polymorphism == Adverse effects == Seizure risk: carbapenems in general have been reported to cause seizure activity in some people. In addition, those who already have a seizure disorder may be at risk for further seizures if they are using valproic acid to control their seizures; doripenem has been found to decrease serum concentrations of valproic acid. Infection related: use of doripenem can lead to Clostridioides difficile infection. It has also been noted to increase mortality in people who have ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and is no longer recommended as a treatment for this condition. == Resistance == Potential avenues for the development of resistance to doripenem are: altered PBPs (penicillin-binding protein), reduced activity in the permeability of the outer membrane especially when accepting foreign toxic substances within the cell, and deactivation of the drug by hydrolyzing enzymes from the carbapenem. Beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases) formed by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can stabilize doripenem to hydrolysis. However, carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamases are an exception. == Pharmacokinetics == === Distribution === On average, about 8.1% of plasma proteins attached to doripenem; it is separate from drug concentrations of plasma. Doripenem’s distribution volume is close to that of extracellular fluid volume in humans (18.2 L). When doripenem is essentially stable, the average volume of distribution is approximately 16.8 L. Within the few of the body’s fluids and tissues, Doripenem is filtered successfully as well as reaching concentration levels that are able to restrain from more vulnerable bacteria than what is required. === Metabolism === Doripenem is metabolized by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-I into an inactive ring-opened metabolite. === Excretion === In young and healthy adults, the elimination half-life of doripenem considering the average plasma terminal is normally around 1 hour. The plasma clearance is about 15.9 L/hour and the average renal clearance is 10.3 L/hour. Research indicates doripenem is filtered by the glomerular capillary bed in Bowman’s capsule and the tubular secretions in the nephron. == Society and culture == === Regulatory and marketing === It was launched by Shionogi Co. of Japan under the brand name in 2005 and is being marketed outside Japan by Johnson & Johnson. Doripenem was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on October 12, 2007, to be sold under the tradename Doribax. It has since been discontinued in the United States. == References == == Further reading ==",Doribax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5258672647178173e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043764073052443564)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/doribax.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Doribax: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/doribax.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1111,"('Pomaglumetad', '(1r,4s,5s,6s)-4-amino-2-thiabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid 2,2-dioxide', 'Ly 404039', 'Ex-a2094', 'S6001')",Medical,"Pomaglumetad (LY-404,039) is an amino acid analog drug that acts as a highly selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor group II subtypes mGluR2 and mGluR3. Pharmacological research has focused on its potential antipsychotic and anxiolytic effects. Pomaglumetad is intended as a treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic and anxiety disorders by modulating glutamatergic activity and reducing presynaptic release of glutamate at synapses in limbic and forebrain areas relevant to these disorders. Human studies investigating therapeutic use of pomaglumetad have focused on the prodrug LY-2140023, a methionine amide of pomaglumetad (also called pomaglumetad methionil) since pomaglumetad exhibits low oral absorption and bioavailability in humans. Early human trials using this prodrug form of pomaglumetad gave encouraging results. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. In 2015, Denovo Biopharma exclusively licensed LY-2140023 (the prodrug) for further development, having identified ""a meaningful subset of patients who showed significantly improved outcomes"". == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics === Clinical development of pomaglumetad resulted from efforts to discover potent and selective mGluR agonists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Pomaglumetad is highly selective for group II metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR3. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. pomaglumetad has been shown to act as a potent full agonist at group II mGluRs as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, formation as a result of stimulation by forskolin. Pomaglumetad has been shown to modulate glutamatergic activity in the limbic and forebrain areas, where group II mGlu receptors are most densely localized. The specific binding of pomaglumetad to human cloned mGlu receptors has been found to be highest for mGluR2 (Ki = 149 ± 11 nM) and relatively high for mGluR3 (Ki = 92 ± 14 nM). Research suggests that it does not have any appreciable affinity for other metabotropic glutamate receptors, ionotropic NMDA receptors, or kainate receptors, nor does it appear to have any affinity for adrenergic, benzodiazepine/GABAergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors. The functional activity of pomaglumetad on mGluR receptors has been further demonstrated by investigating the drug's ability to suppress electrically stimulated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs. Pomaglumetad has been shown to attenuate cortically evoked EPSPs in rat striatal spiny neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, mediated by activation of mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors. This suppressive effect of pomaglumetad on stimulated EPSPs is reversed by the use of mGluR2/3 antagonists, such as LY341495. Pomaglumetad possesses partial agonist actions at D2 receptors and inhibits the binding of the D2-specific antagonist [3H]domperidone to human cloned D2 receptors. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Pomaglumetad also appears to have some effects on serotonin. It has been shown that pomaglumetad increases serotonin turnover, increasing the ratio of 5-HIAA to 5-HT, and suppresses serotonin-induced glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex. There is disagreement in the literature as to the possible agonistic action that pomaglumetad has on dopamine receptors. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. === Novelty === Based on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Pomaglumetad was one of the first drugs to be suggested as effective in treating psychosis without any apparent interference in dopaminergic function. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Structurally, pomaglumetad is a close relative to other mGluR2/3 orthosteric agonists eglumetad, LY-379,268, LY-389,795, and MGS-008, all of which are members of the bicyclohexane family. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. == Animal studies == The pharmacokinetic profile of pomaglumetad has been primarily investigated in rodent models. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. In overnight-fasted rats, intravenous dosing resulted in an AUC0-24 value of 2.9 μg*h/mL and a Cmax value of 7.5 μg/mL. Oral administration resulted in an AUC0-24 value of 7.2 μg*h/mL and a Cmax value of 4.0 μg/mL. The oral bioavailability in these rats was found to be 63%. Pomaglumetad demonstrates similar efficacy to clozapine for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in amphetamine and PCP animal models. In both mice and rat studies, the drug demonstrates inhibition of induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned avoidance responding. Pomaglumetad has also been shown to attenuate fear-potentiated startle and reduce marble burying in rodents, predictive of anxiolytic efficacy. Use of pomaglumetad in rodent models indicates a lack of motor side effects or impairment, as determined by experiments using a rotarod. There also appear to be no sedative effects. Animal studies and neurochemical models have also shown that use of pomaglumetad augments the efficacy of known antipsychotics, predictive of potential clinical efficacy in schizophrenia treatment. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. == Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil == Despite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. A single dose of 200 mg results in an AUC value of 900 ng*h/mL. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. === Synthesis and pharmacology === LY-2140023 was identified using the analogous peptide prodrug approach used previously for talaglumetad, the prodrug of eglumetad. Synthesis was the result of preparation of LY-389795 followed by oxidation to pomaglumetad and coupling with L-methionine. LY-2140023 uses a human peptide transporter and hydrolytic pathways to deliver pomaglumetad to systemic circulation in humans. It is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to produce active pomaglumetad (~70% conversion), increasing its estimated bioavailability to 49%. In humans, use of LY-2140023 resulted in significantly higher plasma levels of pomaglumetad compared with oral administration of LY-404039. LY-2140023 appears to be an inactive prodrug, as Ki values for the drug have been found to be greater than 100 μM. === Treatment for schizophrenia === LY-2140023 is the first drug acting on mGlu receptors that has been studied in humans for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. It is suspected that LY-2140023 may balance and normalize dysregulated and hyperactive cortical pyramidal neurons in regions associated with schizophrenia and psychosis such as the thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system. Clinical trials using LY-2140023 have investigated its use as a therapy when administered alone and as an adjuvant therapy used in addition to atypical antipsychotics. === Dosage and usage === The dosage of LY-2140023 given to patients has varied by clinical trial, though dosages have typically ranged between 10 mg and 40 mg twice daily (BID). In an early phase II monotherapy trial, the dosage shown to be efficacious was 40 mg BID. Later trials investigating the use of LY-2140023 as an adjuvant to the antipsychotic medications already used by patients participating in the study utilized a lower dose of 20 mg BID. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg. === Efficacy and clinical trials === In 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. The researchers on the clinical trial hypothesized that the lack of significant difference between LY-2140023 and olanzapine on their outcome measures was due to incorrect dosage of LY-2140023, and that the optimal therapeutic dose was yet to be determined. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found to be more efficacious than placebo on measures of PANSS total score. However, the results of this study were considered inconclusive because neither the LY-2140023 or the olanzapine (active control) groups demonstrated significant differences in treatment as compared to the placebo. Due to the possibility of a heightened placebo response that may have reduced the ability to detect a significant response to the drug across the LY-2140023 and olanzapine groups, clinical studies of the drug's efficacy were continued. A phase II, multicenter, randomized, parallel, active-controlled study with an open-label design was conducted in 2013 to investigate tolerability, efficacy and adverse effects of long-term treatment with LY-2140023. Patients receiving LY-2140023 were compared to patients receiving other antipsychotic medications, including olanzapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole, for a 24-week treatment phase and optional 28-week extension phase. Researchers found that over the initial 6–8 weeks of treatment, the improvement on the PANSS did not differ between groups. At later time points, it was found that the groups receiving the antipsychotic medications showed significantly greater improvement than the LY-2140023 group. === Tolerability and side effects === LY-2140023 has generally been found to be safe and tolerable. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects reported with use of the drug include insomnia, nausea, headache, somnolence, affect lability and blood creatine phosphokinase increase. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in association with LY-2140023 use during an initial phase II clinical trial. However, a second, multicenter study reported four patients experiencing convulsions, suggesting a potential for increased risk of seizures during treatment. A long-term study found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to discontinuation of use due to lack of tolerability between patients using LY-2140023 and other antipsychotic medications. Mild weight loss has also been associated with LY-2140023. In patients receiving 40 mg twice daily, a 0.51 kg weight reduction was observed after 4 weeks of treatment. === Eli Lilly stops phase III development === In August 2012, Eli Lilly and Company announced their decision to stop their ongoing clinical studies investigating LY-2140023 as a treatment for schizophrenia after their phase II study did not meet its primary endpoint. The company completed a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group-assignment, dose-ranging, inpatient, multi-center clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive 5, 20, 40, or 80 mg of LY-2140023, placebo, or olanzapine for 28 days. Results of the clinical trial indicated that neither LY-2140023 nor olanzapine were significantly more efficacious than the placebo as determined with PANSS total scores. Post hoc analyses indicated only a trend towards improvement with LY-2140023, while olanzapine was associated with a significant improvement in total PANSS total score. Of the decision to stop development, Jan Lundberg, PhD and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said ""I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness"". === Denovo Biopharma licenses LY-2140023 === In 2015, Denovo Biopharma exclusively licensed LY-2140023 for further development, having identified ""a meaningful subset of patients who showed significantly improved outcomes"". Under licensing deal, Denovo gains all rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize pomaglumetad globally, including transfer of all intellectual property and other rights, data, and information. Lilly has an option to re-acquire pomaglumetad upon a successful clinical trial, for predetermined but undisclosed financial terms. == References ==",Pomaglumetad,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3869052827358246), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003475538978818804), ('ICAL', -2.622600959512056e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04859505221247673)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomaglumetad?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=6, title='Pomaglumetad', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomaglumetad?utm_source=openai')])"
1112,"('Ampicillin', 'Œ±-aminobenzylpenicillin', 'Aminobenzylpenicillin', 'Ampicillin acid', 'Amcill')",Medical,"Ampicillin is an antibiotic belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family. The drug is used to prevent and treat several bacterial infections, such as respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, salmonellosis, and endocarditis. It may also be used to prevent group B streptococcal infection in newborns. It is used by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or intravenously. Common side effects include rash, nausea, and diarrhea. It should not be used in people who are allergic to penicillin. Serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis or anaphylaxis. While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased. Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be generally safe. Ampicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into commercial use in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies ampicillin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Diseases === Bacterial meningitis; an aminoglycoside can be added to increase efficacy against gram-negative meningitis bacteria Endocarditis by enterococcal strains (off-label use); often given with an aminoglycoside Gastrointestinal infections caused by contaminated water or food (for example, by Salmonella) Genito-urinary tract infections Healthcare-associated infections that are related to infections from using urinary catheters and that are unresponsive to other medications Otitis media (middle ear infection) Prophylaxis (i.e. to prevent infection) in those who previously had rheumatic heart disease or are undergoing dental procedures, vaginal hysterectomies, or C-sections. It is also used in pregnant woman who are carriers of group B streptococci to prevent early-onset neonatal infections. Respiratory infections, including bronchitis, pharyngitis Sinusitis Sepsis Whooping cough, to prevent and treat secondary infections Ampicillin used to also be used to treat gonorrhea, but there are now too many strains resistant to penicillins. === Bacteria === Ampicillin is used to treat infections by many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It was the first ""broad spectrum"" penicillin with activity against gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, some isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (but not penicillin-resistant or methicillin-resistant strains), Trueperella, and some Enterococcus. It is one of the few antibiotics that works against multidrug resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Activity against gram-negative bacteria includes Neisseria meningitidis, some Haemophilus influenzae, and some of the Enterobacteriaceae (though most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas are resistant). Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by co-administration of sulbactam, a drug that inhibits beta lactamase, an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics. It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action, like vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. === Available forms === Ampicillin can be administered by mouth, an intramuscular injection (shot) or by intravenous infusion. The oral form, available as capsules or oral suspensions, is not given as an initial treatment for severe infections, but rather as a follow-up to an IM or IV injection. For IV and IM injections, ampicillin is kept as a powder that must be reconstituted. IV injections must be given slowly, as rapid IV injections can lead to convulsive seizures. === Specific populations === Ampicillin is one of the most used drugs in pregnancy, and has been found to be generally harmless both by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. (which classified it as category B) and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia (which classified it as category A). It is the drug of choice for treating Listeria monocytogenes in pregnant women, either alone or combined with an aminoglycoside. Pregnancy increases the clearance of ampicillin by up to 50%, and a higher dose is thus needed to reach therapeutic levels. Ampicillin crosses the placenta and remains in the amniotic fluid at 50–100% of the concentration in maternal plasma; this can lead to high concentrations of ampicillin in the newborn. While lactating mothers secrete some ampicillin into their breast milk, the amount is minimal. In newborns, ampicillin has a longer half-life and lower plasma protein binding. The clearance by the kidneys is lower, as kidney function has not fully developed. == Contraindications == Ampicillin is contraindicated in those with a hypersensitivity to penicillins, as they can cause fatal anaphylactic reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions can include frequent skin rashes and hives, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and a temporary decrease in both red and white blood cells. Ampicillin is not recommended in people with concurrent mononucleosis, as over 40% of patients develop a skin rash. == Side effects == Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics, and side effects are more likely in those who are sensitive to penicillins and those with a history of asthma or allergies. In very rare cases, it causes severe side effects such as angioedema, anaphylaxis, and C. difficile infection (that can range from mild diarrhea to serious pseudomembranous colitis). Some develop black ""furry"" tongue. Serious adverse effects also include seizures and serum sickness. The most common side effects, experienced by about 10% of users are diarrhea and rash. Less common side effects can be nausea, vomiting, itching, and blood dyscrasias. The gastrointestinal effects, such as hairy tongue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and colitis, are more common with the oral form of penicillin. Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment. === Overdose === Ampicillin overdose can cause behavioral changes, confusion, blackouts, and convulsions, as well as neuromuscular hypersensitivity, electrolyte imbalance, and kidney failure. == Interactions == Ampicillin reacts with probenecid and methotrexate to decrease renal excretion. Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants, possibly by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Ampicillin has been said to make oral contraceptives less effective, but this has been disputed. It can be made less effective by other antibiotic, such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cephalosporins, and tetracyclines. For example, tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria, reducing the target against which ampicillin acts. If given at the same time as aminoglycosides, it can bind to it and inactivate it. When administered separately, aminoglycosides and ampicillin can potentiate each other instead. Ampicillin causes skin rashes more often when given with allopurinol. Both the live cholera vaccine and live typhoid vaccine can be made ineffective if given with ampicillin. Ampicillin is normally used to treat cholera and typhoid fever, lowering the immunological response that the body has to mount. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ampicillin is in the penicillin group of beta-lactam antibiotics and is part of the aminopenicillin family. It is roughly equivalent to amoxicillin in terms of activity. Ampicillin is able to penetrate gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. It differs from penicillin G, or benzylpenicillin, only by the presence of an amino group. This amino group, present on both ampicillin and amoxicillin, helps these antibiotics pass through the pores of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella. Ampicillin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme transpeptidase, which is needed by bacteria to make the cell wall. It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis in binary fission, which ultimately leads to cell lysis; therefore, ampicillin is usually bacteriolytic. === Pharmacokinetics === Ampicillin is well-absorbed from the GI tract (though food reduces its absorption), and reaches peak concentrations in one to two hours. The bioavailability is around 62% for parenteral routes. Unlike other penicillins, which usually bind 60–90% to plasma proteins, ampicillin binds to only 15–20%. Ampicillin is distributed through most tissues, though it is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. It can also be found in the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges become inflamed (such as, for example, meningitis). Some ampicillin is metabolized by hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring to penicilloic acid, though most of it is excreted unchanged. In the kidneys, it is filtered out mostly by tubular secretion; some also undergoes glomerular filtration, and the rest is excreted in the feces and bile. Hetacillin and pivampicillin are ampicillin esters that have been developed to increase bioavailability. == History == Ampicillin has been used extensively to treat bacterial infections since 1961. Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company Beecham, penicillin therapies had only been effective against gram-positive organisms such as staphylococci and streptococci. Ampicillin (originally branded as ""Penbritin"") also demonstrated activity against gram-negative organisms such as H. influenzae, coliforms, and Proteus spp. == Society and culture == === Economics === Ampicillin is relatively inexpensive. In the United States, it is available as a generic medication. == Veterinary use == In veterinary medicine, ampicillin is used in cats, dogs, and farm animals to treat: Anal gland infections Cutaneous infections, such as abscesses, cellulitis, and pustular dermatitis E. coli and Salmonella infections in cattle, sheep, and goats (oral form). Ampicillin use for this purpose had declined as bacterial resistance has increased. Mastitis in sows Mixed aerobic–anaerobic infections, such as from cat bites Multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium Prophylactic use in poultry against Salmonella and sepsis from E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus Respiratory tract infections, including tonsilitis, bovine respiratory disease, shipping fever, bronchopneumonia, and calf and bovine pneumonia Urinary tract infections in dogs Horses are generally not treated with oral ampicillin, as they have low bioavailability of beta-lactams. The half-life in animals is around that same of that in humans (just over an hour). Oral absorption is less than 50% in cats and dogs, and less than 4% in horses. == References == == External links == GB patent 902703, Frank Peter Doyle, John Herbert Charles Nayler, Harry Smith, ""Penicillins"", published 1962-08-09, assigned to Beecham Research Laboratories Ltd US patent 2985648, Frank Peter Doyle, John Herbert Charles Nayler, Harry Smith, ""Alpha-aminobenzylpenicillins"", published 1961-05-23, issued 1961-05-23 US patent 3157640, David A Johnson & Glenn A Hardcastle Jr, ""D-(-)-alpha-aminobenzylpenicillin trihydrate"", published 1964-11-17, issued 1964-11-17, assigned to Bristol Myers Co",Amcill,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017724849749356508), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001529715140350163)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019286326132714748), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([meshb.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000667&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='MeSH Browser', type='url_citation', url='https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000667&utm_source=openai')])"

The synthetic lethal approach is attractive because it enables targeting of cancers harboring specific genomic or epigenomic alterations, the products of which may have proven refractory to direct targeting. An example is cancer driven by overexpression of MYC. Here, we conducted a high-content screen for compounds that are synthetic lethal to elevated MYC using a small-molecule library to identify compounds that are closely related to, or are themselves, regulatory-approved drugs. The screen identified dimethylfasudil, a potent and reversible inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases, ROCK1 and ROCK2. Close analogs of dimethylfasudil are used clinically to treat neurologic and cardiovascular disorders. The synthetic lethal interaction was conserved in rodent and human cell lines and could be observed with activation of either MYC or its paralog MYCN. The synthetic lethality seems specific to MYC overexpressing cells as it could not be substituted by a variety of oncogenic manipulations and synthetic lethality was diminished by RNAi-mediated depletion of MYC in human cancer cell lines.

1115,"('Isoquinoline', 'Benzo[c]pyridine', 'Isochinolin', 'Beta-quinoline', 'Benzo(c)pyridine')",Medical,"Isoquinoline is an individual chemical specimen - a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound - as well as the name of a family of many thousands of natural plant alkaloids, any one of which might be referred to as ""an isoquinoline"". It is a structural isomer of quinoline. Isoquinoline and quinoline are benzopyridines, which are composed of a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. In a broader sense, the term isoquinoline is used to make reference to isoquinoline derivatives. 1-Benzylisoquinoline is the structural backbone in many naturally occurring alkaloids such as papaverine. The isoquinoline ring in these natural compound derives from the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. == Properties == Isoquinoline is a colorless hygroscopic liquid at temperatures above its melting point with a penetrating, unpleasant odor. Impure samples can appear brownish, as is typical for nitrogen heterocycles. It crystallizes in form of platelets that have a low solubility in water but dissolve well in ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether, carbon disulfide, and other common organic solvents. It is also soluble in dilute acids as the protonated derivative. Being an analog of pyridine, isoquinoline is a weak base, with a pKa of 5.14. It protonates to form salts upon treatment with strong acids, such as HCl. It forms adducts with Lewis acids, such as BF3. == Production == Isoquinoline was first isolated from coal tar in 1885 by Hoogewerf and van Dorp. They isolated it by fractional crystallization of the acid sulfate. Weissgerber developed a more rapid route in 1914 by selective extraction of coal tar, exploiting the fact that isoquinoline is more basic than quinoline. Isoquinoline can then be isolated from the mixture by fractional crystallization of the acid sulfate. Although isoquinoline derivatives can be synthesized by several methods, relatively few direct methods deliver the unsubstituted isoquinoline. The Pomeranz–Fritsch reaction provides an efficient method for the preparation of isoquinoline. This reaction uses a benzaldehyde and aminoacetoaldehyde diethyl acetal, which in an acid medium react to form isoquinoline. Alternatively, benzylamine and a glyoxal acetal can be used, to produce the same result using the Schlittler-Müller modification. Several other methods are useful for the preparation of various isoquinoline derivatives. In the Bischler–Napieralski reaction an β-phenylethylamine is acylated and cyclodehydrated by a Lewis acid, such as phosphoryl chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. The resulting 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline can then be dehydrogenated using palladium. The following Bischler–Napieralski reaction produces papaverine. The Pictet–Gams reaction and the Pictet–Spengler reaction are both variations on the Bischler–Napieralski reaction. A Pictet–Gams reaction works similarly to the Bischler–Napieralski reaction; the only difference being that an additional hydroxy group in the reactant provides a site for dehydration under the same reaction conditions as the cyclization to give the isoquinoline rather than requiring a separate reaction to convert a dihydroisoquinoline intermediate. In a Pictet–Spengler reaction, a condensation of a β-phenylethylamine and an aldehyde forms an imine, which undergoes a cyclization to form a tetrahydroisoquinoline instead of the dihydroisoquinoline. In enzymology, the (S)-norcoclaurine synthase (EC 4.2.1.78) is an enzyme that catalyzes a biological Pictect-Spengler synthesis: Intramolecular aza Wittig reactions also afford isoquinolines. == Applications of derivatives == Isoquinolines find many applications, including: anesthetics; dimethisoquin is one example (shown below). antihypertension agents, such as quinapril and debrisoquine (all derived from 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline). antiretroviral agents, such as saquinavir with an isoquinolyl functional group, (shown below). vasodilators, a well-known example, papaverine, shown below. platinum complexes of urea functionalized isoquinolines have been used as anion receptors for chloride and sulfate. Bisbenzylisoquinolinium compounds are compounds similar in structure to tubocurarine. They have two isoquinolinium structures, linked by a carbon chain, containing two ester linkages. == In the human body == Parkinson's disease, a slowly progressing movement disorder, is thought to be caused by certain neurotoxins. A neurotoxin called MPTP (1[N]-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the precursor to MPP+, was found and linked to Parkinson's disease in the 1980s. The active neurotoxins destroy dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. Several tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives have been found to have the same neurochemical properties as MPTP. These derivatives may act as precursors to active neurotoxins. == Other uses == Isoquinolines are used in the manufacture of dyes, paints, insecticides and fungicides. It is also used as a solvent for the liquid–liquid extraction of resins and terpenes, and as a corrosion inhibitor. == See also == Eletefine (1998), an isoquinoline alkaloid Naphthalene, an analog without the nitrogen atom == References == == External links == ""Quinoline"" .

In healthy adults, supplementation with HMB has been shown to increase exercise-induced gains in muscle size, muscle strength, and lean body mass, reduce skeletal muscle damage from exercise, improve aerobic exercise performance, and expedite recovery from exercise. Medical reviews and meta-analyses indicate that HMB supplementation also helps to preserve or increase lean body mass and muscle strength in individuals experiencing age-related muscle loss. HMB produces these effects in part by stimulating the production of proteins and inhibiting the breakdown of proteins in muscle tissue. No adverse effects from long-term use as a dietary supplement in adults have been found. The effects of HMB on human skeletal muscle were first discovered by Steven L. Nissen at Iowa State University in the mid-1990s. As of 2018, HMB has not been banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, World Anti-Doping Agency, or any other prominent national or international athletic organization. In 2006, only about 2% of college student athletes in the United States used HMB as a dietary supplement. As of 2017, HMB has reportedly found widespread use as an ergogenic supplement among young athletes. == Uses == === Available forms === HMB is sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement in the free acid form, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB-FA), and as a monohydrated calcium salt of the conjugate base, calcium β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate monohydrate (HMB-Ca, CaHMB). Since only a small fraction of HMB's metabolic precursor, L-leucine, is metabolized into HMB, pharmacologically active concentrations of the compound in blood plasma and muscle can only be achieved by supplementing HMB directly. A healthy adult produces approximately 0.3 grams per day, while supplemental HMB is usually taken in doses of 3–6 grams per day. HMB is sold at a cost of about US$30–50 per month when taken in doses of 3 grams per day. HMB is also contained in several nutritional products and medical foods marketed by Abbott Laboratories (e.g., certain formulations of Ensure and Juven), and is present in insignificant quantities in certain foods, such as alfalfa, asparagus, avocados, cauliflower, grapefruit, and catfish. === Medical === Supplemental HMB has been used in clinical trials as a treatment for preserving lean body mass in muscle wasting conditions, particularly sarcopenia, and has been studied in clinical trials as an adjunct therapy in conjunction with resistance exercise. Based upon two medical reviews and a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials, HMB supplementation can preserve or increase lean muscle mass and muscle strength in sarcopenic older adults. HMB does not appear to significantly affect fat mass in older adults. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that HMB supplementation may also prevent muscle atrophy during bed rest. A growing body of evidence supports the efficacy of HMB in nutritional support for reducing, or even reversing, the loss of muscle mass, muscle function, and muscle strength that occurs in hypercatabolic disease states such as cancer cachexia; consequently, the authors of two 2016 reviews of the clinical evidence recommended that the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and muscle wasting in general include supplementation with HMB, regular resistance exercise, and consumption of a high-protein diet. Clinical trials that used HMB for the treatment of muscle wasting have involved the administration of 3 grams of HMB per day under different dosing regimens. According to one review, an optimal dosing regimen is to administer it in one 1 gram dose, three times a day, since this ensures elevated plasma concentrations of HMB throughout the day; however, as of 2016 the best dosing regimen for muscle wasting conditions is still being investigated. Some branded products that contain HMB (i.e., certain formulations of Ensure and Juven) are medical foods that are intended to be used to provide nutritional support under the care of a doctor in individuals with muscle wasting due to HIV/AIDS or cancer, to promote wound healing following surgery or injury, or when otherwise recommended by a medical professional. Juven, a nutrition product which contains 3 grams of HMB-Ca, 14 grams of L-arginine, and 14 grams of L-glutamine per two servings, has been shown to improve lean body mass during clinical trials in individuals with AIDS and cancer, but not rheumatoid cachexia. Further research involving the treatment of cancer cachexia with Juven over a period of several months is required to adequately determine treatment efficacy. === Enhancing performance === With an appropriate exercise program, dietary supplementation with 3 grams of HMB per day has been shown to increase exercise-induced gains in muscle size, muscle strength and power, and lean body mass, reduce exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage, and expedite recovery from high-intensity exercise. Based upon limited clinical research, HMB supplementation may also improve aerobic exercise performance and increase gains in aerobic fitness when combined with high-intensity interval training. These effects of HMB are more pronounced in untrained individuals and athletes who perform high intensity resistance or aerobic exercise. In resistance-trained populations, the effects of HMB on muscle strength and lean body mass are limited. HMB affects muscle size, strength, mass, power, and recovery in part by stimulating myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis and inhibiting muscle protein breakdown through various mechanisms, including the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and inhibition of proteasome-mediated proteolysis in skeletal muscles. The efficacy of HMB supplementation for reducing skeletal muscle damage from prolonged or high-intensity exercise is affected by the time that it is used relative to exercise. The greatest reduction in skeletal muscle damage from a single bout of exercise has been shown to occur when HMB-Ca is ingested 1–2 hours prior to exercise or HMB-FA is ingested 30–60 minutes prior to exercise. In 2006, only about 2% of college student athletes in the United States used HMB as a dietary supplement. As of 2017, HMB has found widespread use as an ergogenic supplement among athletes. As of 2018, HMB has not been banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, World Anti-Doping Agency, or any other prominent national or international athletic organization. == Side effects == The safety profile of HMB in adult humans is based upon evidence from clinical trials in humans and animal studies. In humans, no adverse effects in young adults or older adults have been reported when HMB is taken in doses of 3 grams per day for up to a year. Studies on young adults taking 6 grams of HMB per day for up to 2 months have also reported no adverse effects. Studies with supplemental HMB on young, growing rats and livestock have reported no adverse effects based upon clinical chemistry or observable characteristics; for humans younger than 18, there is limited data on the safety of supplemental HMB. The human equivalent dose of HMB for the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) that was identified in a rat model is approximately 0.4 g/kg of body weight per day. Two animal studies have examined the effects of HMB supplementation in pregnant pigs on the offspring and reported no adverse effects on the fetus. No clinical testing with supplemental HMB has been conducted on pregnant women, and pregnant and lactating women are advised not to take HMB by Metabolic Technologies, Inc., the company that grants licenses to include HMB in dietary supplements, due to a lack of safety studies. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Several components of the signaling cascade that mediates the HMB-induced increase in human skeletal muscle protein synthesis have been identified in vivo. Similar to HMB's metabolic precursor, L-leucine, HMB has been shown to increase protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle via phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and subsequent activation of mTORC1Tooltip mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, which leads to protein biosynthesis in cellular ribosomes via phosphorylation of mTORC1's immediate targets (i.e., the p70S6 kinase and the translation repressor protein 4EBP1). Supplementation with HMB in several non-human animal species has been shown to increase the serum concentration of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) via an unknown mechanism, in turn promoting protein synthesis through increased mTOR phosphorylation. Based upon limited clinical evidence in humans, supplemental HMB appears to increase the secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1 in response to resistance exercise. As of 2016, the signaling cascade that mediates the HMB-induced reduction in muscle protein breakdown has not been identified in living humans, although it is well-established that it attenuates proteolysis in humans in vivo. Unlike L-leucine, HMB attenuates muscle protein breakdown in an insulin-independent manner in humans. HMB is believed to reduce muscle protein breakdown in humans by inhibiting the 19S and 20S subunits of the ubiquitin–proteasome system in skeletal muscle and by inhibiting apoptosis of skeletal muscle nuclei via unidentified mechanisms. Based upon animal studies, HMB appears to be metabolized within skeletal muscle into cholesterol, which may then be incorporated into the muscle cell membrane, thereby enhancing membrane integrity and function. The effects of HMB on muscle protein metabolism may help stabilize muscle cell structure. One review suggested that the observed HMB-induced reduction in the plasma concentration of muscle damage biomarkers (i.e., muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) in humans following intense exercise may be due to a cholesterol-mediated improvement in muscle cell membrane function. HMB has been shown to stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of human myosatellite cells in vitro, which potentially increases the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle, by increasing the protein expression of certain myogenic regulatory factors (e.g., myoD and myogenin) and gene transcription factors (e.g., MEF2). HMB-induced human myosatellite cell proliferation in vitro is mediated through the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. HMB-induced human myosatellite differentiation and accelerated fusion of myosatellite cells into muscle tissue in vitro is mediated through the phosphorylation of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Comparison of pharmacokinetics between dosage forms ==== The free acid (HMB-FA) and monohydrated calcium salt (HMB-Ca) forms of HMB have different pharmacokinetics. HMB-FA is more readily absorbed into the bloodstream and has a longer elimination half-life (3 hours) relative to HMB-Ca (2.5 hours). Tissue uptake and utilization of HMB-FA is 25–40% higher than for HMB-Ca. The fraction of an ingested dose that is excreted in urine does not differ between the two forms. ==== Absorption of HMB-Ca ==== After ingestion, HMB-Ca is converted to β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate following dissociation of the calcium moiety in the gut. When the HMB-Ca dosage form is ingested, the magnitude and time at which the peak plasma concentration of HMB occurs depends on the dose and concurrent food intake. Higher HMB-Ca doses increase the rate of absorption, resulting in a peak plasma HMB level (Cmax) that is disproportionately greater than expected of a linear dose-response relationship and which occurs sooner relative to lower doses. Consumption of HMB-Ca with sugary substances slows the rate of HMB absorption, resulting in a lower peak plasma HMB level that occurs later. ==== Excretion of HMB-Ca ==== HMB is eliminated via the kidneys, with roughly 10–40% of an ingested dose being excreted unchanged in urine. The remaining 60–90% of the dose is retained in tissues or excreted as HMB metabolites. The fraction of a given dose of HMB that is excreted unchanged in urine increases with the dose. ==== Metabolism ==== The metabolism of HMB is catalyzed by an uncharacterized enzyme which converts it to β-hydroxy β-methylbutyryl-CoA (HMB-CoA). HMB-CoA is metabolized by either enoyl-CoA hydratase or another uncharacterized enzyme, producing β-methylcrotonyl-CoA (MC-CoA) or hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) respectively. MC-CoA is then converted by the enzyme methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase to methylglutaconyl-CoA (MG-CoA), which is subsequently converted to HMG-CoA by methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. HMG-CoA is then cleaved into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate by HMG-CoA lyase or used in the production of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. === Biosynthesis === HMB is synthesized in the human body through the metabolism of L-leucine, a branched-chain amino acid. In healthy individuals, approximately 60% of dietary L-leucine is metabolized after several hours, with roughly 5% (2–10% range) of dietary L-leucine being converted to HMB. The vast majority of L-leucine metabolism is initially catalyzed by the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase enzyme, producing α-ketoisocaproate (α-KIC). α-KIC is mostly metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which converts it to isovaleryl-CoA. Isovaleryl-CoA is subsequently metabolized by isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and converted to MC-CoA, which is used in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA and other compounds. During biotin deficiency, HMB can be synthesized from MC-CoA via enoyl-CoA hydratase and an unknown thioesterase enzyme, which convert MC-CoA into HMB-CoA and HMB-CoA into HMB respectively. A relatively small amount of α-KIC is metabolized in the liver by the cytosolic enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (KIC dioxygenase), which converts α-KIC to HMB. In healthy individuals, this minor pathway – which involves the conversion of L-leucine to α-KIC and then HMB – is the predominant route of HMB synthesis. == Chemistry == β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid is a monocarboxylic β-hydroxy acid and natural product with the molecular formula C5H10O3. At room temperature, pure β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid occurs as a transparent, colorless to light yellow liquid which is soluble in water. β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid is a weak acid with a pKa of 4.4. Its refractive index ( n 25°C λ = 589 n m {\displaystyle {\mathit {n}}_{\text{25°C}}^{\mathrm {\lambda =589nm} }} ) is 1.42. === Chemical structure === β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid is a member of the carboxylic acid family of organic compounds. It is a structural analog of butyric acid with a hydroxyl functional group and a methyl substituent located on its beta carbon. By extension, other structural analogs include β-hydroxybutyric acid and β-methylbutyric acid. === Synthesis === A variety of synthetic routes to β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid have been developed. The first reported chemical syntheses approached HMB by oxidation of alkene, vicinal diol, and alcohol precursors: in 1877, Russian chemists Michael and Alexander Zaytsev reported the preparation of HMB by oxidation of 2-methylpent-4-en-2-ol with chromic acid (H2CrO4); in 1880 and 1889, Schirokoff and Reformatsky (respectively) reported that the oxidative cleavage of the vicinal diol 4-methylpentane-1,2,4-triol with acidified potassium permanganate (KMnO4) yields HMB – this result is closest related to the first synthesis as cold dilute KMnO4 oxidises alkenes to vicinal cis-diols which hot acid KMnO4 further oxidises to carbonyl-containing compounds, and the diol intermediate is not obtained when hot acidic conditions are used for alkene oxidation. In other words, racemic 4-methylpentane-1,2,4-triol is a derivative of 2-methylpent-4-en-2-ol and β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid is a derivative of both; and, in 1892, Kondakow reported the preparation of HMB by permanganate oxidation of 3-methylbutane-1,3-diol. Depending on the experimental conditions, cycloaddition of acetone and ketene produces either β-isovalerolactone or 4,4-dimethyloxetan-2-one, both of which hydrolyze under basic conditions to yield the conjugate base of HMB. The haloform reaction provides another pathway to HMB involving the exhaustive halogenation of the methyl-ketone region of diacetone alcohol with sodium hypobromite or sodium hypochlorite; Diacetone alcohol is readily available from the aldol condensation of acetone. An organometallic approach to HMB involves the carboxylation of tert-butyl alcohol with carbon monoxide and Fenton's reagent (hydrogen peroxide and ferrous iron). Alternatively, HMB can be prepared through microbial oxidation of β-methylbutyric acid by the fungus Galactomyces reessii. === Detection in body fluids === The concentration of naturally produced HMB has been measured in several human body fluids using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry methods. In the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy adults, the average molar concentration of HMB has been measured at 4.0 micromolar (μM). The average concentration of HMB in the intramuscular fluid of healthy men of ages 21–23 has been measured at 7.0 μM. In the urine of healthy individuals of any age, the excreted urinary concentration of HMB has been measured in a range of 0–68 micromoles per millimole (μmol/mmol) of creatinine. In the breast milk of healthy lactating women, HMB and L-leucine have been measured in ranges of 42–164 μg/L and 2.1–88.5 mg/L. In comparison, HMB has been detected and measured in the milk of healthy cows at a concentration of <20–29 μg/L. This concentration is far too low to be an adequate dietary source of HMB for obtaining pharmacologically active concentrations of the compound in blood plasma. In a study where participants consumed 2.42 grams of pure HMB-FA while fasting, the average plasma HMB concentration increased from a basal level of 5.1 μM to 408 μM after 30 minutes. At 150 minutes post-ingestion, the average plasma HMB concentration among participants was 275 μM. Abnormal HMB concentrations in urine and blood plasma have been noted in several disease states where it may serve as a diagnostic biomarker, particularly in the case of metabolic disorders. The following table lists some of these disorders along with the associated HMB concentrations detected in urine or blood plasma. == History == The first reported chemical synthesis of HMB was published in 1877 by the Russian chemists Michael and Alexander Zaytsev. HMB was isolated from the bark of Erythrophleum couminga (a Madagascan tree) in 1941 by Leopold Ružička. The earliest reported isolation of HMB as a human metabolite was by Tanaka and coworkers in 1968 from a patient with isovaleric acidemia. The effects of HMB on human skeletal muscle were first discovered by Steven L. Nissen at Iowa State University in the mid-1990s. Nissen founded a company called Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI) around the time of his discovery, which later acquired six HMB-related patents that the company has used to license the right to manufacture and incorporate HMB into dietary supplements. When it first became available commercially in the late 1990s, HMB was marketed solely as an exercise supplement to help athletes and bodybuilders build muscle. MTI subsequently developed two HMB-containing products, Juven and Revigor, to which Abbott Nutrition obtained the market rights in 2003 and 2008 respectively. Since then, Abbott has marketed Juven as a medical food and the Revigor brand of HMB as an active ingredient in food products (e.g., certain formulations of Ensure) and other medical foods (e.g., certain formulations of Juven). == See also == 3-Aminoisobutyric acid == Notes == == Reference notes == == References == == External links == Beta-Hydroxyisovaleric acid at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",B-hydroxyisovaleric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.1815323829650879), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.0445127372804563e-05), (' FOOD', -0.44594475626945496), (',', -0.0004886920796707273), (' MED', -0.575973629951477), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.1270151436328888), (' PERSONAL', -2.935296834039036e-06), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.7590731382369995), ('ICAL', -4.768360213347478e-06), (',', -1.0013530300057027e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.25280654430389404), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.0011712603736668825), ('ĠFOOD', -0.00011967896716669202), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06200772523880005)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.313274085521698), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

1119,"('Imrecoxib', 'Imricoxib')",Medical," Imrecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was discovered via the balanced inhibition strategy of COX-1/COX-2. It is indicated for the relief of painful symptoms of osteoarthritis. There have been some pharmacological and therapeutic advances since the approval of imrecoxib in 2011. However, an update review in this aspect is not yet available. Relevant literature until January 2024 was identified by search of PubMed, Web of science, Embase and CNKI. From the perspective of efficacy, imrecoxib provides relief of osteoarthritis symptoms, and potential off-label use for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, perioperative pain, hand-foot syndrome, axial spondyloarthritis, COVID-19, cartilage injury, and malignancies such as lung and colon cancer. From a safety point of view, imrecoxib showed adverse effects common to NSAIDs; however, it has lower incidence of new-onset hypertension than other types of selective COX-2 inhibitors, less gastrointestinal toxicities than non-selective NSAIDs, weaker risk of drug interaction than celecoxib, and more suitable for elderly patients due to balanced inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. From a pharmacoeconomic perspective, imrecoxib is more cost-effective than celecoxib and diclofenac for osteoarthritis patients. With the deepening of the disease pathophysiology study of osteoarthritis, new therapeutic schemes and pharmacological mechanisms are constantly discovered. In the field of osteoarthritis treatment, mechanisms other than the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of COX-2 inhibitors are also being explored. Taken together, imrecoxib is a moderate selective COX-2 inhibitor with some advantages, and there would be more clinical applications and research opportunities in the future. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable chronic progressive disease with a low survival rate and ineffective therapeutic options. We examined the effects of imrecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on experimental pulmonary fibrosis. The mouse IPF model was established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. From Day 0 to Day 13, the mice were orally administered imrecoxib (100 mg/kg) and pirfenidone (200 mg/kg) daily, and from Day 7 to Day 13, the mice were orally administered pirfenidone and imrecoxib daily. The tissues were dissected on the 14th day. Mouse body weight was measured, and histopathological examination and hydroxyproline content analysis confirmed that the administration of imrecoxib exerted a similar effect to pirfenidone. Compared with bleomycin-induced mice, imrecoxib-treated mice showed significantly reduced inflammatory factor expression (IL-1 and TNF-α) and inflammatory cell numbers (macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils) in BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Our experiment tested the ability of imrecoxib to inhibit the signal pathway involved in gene expression induced by TGF-β1 in the NIH-3T3 cell line in vitro. Western blotting showed that imrecoxib (20 μM and 40 μM) inhibited the expression of fibronectin, type I collagen and CTGF. In addition, imrecoxib reduced the levels of  To evaluate the effect of imrecoxib on CYP2C11 enzyme activity, mRNA, and protein expression, a UPLC method was established. Tolbutamide was selected as the CYP2C11 enzyme-specific probe drug and incubated with imrecoxib in rat liver microsomes. The yield of 4-hydroxytolbutamide was measured using UPLC to investigate the effect of imrecoxib on CYP2C11 enzyme activity. Imrecoxib (10 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically twice daily. After 1, 7, and 14 days of administration, the liver tissues were analyzed. The expression of CYP2C11 enzyme mRNA was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and its protein expression was determined using Western blot analysis.

It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure (postexposure prophylaxis (PEP)). It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, nausea, yellowish skin, abdominal pain, trouble sleeping, and fever. Severe side effects include rashes such as erythema multiforme and high blood sugar. Atazanavir appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. It is of the protease inhibitor (PI) class and works by blocking HIV protease. Atazanavir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Atazanavir is used in the treatment of HIV. The efficacy of atazanavir has been assessed in a number of well-designed trials in ART-naive and ART-experienced adults. Atazanavir is distinguished from other protease inhibitors in that it has lesser effects on lipid profile and appears to be less likely to cause lipodystrophy. There may be some cross-resistant with other protease inhibitors. When boosted with ritonavir it is equivalent in potency to lopinavir for use in salvage therapy in people with a degree of drug resistance, although boosting with ritonavir reduces the metabolic advantages of atazanavir. === Pregnancy === No evidence of harm has been found among pregnant women taking atazanavir. It is one of the preferred HIV medications to use in pregnant women who have not taken an HIV medication before. It was not associated with any birth defects among over 2,500 live births observed. Atazanavir resulted in a better cholesterol profile and confirmed that it is a safe option during pregnancy. == Contraindications == Atazanavir is contraindicated in those with previous hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions). Additionally, atazanavir should not be given with alfuzosin, rifampin, irinotecan, lurasidone, pimozide, triazolam, orally administered midazolam, ergot derivatives, cisapride, St. John's wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, indinavir, or nevirapine. Atazanavir inhibits the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, thereby impacting the hepatic glucuronidation and elimination of bilirubin. As such atazanavir may not be prescribed to patients with UGT1A1 deficiencies (e.g. those who suffer from Gilbert's syndrome or Crigler–Najjar syndrome) in order to avoid the possibility of jaundice. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include: nausea, jaundice, rash, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, insomnia, peripheral neurologic symptoms, dizziness, muscle pain, diarrhea, depression and fever. Bilirubin levels in the blood are normally asymptomatically raised with atazanavir, but can sometimes lead to jaundice. == Mechanism of action == Atazanavir binds to the active site HIV protease and prevents it from cleaving the pro-form of viral proteins into the working machinery of the virus. If the HIV protease enzyme does not work, the virus is not infectious, and no mature virions are made. The azapeptide drug was designed as an analog of the peptide chain substrate that HIV protease would cleave normally into active viral proteins. More specifically, atazanavir is a structural analog of the transition state during which the bond between a phenylalanine and proline is broken. Humans do not have any enzymes that break bonds between phenylalanine and proline, so this drug will not target human enzymes. == References ==",Reyataz,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.13382354559144e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005723983631469309)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/reyataz.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Reyataz: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/reyataz.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The ""block"" refers to a compound's ability to inhibit latent HIV-1 proviral transcription, while the ""lock"" refers to its capacity to induce permanent proviral silencing. We previously identified PF-3758309, a pan-isoform inhibitor of p21-activated kinases (PAKs), as a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 latency reversal. The goal of this study was to define the mechanism(s) involved. We found that both 24ST1NLESG cells (a cell line model of HIV-1 latency) and purified CD4+ naïve and central memory T cells express high levels of PAK2 and lower levels of PAK1 and PAK4. Knockdown of PAK1 or PAK2, but not PAK4, in 24ST1NLESG cells resulted in a modest, but statistically significant, decrease in the magnitude of HIV-1 latency reversal. Overexpression of PAK1 significantly increased the magnitude of latency reversal. A phospho-protein array analysis revealed that PF-3758309 down-regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which provides the most likely mechanism by which PF-3758309 inhibits latency reversal. Finally, we used cellular thermal shift assays combined with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to ascertain whether PF-3758309 off-target binding contributed to its activity. In 24ST1NLESG cells and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PF-3758309 bound to mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and protein kinase A; however, knockdown of either of these kinases did not impact HIV-1 latency reversal. Collectively, our study suggests that PAK1 and PAK2 play a key role in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains the most lethal malignancy due to lack of an effective treatment. P21-activated kinases (PAKs) play a key role not only in cell proliferation and migration, but also in mediating chemo-resistance in PDA. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effect of a PAK inhibitor PF-3758309 with multiple chemotherapeutic reagents on a panel of patient-derived PDA cell lines, and potential mechanisms involved. Cells were treated with PF-3758309 plus or minus gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or abraxane, and cell growth was determined using a cell proliferation assay kit. Protein expression profiles were measured by Western blot. PDA cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of SCID mice which were then treated with saline, gemcitabine, PF-3758309, gemcitabine plus PF-3758309 or abraxane. Tumour growth was measured by volume and weight. PAK1 was correlated with CK19 expression, and PAK4 with α-SMA and palladin expression. Combination of PF-3758309 with 5-FU, gemcitabine or abraxane further suppressed cell growth of patient-derived PDA cell lines  PAK inhibitor PF-3758309 can enhance anti-tumour effects of multiple chemotherapeutic reagents on a panel of patient-derived PDA cell lines. Combination of PF-3758309 with gemcitabine achieves comparable efficacy to combination of gemcitabine with abraxane, and thus provides a potential targeted therapy in the management of PDA. Migration and invasion comprise key steps in cancer metastasis. Through the migration and invasion into and out of lymphatic and/or blood vessels, cancer cells can be spread out into the tissues in remote site from the origin. Degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) must be preceded prior to the metastasis of cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) can degrade ECM, thus allow cells to migrate from the original site. Among MMPs, two gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 play particularly important roles in ECM degradation. Here, we report that recently developed p21-activated kinase 4 inhibitor PF-3758309 shows anti-metastatic effect in A549 human lung cancer cell. PF-3758309 suppresses CREB, NF-κB, and β-catenin pathways, which are well known to be closely related with cell migration. This leads to the downregulation of MMP-2/MMP-9 expressions and the inhibition of A549 lung cancer metastasis.",Pf 3758309,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.505351095460355e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.023456702008843422), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1602449268102646)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.0206720617134124e-05)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF-3758309?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='PF-3758309', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF-3758309?utm_source=openai')])"

1126,"('Threonine', '(2s,3r)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid', 'Threonin', '(s)-threonine', 'H-thr-oh')","Food, Medical","Threonine (symbol Thr or T) is an amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form when dissolved in water), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form when dissolved in water), and a side chain containing a hydroxyl group, making it a polar, uncharged amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Threonine is synthesized from aspartate in bacteria such as E. coli. It is encoded by all the codons starting AC (ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG). Threonine sidechains are often hydrogen bonded; the most common small motifs formed are based on interactions with serine: ST turns, ST motifs (often at the beginning of alpha helices) and ST staples (usually at the middle of alpha helices). == Modifications == The threonine residue is susceptible to numerous posttranslational modifications. The hydroxyl side-chain can undergo O-linked glycosylation. In addition, threonine residues undergo phosphorylation through the action of a threonine kinase. In its phosphorylated form, it can be referred to as phosphothreonine. Phosphothreonine has three potential coordination sites (carboxyl, amine and phosphate group) and determination of the mode of coordination between phosphorylated ligands and metal ions occurring in an organism is important to explain the function of the phosphothreonine in biological processes. == History == Threonine was the last of the 20 common proteinogenic amino acids to be discovered. It was discovered in 1935 by William Cumming Rose, collaborating with Curtis Meyer. The amino acid was named threonine because it was similar in structure to threonic acid, a four-carbon monosaccharide with molecular formula C4H8O5 == Stereoisomers == Threonine is one of two proteinogenic amino acids with two stereogenic centers, the other being isoleucine. Threonine can exist in four possible stereoisomers with the following configurations: (2S,3R), (2R,3S), (2S,3S) and (2R,3R). However, the name L-threonine is used for one single stereoisomer, (2S,3R)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid. The stereoisomer (2S,3S), which is rarely present in nature, is called L-allothreonine. == Biosynthesis == As an essential amino acid, threonine is not synthesized in humans, and needs to be present in proteins in the diet. Adult humans require about 20 mg/kg body weight/day. In plants and microorganisms, threonine is synthesized from aspartic acid via α-aspartyl-semialdehyde and homoserine. Homoserine undergoes O-phosphorylation; this phosphate ester undergoes hydrolysis concomitant with relocation of the OH group. Enzymes involved in a typical biosynthesis of threonine include: aspartokinase β-aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase homoserine dehydrogenase homoserine kinase threonine synthase. == Metabolism == Threonine is metabolized in at least three ways: In many animals it is converted to pyruvate via threonine dehydrogenase. An intermediate in this pathway can undergo thiolysis with CoA to produce acetyl-CoA and glycine. In humans the gene for threonine dehydrogenase is an inactive pseudogene, so threonine is converted to α-ketobutyrate. The mechanism of the first step is analogous to that catalyzed by serine dehydratase, and the serine and threonine dehydratase reactions are probably catalyzed by the same enzyme. In many organisms it is O-phosphorylated by a kinase preparatory to further metabolism. This is especially important in bacteria as part of the biosynthesis of cobalamin (Vitamin B12), as the product is converted to (R)-1-aminopropan-2-ol for incorporation into the vitamin's sidechain. Threonine is used to synthesize glycine during the endogenous production of L-carnitine in the brain and liver of rats. == Metabolic diseases == The degradation of threonine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia == Research of Threonine as a Dietary Supplement in Animals == Effects of threonine dietary supplementation have been researched in broilers. An essential amino acid, threonine is involved in the metabolism of fats, the creation of proteins, the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic stem cells, and the health and function of the intestines. Animal health and illness are strongly correlated with the need for and metabolism of threonine. Intestinal inflammation and energy metabolism disorders in animals may be alleviated by appropriate amounts of dietary threonine. Nevertheless, because these effects pertain to the control of nutrition metabolism, more research is required to confirm the results in various animal models. Furthermore, more research is needed to understand how threonine controls the dynamic equilibrium of the intestinal barrier function, immunological response and gut flora. == Sources == Foods high in threonine include cottage cheese, poultry, fish, meat, lentils, black turtle bean and sesame seeds.

1130,"('Dienogest', 'Dienogestrel', 'Dienogestril', 'Dienogestum', 'Dinagest')",Medical,"Dienogest, sold under the brand name Visanne among others, is a progestin medication which is used in birth control pills and in the treatment of endometriosis. It is also used in menopausal hormone therapy and to treat heavy periods. Dienogest is available both alone and in combination with estrogens. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of dienogest include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, depression, and acne, among others. Dienogest is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It is a unique progestogen, with strong effects in the uterus. The medication has some antiandrogenic activity, which may help to improve androgen-dependent symptoms like acne, and has no other important hormonal activity. Dienogest was discovered in 1979 and was introduced for medical use in 1995. Additional formulations of dienogest were approved between 2007 and 2010. It is sometimes referred to as a ""fourth-generation"" progestin. Dienogest is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Birth control === Dienogest is used primarily in birth control pills in combination with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Valette. It is also available in a quadriphasic birth control pill combined with estradiol valerate, marketed as Natazia in the United States and Qlaira in some European countries and Russia. === Endometriosis === Dienogest is approved as a standalone medication under the brand names Visanne and Dinagest in various places such as Europe, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia for the treatment of endometriosis. It has been found to be equally effective as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), such as leuprorelin, in the treatment of endometriosis. === Heavy periods === Birth control pills containing dienogest and estradiol valerate are approved in the United States for the treatment of menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding). === Menopausal symptoms === Dienogest is used in combination with estradiol valerate in the treatment of menopausal symptoms in certain countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. === Available forms === Dienogest is available both alone and in combination with estrogens. The following formulations are available: Dienogest 1 mg oral tablets (Dinagest) and 2 mg oral tablets (Valette) (not available in U.S.) – indicated for endometriosis Dienogest 2 mg and estradiol valerate 3 mg oral tablets (Natazia) (U.S.) – indicated for contraception and menorrhagia 2 dark yellow tablets each containing 3 mg estradiol valerate 5 medium red tablets each containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2 mg dienogest 17 light yellow tablets each containing 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest 2 dark red tablets each containing 1 mg estradiol valerate 2 white tablets (inert) Dienogest 2 to 3 mg and estradiol valerate 1 to 3 mg oral tablets (Qlaira) (not available in U.S.) – indicated for contraception Each dark yellow active tablet contains 3 mg estradiol valerate Each medium red active tablet contains 2 mg estradiol valerate and 2 mg dienogest Each light yellow active tablet contains 2 mg estradiol valerate and 3 mg dienogest Each dark red active tablet contains 1 mg estradiol valerate Dienogest 2 mg and ethinylestradiol 30 μg oral tablets (Valette) – indicated for contraception Dienogest 2 mg and estradiol valerate 1 or 2 mg oral tablets (various) – indicated for menopausal hormone therapy The availability of these formulations differs by country (see Availability). == Contraindications == Contraindications of dienogest include active venous thromboembolism, previous or current cardiovascular disease, diabetes with cardiovascular complications, previous or current severe liver disease or tumors, hormone-dependent cancers such as breast cancer, and undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. == Side effects == Side effects associated with dienogest are the same as those expected of a progestogen. They include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, depression, acne, weight gain, flatulence, and others. Dienogest produces no androgenic side effects and has little effect on metabolic and lipid hemostatic parameters. Birth control pills containing estradiol valerate/dienogest are associated with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism. However, they are associated with a significantly lower risk of venous thromboembolism than birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin. == Overdose == In safety studies, dienogest has been assessed in women with endometriosis at high doses of as much as 20 mg/day for up to 24 weeks and produced no clinically relevant effects on lipid metabolism, liver enzymes, the coagulatory system, or thyroid metabolism. == Interactions == Dienogest is metabolized mainly by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, and for this reason, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can alter the amount of exposure to dienogest when administered concomitantly with it. (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see here.) The strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin have been found to increase exposure to dienogest by up to 3-fold, whereas the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (rifampin) was found to decrease steady-state and area-under-curve concentrations of dienogest by 50% and 80%, respectively. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Dienogest has progestogenic activity, possibly some antiprogestogenic activity, and has antiandrogenic activity. The medication does not interact with the estrogen receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor, or the mineralocorticoid receptor, and hence has no estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. Because of its relatively high selectivity as a progestogen, dienogest may have favorable safety and tolerability compared to various other progestins. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== Dienogest is an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), and hence is a progestogen. It has relatively weak affinity for the PR in vitro in human uterine tissue, about 10% that of progesterone. Despite its low affinity for the PR however, dienogest has high progestogenic activity in vivo. In addition, although its metabolites, such as 9α,10β-dihydrodienogest and 3α,5α-tetrahydrodienogest, have greater affinity for the PR than does dienogest itself, the medication is not considered to be a prodrug. Dienogest has been described as ""special"" progestogen, possessing low or moderate antigonadotropic efficacy but strong or very strong endometrial efficacy. In relation to its endometrial activity, dienogest is said to be one of the strongest progestogens available. The high endometrial activity of dienogest underlies its ability to stabilize the menstrual cycle when combined with either ethinylestradiol or estradiol valerate (which has lower relative effects on the uterus compared to ethinylestradiol) in birth control pills, and also its use in the treatment of endometriosis. The combination of most other progestins with estradiol or an estradiol ester like estradiol valerate as birth control pills was unsatisfactory due to a high incidence of irregular menstrual bleeding. This is a property that ethinylestradiol does not share with estradiol, because of its resistance to metabolism in the endometrium and hence its greater relative effects in this part of the body. In contrast to other progestins, due to its high endometrial efficacy, the combination of dienogest with estradiol valerate in birth control pills is able to prevent breakthrough bleeding, and is uniquely able to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. The absence of withdrawal bleeding, otherwise known as ""silent menstruation"", also may occur. Dienogest has antiovulatory potency that is similar to that of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives like cyproterone acetate but endometrial potency that is much stronger and similar to that of gonane 19-nortestosterone progestins like levonorgestrel. Unlike other progestogens, except in the case of its strong effects in the uterus, dienogest has been described as lacking antiestrogenic effects, and does not antagonize beneficial effects of estradiol, for instance in the metabolic and vascular systems. Dienogest showed some possible antiprogestogenic activity in one animal bioassay when administered before but not at the same time as progesterone. The minimum effective dose of oral dienogest required to inhibit ovulation is 1 mg/day. The inhibition of ovulation by dienogest occurs mainly via a direct peripheral action in the ovary of inhibiting folliculogenesis as opposed to a central action of inhibiting gonadotropin secretion. Oral therapy with 2 mg/day dienogest in cyclical premenopausal women reduced serum progesterone levels to anovulatory levels, but circulating levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were not considerably affected. At this dosage, estradiol levels are reduced to early follicular phase levels of about 30 to 50 pg/mL. Such levels are insufficient for reactivation of endometrioses, but are sufficient to avoid menopausal-like symptoms such as hot flashes and bone loss. This is in contrast to gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues), which suppress estradiol levels to lower concentrations and readily induce menopausal-like symptoms. Dienogest appears to have similar effects in the breasts as norethisterone acetate, and may likewise increase the risk of breast cancer when combined with an estrogen in postmenopausal women, although this has yet to be confirmed in clinical studies. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Dienogest has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men by 43% at 2 mg/day, 70% at 5 mg/day, and 81% at 10 mg/day. The suppression of testosterone levels with 10 mg/day dienogest was comparable to that with 10 mg/day cyproterone acetate. In general, progestogens are able to suppress testosterone levels in men by a maximum of about 70 to 80% at sufficiently high doses. ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Dienogest is one of the only 19-nortestosterone derivative progestins that does not have androgenic properties. In fact, it is actually an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), and hence has antiandrogenic activity. The antiandrogenic activity of dienogest in the Hershberger test is about 30 to 40% of that of cyproterone acetate. It may be able to improve androgen-dependent symptoms such as acne and hirsutism. Metabolites of dienogest, such as 9α,10β-dihydrodienogest and 3α,5α-tetrahydrodienogest, show greater affinity for the AR than does dienogest itself. Dienogest has no affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and hence does not displace testosterone or estradiol from this plasma protein or increase the free fractions of these hormones. ==== Other activities ==== Dienogest does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4, unlike many other related progestins. Because of this, it may have a lower propensity for drug interactions. Dienogest weakly stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins are also active in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === Dienogest is rapidly absorbed with oral administration and has high bioavailability of approximately 90%. Peak levels of dienogest occur within approximately 2 hours after an oral dose. The pharmacokinetics of dienogest are linear; single oral doses of dienogest were found to result in maximal levels of 28 ng/mL with 1 mg, 54 ng/mL with 2 mg, 101 ng/mL with 4 mg, and 212 ng/mL with 8 mg. The corresponding area-under-the-curve levels were 306, 577, 1153, and 2293 ng/mL, respectively. Dienogest reaches steady-state concentrations within 6 days of continuous administration, and does not accumulate in the body. The plasma protein binding of dienogest is 90%, with a relatively high free fraction of 10%. It is exclusively bound to albumin, with no binding to SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin. The lack of affinity of dienogest for SHBG is in contrast to most other 19-nortestosterone progestins. The volume of distribution of dienogest is relatively low at 40 L. Dienogest is metabolized in the liver. Metabolic pathways of dienogest include reduction of its Δ4-3-keto group, hydroxylation mainly via CYP3A4, removal of its C17α cyanomethyl group, and conjugation. The metabolites of dienogest are quickly excreted and are said to be mostly inactive. The elimination half-life of dienogest is relatively short at approximately 7.5 to 10.7 hours. The short half-life of dienogest relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins is in part due to its lack of binding to SHBG and hence prolongation in the circulation. The clearance of dienogest is 3 L/h. It is eliminated mainly in the urine, both as sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and as free steroid. == Chemistry == Dienogest, also known as δ9-17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-cyanomethylestra-4,9-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is a member of the estrane subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins, but unlike most other 19-nortestosterone progestins, is not a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). This is because it uniquely possesses a cyanomethyl group (i.e., a nitrile group) at the C17α position rather than the usual ethynyl group. It is also unique among most 19-nortestosterone progestins in that it has a double bond between the C9 and C10 positions. Dienogest is the C17α cyanomethyl derivative of the anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS) dienolone, as well as the C17α cyanomethyl analogue of the AAS methyldienolone (17α-methyldienolone) and ethyldienolone (17α-ethyldienolone). In terms of structure–activity relationships, the C17α cyanomethyl group of dienogest is responsible for its unique antiandrogenic instead of androgenic activity relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins. A loss of ability to activate the AR is also seen with other testosterone derivatives with extended-length C17α substitutions such as topterone (propyltestosterone) (compare to the AAS ethyltestosterone and methyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (compare to the AAS ethylestrenol). Studies with steroids similar to dienogest (e.g., dienolone) have found that the introduction of a double bond between the C9 and C10 positions is associated with similar/almost unchanged affinity for the PR and AR. On the other hand, the C9(10) double bond of dienogest appears to inhibit metabolism via 5α-reductase and/or 5β-reductase, which is the major metabolic route for other 19-nortestosterone progestins like norethisterone, norgestrel, and etonogestrel, and this may serve to improve the metabolic stability and potency of dienogest. == History == Dienogest was synthesized in 1979 in Jena, Germany under the leadership of Kurt Ponsold, was initially referred to as STS-557. It was found that its potency was 10 times that of levonorgestrel. The first product on the market to contain dienogest was a combined birth control pill (with ethinylestradiol), Valette, introduced in 1995 and made by Jenapharm. In 2007, dienogest was introduced as Dinagest in Japan for the treatment of endometriosis, and it was subsequently marketed for this indication as Visanne in Europe and Australia in December 2009 and April 2010, respectively. Qlaira was introduced in Europe in 2009 and Natazia was introduced in the United States in 2010. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Dienogest is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while diénogest is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known by its synonyms dienogestril and cyanomethyldienolone as well as by its numerous former developmental code names including BAY 86-5258, M-18575, MJR-35, SH-660, SH-T00660AA, STS-557, and ZK-37659. === Brand names === Dienogest is marketed in combination with estradiol valerate as a birth control pill primarily under the brand names Natazia and Qlaira and in combination with ethinylestradiol as a birth control pill primarily under the brand name Valette, although these combinations are marketed under numerous other brand names as well. In the case of the dienogest and estradiol valerate birth control pill, these other brand names include Gianda and Klaira. Dienogest is also marketed in combination with estradiol valerate for use in menopausal hormone therapy under a variety of brand names including Climodien, Climodiène, Estradiol Valeraat / Dienogest, Klimodien, lafamme, Lafleur, Mevaren, Valerix, and Velbienne. Dienogest is marketed as a standalone medication for the treatment of endometriosis primarily under the brand name Visanne, but is also available under the brand names Alondra, Dinagest, Disven, Visabelle, and Visannette in various countries. === Availability === Dienogest is available both alone and in combination with ethinylestradiol and estradiol valerate widely throughout the world, including but not limited to Canada, Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. It is available specifically as a standalone medication in Canada, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Australia, South Africa, Georgia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand. It is notably not available as a standalone medication in the United States or the United Kingdom. == Research == Dienogest has been studied as a form of male hormonal contraception. As of July 2018, dienogest is in phase III clinical trials in Japan for the treatment of adenomyosis and dysmenorrhea. The combination of estradiol valerate and dienogest is in pre-registration in Europe for the treatment of acne. Dienogest is also being evaluated for the potential treatment of anorexia nervosa. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Dienogest"". Drug Information Portal.

1131,"('Ivermectin', 'Ivermectin b1a', 'Dihydroavermectin b1a', 'Avermectin h2b1a', 'Ivermectin component b1a')",Medical,"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug. After its discovery in 1975, its first uses were in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis. Approved for human use in 1987, it is used to treat infestations including head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis and lymphatic filariasis. It works through many mechanisms to kill the targeted parasites, and can be taken by mouth, or applied to the skin for external infestations. It belongs to the avermectin family of medications. William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura were awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its discovery and applications. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antiparasitic agent. In 2022, it was the 314th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 200,000 prescriptions. It is available as a generic medicine. Ivermectin is available in a fixed-dose combination with albendazole. Misinformation has been widely spread claiming that ivermectin is beneficial for treating and preventing COVID-19. Such claims are not backed by credible scientific evidence. Multiple major health organizations, including the US Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the European Medicines Agency, and the World Health Organization have advised that ivermectin is not recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. == Medical uses == Ivermectin is used to treat human diseases caused by roundworms and a wide variety of external parasites. === Worm infections === For river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis, ivermectin is typically given as part of mass drug administration campaigns that distribute the drug to all members of a community affected by the disease. Adult worms survive in the skin and eventually recover to produce larval worms again; to keep the worms at bay, ivermectin is given at least once per year for the 10–15-year lifespan of the adult worms. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers ivermectin the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. Ivermectin is also the primary treatment for Mansonella ozzardi and cutaneous larva migrans.: 294 : 299 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends ivermectin, albendazole, or mebendazole as treatments for ascariasis. Ivermectin is sometimes added to albendazole or mebendazole for whipworm treatment, and is considered a second-line treatment for gnathostomiasis.: 299 : 201 When co-administered, ivermectin and albendazole act in synergy. Ivermectin targets the parasite's nervous and muscular systems, causing paralysis, while albendazole disrupts the parasite's metabolism and energy production. This dual approach immobilizes and kills the parasite and improves the treatment's effectiveness. In January 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive scientific opinion for ivermectin/albendazole for the treatment of infections caused by several types of worm parasites including lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for use in people aged five years of age or older, for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminth infections, caused by different types of intestinal parasitic worms, which are spread through soil contaminated by human feces in areas with poor sanitation. Among the worms responsible for these diseases are hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus), roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms (Trichuris trichiura) and a roundworm called Strongyloides stercoralis. Ivermectin/albendazole is also indicated for the treatment of microfilaraemia (the presence of worm larvae in the blood) in people with lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease commonly known as elephantiasis, which impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for the treatment of cases of lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, a parasite which is responsible for 90% of cases worldwide. === Mites and insects === Ivermectin is also used to treat infection with parasitic arthropods. Scabies – infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei – is most commonly treated with topical permethrin or oral ivermectin. A single application of permethrin is more efficacious than a single treatment of ivermectin. For most scabies cases, ivermectin is used in a two-dose regimen: the first dose kills the active mites, but not their eggs. Over the next week, the eggs hatch, and a second dose kills the newly hatched mites. The two-dose regimen of ivermectin has similar efficacy to the single dose permethrin treatment. Ivermectin is, however, more effective than permethrin when used in the mass treatment of endemic scabies. For severe ""crusted scabies"", where the parasite burden is orders of magnitude higher than usual, the CDC recommends up to seven doses of ivermectin over the course of a month, along with a topical antiparasitic. Both head lice and pubic lice can be treated with oral ivermectin, an ivermectin lotion applied directly to the affected area, or various other insecticides. Ivermectin is also used to treat rosacea and blepharitis, both of which can be caused or exacerbated by Demodex folliculorum mites. == Contraindications == The only absolute contraindication to the use of ivermectin is hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any component of the formulation. In children under the age of five or those who weigh less than 15 kilograms (33 pounds), there is limited data regarding the efficacy or safety of ivermectin, though the available data demonstrate few adverse effects. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics cautions against use of ivermectin in such patients, as the blood–brain barrier is less developed, and thus there may be an increased risk of particular CNS side effects such as encephalopathy, ataxia, coma, or death. The American Academy of Family Physicians also recommends against use in these patients, given a lack of sufficient data to prove drug safety. Ivermectin is secreted in very low concentration in breast milk. It remains unclear if ivermectin is safe during pregnancy. == Adverse effects == Side effects, although uncommon, include fever, itching, and skin rash when taken by mouth; and red eyes, dry skin, and burning skin when used topically for head lice. It is unclear if the drug is safe for use during pregnancy, but it is probably acceptable for use during breastfeeding. Ivermectin is considered relatively free of toxicity in standard doses (around 300 μg/kg). Based on the data drug safety sheet for ivermectin, side effects are uncommon. However, serious adverse events following ivermectin treatment are more common in people with very high burdens of larval Loa loa worms in their blood. Those who have over 30,000 microfilaria per milliliter of blood risk inflammation and capillary blockage due to the rapid death of the microfilaria following ivermectin treatment. One concern is neurotoxicity after large overdoses, which in most mammalian species may manifest as central nervous system depression, ataxia, coma, and death, as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory chloride channels. Since drugs that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 often also inhibit P-glycoprotein transport, the risk of increased absorption past the blood-brain barrier exists when ivermectin is administered along with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. These drugs include statins, HIV protease inhibitors, many calcium channel blockers, lidocaine, benzodiazepines, and glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone. During a typical treatment course, ivermectin can cause minor aminotransferase elevations. In rare cases it can cause mild clinically apparent liver disease. To provide context for the dosing and toxicity ranges, the LD50 of ivermectin in mice is 25 mg/kg (oral), and 80 mg/kg in dogs, corresponding to an approximated human-equivalent dose LD50 range of 2.02–43.24 mg/kg, which is far more than its FDA-approved usage (a single dose of 0.150–0.200 mg/kg to be used for specific parasitic infections). While ivermectin has also been studied for use in COVID-19, and while it has some ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, achieving 50% inhibition in vitro was found to require an estimated oral dose of 7.0 mg/kg (or 35x the maximum FDA-approved dosage), high enough to be considered ivermectin poisoning. Despite insufficient data to show any safe and effective dosing regimen for ivermectin in COVID-19, doses have been taken far more than FDA-approved dosing, leading the CDC to issue a warning of overdose symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, decreased level of consciousness, confusion, blurred vision, visual hallucinations, loss of coordination and balance, seizures, coma, and death. The CDC advises against consuming doses intended for livestock or doses intended for external use and warns that increasing misuse of ivermectin-containing products is increasing harmful overdoses. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ivermectin and its related drugs act by interfering with the nerve and muscle functions of helminths and insects. The drug binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels common to invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. The binding pushes the channels open, which increases the flow of chloride ions and hyper-polarizes the cell membranes, paralyzing and killing the invertebrate. Ivermectin is safe for mammals (at the normal therapeutic doses used to cure parasite infections) because mammalian glutamate-gated chloride channels only occur in the brain and spinal cord: the causative avermectins usually do not cross the blood–brain barrier, and are unlikely to bind to other mammalian ligand-gated channels. === Pharmacokinetics === Ivermectin can be given by mouth, topically, or via injection. Oral doses are absorbed into systemic circulation; the alcoholic solution form is more orally available than tablet and capsule forms. Ivermectin is widely distributed in the body. Ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier of mammals due to the presence of P-glycoprotein (the MDR1 gene mutation affects the function of this protein). Crossing may still become significant if ivermectin is given at high doses, in which case brain levels peak 2–5 hours after administration. In contrast to mammals, ivermectin can cross the blood-brain barrier in tortoises, often with fatal consequences. Ivermectin is metabolized into eight different products by human CYP3A4, two of which (M1, M2) remain toxic to mosquitos. M1 and M2 also have longer elimination half-lives of about 55 hours. CYP3A5 produces a ninth metabolite. == Chemistry == Fermentation of Streptomyces avermitilis yields eight closely related avermectin homologues, of which B1a and B1b form the bulk of the products isolated. In a separate chemical step, the mixture is hydrogenated to give ivermectin, which is an approximately 80:20 mixture of the two 22,23-dihydroavermectin compounds. Ivermectin is a macrocyclical lactone. == History == The avermectin family of compounds was discovered by Satoshi Ōmura of Kitasato University and William Campbell of Merck. In 1970, Ōmura isolated a strain of Streptomyces avermitilis from woodland soil near a golf course along the southeast coast of Honshu, Japan. Ōmura sent the bacteria to William Campbell, who showed that the bacterial culture could cure mice infected with the roundworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Campbell isolated the active compounds from the bacterial culture, naming them ""avermectins"" and the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis for the compounds' ability to clear mice of worms (in Latin: a 'without', vermis 'worms'). Of the various avermectins, Campbell's group found the compound ""avermectin B1"" to be the most potent when taken orally. They synthesized modified forms of avermectin B1 to improve its pharmaceutical properties, eventually choosing a mixture of at least 80% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and up to 20% 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b, a combination they called ""ivermectin"". The discovery of ivermectin has been described as a combination of ""chance and choice."" Merck was looking for a broad-spectrum anthelmintic, which ivermectin is; however, Campbell noted that they ""...also found a broad-spectrum agent for the control of ectoparasitic insects and mites."" Merck began marketing ivermectin as a veterinary antiparasitic in 1981. By 1986, ivermectin was registered for use in 46 countries and was administered massively to cattle, sheep, and other animals. By the late 1980s, ivermectin was the bestselling veterinary medicine in the world. Following its blockbuster success as a veterinary antiparasitic, another Merck scientist, Mohamed Aziz, collaborated with the World Health Organization to test the safety and efficacy of ivermectin against onchocerciasis in humans. They found it to be highly safe and effective, triggering Merck to register ivermectin for human use as ""Mectizan"" in France in 1987. A year later, Merck CEO Roy Vagelos agreed that Merck would donate all ivermectin needed to eradicate river blindness. In 1998, that donation would be expanded to include ivermectin used to treat lymphatic filariasis. Ivermectin earned the title of ""wonder drug"" for the treatment of nematodes and arthropod parasites. Ivermectin has been used safely by hundreds of millions of people to treat river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Campbell and Ōmura for discovering ivermectin, ""the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases"". == Society and culture == === COVID-19 misinformation === === Economics === The initial price proposed by Merck in 1987 was US$6 per treatment, which was unaffordable for patients who most needed ivermectin. The company donated hundreds of millions of courses of treatments since 1988 in more than 30 countries. Between 1995 and 2010, using donated ivermectin to prevent river blindness, the program is estimated to have prevented seven million years of disability at a cost of US$257 million. Ivermectin is considered an inexpensive drug. As of 2019, ivermectin tablets (Stromectol) in the United States were the least expensive treatment option for lice in children at approximately US$9.30, while Sklice, an ivermectin lotion, cost around US$300 for 120 mL (4 US fl oz). As of 2019, the cost effectiveness of treating scabies and lice with ivermectin has not been studied. === Brand names === It is sold under the brand names Heartgard, Sklice, and Stromectol in the United States, Ivomec worldwide by Merial Animal Health, Mectizan in Canada by Merck, Iver-DT in Nepal by Alive Pharmaceutical and Ivexterm in Mexico by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. In Southeast Asian countries, it is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd. under the trade name Scabo 6. The formulation for rosacea treatment is sold under the brand name Soolantra. While in development, it was assigned the code MK-933 by Merck. == Research == === Parasitic disease === Ivermectin has been researched in laboratory animals, as a potential treatment for trichinosis and trypanosomiasis. Ivermectin has also been tested on zebrafish infected with Pseudocapillaria tomentosa. === Tropical diseases === Ivermectin is also of interest in the prevention of malaria, as it is toxic to both the malaria plasmodium itself and the mosquitos that carry it. A direct effect on malaria parasites could not be shown in an experimental infection of volunteers with Plasmodium falciparum. Use of ivermectin at higher doses necessary to control malaria is probably safe, though large clinical trials have not yet been done to definitively establish the efficacy or safety of ivermectin for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria. Mass drug administration of a population with ivermectin to treat and prevent nematode infestation is effective for eliminating malaria-bearing mosquitos and thereby potentially reducing infection with residual malaria parasites. Whilst effective in killing malaria-bearing mosquitos, a 2021 Cochrane review found that, to date, the evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin. One alternative to ivermectin is moxidectin, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in people with river blindness. Moxidectin has a longer half-life than ivermectin and may eventually supplant ivermectin as it is a more potent microfilaricide, but there is a need for additional clinical trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential. There is tentative evidence that ivermectin kills bedbugs, as part of integrated pest management for bedbug infestations. However, such use may require a prolonged course of treatment which is of unclear safety. === NAFLD === In 2013, ivermectin was demonstrated as a novel ligand of the farnesoid X receptor, a therapeutic target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). === COVID-19 === During the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin was researched for possible utility in preventing and treating COVID-19, but no good evidence of benefit was found. == Veterinary use == Ivermectin is routinely used to control parasitic worms in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals. These parasites normally enter the animal when it is grazing, pass the bowel, and set and mature in the intestines, after which they produce eggs that leave the animal via its droppings and can infest new pastures. Ivermectin is only effective in killing some of these parasites, because of an increase in anthelmintic resistance. This resistance has arisen from the persistent use of the same anthelmintic drugs for the past 40 years. Additionally, the use of Ivermectin for livestock has a profound impact on dung beetles, such as T. lusitanicus, as it can lead to acute toxicity within these insects. In dogs, ivermectin is routinely used as prophylaxis against heartworm. Dogs with defects in the P-glycoprotein gene (MDR1), often collie-like herding dogs, can be severely poisoned by ivermectin. The mnemonic ""white feet, don't treat"" refers to Scotch collies that are vulnerable to ivermectin. Some other dog breeds (especially the Rough Collie, the Smooth Collie, the Shetland Sheepdog, and the Australian Shepherd), also have a high incidence of mutation within the MDR1 gene (coding for P-glycoprotein) and are sensitive to the toxic effects of ivermectin. For dogs, the insecticide spinosad may have the effect of increasing the toxicity of ivermectin. A 0.01% ivermectin topical preparation for treating ear mites in cats is available. Clinical evidence suggests 7-week-old kittens are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity. Ivermectin is sometimes used as an acaricide in reptiles, both by injection and as a diluted spray. While this works well in some cases, care must be taken, as several species of reptiles are very sensitive to ivermectin. Use in turtles is particularly contraindicated. A characteristic of the antinematodal action of ivermectin is its potency: for instance, to combat Dirofilaria immitis in dogs, ivermectin is effective at 0.001 milligram per kilogram of body weight when administered orally. == Notes == == References == == External links == ""Ivermectin Topical"".

The most common side effects include diarrhea, rash, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, decreased appetite, paronychia, fatigue, dry skin, and musculoskeletal pain. Mobocertinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor structurally similar to osimertinib (differs only by the presence of an additional isopropyl ester group). Its molecular target is epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) bearing mutations in the exon 20 region. Mobocertinib is an irreversible kinase inhibitor, forming a covalent bond with the cysteine 797 in the EGFR active site, leading to sustained inhibition of EGFR enzymatic activity. The irreversible binding leads to increased potency via higher affinity binding, more sustained EGFR kinase activity inhibition, and greater overall selectivity, as only a limited number of other kinases possess a cysteine in the equivalent position. Mobocertinib was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2021. It is a first-in-class oral treatment to target EGFR Exon20 insertion mutations. == Medical uses == Mobocertinib is indicated for adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. == Mechanism of action == Mobocertinib acts to inhibit EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations at a lower concentration than it does on wild-type proteins. == Pharmacokinetics == The volume of distribution of Mobocertinib at steady state is 3,509 L. The mean oral bioavailability of Mobocertinib is 37%. The median Tmax is 4 hours. The average half-life of Mobocertinib and its metabolites is 18 hours. Mobocertinib is metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. == Warnings == Mobocertinib may increase the chance of QTC prolongation, specifically Torsades de Pointes which can be fatal. == Adverse Effects == More serious side effects of Mobocertinib may include agitation, bloating of the eyes, lips, feet, blurred vision, coma, decreased urine output, headache, hostility, diarrhea, depression, dizziness, fainting, lethargy, anxiety, nausea, seizures, weight gain, fatigue as well as edema. Other side effects which may be less frequent are: chills, cough, dilated neck veins, ill-feeling and trouble with breathing. Other notable side effects of taking Mobocertinib are: having an acidic stomach, heartburn, acidity, hair loss/thinning, bone pain, sore throat, stuffy nose, trouble swallowing, vomiting and weakness in hands and feet. == History == Mobocertinib was studied in participants with previously treated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertions.

Although CPT has excellent cytotoxicity, it has the disadvantage of instability under physiological conditions. Therefore, new types of TOP1 inhibitor have attracted particular attention. Here, we characterised the effect of a non-camptothecin inhibitor, Genz-644282 (Genz). First, we found that treatment with Genz showed cytotoxicity by introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs), which was suppressed by co-treatment with aphidicolin. Genz-induced DSB formation required the functions of TOP1. Next, we explored the advantages of Genz over CPT and found it was effective against CPT-resistant TOP1 carrying either N722S or N722A mutation. The effect of Genz was also confirmed at the cellular level using a CPT-resistant cell line carrying N722S mutation in the TOP1 gene. Moreover, we found arginine residue 364 plays a crucial role for the binding of Genz. Because tyrosine residue 723 is the active centre for DNA cleavage and re-ligation by TOP1, asparagine residue 722 plays crucial roles in the accessibility of the drug. Here, we discuss the mechanism of action of Genz on TOP1 inhibition. Genz-644282 [8,9-dimethoxy-5-(2-N-methylaminoethyl)-2,3-methylenedioxy-5H-dibenzo[c,h][1,6]naphthyridin-6-one] has emerged as a promising candidate for antitumor agents. This report describes the bone marrow colony-forming unit, granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and tumor cell CFU activity of topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors, such as Genz-644282, topotecan, irinotecan/SN-38, and ARC-111, and examines their activity in several human tumor xenograft models. Colony-forming assays were conducted with mouse and human bone marrow and eight human tumor cell lines. In addition, 29 human tumor cell lines representing a range of histology and potential resistance mechanisms were assayed for sensitivity to Genz-644282 in a 72-hour exposure assay. The efficacy of Genz-644282 was compared with standard anticancer drugs (i.e., irinotecan, docetaxel, and dacarbazine) in human tumor xenografts of colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and melanoma. Human bone marrow CFU-GM was more sensitive to the Top1 inhibitors than was mouse bone marrow CFU-GM. The ratio of mouse to human IC(90) values was more than 10 for the camptothecins and less than 10 for Genz-644282, which had more potency as a cytotoxic agent toward human tumor cells in culture than the camptothecins in the colony-forming and 72-hour proliferation assays. Genz-644282 has superior or equal antitumor activity in the human tumor xenografts than the standard drug comparators. On the basis of preclinical activity and safety, Genz-644282 was selected for development and is currently undergoing phase 1 clinical trial. Genz-644282 is a novel non-camptothecin topoisomerase I poison that is in clinical development. Genz-644282 was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel (0.1 nM to 1 µM), and in vivo using three times per week × 2 schedule repeated at day 21 at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 4 mg/kg. Subsequently Genz-644282 was tested at 4, 3, 2, and 1 mg/kg in 3 models to assess the dose-response relationship. mRNA gene signatures predictive for Genz-644282 response in vitro were applied to select 15 tumor models that were evaluated prospectively. In vitro, Genz-644282 demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity with a median IC(50) of 1.2 nM (range 0.2-21.9 nM). In vivo, Genz-644282 at its MTD (4 mg/kg) induced maintained complete responses (MCR) in 6/6 evaluable solid tumor models. At 2 mg/kg Genz-644282 induced CR or MCR in 3/3 tumor models relatively insensitive to topotecan, but there were no objective responses at 1 mg/kg. Further testing at 2 mg/kg showed that Genz-644282 induced objective regressions in 7 of 17 (41%) models. There was a significant correlation between predictive response scores based on Affymetrix U133Plus2 baseline tumor expression profiles and the observed in vivo responses to Genz-644282. Genz-644282 was highly active within a narrow dose range (2-4 mg/kg), typical of other topoisomerase I poisons.

1137,"('Sucralose', 'Trichlorosucrose', 'Splenda', 'Aspasvit', 'Acucar light')","Food, Medical","Splenda is a global brand of sugar substitutes and reduced-calorie food products. While the company is known for its original formulation containing sucralose, it also manufactures items using natural sweeteners such as stevia, monk fruit and allulose. It is owned by the American company Heartland Food Products Group. The high-intensity sweetener ingredient sucralose used in Splenda Original is manufactured by the British company Tate & Lyle. Sucralose was discovered by Tate & Lyle and researchers at Queen Elizabeth College, University of London, in 1976. While researching in new insecticides, Shashikant Phadnis at Queen Elizabeth College misheard the instruction of his advisor Leslie Hough to ""test"" the chemical as ""taste"", due to his misunderstanding of the foreign accent. So he accidentally tasted the chemical, and to his surprise, he found it to be extremely sweet. Tate & Lyle subsequently developed sucralose-based Splenda products in partnership with Johnson & Johnson subsidiary McNeil Nutritionals, LLC. The Splenda brand was transferred to Heartland Food Products Group after its purchase of the line with investor Centerbridge Partners in 2015. Since its approval by the United States government in 1998 and introduction there in 1999, sucralose has overtaken Equal in the $1.5-billion artificial sweetener market, holding a 62% market share. According to market research firm IRI, Splenda sales were $212 million in 2006 in the U.S. while Equal's totaled $48.7 million. According to a 2012 article in The New Zealand Herald it is ""the category leader in table-top sweetener in the US"". == Products == Splenda is available in a variety of products, including: Splenda Original Sweeteners (based on sucralose) Splenda Stevia Sweeteners Splenda Monk Fruit Sweeteners Splenda Allulose Sweeteners Splenda Liquid Sweeteners Splenda Coffee Creamers Splenda Diabetes Care Shakes Splenda Premium Sweet Teas == Energy (caloric) content == The energy content of a single-serving (1 g packet) of Splenda is 3.36 kcal, which is 31% of a single-serving (2.8 g packet) of granulated sugar (10.8 kcal). In the United States, it is legally labelled ""zero calories""; U.S. FDA regulations allow this ""if the food contains less than 5 Calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving"". Splenda powder consists of predominantly fillers as bulking agents – dextrose and maltodextrin. Sucralose content is about 1.1% and remainder is bulking agents. == Cooking == Unlike other artificial sweeteners, sucralose is heat stable up to 450 °F (232 °C), so Splenda can be used as a replacement for table sugar in cooking and baking, and there are Splenda products packaged specifically for this purpose. In product testing by Cook's Illustrated, the major drawback to cooking with Splenda was found to be that it does not produce the browning or caramelization the way table sugar does. However, Cook's Illustrated also found that desserts baked with Splenda were ""lacking the artificial flavors that just about every other sugar substitute brings with it"". == Health and safety regulation == Splenda usually contains 95% dextrose (D-glucose) and maltodextrin (by volume) which the body readily metabolizes, combined with a small amount of mostly indigestible sucralose. Sucralose is made by replacing three select hydrogen-oxygen groups on sucrose (table sugar) molecules with three chlorine atoms. The tightly bound chlorine atoms create a molecular structure that is stable under intense conditions. Sucralose itself is recognized as safe to ingest as a diabetic sugar substitute, but the sugars or other carbohydrates used as bulking agents in Splenda products should be evaluated individually. The recommended amount of sucralose that can be consumed on a daily basis over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 900 mg/kg BW/day, or about 60 g for a 70 kg (150 lb) person. A repeated dose study of sucralose in human subjects concluded that ""there is no indication that adverse effects on human health would occur from frequent or long-term exposure to sucralose at the maximum anticipated levels of intake"". Conversely, a Duke University animal study funded by the Sugar Association found evidence that doses of Splenda between 100 and 1000 mg/kg BW/day, containing sucralose at 1.1 to 11 mg/kg BW/day, fed to rats reduced fecal microflora, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and increased levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). These effects have not been reported in humans. In response, McNeil Nutritionals, along with an expert panel that included scientists from Duke University, Rutgers University, New York Medical College, Harvard School of Public Health, and Columbia University reported in Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology that the Duke study was ""not scientifically rigorous and is deficient in several critical areas that preclude reliable interpretation of the study results"". The other ingredients in Splenda—dextrose and maltodextrin—are listed as generally recognized as safe because of their long history of safe consumption. Sucralose may not be completely biologically inert, and a study showed that cooking with sucralose at high temperatures could cause it to degrade into potentially toxic compounds. However, only a very small amount (approximately 2–8% of sucralose consumed) is metabolized by the body, on average. == Marketing controversy == In 2006, Merisant, the maker of Equal, filed suit against McNeil Nutritionals in U.S. District Court, Philadelphia, alleging that Splenda's tagline; ""made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar"" is misleading. McNeil argued during the trial that it had never deceived consumers or set out to deceive them, since the product is in fact made from sugar. Merisant asked that McNeil be ordered to surrender profits and modify its advertising. The case ended with an agreement reached outside of court, with undisclosed settlement conditions. In 2004, Merisant filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau regarding McNeil's advertising. McNeil alleged that Merisant's complaint was in retaliation for a ruling in federal court in Puerto Rico, which forced Merisant to stop packaging Equal in packages resembling Splenda's. McNeil filed suit in Puerto Rico seeking a ruling which would declare its advertising to not be misleading. Following Merisant's lawsuit in Philadelphia, McNeil agreed to a jury trial and to the dismissal of its lawsuit in Puerto Rico. However, on May 11, 2007, the parties reached a settlement on the case, the terms of which were not disclosed. In 2007, Merisant France prevailed in the Commercial Court of Paris against subsidiaries of McNeil Nutritionals LLC. The court awarded Merisant $54,000 in damages and ordered the defendants to cease advertising claims found to violate French consumer protection laws, including the slogans; ""because it comes from sugar, sucralose tastes like sugar"" and ""With sucralose: comes from sugar and tastes like sugar"". A Sugar Association complaint to the Federal Trade Commission stated that ""Splenda is not a natural product. It is not cultivated or grown and it does not occur in nature."" McNeil Nutritionals, the manufacturer of Splenda, has responded that its ""advertising represents the products in an accurate and informative manner and complies with applicable advertising rules in the countries where Splenda brand products are marketed."" == References == == External links == Heartland official U.S. website for Splenda Heartland official U.K. website for Splenda Splenda Truth, rebuttal site run by Heartland, makers of Splenda",Splenda,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0005638765869662166), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0008915264043025672), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12697140872478485)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenda?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=6, title='Splenda', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenda?utm_source=openai')])"
1138,"('Œ≤-dpn', 'Œ≤-nad', 'Œ≤-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide', 'Nadide', 'Coenzyme i')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme central to metabolism. Found in all living cells, NAD is called a dinucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine nucleobase and the other, nicotinamide. NAD exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form, abbreviated as NAD+ and NADH (H for hydrogen), respectively. In cellular metabolism, NAD is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another, so it is found in two forms: NAD+ is an oxidizing agent, accepting electrons from other molecules and becoming reduced; with H+, this reaction forms NADH, which can be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. It is also used in other cellular processes, most notably as a substrate of enzymes in adding or removing chemical groups to or from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery. In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (de novo) from either tryptophan or aspartic acid, each a case of an amino acid. Alternatively, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from nutritive compounds such as nicotinic acid; similar compounds are produced by reactions that break down the structure of NAD, providing a salvage pathway that recycles them back into their respective active form. Some NAD is converted into the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), whose chemistry largely parallels that of NAD, though its predominant role is as a coenzyme in anabolic metabolism. In the name NAD+, the superscripted plus sign indicates the positive formal charge on one of its nitrogen atoms. A biological coenzyme that acts as an electron carrier in enzymatic reactions. NADP is a reducing agent in anabolic reactions like the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses. NADP exists in two forms: NADP+, the oxidized form, and NADPH, the reduced form. NADP is similar to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), but NADP has a phosphate group at the C-2′ position of the adenosyl. == Physical and chemical properties == Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consists of two nucleosides joined by pyrophosphate. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) (adenosine diphosphate ribose) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The compound accepts or donates the equivalent of H−. Such reactions (summarized in formula below) involve the removal of two hydrogen atoms from a reactant (R), in the form of a hydride ion (H−), and a proton (H+). The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH2 is oxidized and NAD+ reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring. RH2 + NAD+ → NADH + H+ + R; From the electron pair of the hydride ion, one electron is attracted to the slightly more electronegative atom of the nicotinamide ring of NAD+, becoming part of the nicotinamide moiety. The remaining hydrogen atom is transferred to the carbon atom opposite the N atom. The midpoint potential of the NAD+/NADH redox pair is −0.32 volts, which makes NADH a moderately strong reducing agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD+. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD+ and NADH forms without being consumed. In appearance, all forms of this coenzyme are white amorphous powders that are hygroscopic and highly water-soluble. The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD+ are colorless and stable for about a week at 4 °C and neutral pH, but decompose rapidly in acidic or alkaline solutions. Upon decomposition, they form products that are enzyme inhibitors. Both NAD+ and NADH strongly absorb ultraviolet light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD+ is at a wavelength of 259 nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900 M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339 nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220 M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays – by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer. NAD+ and NADH also differ in their fluorescence. Freely diffusing NADH in aqueous solution, when excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near-UV), fluoresces at 445–460 nm (violet to blue) with a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4 nanoseconds, while NAD+ does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these changes can be used to measure dissociation constants, which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics. These changes in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through fluorescence microscopy. NADH can be converted to NAD+ in a reaction catalysed by copper, which requires hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the supply of NAD+ in cells requires mitochondrial copper(II). == Concentration and state in cells == In rat liver, the total amount of NAD+ and NADH is approximately 1 μmole per gram of wet weight, about 10 times the concentration of NADP+ and NADPH in the same cells. The actual concentration of NAD+ in cell cytosol is harder to measure, with recent estimates in animal cells ranging around 0.3 mM, and approximately 1.0 to 2.0 mM in yeast. However, more than 80% of NADH fluorescence in mitochondria is from bound form, so the concentration in solution is much lower. NAD+ concentrations are highest in the mitochondria, constituting 40% to 70% of the total cellular NAD+. NAD+ in the cytosol is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific membrane transport protein, since the coenzyme cannot diffuse across membranes. The intracellular half-life of NAD+ was claimed to be between 1–2 hours by one review, whereas another review gave varying estimates based on compartment: intracellular 1–4 hours, cytoplasmic 2 hours, and mitochondrial 4–6 hours. The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD+/NADH ratio. This ratio is an important component of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD+/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio of free NAD+ to NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700:1; the ratio is thus favorable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD+/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP+/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH. == Biosynthesis == NAD+ is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a de novo pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD+. Although most tissues synthesize NAD+ by the salvage pathway in mammals, much more de novo synthesis occurs in the liver from tryptophan, and in the kidney and macrophages from nicotinic acid. === De novo production === Most organisms synthesize NAD+ from simple components. The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid – either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In a further step, some NAD+ is converted into NADP+ by NAD+ kinase, which phosphorylates NAD+. In most organisms, this enzyme uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the source of the phosphate group, although several bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor. === Salvage pathways === Despite the presence of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of vitamin B3 in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD+ results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD+ between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme. The major source of NAD+ in mammals is the salvage pathway which recycles the nicotinamide produced by enzymes utilizing NAD+. The first step, and the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway is nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which produces nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is the immediate precursor to NAD+ in the salvage pathway. Besides assembling NAD+ de novo from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B3 or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD+. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD+ in this organelle. There are some reports that mammalian cells can take up extracellular NAD+ from their surroundings, and both nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside can be absorbed from the gut. The salvage pathways used in microorganisms differ from those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast Candida glabrata and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae are NAD+ auxotrophs – they cannot synthesize NAD+ – but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD+ or its precursors. Even more surprising is the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, which lacks recognizable candidates for any genes involved in the biosynthesis or salvage of both NAD+ and NADP+, and must acquire these coenzymes from its host. == Functions == Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in metabolism. It acts as a coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases and a group of enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD+ to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles. === Oxidoreductase binding of NAD === The main role of NAD+ in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q. However, these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases, with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called NADH dehydrogenase or sometimes coenzyme Q reductase. There are many different superfamilies of enzymes that bind NAD+ / NADH. One of the most common superfamilies includes a structural motif known as the Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann, who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. An example of a NAD-binding bacterial enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism that does not have the Rossmann fold is found in Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (PDB: 2CWH​; InterPro: IPR003767). When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either ""above"" or ""below"" the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral, this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD+ by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH. Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD+ or NADP+. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP+. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP+ from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species. === Role in redox metabolism === The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD+ by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD+) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts. Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD+ and NADH, with the high NAD+/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP+/NADPH ratio is kept very low. Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release only a small amount of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH. === Non-redox roles === The coenzyme NAD+ is also consumed in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called ADP-ribosyltransferases add the ADP-ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a posttranslational modification called ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation involves either the addition of a single ADP-ribose moiety, in mono-ADP-ribosylation, or the transferral of ADP-ribose to proteins in long branched chains, which is called poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins, notably cholera toxin, but it is also involved in normal cell signaling. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is carried out by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. The poly(ADP-ribose) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus, in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In addition to these functions within the cell, a group of extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered, but their functions remain obscure. NAD+ may also be added onto cellular RNA as a 5'-terminal modification. Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD+ by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, as part of a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and inducing the activation of the transcription factor NAFC3 NAD+ is also consumed by different NAD+-consuming enzymes, such as CD38, CD157, PARPs and the NAD-dependent deacetylases (sirtuins,such as Sir2.). These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly seem to be involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging. Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends by using NAD+ as a substrate to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate. Li et al. have found that NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions. They also show that one of the causes of age-related decline in DNA repair may be increased binding of the protein DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1) to PARP1 (poly[ADP–ribose] polymerase 1) as NAD+ levels decline during aging. The decline in cellular concentrations of NAD+ during aging likely contributes to the aging process and to the pathogenesis of the chronic diseases of aging. Thus, the modulation of NAD+ may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging. === Extracellular actions of NAD+ === In recent years, NAD+ has also been recognized as an extracellular signaling molecule involved in cell-to-cell communication. NAD+ is released from neurons in blood vessels, urinary bladder, large intestine, from neurosecretory cells, and from brain synaptosomes, and is proposed to be a novel neurotransmitter that transmits information from nerves to effector cells in smooth muscle organs. In plants, the extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide induces resistance to pathogen infection and the first extracellular NAD receptor has been identified. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of its extracellular actions and their importance for human health and life processes in other organisms. == Clinical significance == The enzymes that make and use NAD+ and NADH are important in both pharmacology and the research into future treatments for disease. Drug design and drug development exploits NAD+ in three ways: as a direct target of drugs, by designing enzyme inhibitors or activators based on its structure that change the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes, and by trying to inhibit NAD+ biosynthesis. Because cancer cells utilize increased glycolysis, and because NAD enhances glycolysis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAD salvage pathway) is often amplified in cancer cells. It has been studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease as well as multiple sclerosis. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of NADH (which excluded NADH precursors) in people with Parkinson's failed to show any effect. NAD+ is also a direct target of the drug isoniazid, which is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. Since many oxidoreductases use NAD+ and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved structural motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD+ could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD+ binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD+ metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan in some animal models. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication. Because of the differences in the metabolic pathways of NAD+ biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria. In bacteriology, NAD, sometimes referred to factor V, is used as a supplement to culture media for some fastidious bacteria. High-cost unlicensed infusions of NAD+ have been claimed in the UK to be ""clinically proven"" and ""effective"" treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse. NAD+ is not approved or licensed for medical use in the UK; there are likely breaches of advertising and medicines rules, and no proof that treatments work. Medical experts say ""It's complete nonsense"" ... ""It's untested and unproven. We don't know anything about its efficacy or long-term safety"". A November 2024 study, cited 700 times, claiming that NAD+ levels in lab rats decreased with age was withdrawn after images were found to have been manipulated, and underlying data was not provided to the publishers on request. == History == The coenzyme NAD+ was first discovered by the British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions. Vitamin precursors of NAD+ were first identified in 1938, when Conrad Elvehjem showed that liver has an ""anti-black tongue"" activity in the form of nicotinamide. Then, in 1939, he provided the first strong evidence that nicotinic acid is used to synthesize NAD+. In the early 1940s, Arthur Kornberg was the first to detect an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. In 1949, the American biochemists Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. In 1958, Jack Preiss and Philip Handler discovered the intermediates and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD+; salvage synthesis from nicotinic acid is termed the Preiss-Handler pathway. In 2004, Charles Brenner and co-workers uncovered the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway to NAD+. The non-redox roles of NAD(P) were discovered later. The first to be identified was the use of NAD+ as the ADP-ribose donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the activities of NAD+ and NADP+ metabolites in cell signaling – such as the action of cyclic ADP-ribose, which was discovered in 1987. The metabolism of NAD+ remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest heightened after the discovery of the NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000, by Shin-ichiro Imai and coworkers in the laboratory of Leonard P. Guarente. In 2009 Imai proposed the ""NAD World"" hypothesis that key regulators of aging and longevity in mammals are sirtuin 1 and the primary NAD+ synthesizing enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). In 2016 Imai expanded his hypothesis to ""NAD World 2.0"", which postulates that extracellular NAMPT from adipose tissue maintains NAD+ in the hypothalamus (the control center) in conjunction with myokines from skeletal muscle cells. In 2018, Napa Therapeutics was formed to develop drugs against a novel aging-related target based on the research in NAD metabolism conducted in the lab of Eric Verdin. == See also == Enzyme catalysis List of oxidoreductases == References == == Further reading == === Function === Nelson DL; Cox MM (2004).

1139,"('Telaprevir', 'Incivek', 'Telaprevir (vx-950)', 'Incivo', 'Vx 950')",Medical,"Telaprevir (VX-950), marketed under the brand names Incivek and Incivo, is a pharmaceutical drug for the treatment of hepatitis C co-developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Johnson & Johnson. It is a member of a class of antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors. Specifically, telaprevir inhibits the hepatitis C viral enzyme NS3/4A serine protease. Telaprevir is only indicated for use against hepatitis C genotype 1 viral infections and has not been proven to be safe or effective when used for other genotypes of the virus. The standard therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is less effective than telaprevir in those with genotype 1. == Clinical trials and approvals == In a randomized controlled trial (PROVE3) of patients in whom standard treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin had failed, repeat treatment with the addition of telaprevir was more likely to have a sustained virological response (SVR) than repeat treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. In patients who received peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for a year, the addition of telaprevir for 24 weeks achieved an SVR of 53% compared to 14% in patients who did not receive telaprevir. In that study, shorted treatment with only three months of telaprevir and six months of treatment peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin achieved an SVR of 51%. In a second randomized controlled trial (REALIZE) of patients who had previously relapsed or had only a partial response, rates of SVR were higher in patients treated with telaprevir (83% to 88%) compared to 24% in controls. In a third trial (ADVANCE) for previously untreated patients, patients taking telaprevir had a SVR (69% to 75%) versus 44% in the control group. On April 28, 2011, the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee voted 18–0 to recommend approval telaprevir for people with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. The committee reviewed clinical trial data (including findings from the phase-III ADVANCE, ILLUMINATE, and REALIZE studies) showing that combining telaprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin produced a higher cure rate—and in less time—than standard therapy alone. This improvement is most notable for hard-to-treat patients including those with HCV genotype 1, people with liver cirrhosis, and those who did not respond to a prior course of interferon-based therapy. Merck's boceprevir, also a new antihepatitis C drug, was given a positive recommendation by the same committee, on the previous day. Telaprevir was fully approved for use in the United States in May 2011. The hypothesis that host genetics play an essential role in the ability not only to clear acute hepatitis C infection, but also to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) to interferon-based therapy has been proved with the recent discovery of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 19. Variants in the minor allele rs8099917 and the proximate polymorphism rs12979860, 3 kb upstream of the interleukin (IL)-28B gene, which encodes the endogenous antiviral cytokine IFN-λ, are associated with SVR and with natural viral clearance. The disparate frequencies of these alleles in ethnic groups worldwide may well explain differing rates of SVR among them. The test for one of these polymorphisms is now commercially available and can serve as a powerful predictor of a patient's chance of achieving SVR. Perhaps more importantly, the test can help the clinician personally tailor the duration and even the type of therapy most appropriate for an individual patient, newly or chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect is rash. Grade 3 adverse events (mainly anemia and leukopenia/neutropenia) were more frequent in the telaprevir groups than in the control group (37% vs. 22%). After receiving reports of serious skin reactions, some fatal, in patients taking the hepatitis C drug Incivek (telaprevir) in combination with drugs peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (Incivek combination treatment), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added a black box warning to the label of this Vertex product. On December 19, 2012, Vertex announced it would add a boxed warning of possible side effects on the US labels of telaprevir, following ""reports of a small number of fatal skin reactions in patients who continued to receive Incivek combination therapy after a serious skin reaction was identified.” The FDA reported two people had died from serious skin reactions caused by the Incivek combination treatment and a total of 112 patients had developed serious skin reactions of two different types. == Availability == The cost of telaprevir-based triple therapy for hepatitis C is $189,000 per sustained viral response. On August 12, 2014, Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced that it would discontinue production of its brand of telaprevir, Incivek, due to falling demand for the drug caused by competition from newer hepatitis C treatments. == Research == Studies in mice have indicated that telaprevir may also show activity against enterovirus D68, which has been implicated as a causative agent for acute flaccid myelitis. Since telaprevir is already approved for use in humans in the treatment of hepatitis C, it is now being researched to see whether it could be useful for the treatment of AFM in humans. == References ==",Incivo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.645074735279195e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003400462737772614)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmatimes.com](https://pharmatimes.com/news/j_and_jvertex_hep_c_treatment_incivo_gets_eu_approval_980365/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=138, start_index=9, title=""J&J/Vertex' hep C treatment Incivo gets EU approval - PharmaTimes"", type='url_citation', url='https://pharmatimes.com/news/j_and_jvertex_hep_c_treatment_incivo_gets_eu_approval_980365/?utm_source=openai')])"
1140,"('Ancitabine (hydrochloride)', 'Cyclocytidine hydrochloride', 'Cyclo-cmp hydrochloride', 'Cyclo-c', 'Cyclocytidine')",Medical," Cyclocytidine hydrochloride (HCl) has been reported to inhibit DNA synthesis by affecting DNA polymerase. Here, we tested the antiviral effect of cyclocytidine on hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA synthesis, which is reliant on DNA polymerase activity. Cyclocytidine HCl was treated to HBV-producing HepAD38 cells or added to an endogenous polymerase reaction, and HBV DNA was detected by Southern blot. Treatment of 20 µM cyclocytidine HCl significantly decreased the production of relaxed circular (rc) DNA in HepAD38 cells and block rcDNA synthesis in endogenous polymerase reaction (EPR), a cell free assay, possibly by inhibiting the HBV DNA polymerase activity. Cyclocytidine HCl could inhibit the synthesis of HBV rcDNA, the precursor of covalently closed circular DNA, and this result provides a case for the usage of ""old"" drugs for ""new"" applications. Since cyclocytidine (2,2'-anhydro-1-beta-arabinofuranosylcytosine hydrochloride) was introduced as an antineoplastic agent for the treatment of lymphatic leukemia, sinus acceleration and an increase in systemic blood pressure has been reported as its systemic effects in the clinical cases. These cardiovascular effects of cyclocytidine were observed also in anesthetized dogs, but not in reserpine-pretreated animals. Increases in heart rate and in systemic blood pressure were prevented by propranolol and phentolamine, respectively. The mechanism of these sympathomimetic effects was further analysed in the excised, blood-perfused canine sinoatrial node and papillary muscle preparations with a support dog. Positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to cyclocytidine were abolished by desipramine, propanolol, and pretreatment with reserpine but not by tetrodotoxin and hexamethonium. The tyramine-like actions of cyclocytidine at adrenergic neuronal terminals were discussed in conjunction with the uptake mechanism of the drug into the tumor cells. The nitrogen-bridged compound 2,2'-anhydro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2,4-diamino-5-fluoropyrimidinium chloride (2), an analogue of the antitumor agent anhydro-ara-FC (1), has been synthesized. 5-Fluorocytidine was converted into 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2,4-diamino-5-fluoropyrimidinium chloride (4), but cyclization of 4 was not achieved due to a competing side reaction. The nitrogen bridge was therefore introduced by cyclization of 5-fluoroisocytidine (10) to give the 2,2'-imino-bridged compound 16.

1141,"('Aristolochic acid a', 'Aristolochic acid i', 'Tr 1736', 'Aristolochic acid', 'Aristolochin')",Medical,"Aristolochic acids (English: ) are a family of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and nephrotoxic phytochemicals commonly found in the flowering plant family Aristolochiaceae (birthworts). Aristolochic acid (AA) I is the most abundant one. The family Aristolochiaceae includes the genera Aristolochia and Asarum (wild ginger), which are commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine. Although these compounds are widely associated with kidney problems, liver and urothelial cancers, the use of AA-containing plants for medicinal purposes has a long history. The FDA has issued warnings regarding consumption of AA-containing supplements. == History == === Early medical uses === Birthwort plants, and the aristolochic acids they contain, were quite common in ancient Greek and Roman medical texts, well-established as an herb there by the fifth century BC. Birthworts appeared in Ayurvedic texts by 400 AD, and in Chinese texts later in the fifth century. In these ancient times, it was used to treat kidney and urinary problems, as well as gout, snakebites, and a variety of other ailments. It was also considered to be an effective contraceptive. In many of these cases, birthworts were just some of the many ingredients used to create ointments or salves. In the early first century, in Roman texts, Aristolochia is first mentioned as a component of frequently ingested medicines to treat things such as asthma, hiccups, spasms, pains, and expulsion of afterbirth. === Discovery of toxicity === ==== Kidney damage ==== Aristolochic acid poisoning was first diagnosed at a clinic in Brussels, Belgium, when cases of nephritis leading to rapid kidney failure were seen in a group of women who had all taken the same weight-loss supplement, Aristolochia fangchi, which contained aristolochic acid. This nephritis was termed “Chinese herbs nephropathy” (CHN) due to the origin of the weight-loss supplement. A similar condition previously known as Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), first characterized in the 1950s in southeastern Europe, was later discovered to be also the result of aristolochic acid (AA) consumption. BEN is more slowly progressive than the nephritis that is seen in CHN, but is likely caused by low-level AA exposure, possibly from contamination of wheat flour seeds by a plant of the birthwort family, Aristolochia clematitis. CHN and BEN fall under the umbrella of what is now known as aristolochic acid nephropathy, the prevalent symptom of AA poisoning. ==== Liver cancer ==== A study reported in the Science Translational Medicine journal in October 2017 reported high incidents of liver cancer in Asia, particularly Taiwan, which bore the ""well-defined mutational signature"" of aristolochic acids. The same link was found in Vietnam and other South-east Asian countries. This was compared with much lower rates found in Europe and North America. == Biosynthesis == The herbal drug known as aristolochic acid contains a mixture of numerous structurally related nitrophenanthrene carboxylic acids generally consisting of two major compounds: aristolochic acid I (AA-I) and aristolochic acid II (AA-II). The biosynthesis of these compounds has been of considerable interest due in large part to the inclusion of both an aryl carboxylic acid and an aryl nitro functionality (uncommon in natural products) within their structures, which suggested an apparent biogenetic relationship to the well-known aporphine alkaloids. Furthermore, this association thereby suggested a biosynthetic relationship with norlaudanosoline (tetrahydropapaveroline) or related benzylisoquinoline precursors, which in turn are derived from tyrosine (2). Feeding studies (Aristolochia sipho) independently using uniquely 14C-labeled compounds [3-14C]-tyrosine, [2-14C]-dopamine and [2-14C]-dihydroxyphenylalanine resulted in the isolation of [14C]-AA-I in each case, which illustrated that the aporphine alkaloid stephanine (11) could be a precursor of AA-I since tyrosine, L-DOPA (3) and dopamine (4) were known precursors of norlaudanosoline: tyrosine (2) is metabolized to L-DOPA (3) which is converted into dopamine (4) which is metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL); cyclization of these two compounds results in the formation of norlaudanosoline via a Pictet-Spengler like condensation catalyzed by norlaudanosoline synthetase. Subsequent feeding studies that used (±)‑[4‑14C]-norlaudanosoline also resulted in the formation of 14C‑labeled-AAI, further suggesting that norlaudanosoline and stephanine (11) could have a possible intermediacy in the biosynthesis of AA-I. Degradation studies of the isolated 14C-labeled AA-I demonstrated that the carbon atom at ring position C4 of the benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline norlaudanosoline was incorporated exclusively in the carboxylic acid moiety of AAI. When this study was repeated but using [4‑14C]-tetrahydropapaverine no labeled AAI was isolated; this observation established that a phenol oxidative reaction was required for the biosynthesis of AA-I from norlaudanosoline, further supporting the intermediacy of aporphine intermediates. The results of a feeding experiment (A. sipho) with (±)‑[3‑14C, 15N]-tyrosine followed by degradation of the isolated doubly labeled AA-I provided evidence that the nitro group of AA-I originates from the amino group of tyrosine. Confirmation of the involvement of aporphine intermediates in the biogenetic route from norlaudanosoline to AA-I was obtained some two decades later through a series of feeding studies (Aristolochia bracteata) using several labeled hypothetical benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline and aporphine precursors. Feeding experiments with (±)‑[5’,8‑3H2; 6-methoxy‑14C]-nororientaline resulted in the isolation of the doubly labeled AA-I. Cleavage of the methylenedioxy group with trapping of the resulting 14C‑labeled formaldehyde confirmed that this functionality was formed from the o‑methoxyphenol segment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring of nororientaline. (±)‑[5’,8‑3H2]‑Orientaline was also incorporated into AA-I. These observations implied that the aporphine prestephanine (10) would be an obligatory intermediate in the biosynthesis, which would involve the intermediacy of the proaporphines orientalinone (8) and orientalinol (9) via the known intramolecular dienone-dienol-phenol sequence for the transformation of benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines to aporphines. A potential role for CYP80G2, a cytochrome P450 that has been demonstrated to catalyze the intramolecular C-C phenol coupling of several benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines, in this orientaline (7) to prestephanine (10) transformation has been suggested. (±)‑[aryl‑3H]‑Prestephanine was incorporated into AA-I confirming its intermediacy in the biosynthesis; and also (±)‑[aryl‑3H]‑stephanine was incorporated into AA-I. This final transformation, that is stephanine (11) to AA-I (12), involves an uncommon oxidative cleavage of the B ring of the aporphine structure to give a nitro substituted phenanthrene carboxylic acid. Hence, taken together these experiments support the sequence outlined for the biosynthesis of aristolochic acid I from norlaudanosoline. == Symptoms and diagnosis == Exposure to aristolochic acid is associated with a high incidence of uroepithelial tumorigenesis, and is linked to urothelial cancer. Since aristolochic acid is a mutagen, it does damage over time. Patients are often first diagnosed with aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), which is a rapidly progressive nephropathy and puts them at risk for renal failure and urothelial cancer. However, urothelial cancer is only observed long after consumption. One study estimated, on average, detectable cancer develops ten years from the start of daily aristolochic acid consumption. A patient thought to have AAN can be confirmed through phytochemical analysis of plant products consumed and detection of aristolactam DNA adducts in the renal cells. (Aristolochic acid is metabolised into aristolactam.) Additionally, mutated proteins in renal cancers as a result of transversion of A:T pairings to T:A are characteristically seen in aristolochic acid-induced mutations. In some cases, early detection resulting in cessation of aristolochia-product consumption can lead to reverse of the kidney damage. == Pharmacology == === Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion === Once orally ingested, aristolochic acid I is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract into the blood stream. It is distributed throughout the body via the blood stream. Aristolochic acids are metabolized by oxidation and reduction pathways, or phase I metabolism. Reduction of aristolochic acid I produces aristolactam I which has been observed in the urine. Further processing of aristolactam I by O-demethylation results in aristolactam Ia, the primary metabolite. Additionally, nitroreduction results in an N-acylnitrenium ion, which can form DNA-base adducts, thus giving aristolochic acid I its mutagenic properties. Aristolactam I adducts that are bound to DNA are extremely stable; they have been detected in patient biopsy samples taken 20 years after exposure to plants containing aristolochic acid. Excretion of aristolochic acids and their metabolites is through the urine. === Mechanism of action === The exact mechanism of action of aristolochic acid is not known, especially in regards to nephropathy. The carcinogenic effects of aristolochic acids are thought to be a result of mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53, which seems to be unique to aristolochic acid-associated carcinogenesis. Nephropathy caused by aristolochic acid consumption is not mechanistically understood, but DNA adducts characteristic of aristolochic acid-induced mutations are found in the kidneys of AAN patients, indicating these might play a role. == Regulation == In April 2001, the Food and Drug Administration issued a consumer health alert warning against consuming botanical products, sold as ""traditional medicines"" or as ingredients in dietary supplements, containing aristolochic acid. The agency warned that consumption of aristolochic acid-containing products was associated with ""permanent kidney damage, sometimes resulting in kidney failure that has required kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation. In addition, some patients have developed certain types of cancers, most often occurring in the urinary tract."" In August 2013, two studies identified an aristolochic acid mutational signature in upper urinary tract cancer patients from Taiwan. The carcinogenic effect is the most potent found thus far, exceeding the amount of mutations in smoking-induced lung cancer and UV-exposed melanoma. Exposure to aristolochic acid may also cause certain types of liver cancer. == See also == List of herbs with known adverse effects Piperolactam A Stephania tetrandra == References == == Further reading == Aronson, J.K.

1143,"('Imipramine (hydrochloride)', 'Imipramine', 'Melipramine', 'Antideprin', 'Berkomine')",Medical,"Imipramine, sold under the brand name Tofranil, among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) mainly used in the treatment of depression. It is also effective in treating anxiety and panic disorder. Imipramine is taken by mouth. Common side effects of imipramine include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, urinary retention, and electrocardiogram changes. Overdose of the medication can result in death. Imipramine appears to work by increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine and by blocking certain serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and cholinergic receptors. Imipramine was discovered in 1951 and was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was the first TCA to be marketed. Imipramine and TCAs other than amitriptyline (which, at least in the U.K., is prescribed comparatively as frequently as SSRIs) have decreased in prescription frequency with the rise of SSRIs—which have fewer inherent side effects and are far safer in overdose. Regardless of its caveats, imipramine retains importance in psychopharmacology and pediatrics (e.g., with childhood enuresis). == Medical uses == Imipramine is primarily used for the treatment of depression and certain anxiety disorders, including acute post-traumatic stress reactions. A significant amount of research regarding its efficacy on acute post-traumatic stress in children and adolescents has focused on trauma resulting from burn-injuries. Although evidence for its efficacy in the treatment of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder appears to be less robust, it remains a viable treatment. Here, it may act fairly similarly to monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine. Caution is needed in prescribing imipramine (and its commercially-available metabolite, desipramine) in children and youth/adolescents (whether they suffer with, e.g., bed-wetting, recurrent panic attacks, acute trauma or, in the case of desipramine, ADHD), owing to possibility of certain side-effects which may be of particular concern in those under a certain age. In the treatment of depression, it has demonstrated similar efficacy to the MAOI moclobemide. It has also been used to treat nocturnal enuresis because of its ability to shorten the time of delta wave stage sleep, where wetting occurs. In veterinary medicine, imipramine is used with xylazine to induce pharmacologic ejaculation in stallions. It is also used for separation anxiety in dogs and cats. Blood levels between 150 and 250 ng/mL of imipramine plus its metabolite desipramine generally correspond to antidepressant efficacy. == Contraindications == Combining it with alcohol consumption may cause more drowsiness, necessitating greater caution when drinking. It may be unsafe during pregnancy. Many MAOIs are known to have serious interactions with imipramine. It is often contraindicated during their use or in the two weeks following their discontinuation. This category includes medications such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue, phenelzine, selegiline, moclobemide, procarbazine, rasagiline, safinamide, and tranylcypromine. == Side effects == These side effects can be contributed to the multiple receptors that imipramine targets such as serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, epinephrine, histamine. Those listed in italics below denote common side effects, separated by the organ systems that are affected. Some side effects may be beneficial in some cases, e.g. reduction of hyperactive gag reflex; reduced random or physical strain-linked urinary leakage. Central nervous system: dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, seizures, headache, anxiety, tremors, stimulation, weakness, insomnia, nightmares, extrapyramidal symptoms in geriatric patients, increased psychiatric symptoms, paresthesia Cardiovascular: orthostatic hypotension, ECG changes, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, dysrhythmias Eyes, ears, nose and throat: blurred vision, tinnitus, mydriasis Gastrointestinal: dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, increased appetite, cramps, epigastric distress, jaundice, hepatitis, stomatitis, constipation, taste change Genitourinary: urinary retention Hematological: agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, leukopenia Skin: rash, urticaria, diaphoresis, pruritus, photosensitivity == Overdose == == Interactions == Like other tricyclic antidepressants, imipramine has many medication interactions. Many MAOIs have serious interactions with this medication. Other categories of medications that may interact with imipramine include blood thinners, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, sleeping pills, thyroid medications, and tranquilizers. Some medications used for various conditions such as high blood pressure, mental illness, nausea, Parkinson's disease, asthma, colds, or allergies. Certain medications increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), St. John's Wort, and drugs such as ecstasy. Other prescription drugs decrease the body's ability to eliminate imipramine. These include barbiturates, some antiarrhythmic medications, some antiepileptic drugs, and certain HIV drugs (protease inhibitors). Others may cause changes in the heart rhythm, such as QT prolongation. Alcohol and tobacco may interact with imipramine. Tobacco may decrease the medication's effectiveness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Imipramine affects numerous neurotransmitter systems known to be involved in the etiology of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enuresis and numerous other mental and physical conditions. Imipramine is similar in structure to some muscle relaxants, and has a significant analgesic effect and, thus, is very useful in some pain conditions. The mechanisms of imipramine's actions include, but are not limited to, effects on: Serotonin: very strong reuptake inhibition. Imipramine is a tertiary TCA, and is a potent inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, and to a greater extent than secondary amine TCAs such as nortriptyline and despiramine. Norepinephrine: strong reuptake inhibition. Desipramine has more affinity to norepinephrine transporter than imipramine. Dopamine: imipramine blocks D2 receptors. Imipramine, and its metabolite desipramine, have no appreciable affinity for the dopamine transporter (Ki = 8,500 and >10,000 nM, respectively). Acetylcholine: imipramine is, to a certain extent, an antimuscarinic, specifically a relative antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The attendant side-effects (e.g., blurry vision, dry mouth, constipation), however, are somewhat less common with imipramine than amitriptyline and protriptyline, which tend to cause antimuscarinic side-effects more often. All-in-all, however, it is prescribed with caution to the elderly and with extreme caution to those with psychosis, as the general brain activity enhancement in combination with the ""dementing"" effects of anticholinergics increases the potential of imipramine to cause hallucinations, confusion and delirium in this population. ""Anti-cholinergic"" side-effects, including urinary hesitancy/retention, may be treated/reversed with bethanechol and/or other acetylcholine-agonists. Bethanechol may also be able to alleviate the sexual-dysfunction symptoms which may occur in the context of tricyclic-antidepressant treatment. Epinephrine: imipramine antagonizes adrenergic receptors, thus sometimes causing orthostatic hypotension. Sigma receptor: activity on sigma receptors is present, but it is very weak (Ki = 520 nM) and it is about half that of amitriptyline (Ki = 300 nM). Histamine: imipramine is an antagonist of the histamine H1 receptors. BDNF: BDNF is implicated in neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and studies suggest that depressed patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. It is not clear how neurogenesis restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in murine models do not show anxiety related or depression related behaviours. Chronic imipramine administration results in increased histone acetylation (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promoter, and also reduced expression of hippocampal HDAC5. === Pharmacokinetics === Imipramine has a varied absolute oral bioavailability ranging from 22% to 77%, leading to significant variability in pharmacokinetics. While the drug has rapid and complete absorption after oral administration, much of the drug is affected by first pass metabolism. Food has no effect on absorption, peak drug concentration, or time to peak drug concentration. Within the body, imipramine is converted into desipramine (desmethylimipramine) as a metabolite. == Chemistry == Imipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include desipramine (N-desmethylimipramine), clomipramine (3-chloroimipramine), trimipramine (2′-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine), and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Imipramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of imipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H24N2 with a molecular weight of 280.407 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the embonate (pamoate) salt is used for intramuscular administration and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-49-7, of the hydrochloride is 113-52-0, and of the embonate is 10075-24-8. == History == The parent compound of imipramine, 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine (dibenzazepine), was first synthesized in 1899, but no pharmacological assessment of this compound or any substituted derivatives was undertaken until the late 1940s. Imipramine was first synthesized in 1951, as an antihistamine. The antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine were discovered in 1952, and imipramine was then developed and studied as an antipsychotic for use in patients with schizophrenia. The medication was tested in several hundred patients with psychosis, but showed little effectiveness. However, imipramine was serendipitously found to possess antidepressant effects in the mid-1950s following a case report of symptom improvement in a woman with severe depression who had been treated with it. This was followed by similar observations in other patients and further clinical research. Subsequently, imipramine was introduced for the treatment of depression in Europe in 1958 and in the United States in 1959. Along with the discovery and introduction of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor iproniazid as an antidepressant around the same time, imipramine resulted in the establishment of monoaminergic drugs as antidepressants. In the late 1950s, imipramine was the first TCA to be developed (by Ciba). At the first international congress of neuropharmacology in Rome, September 1958 Dr Freyhan from the University of Pennsylvania discussed as one of the first clinicians the effects of imipramine in a group of 46 patients, most of them diagnosed as ""depressive psychosis"". The patients were selected for this study based on symptoms such as depressive apathy, kinetic retardation and feelings of hopelessness and despair. In 30% of all patients, he reported optimal results, and in around 20%, failure. The side effects noted were atropine-like, and most patients experienced dizziness. Imipramine was first tried for treating psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, but proved ineffective. As an antidepressant, it did well in clinical studies and it is known to work well in even the most severe cases of depression. It is not surprising, therefore, that imipramine may cause a high rate of manic and hypomanic reactions in hospitalized patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, with one study showing that up to 25% of such patients maintained on Imipramine switched into mania or hypomania. Such powerful antidepressant properties have made it favorable in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression. Before the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), its sometimes intolerable side-effect profile was considered more tolerable. Therefore, it became extensively used as a standard antidepressant and later served as a prototypical drug for the development of the later-released TCAs. Since SSRIs are superior in terms of inherent side-effect tolerability (although probably inferior in terms of actual efficacy), it has, as of the 1990s, no longer been used as commonly, but is sometimes still prescribed as a second-line treatment for treating major depression. It has also seen limited use in the treatment of migraines, ADHD, and post-concussive syndrome. Imipramine has additional indications for the treatment of panic attacks, chronic pain, and Kleine-Levin syndrome. In pediatric patients, it is relatively frequently used to treat pavor nocturnus and nocturnal enuresis. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Imipramine is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while imipramine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are imipramina, in German is imipramin, and in Latin is imipraminum.

It is used for determining cardiac output, hepatic function, liver and gastric blood flow, and for ophthalmic and cerebral angiography. It has a peak spectral absorption at about 800 nm.

ICG binds tightly to plasma proteins and becomes confined to the vascular system. ICG has a half-life of 150 to 180 seconds and is removed from circulation exclusively by the liver to bile. ICG is a fluorescent dye which is used in medicine as an indicator substance (e.g. for photometric hepatic function diagnostics and fluorescence angiography) in cardiac, circulatory, hepatic and ophthalmic conditions. It is administered intravenously and, depending on liver performance, is eliminated from the body with a half life of about 3 to 4 minutes. ICG sodium salt is normally available in powder form and can be dissolved in various solvents; 5% (< 5% depending on batch) sodium iodide is usually added to ensure better solubility. The sterile lyophilisate of a water-ICG solution is approved in many European countries and the United States under the names ICG-Pulsion and IC-Green as a diagnostic for intravenous use. == History == ICG was developed in the Second World War as a dye in photography and tested in 1957 at the Mayo Clinic for use in human medicine by I.J. Fox. After being granted FDA approval in 1959, ICG was initially used primarily in hepatic function diagnostics and later in cardiology. In 1964, S. Schilling was able to determine renal blood flow using ICG. From 1969, ICG was also used in the research and diagnosis of subretinal processes in the eye (in the choroid). In the years since 1980, the development of new types of cameras and better film material or new photometric measuring devices has cleared away many technical difficulties. In the meantime, the use of ICG in medicine (and especially in fluorescent angiography in ophthalmology) has become established as standard. A distinction is therefore also made, when describing fluorescent angiography, between NA fluorescent angiography and ICGA / ICG fluorescent angiography. Around 3,000 scientific papers on ICG have now been published worldwide. == Optical properties == The absorption and fluorescence spectrum of ICG is in the near infrared region. Both depend largely on the solvent used and the concentration. ICG absorbs mainly between 600 nm and 900 nm and emits fluorescence between 750 nm and 950 nm. The large overlapping of the absorption and fluorescence spectra leads to a marked reabsorption of the fluorescence by ICG itself. The fluorescence spectrum is very wide. Its maximum values are approx. 810 nm in water and approx. 830 nm in blood. For medical applications based on absorption, the maximum absorption at approx. 800 nm (in blood plasma at low concentrations) is important. In combination with fluorescence detection, lasers with a wavelength of around 780 nm are used. At this wavelength, it is still possible to detect the fluorescence of ICG by filtering out scattered light from the excitation beam. == Toxicity and side-effects == ICG is metabolized microsomally in the liver and only excreted via the liver and bile ducts; since it is not absorbed by the intestinal mucous membrane, the toxicity can be classified as low. Administration is not without risks during pregnancy. It has been known since September 2007 that ICG decomposes into toxic waste materials under the influence of UV light, creating a number of still unknown substances. A study published in February 2008, however, shows that ICG (the substance without UV effect) is basically, as such, of only minor toxicity. The intravenous LD50 values measured in animals are 60 mg/kg in mice and 87 mg/kg in rats. Occasionally – in one out of 42,000 cases – slight side-effects occur in humans such as sore throats and hot flushes. Effects such as anaphylactic shock, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea and urticaria only occurred in individual cases; the risk of severe side-effects rises in patients with chronic kidney impairment. The frequencies of mild, moderate and severe side-effects were only 0.15%, 0.2% and 0.05%; the rate of deaths is 1:333,333. For the competitor substance fluorescein, the proportion of people with side-effects is 4.8% and the death rate is 1:222,222. == Uses == === Uses in ophthalmology === ==== Indocyanine green angiography ==== Because the preparation contains sodium iodide, a test must be carried out for iodine intolerance. Because around 5% of iodide is added, the iodine content of a 25 mg ampoule is 0.93 mg. In comparison, preparations for a bone marrow CT (140 ml) contain 300 mg/ml and for a corona angiography (200 ml) 350 mg/ml of iodine. ICG has the ability to bind 98% to plasma proteins – 80% to globulins and 20% to alpha-lipoprotein and albumin – and thus, in comparison with fluorescein as a marker, has a lower leakage (slower emergence of dye from the vessels, extravasally). Because of the plasma protein binding, ICG stays for up to 20 to 30 minutes in the vessels (intravasally). When the eye is examined, it thus stays for a long time in tissues with a higher blood flow, such as the choroid and the blood vessels of the retina. ==== Capsulorhexis ==== Capsulorhexis is a technique used to remove the lens capsule during cataract surgery. Various dyes are used to stain lens capsule during cataract surgery. In 1998, Horiguchi et al. first described the use of indocyanine green dye (0.5%) for capsular staining to assist cataract surgery. ICG-enhanced anterior and posterior capsulorhexis is useful in childhood cataract surgery. It may also use in adult cataract with no fundus glow. Although ICG is approved by US FDA, still there is no approval for intraocular use of the dye. === Perfusion diagnostics of tissues and organs === ICG is used as a marker in the assessment of the perfusion of tissues and organs in many areas of medicine. The light needed for the excitation of the fluorescence is generated by a near infrared light source which is attached directly to a camera. A digital video camera allows the absorption of the ICG fluorescence to be recorded in real time, which means that perfusion can be assessed and documented. In addition, ICG can also be used as a tracer in cerebral perfusion diagnostics. In the case of stroke patients, monitoring in the recovery phase seems to be achievable by measurement of both the ICG absorption and the fluorescence in everyday clinical conditions. === ICG-supported navigation for sentinel lymph node biopsy with tumors === Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLB or SLN biopsy) allows selective, minimally invasive access for assessment of the regional lymph node status with malignant tumours. The first draining lymph node, the ""sentinel"", represents an existing or non-existing tumour of an entire lymph node region. The method has been validated using radionuclides and/or blue dye for breast cancer, malignant melanoma and also gastrointestinal tumours and gives a good detection rate and sensitivity. For the SLB, a reduced mortality has been observed in comparison with complete lymph node dissection, but the methods have disadvantages with regard to availability, application and disposal of the radionuclide and the risk of anaphylaxis (up to 1%) for the blue dye. ICG, because of its near-infrared fluorescence and previous toxicity investigations, was evaluated in this investigation as a new, alternative method for SLB with regard to the clinical application of the transcutaneous navigation and lymph vessel visualisation and SLN detection. This technique is sometimes referred as fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS). ICG fluorescence navigation achieves high rates of detection and sensitivity in comparison with the conventional methods. Taking into account the learning curve required, the new, alternative method offers a combination of lymphography and SLB and the possibility of carrying out an SLB without the need for radioactive substances for solitary tumours === Selectively over-heating cells (especially cancer) === ICG absorbs near infra-red, especially light with a wavelength of about 805 nanometers. A laser of that wavelength can penetrate tissue. That means, dying tissue with injected ICG allows an 800 nm to 810 nm laser to heat or overheat the dyed tissue without harming the surrounding tissue. Although overheating is the main mechanism for it to kill cells, a small amount of the laser energy absorbed by the ICG releases free radicals such as singlet oxygen that also damage target cells. That works particularly well on cancer tumors, because tumors naturally absorb more ICG than other tissue. When ICG is injected near tumors, tumors react to the laser 2.5 times as much as the surrounding tissue does. It is also possible to target specific cells by conjugating the ICG to antibodies such as daclizumab (Dac), trastuzumab (Tra), or panitumumab (Pan). ICG and laser therapy has been shown to kill human pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3) in vitro. ICG and an infrared laser have also been used the same way to treat acne vulgaris. === Enzyme inhibitor against mushroom toxin === ICG is being studied as a possible antidote for the death cap mushroom toxin alpha-amanitin by inhibiting the enzyme STT3B. == References == == External links == Stanga, Paulo E.; Lim, Jennifer I.; Hamilton, Peter (2003).

1146,"('Azelaic acid', 'Nonanedioic acid', 'Finacea', 'Anchoic acid', 'Azelex')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Azelaic acid (AzA), or nonanedioic acid, is an organic compound with the formula HOOC(CH2)7COOH. This saturated dicarboxylic acid exists as a white powder. It is found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is a precursor to diverse industrial products including polymers and plasticizers, as well as being a component of several hair and skin conditioners. AzA inhibits tyrosinase. == Production == Azelaic acid is industrially produced by the ozonolysis of oleic acid. The side product is nonanoic acid. It is produced naturally by Malassezia furfur (also known as Pityrosporum ovale), a yeast that lives on normal skin. The bacterial degradation of nonanoic acid gives azelaic acid. == Biological function == === Plants biology === In plants, azelaic acid serves as a ""distress flare"" involved in defense responses after infection. It serves as a signal that induces the accumulation of salicylic acid, an important component of a plant's defensive response. === Human biology === The mechanism of action in humans is thought to be through the inhibition of hyperactive protease activity that converts cathelicidin into the antimicrobial skin peptide LL-37. == Applications == === Polymers and related materials === Esters of this dicarboxylic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers. In lubricant industries, it is used as a thickening agent in lithium complex grease. With hexamethylenediamine, azelaic acid forms Nylon-6,9, which finds specialized uses as a plastic. === Medical === In 2022, it was the 298th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 300,000 prescriptions. Azelaic acid is used to treat mild to moderate acne, both comedonal acne and inflammatory acne. It belongs to a class of chemicals called dicarboxylic acids. It works by killing acne bacteria that infect skin pores. It also decreases the production of keratin, which is a natural substance that promotes the growth of acne bacteria. Azelaic acid is also used as a topical gel treatment for rosacea, due to its ability to reduce inflammation. It clears the bumps and swelling caused by rosacea. In topical pharmaceutical preparations and scientific research AzA is typically used in concentrations between 15% and 20% but some research demonstrates that in certain vehicle formulations, the pharmaceutical effects of 10% Azelaic acid have the potential to be fully comparable to that of some 20% creams. ==== Acne treatment ==== Azelaic acid is effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 15%-20% concentration. In patients with moderate acne, twice daily application over 3 months of 20% AzA significantly reduced the number of comedones, papules, and pustules; at this strength, it’s considered to be as effective as benzoyl peroxide 5%, tretinoin 0.05%, erythromycin 2%, and oral tetracycline at 500 mg-1000 mg. In a comparative review of effects of topical AzA, Salicylic acid, Nicotinamide, Sulfur, Zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid, AzA had more high-quality evidence of effectiveness than the rest. Results can be expected after 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment. The effectiveness of long-term use is unclear, but it’s been recommended that AzA be used for at least 6 months continuously for maintenance. === Whitening agent === Azelaic acid is used for the treatment of skin pigmentation, including melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, particularly in those with darker skin types. It has been recommended as an alternative to hydroquinone. As a tyrosinase inhibitor, azelaic acid reduces synthesis of melanin. According to one report in 1988, azelaic acid in combination with zinc sulfate in vitro was found to be a potent (90% inhibition) 5α-reductase inhibitor, similar to the hair loss drugs finasteride and dutasteride. In vitro research during mid-1980s evaluating azelaic acid's depigmenting (whitening) capability concluded it is effective (cytotoxic to melanocytes) at only high concentrations. A 1996 review claimed 20% AzA is as potent as 4% hydroquinone after a period of application of three months without the latter's adverse effects and even more effective if applied along with tretinoin for the same period of time. == Brand names == Brand names for azelaic acid include Dermaz 99, Crema Pella Perfetta (micronized azelaic acid, kojic dipalmitate, and liquorice extract), Azepur99, Azetec99, Azaclear (azelaic acid and niacinamide), AzClear Action, Azelex, White Action cream, Finacea, Finevin, Melazepam, Skinoren, Ezanic, Azelac, Azelan, Azaderm, (Acnegen, Eziderm, Acnicam, Azelexin in Pakistan) == References == == External links == DermNet treatments/azelaic-acid ""Azelaic Acid Topical"".

1147,"('Kojic acid', 'Acido kojico', 'Pyran-4-one, 5-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)', 'Kojisaeure', 'Kojic acid solution')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Kojic acid is an organic compound with the formula HOCH2C5H2O2OH. It is a derivative of 4-pyrone that functions in nature as a chelation agent produced by several species of fungus, especially Aspergillus oryzae, which has the Japanese common name koji. Kojic acid is a by-product in the fermentation process of malting rice, for use in the manufacturing of sake, the Japanese rice wine. It is a mild inhibitor of the formation of pigment in plant and animal tissues, and is used in food and cosmetics to preserve or change colors of substances. It forms a bright red complex with ferric ions. == Biosynthesis == 13C-Labeling studies have revealed at least two pathways to kojic acid. In the usual route, dehydratase enzymes convert glucose to kojic acid. Pentoses are also viable precursors in which case dihydroxyacetone is invoked as an intermediate. == Applications == Kojic acid may be used on cut fruits to prevent oxidative browning, in seafood to preserve pink and red colors, and in cosmetics to lighten skin. As an example of the latter, it is used to treat skin diseases like melasma. Kojic acid also has antibacterial and antifungal properties. == Chemical reactions == Deprotonation of the ring-OH group converts kojic acid to kojate. Kojate chelates to iron(III), forming a red complex Fe(HOCH2C5OH2O2)3. This kind of reaction may be the basis of the biological function of kojic acid, that is, to solubilize ferric iron. Being a multifunctional molecule, kojic acid has diverse organic chemistry. The hydroxymethyl group gives the chloromethyl derivative upon treatment with thionyl chloride. == Safety == Kojic acid may be weakly carcinogenic, according to some animal studies.

1148,"('Phenol red (sodium salt)', 'Phenolsulfonephthalein sodium salt', 'Phenolsulfonphthalein', 'Fenolipuna', 'Sulfonphthal')","Medical, Industrial","Phenol red (also known as phenolsulfonphthalein or PSP) is a pH indicator frequently used in cell biology laboratories. == Chemical structure and properties == Phenol red exists as a red crystal that is stable in air. Its solubility is 0.77 grams per liter (g/L) in water and 2.9 g/L in ethanol. It is a weak acid with pKa = 8.00 at 20 °C (68 °F). A solution of phenol red is used as a pH indicator, often in cell culture. Its color exhibits a gradual transition from yellow (λmax = 443 nm) to red (λmax = 570 nm) over the pH range 6.8 to 8.2. Above pH 8.2, phenol red turns a bright pink (fuchsia) color. In crystalline form, and in solution under very acidic conditions (low pH), the compound exists as a zwitterion as in the structure shown above, with the sulfate group negatively charged, and the ketone group carrying an additional proton. This form is sometimes symbolically written as H+2PS− and is orange-red. If the pH is increased (pKa = 1.2), the proton from the ketone group is lost, resulting in the yellow, negatively charged ion denoted as HPS−. At still higher pH (pKa = 7.7), the phenol's hydroxy group loses its proton, resulting in the red ion denoted as PS2−. In several sources, the structure of phenol red is shown with the sulfur atom being part of a cyclic group, similar to the structure of phenolphthalein. However, this cyclic structure could not be confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Several indicators share a similar structure to phenol red, including bromothymol blue, thymol blue, bromocresol purple, thymolphthalein, and phenolphthalein. (A table of other common chemical indicators is available in the article on pH indicators.) == Uses == === Phenolsulfonphthalein test === Phenol red was used by Leonard Rowntree and John Geraghty in the phenolsulfonphthalein test to estimate the overall blood flow through the kidney in 1911. It was the first test of kidney function and was used for almost a century but is now obsolete. The test is based on the fact that phenol red is excreted almost entirely in the urine. Phenol red solution is administered intravenously; the urine produced is collected. By measuring the amount of phenol red excreted colorimetrically, kidney function can be determined. === Indicator for cell cultures === Most living tissues prosper at a near-neutral pH—that is, a pH close to 7. The pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, for instance. When cells are grown in tissue culture, the medium in which they grow is held close to this physiological pH. A small amount of phenol red added to this growth medium will have a pink-red color under normal conditions. Typically, 15 mg/L are used for cell culture. In the event of problems, waste products produced by dying cells or overgrowth of contaminants will cause a change in pH, leading to a change in indicator color. For example, a culture of relatively slowly dividing mammalian cells can be quickly overgrown by bacterial contamination. This usually results in an acidification of the medium, turning it yellow. Many biologists find this a convenient way to rapidly check on the health of tissue cultures. In addition, the waste products produced by the mammalian cells themselves will slowly decrease the pH, gradually turning the solution orange and then yellow. This color change is an indication that even in the absence of contamination, the medium needs to be replaced (generally, this should be done before the medium has turned completely orange). Since the color of phenol red can interfere with some spectrophotometric and fluorescent assays, many types of tissue culture media are also available without phenol red. === Estrogen mimic === Phenol red is a weak estrogen mimic, and in cell cultures can enhance the growth of cells that express the estrogen receptor. It has been used to induce ovarian epithelial cells from post-menopausal women to differentiate into cells with properties of oocytes (eggs), with potential implications for both fertility treatment and stem cell research. === Use in swimming pool test kits === Phenol red, sometimes labelled with a different name, such as ""Guardex Solution #2"", is used as a pH indicator in home swimming pool test kits. Chlorine can result in the bleaching of the dye in the absence of thiosulfate to inhibit the oxidizing chlorine. High levels of bromine can convert phenol red to bromophenol red (dibromophenolsulfonephthalein, whose lowered pKa results in an indicator with a range shifted in the acidic direction – water at pH 6.8 will appear to test at 7.5). Even higher levels of bromine (>20 ppm) can result in the secondary conversion of bromophenol red to bromophenol blue with an even lower pKa, erroneously giving the impression that the water has an extremely high pH despite being dangerously low. == References == == External links == Video of phenol red activity demonstration and medium preparation",Phenolsulfonphthalein,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.049699705094099045), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.1684534251689911), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.576071560382843)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.04858771339058876), (' INDUSTR', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/phenolsulfonphthalein-injection-route/description/drg-20065437?utm_source=openai), [cosmileeurope.eu](https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/detail/11554/phenolsulfonphthalein/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=274, start_index=24, title='Phenolsulfonphthalein (injection route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/phenolsulfonphthalein-injection-route/description/drg-20065437?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=274, start_index=24, title='PHENOLSULFONPHTHALEIN – Ingredient - COSMILE Europe', type='url_citation', url='https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/detail/11554/phenolsulfonphthalein/?utm_source=openai')])"

Eligible adults had a previously treated locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic biliary tract (cohort 1), urothelial (cohort 2), or another histologic cancer type (cohort 3). Debio 1347 was administered at 80 mg once daily, continuously, in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, pharmacokinetics, and incidence of adverse events. Between March 22, 2019, and January 8, 2020, 63 patients were enrolled and treated, 30 in cohort 1, 4 in cohort 2, and 29 in cohort 3. An unplanned preliminary statistical review showed that the efficacy of Debio 1347 was lower than predicted, and the trial was terminated. In total, 3 of 58 evaluable patients had partial responses, representing an objective response rate of 5%, with a further 26 (45%) having stable disease (≥6 weeks duration). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 22 (35%) of 63 patients, with the most common being hyperphosphatemia (13%) and stomatitis (5%). Two patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Debio 1347 had manageable toxicity; however, the efficacy in patients with tumors harboring FGFR fusions did not support further clinical evaluation in this setting. Our transcriptomic-based analysis characterized in detail the incidence and nature of FGFR fusions across solid tumors. See related commentary by Hage Chehade et al., p. 4549. Drugs that target specific gene alterations have proven beneficial in the treatment of cancer. Because cancer cells have multiple resistance mechanisms, it is important to understand the downstream pathways of the target genes and monitor the pharmacodynamic markers associated with therapeutic efficacy. We performed a transcriptome analysis to characterize the response of various cancer cell lines to a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor (CH5183284/Debio 1347), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, or a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. FGFR and MEK inhibition produced similar expression patterns, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) gene signature was altered in several FGFR inhibitor-sensitive cell lines. Consistent with these findings, CH5183284/Debio 1347 suppressed phospho-ERK in every tested FGFR inhibitor-sensitive cell line. Because the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway functions downstream of FGFR, we searched for a pharmacodynamic marker of FGFR inhibitor efficacy in a collection of cell lines with the ERK signature and identified dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) as a candidate marker. Although a MEK inhibitor suppressed the MAPK pathway, most FGFR inhibitor-sensitive cell lines are insensitive to MEK inhibitors and we found potent feedback activation of several pathways via FGFR. We therefore suggest that FGFR inhibitors exert their effect by suppressing ERK signaling without feedback activation. In addition, DUSP6 may be a pharmacodynamic marker of FGFR inhibitor efficacy in FGFR-addicted cancers. The FGF receptors (FGFR) are tyrosine kinases that are constitutively activated in a subset of tumors by genetic alterations such as gene amplifications, point mutations, or chromosomal translocations/rearrangements. Recently, small-molecule inhibitors that can inhibit the FGFR family as well as the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family displayed clinical benefits in cohorts of patients with FGFR genetic alterations. However, to achieve more potent and prolonged activity in such populations, a selective FGFR inhibitor is still needed. Here, we report the identification of CH5183284/Debio 1347, a selective and orally available FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 inhibitor that has a unique chemical scaffold. By interacting with unique residues in the ATP-binding site of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3, CH5183284/Debio 1347 selectively inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 but does not inhibit kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) or other kinases. Consistent with its high selectivity for FGFR enzymes, CH5183284/Debio 1347 displayed preferential antitumor activity against cancer cells with various FGFR genetic alterations in a panel of 327 cancer cell lines and in xenograft models. Because of its unique binding mode, CH5183284/Debio 1347 can inhibit FGFR2 harboring one type of the gatekeeper mutation that causes resistance to other FGFR inhibitors and block FGFR2 V564F-driven tumor growth. CH5183284/Debio 1347 is under clinical investigation for the treatment of patients harboring FGFR genetic alterations.",Debio 1347,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003719830128829926), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004084459971636534)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.2500?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=107, start_index=9, title='Debio 1347, an oral FGFR inhibitor: Results from a first-in-human, phase I dose-escalation study in patients with FGFR genomically activated advanced solid tumors. | Journal of Clinical Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.2500?utm_source=openai')])"

1151,"('Oxfendazole', 'Fenbendazole sulfoxide', 'Synanthic', 'Systamex', 'Repidose')",Medical,"Oxfendazole is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic. Its main use is for protecting livestock against roundworm, strongyles, and pinworms. Oxfendazole is the sulfoxide metabolite of fenbendazole. Oxfendazole is an anthelmintic (wormer) compound used in veterinary practice. It comes under the chemical class of the benzimidazoles. This drug is rarely used in horses, goats, sheep, and cattle. It is very scarcely applied on dogs and cats. The drug for livestock is majorly available in the form of pills, tablets, drenches, bolus, etc. They are meant for oral consumption. Several drenches are allowed for intraruminal injection in some of the countries. Few countries also prefer injectables and pour-ons. For pet dogs, the drug is available in the form of drenches. == Efficacy == Both oxfendazole and fenbendazole are efficacious against gastrointestinal lungworms and roundworms of livestock, adults, and L4-larvae of the significant species for example, of the genera Bunostomum, Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Oesophagostomum, Nematodirus, Teladorsagia, Cooperia, Trichostrongylus, Dictyocaulus, Trichuris, etc., including against arrested larvae of some of the species. They are even highly efficient against majority of the tapeworms commonly found in livestock. This drug works effectively against the main parasitic roundworms and tapeworms of dogs and cats. The drug offers a small residual effect in ruminants unless and otherwise it is delivered by using a slow-release device. This essentially means that on a single administration, it will help in killing the parasites that are present in the host during the time of treatment and also prevent against reinfestations for some more days, but not weeks or months. The residual effect is comparatively shorter in nonruminants. The drug is not effective against flukes and external parasites at therapeutic doses. == Adverse effects == Since the toxicity of oxfendazole is quite low, it is generally well tolerated by most species. High oral doses can cause intoxication, though, resulting in loss of appetite, diarrhea, fever, cramps, nausea and vomiting, convulsions, hepatic and epicardial hemorrhage, allergic reactions, etc. Due to lack of research, use of oxfendazole in pregnant mares and bitches is not recommended, nor are oxfendazole tablets to treat dogs or cats. A registered veterinarian must authorize the use of oxfendazole in any species. == Brand names == Oxfendazole is sold under brand names of Synanthic (suspension), Benzelmin (paste), and Anthelcide EQ (paste). == References ==",Systamex,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02975720353424549)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.6699362397193909), ('DU', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31502678990364075)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1152,"('Ethynyl estradiol', 'Ethynylestradiol', 'Ethinyl estradiol', 'Ethinyloestradiol', 'Ginestrene')",Medical,"Ethinylestradiol (EE) is an estrogen medication which is used widely in birth control pills in combination with progestins. In the past, EE was widely used for various indications such as the treatment of menopausal symptoms, gynecological disorders, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers. It is usually taken by mouth but is also used as a patch and vaginal ring. The general side effects of EE include breast tenderness and enlargement, headache, fluid retention, and nausea among others. In men, EE can additionally cause breast development, feminization in general, hypogonadism, and sexual dysfunction. Rare but serious side effects include blood clots, liver damage, and cancer of the uterus. EE is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a synthetic derivative of estradiol, a natural estrogen, and differs from it in various ways. Compared to estradiol, EE is more resistant to metabolism, has greatly improved bioavailability when taken by mouth, and shows relatively increased effects in certain parts of the body like the liver and uterus. These differences make EE more favorable for use in birth control pills than estradiol, though also result in an increased risk of blood clots and certain other rare adverse effects. EE was developed in the 1930s and was introduced for medical use in 1943. The medication started being used in birth control pills in the 1960s. Ethinylestradiol is found in almost all combined forms of birth control pills and is nearly the exclusive estrogen used for this purpose, making it one of the most widely used estrogens. The combination with norethisterone was already the 80th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States and the compound appears in many other common mediactions as well.; == Medical uses == There are many uses for EE. It is most commonly used as contraception in combined oral contraceptives (COC), also known as birth control, to prevent pregnancy after sex. EE in its birth control formulation is not only used to prevent pregnancy, but can also be used to treat absence of menstruation, symptoms during menstruation, and acne. EE is also used as menopausal hormone therapy. The main reason for using HRT in menopausal women is to relieve common vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and flushing. Studies have found that estrogen replacement helps improve these symptoms when compared to a placebo. Other common menopause symptoms, such as vaginal dryness (which can cause pain during sexual intercourse), vaginal itching, and depressed mood, can benefit from HRT. In addition to treatment of menopausal symptoms, EE has been used as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. However, it is no longer commonly used nor recommended for this purpose, with estradiol having largely superseded it. EE can also be used to treat hypogonadism in women, prevent osteoporosis in women, and has been used as palliative care for prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. It has also been used to reduce sex drive in sex offenders. EE or any estrogen alone is contraindicated for women who have a uterus due to the increased risk of endometrial cancer; giving a progestogen with an estrogen mitigates the risk. === Available forms === EE is available in combination with a progestin in a vast number of COCs. It is also available in combination with progestins as a transdermal contraceptive patch and as a contraceptive vaginal ring. In addition, there is a single preparation (brand name FemHRT) containing very low doses of EE (2.5 and 5 μg) plus a progestin in an oral tablet that remains in use for menopausal hormone therapy. EE was previously available by itself under brand names like Estinyl and Lynoral in the form of 0.002, 0.01, 0.02, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg (2, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μg) tablets. The amount of EE in COCs has reduced over the years. Previously, COCs contained high doses of EE of as much as 100 μg/day. Doses of more than 50 μg EE are considered high-dose, doses of 30 and 35 μg EE are considered low-dose, and doses of 10 to 25 μg EE are considered very low dose. Today, COCs generally contain 10 to 50 μg EE. The higher doses of EE were discontinued due to a high risk of VTE and cardiovascular problems. == Contraindications == EE should be avoided in individuals with a history of or known susceptibility to arterial or venous thrombosis (blood clots), due to an increased risk of cardiovascular problems such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. This includes women with: History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) not receiving anticoagulants Acute DVT/PE Prolonged immobilization due to major surgery Advanced diabetes mellitus with vascular disease Migraine with aura Hypertension ≥160/100 Vascular disease Current and history of ischemic heart disease Multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g. older age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, low HDL, high LDL, or high triglyceride levels) Age ≥35 and smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day History of cerebrovascular accident Systemic lupus erythematosus with positive (or unknown) antiphospholipid antibodies Complicated valvular heart disease Except when being used to treat it, EE should be avoided in women with current breast cancer due to a possible worsening of prognosis. EE should also be avoided in breastfeeding women who are less than 21 days postpartum due to an increased risk of VTE. EE use in breastfeeding women who are at least 21 days postpartum should be discussed with a provider and include information on the advantages, disadvantages, and alternatives for using EE. Due to risk of cholestatic hepatotoxicity, it is widely considered that COCs containing EE should be avoided in women with a history of cholestasis of pregnancy, hepatic tumors, active hepatitis, and familial defects in biliary excretion. == Side effects == The severity of side effects can vary based on the dose and administration route of EE. General side effects of EE are the same as for other estrogens and include breast tenderness, headache, fluid retention (bloating), nausea, dizziness, and weight gain. The estrogen component of oral contraceptives, which is almost always EE, can cause breast tenderness and fullness. In males, EE has additional side effects, including gynecomastia (breast development), feminization in general, hypogonadism, infertility, and sexual dysfunction (e.g., reduced libido and erectile dysfunction). In men who received high-dose estrogen therapy with 200 μg/day oral EE for more than three months, gynecomastia occurred in 98% and decreased libido occurred in 42 to 73%. === Long-term effects === ==== Blood clots ==== VTE is a blood clot in a vein, and includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Estrogens are known to increase the risk of VTE due to their effects on liver synthesis of coagulation factors. EE carries a greater risk of blood clot formation and VTE than does natural estradiol, which is thought to be due to structural differences between the two compounds and different susceptibilities to liver inactivation. A 2012 meta-analysis estimated that the absolute risk of VTE is 2 per 10,000 women for non-use, 8 per 10,000 women for EE and levonorgestrel-containing birth control pills, and 10 to 15 per 10,000 women for birth control pills containing EE and a third- or fourth-generation progestin such as desogestrel or drospirenone. For comparison, the absolute risk of VTE is generally estimated as 1 to 5 per 10,000 woman–years for non-use, 5 to 20 per 10,000 woman–years for pregnancy, and 40 to 65 per 10,000 woman–years for the postpartum period. Modern COCs are associated with about a 2- to 4-fold higher risk of VTE than non-use. The route of administration of EE does not appear to influence VTE risk, as EE/progestin-containing contraceptive vaginal rings and contraceptive patches have the same or even higher risk of VTE than COCs. Pregnancy is associated with about a 4.3-fold increase in risk of VTE. It has been estimated that at least 300 to 400 healthy young women die each year in the United States due to VTE caused by EE-containing birth control pills. Modern COCs contain 10 to 35 μg EE, but typically 20, 30, or 35 μg. The initial formulations of COCs that were introduced in the 1960s contained 100 to 150 μg EE. However, it was soon found that EE is associated with increased risk of VTE and that the risk is dose-dependent. Following these events, the dose of EE was greatly reduced, and is now always less than 50 μg. These lower doses have a significantly reduced risk of VTE with no loss of contraceptive effectiveness. Gerstman et al. (1991) found that COCs containing more than 50 μg EE had 1.7-fold and COCs containing 50 μg EE 1.5-fold the risk of VTE of COCs containing less than 50 μg. A 2014 Cochrane review found that COCs containing 50 μg EE with levonorgestrel had 2.1- to 2.3-fold the risk of COCs containing 30 μg or 20 μg EE with levonorgestrel, respectively. COCs containing 20 μg EE are likewise associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events than COCs containing 30 or 40 μg EE. However, discontinuation of COCs is more common with doses of EE from 10 to 20 μg due to problematic changes in bleeding patterns. Women with thrombophilia have a dramatically higher risk of VTE with EE-containing contraception than women without thrombophilia. Depending on the condition, risk of VTE can be increased 5- to 50-fold relative to non-use in such women. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels indicate hepatic estrogenic exposure and may be a surrogate marker for coagulation and VTE risk with estrogen therapy, although this topic has been debated. SHBG levels with birth control pills containing different progestins are increased by 1.5 to 2-fold with levonorgestrel, 2.5- to 4-fold with desogestrel and gestodene, 3.5- to 4-fold with drospirenone and dienogest, and 4- to 5-fold with cyproterone acetate. Contraceptive vaginal rings and contraceptive patches likewise have been found to increase SHBG levels by 2.5-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Birth control pills containing high doses of ethinylestradiol (>50 μg) can increase SHBG levels by 5- to 10-fold, which is similar to the increase that occurs during pregnancy. Conversely, increases in SHBG levels are much lower with estradiol, especially when used parenterally. High-dose parenteral polyestradiol phosphate therapy has been found to increase SHBG levels by about 1.5-fold. ==== Cardiovascular issues ==== When used orally at high dosages, for instance as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in men with prostate cancer and in women with breast cancer, synthetic and non-bioidentical estrogens like EE and diethylstilbestrol are associated with fairly high rates of severe cardiovascular complications such as VTE, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Diethylstilbestrol has been associated with an up to 35% risk of cardiovascular toxicity and death and a 15% incidence of VTE in men treated with it for prostate cancer. EE has a to some degree lower risk of cardiovascular complications than does diethylstilbestrol when used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. However, both EE and diethylstilbestrol nonetheless have highly disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis, which is thought to be responsible for their cardiovascular toxicity. In contrast to oral synthetic estrogens like EE and diethylstilbestrol, high-dosage polyestradiol phosphate and transdermal estradiol have not been found to increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality or thromboembolism in men with prostate cancer. However, significantly increased cardiovascular morbidity has been observed with high-dosage polyestradiol phosphate. In any case, these estrogens are considered to be much safer than oral synthetic estrogens like EE and diethylstilbestrol. In addition, ethinylestradiol sulfonate (EES), an oral but parenteral-like long-lasting prodrug of EE, is used in the treatment of prostate cancer, and is said to have a considerably better profile of cardiovascular safety than EE. Because of its disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis and associated cardiovascular risks, synthetic estrogens like EE and diethylstilbestrol are no longer used in menopausal hormone therapy. They are also being replaced by parenteral forms of estradiol like polyestradiol phosphate and transdermal estradiol in the treatment of prostate cancer. ==== Liver damage ==== At the lower dosages that are now used in birth control pills, EE has been associated rarely with cholestatic hepatotoxicity similarly to 17α-alkylated androgens/anabolic steroids and 17α-ethynylated 19-nortestosterone progestins. Cholestasis can manifest as pruritus and jaundice. Glucuronide metabolites of EE, via effects on the ABCB11 (BSEP) and MRP2 (ABCC2) proteins and consequent changes in bile flow and bile salt excretion, appear to be responsible for the cholestasis. Very high concentrations of estradiol, via its metabolite estradiol glucuronide, are also implicated in cholestasis, for instance in cholestasis of pregnancy. However, the incidence and severity of cholestatic hepatotoxicity appear to be much greater with EE than with estradiol, which is thought to be due to the reactive C17α ethynyl substitution in EE as well as its greatly reduced susceptibility to hepatic metabolism. Whereas abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are normally found in about 1% of women not on birth control pills or taking lower-dose EE-containing birth control pills, this increases to more than 10% of women taking birth control pills containing 50 μg/day EE or more. With birth control pills containing 50 μg/day EE, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels increase by 50%, hematocrit by 19%, and leukocytes by 50%, while gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) decreases by 30%. However, the values usually remain in the normal range. In addition to abnormal LFTs, pathological changes in partial liver functions and liver morphology can be observed in half of women on birth control pills with 50 μg/day EE. EE-containing birth control pills have also been associated with a 25- to 50-fold increase in the risk of rare benign liver tumors and a 3- to 6-fold increase in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as greater risk of other liver complications. At one time, EE-containing birth control pills were estimated to be responsible for 84% of all drug-related and histologically verified liver damage. However, these risks now are reduced with modern lower-dose EE-containing birth control pills, with contain 35 μg/day EE or less. ==== Uterine cancer ==== The high doses of EE that were used in early COCs were associated with a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer in certain preparations, for instance those containing the progestogen dimethisterone. Unopposed estrogens like EE have carcinogenic effects in the endometrium and progestogens protect against these effects, but dimethisterone is a relatively weak progestogen and was unable to adequately antagonize the endometrial carcinogenic effects of EE, in turn resulting in the increased risk of endometrial cancer. COCs containing dimethisterone have since been discontinued (with more potent progestogens used instead) and doses of EE in COCs in general have been dramatically reduced, abrogating the risk. In turn, most studies of modern COCs have found a decreased risk of endometrial cancer. === Ecological Effects === Wastewater contains various estrogens, including EE, that are not completely broken down by wastewater treatment procedures. The input of artificial estrogens into freshwater ecosystems affects fish and amphibian populations. Chronic exposure to low levels of EE over seven years led to the collapse of fathead minnow populations in an experimental lake in Ontario, Canada. EE changed oogenesis in female fish and feminized male fish such that they produced a protein associated with egg maturation, vitellogenin, as well as early-stage eggs. In amphibians, exposure to EE can reduce hatching success and alter gonadal development. Exposure to hormones can change frogs' gonadal development even though it is encoded in their genes. A study of mink frogs found more intersex tadpoles in those experimentally exposed to EE than those not exposed to EE, and green frogs showed much lower rates of hatching success. == Overdose == Estrogens like EE are relatively safe in acute overdose. == Interactions == EE is metabolized by certain cytochrome P450 isoforms, including CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Thus, inducers of enzymes such as CYP3A4 can decrease circulating concentrations of EE. Examples of inducers include anticonvulsants like phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine; azole antifungals like fluconazole; and rifamycin antibiotics like rifampin (rifampicin). Conversely, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes may increase circulating levels of EE. An example is troleandomycin, which is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of CYP3A4. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been found to competitively inhibit the sulfation of EE, with pretreatment of 1,000 mg of paracetamol significantly increasing the AUC levels of EE (by 22%) and decreasing the AUC levels of ethinylestradiol sulfate (EE sulfate) in women. The same has been found for ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and EE, although the significance of the interaction has been regarded as dubious. In contrast to estradiol, it is unlikely that there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between smoking (which potently induces certain cytochrome P450 enzymes and markedly increases the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol) and EE. This suggests that estradiol and EE are metabolized by different cytochrome P450 enzymes. There is, however, an increased risk of cardiovascular complications with smoking and EE, similarly to the case of smoking and other estrogens. EE is known to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, and is possibly an inducer of CYP2A6. As a result, it can affect the metabolism and concentrations of many other drugs. Examples of known interactions include bupropion, caffeine, mephenytoin, midazolam, nicotine, nifedipine, omeprazole, propranolol, proguanil, selegiline, theophylline, and tizanidine. One of the most notable interactions is that EE strongly increases levels of selegiline, a substrate of CYP2B6 and CYP2C19. EE may also induce glucuronidation and possibly alter sulfation. It has been found to increase the clearance of and reduce the concentrations of a variety of drugs known to be glucuronidated. Examples include clofibrate, lamotrigine, lorazepam, oxazepam, and propranolol. Progestins, which are often used in combination with EE, are also known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, and this may contribute to drug interactions with EE-containing contraceptives as well. Examples include gestodene, desogestrel, and etonogestrel, which are CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors. In addition, these progestins are known to progressively inhibit the metabolism of and increase concentrations of EE itself. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === EE is an estrogen similarly to natural estrogens like estradiol and conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and synthetic estrogens like diethylstilbestrol. It binds to and activates both isoforms of the estrogen receptor, ERα and ERβ. In one study, EE was found to have 233% and 38% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. In another study, it was found to possess 194% and 151% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. EE also appears to act as a potent agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (affinity unknown), a membrane estrogen receptor, similarly to estradiol. Estrogens have antigonadotropic effects through activation of the ERα. As a contraceptive, EE acts in concert with a progestin to inhibit the mid-cycle surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) via its antigonadotropic effects, thereby inhibiting folliculogenesis and preventing ovulation and hence the possibility of pregnancy. EE is a long-acting estrogen, with a nuclear retention of about 24 hours. Orally, EE is on the order of 100 times as potent by weight as natural estrogens like micronized estradiol and conjugated estrogens, which is largely due to substantially greater resistance to first-pass metabolism. It is specifically in the range of 80 to 200 times as potent as estropipate (piperazine estrone sulfate), which has similar potency to micronized estradiol, in terms of systemic estrogenic potency. In contrast, the potencies of EE and natural estrogens are similar when they are administered intravenously, due to the bypassing of first-pass metabolism. Relative to its prodrug mestranol, EE is about 1.7 times as potent by weight orally. ==== Antiandrogenic and antigonadotropic effects ==== EE is a potent functional antiandrogen in both women and men. It mediates its antiandrogenic effects by 1) stimulating the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver, which decreases free and thus bioactive concentrations of testosterone in the blood; and by 2) suppressing luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion from the pituitary gland, which decreases production of testosterone by the gonads. Birth control pills that contain EE are useful in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like acne and hirsutism by virtue of their antiandrogenic effects. Birth control pills containing EE have been found in women to reduce total testosterone levels by 30% on average, to increase circulating SHBG levels by about 3-fold on average (but variable depending on progestin, range 1.5- to 5-fold increase), and to reduce free testosterone concentrations by 60% on average (range 40 to 80%). Birth control pills containing high doses of EE can increase SHBG levels in women by as much as 5- to 10-fold. This is similar to the 5- to 10-fold increase in SHBG levels that occurs during pregnancy. Due to the marked increase in SHBG levels, free testosterone levels become very low during treatment with EE-containing birth control pills. In men, a study found that treatment with a relatively low dosage of 20 μg/day EE for five weeks increased circulating SHBG levels by 150% and, due to the accompanying decrease in free testosterone levels, increased total circulating levels of testosterone by 50% (via upregulation of gonadal testosterone production due to reduced negative feedback by androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis). The stimulation of hepatic SHBG production by EE is far stronger than with other estrogens like estradiol, owing to the high resistance of EE to inactivation in the liver and hence its disproportionate effects in this part of the body. Estrogens are antigonadotropins and are able to suppress the secretion of LH and FSH from the pituitary gland and by extension gonadal testosterone production. High-dose estrogen therapy, including with EE, is able to suppress testosterone levels in men by around 95%, or into the castrate/female range. The dosage of EE required for use as a component of hormone therapy for preoperative transgender women is 50 to 100 μg/day. This high dosage is associated with a high incidence of VTE, particularly in those over the age of 40 years, and it has been said that it should not be used. The dosage of EE used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men is 150 to 1,000 μg/day (0.15–1.0 mg/day). A dosage of EE of 50 μg twice daily (100 μg/day total) has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men to an equivalent extent as 3 mg/day oral diethylstilbestrol, which is the minimum dosage of diethylstilbestrol required to consistently suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range. The ovulation-inhibiting dose of EE by itself and not in combination with a progestin in women is 100 μg/day. However, it has been found to be about 75 to 90% effective at inhibiting ovulation at a dosage of 20 μg/day and about 97 or 98% effective at a dosage of 50 μg/day. In another study, ovulation occurred in 25.2% with an EE dose of 50 μg/day. Lower dosages of EE also have significant antigonadotropic effects. A ""very low"" dosage of 15 μg/day EE has been described as the ""borderline"" amount required for suppression of LH and testosterone levels in men, and a study found that LH and testosterone levels were ""reliably"" suppressed in men by a dosage of 30 μg/day EE. However, other clinical studies have found that 20 μg/day EE increased testosterone levels by 50% in men (as described above) and that dosages of 32 μg/day and 42 μg/day EE suppressed FSH levels in men but did not significantly affect LH levels. A stronger suppression of testosterone levels was observed in men following daily treatment with a combined oral contraceptive containing 50 μg ethinylestradiol and 0.5 mg norgestrel for 9 days. However, investigation revealed that the progestin was the more important component responsible for the suppression in testosterone levels. In accordance, the progestin component of COCs is primarily responsible for inhibition of ovulation in women. A combination of 20 μg/day EE and 10 mg/day methyltestosterone was found to suppress FSH secretion in men to an extent sufficient to stop spermatogenesis. Studies in women have found that 50 μg/day EE suppresses LH and FSH levels both by about 70% in postmenopausal women. In addition to its antigonadotropic effects, EE can significantly suppress androgen production by the adrenal glands at high concentrations. One study found that treatment with a high dosage of 100 μg/day EE suppressed circulating adrenal androgen levels by 27 to 48% in transgender women. This may additionally contribute to suppression of androgen levels by estrogens. ==== Effects on liver protein synthesis ==== EE has marked effects on liver protein synthesis, even at low dosages and regardless of route of administration. These effects are mediated by its estrogenic activity. The medication dose-dependently increases circulating levels of SHBG, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), and also affects a broad range of other liver proteins. EE affects triglyceride levels at a dose as low as 1 μg/day and LDL and HDL cholesterol levels at a dose as low as 2.5 μg/day. EE affects several hepatic proteins at a dosage as low as 5 μg/day. At doses above 20 μg/day, the incremental effects of EE on liver protein synthesis become continuously smaller. EE at 5 μg/day has been found to increase SHBG levels by 100% in postmenopausal women, while a dosage of 20 μg/day EE increased them by 200%. Androgens decrease hepatic SHBG production, and have been found to oppose the effects of EE on SHBG levels. This is of particular relevance when it is considered that many progestins used in COCs have varying degrees of weak androgenic activity. A combination of 20 μg/day EE and 0.25 mg/day levonorgestrel, a progestin with relatively high androgenicity, decreases SHBG levels by 50%; 30 μg/day EE and 0.25 mg/day levonorgestrel has no effect on SHBG levels; 30 μg/day EE and 0.15 mg/day levonorgestrel increases SHBG levels by 30%; and triphasic COCs containing EE and levonorgestrel increase SHBG levels by 100 to 150%. The combination of 30 μg/day EE and 150 μg/day desogestrel, a progestin with relatively weak androgenicity than levonorgestrel, increases SHBG levels by 200%, while the combination of 35 μg/day EE and 2 mg/day cyproterone acetate, a progestin with potent antiandrogenic activity, increases SHBG levels by 400%. As such, the type and dosage of progestin contained in COCs potently moderates the effects of EE on SHBG levels. A dosage of 10 μg/day EE has been found to increase CBG levels by 50%, while a dosage of 20 μg/day EE increased them by 100%. Progestins that are progesterone derivatives have no effect on CBG levels, while androgenic progestins like the 19-nortestosterone derivatives have only a weak effect on CBG levels. COCs may increase CBG levels by 100 to 150%. A dosage of 5 μg/day EE has been found to increase TBG levels by 40%, while a dosage of 20 μg/day EE increased them by 60%. Progestins that are progesterone derivatives do not affect TBG levels, while progestins with androgenic activity may decrease TBG levels. A combination of 30 μg/day EE and 1 mg/day norethisterone, a moderately androgenic progestin, have been found to increase TBG levels by 50 to 70%, while the combination of 30 μg/day EE and 150 μg/day desogestrel increased them by 100%. ==== Differences from estradiol ==== EE shows strong and disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis relative to estradiol. The liver as well as the uterus express 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), and this enzyme serves to inactivate estradiol and effectively suppress its potency in these tissues by reversibly converting it into the far less potent estrogen estrone (which has approximately 4% of the estrogenic activity of estradiol). In contrast to estradiol, the 17α-ethynyl group of EE prevents oxidation of the C17β position of EE by 17β-HSD, and for this reason, EE is not inactivated in these tissues and has much stronger relative estrogenic activity in them. This is the mechanism of the disproportionately strong effects of EE on hepatic protein production, which results in a greatly increased magnitude of effect on VTE and cardiovascular risks relative to estradiol. On the other hand, due to the loss of inactivation of EE by 17β-HSD in the endometrium (uterus), EE is relatively more active than estradiol in the endometrium and, for this reason, is associated with a significantly lower incidence of vaginal bleeding and spotting in comparison. This is particularly so in the case of combined estrogen and progestogen therapy (as in COCs or menopausal HRT), as progestogens induce the expression of 17β-HSD in the endometrium. The reduced vaginal bleeding and spotting with EE is one of the main reasons that it is used in COCs instead of estradiol, in spite of its potentially inferior safety profile (related to its adverse effects on hepatic protein synthesis and VTE incidence). EE has been found to have disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis and VTE risk regardless of whether the route of administration is oral, transdermal, or vaginal, indicating that the use of parenteral routes over the oral route does not result in EE having proportional hepatic actions relative to non-hepatic actions. However, the potency of EE on liver protein synthesis is in any case reduced with parenteral administration. A dosage of 10 μg/day vaginal EE has been found to be equivalent to 50 μg oral EE in terms of effects on liver protein synthesis, such as stimulation of hepatic SHBG production. As such, parenteral EE, which bypasses the first pass through the liver that occurs with oral EE, has been found to have a 5-fold lower impact on liver protein synthesis by weight than oral EE. In contrast to EE as well as to oral estradiol, transdermal estradiol shows few or no effects on liver protein synthesis at typical menopausal dosages. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of EE is 45% on average, with a wide range of 20% to 74% (though most commonly between 38 and 48%) that is due to high interindividual variability. Although relatively low, the oral bioavailability of EE is considerably higher than that of micronized estradiol (5%). Following a single 20 μg dose of EE in combination with 2 mg norethisterone acetate in postmenopausal women, EE concentrations have been found to reach a maximum of 50 pg/mL within an average of 1.5 hours. Following the first dose, mean levels of EE in general further increase by about 50% until steady-state concentrations are reached; steady-state is reached after one week of daily administration. For comparison, the mean peak levels of estradiol achieved with 2 mg micronized estradiol or estradiol valerate are 40 pg/mL following the first dose and 80 pg/mL after three weeks of administration. These maximal concentrations of estradiol are in the same range as the concentrations of EE that are produced by an oral dose of EE that is 100 times lower by weight, which is in accordance with the approximately 100-fold increased oral potency of EE relative to estradiol. In accordance with the high interindividual variability in the oral bioavailability of EE, there is a large degree of interindividual variation in EE levels. A dosage of EE of 50 μg/day has been found to achieve a wide range of circulating EE levels of about 100 to 2,000 pg/mL. Taking EE in combination with a high-fat meal has been found to significantly decrease its peak concentrations. EE levels after a single 50 μg dose by intravenous injection are several times higher than levels of EE after a single 50 mg dose given orally. Besides the difference in levels, the course of elimination is similar for the two routes. There may be gender-specific differences in the pharmacokinetics of EE, such that EE may have greater oral potency in women than in men. A study found that a combination of 60 μg/day EE and 0.25 mg/day levonorgestrel in women and men resulted in peak levels of EE of 495 pg/mL and 251 pg/mL, area-under-the-curve levels of EE of 6.216 pg/mL/hour and 2.850 pg/mL/hour, and elimination half-lives of 16.5 hours and 10.2 hours, respectively. It has been suggested that this phenomenon could represent a ""protection mechanism"" of males against environmental estrogen exposure. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of EE is 97 to 98%, and it is bound almost exclusively to albumin. Unlike estradiol, which binds with high affinity to SHBG, EE has very low affinity for this protein, about 2% of that of estradiol, and hence does not bind to it importantly. ==== Metabolism ==== Due to high first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver, only 1% of an oral dose of an EE appears in the circulation as EE itself. During first-pass metabolism, EE is extensively conjugated via glucuronidation and sulfation into the hormonally inert ethinylestradiol glucuronides and ethinylestradiol sulfate (EE sulfate), and levels of EE sulfate in circulation are between 6- and 22-fold higher than those of EE. For comparison, with oral administration of 2 mg micronized estradiol, levels of estrone and estrone sulfate are 4- to 6-fold and 200-fold higher than those of estradiol, respectively. In contrast to estradiol, EE, due to steric hindrance by its C17α ethynyl group, is not metabolized or inactivated by 17β-HSD, and this is the primary factor responsible for the dramatically increased potency of oral EE relative to oral estradiol. EE is also not metabolized into estradiol. Aside from sulfate conjugation, EE is mainly metabolized by hydroxylation into catechol estrogens. This is mainly by 2-hydroxylation into 2-hydroxy-EE, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4. Hydroxylation of EE at the C4, C6α, and C16β positions into 4-, 6α-, and 16β-hydroxy-EE has also been reported, but appears to contribute to its metabolism to only a small extent. 2- and 4-methoxy-EE are also formed via transformation by catechol O-methyltransferase of 2- and 4-hydroxy-EE. Unlike the case of estradiol, 16α-hydroxylation does not occur with EE, owing to steric hindrance by its ethynyl group at C17α. The ethynylation of EE is largely irreversible, and so EE is not metabolized into estradiol, unlike estradiol esters. A review found that the range of the reported elimination half-life of EE in the literature was 13.1 to 27.0 hours. Another review reported an elimination half-life of EE of 10 to 20 hours. However, the elimination half-life of EE has also been reported by other sources to be as short as 7 hours and as long as 36 hours. Unlike the case of estradiol, in which there is a rapid rise in its levels and which remain elevated in a plateau-like curve for many hours, levels of EE fall rapidly after peaking. This is thought to be because estrone and estrone sulfate can be reversibly converted back into estradiol and serve as a hormonally inert reservoir for estradiol, whereas the EE sulfate reservoir for EE is much smaller in comparison. In any case, due to the formation of EE sulfate, enterohepatic recirculation is involved in the pharmacokinetics of EE similarly to estradiol, although to a lesser extent. The contribution of enterohepatic recirculation to total circulating EE levels appears to be 12 to 20% or less, and is not observed consistently. A secondary peak in EE levels 10 to 14 hours after administration can often be observed with oral EE. EE, following oxidative formation of a very reactive metabolite, irreversibly inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in its metabolism, and this may also play a role in the increased potency of EE relative to estradiol. Indeed, EE is said to have a marked effect on hepatic metabolism, and this is one of the reasons, among others, that natural estrogens like estradiol may be preferable. A 2-fold accumulation in EE levels with an EE-containing COC has been observed following 1 year of therapy. ==== Elimination ==== EE is eliminated 62% in the feces and 38% in the urine. == Chemistry == EE, also known as 17α-ethynylestradiol or as 17α-ethynylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol with an ethynyl substitution at the C17α position. The 17α-ethynylation of estradiol to create EE is analogous to the 17α-substitution of testosterone to make testosterone derivatives such as 17α-ethynylated progestins like ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) as well as 17α-alkylated androgens/anabolic steroids like methyltestosterone (17α-methyltestosterone). === Analogues === A number of derivatives of EE exist. These include mestranol (EE 3-methyl ether), quinestrol (EE 3-cyclopentyl ether), ethinylestradiol sulfonate (EE 3-isopropylsulfonate), and moxestrol (11β-methoxy-EE). The former three are prodrugs of EE, while the latter one is not. A few analogues of EE with other substitutions at the C17α position exist. Examples include the estradiol derivatives methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol) and ethylestradiol (17α-ethylestradiol), and the estriol derivatives ethinylestriol (17α-ethynylestriol) and nilestriol (17α-ethynylestriol 3-cyclopentyl ether). Androstane analogues of EE with significant although weak estrogenic activity include ethinylandrostenediol (17α-ethynyl-5-androstenediol), 17α-ethynyl-3β-androstanediol, 17α-ethynyl-3α-androstanediol, and methandriol (17α-methyl-5-androstenediol). == History == EE was the first orally active synthetic estrogen and was described in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg of Schering AG in Berlin. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 1943, and marketed by Schering under the brand name Estinyl. The FDA withdrew approval of Estinyl effective 4 June 2004 at the request of Schering, which had discontinued marketing it. EE was never introduced for use by intramuscular injection. EE was first used in COCs, as an alternative to mestranol, in 1964, and shortly thereafter superseded mestranol in COCs. Early COCs contained 40 to 100 μg/day EE and 50 to 150 μg/day mestranol. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Ethinylestradiol is the English generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It has also been spelled as ethynylestradiol, ethynyloestradiol, and ethinyloestradiol (all having the same pronunciation), and the latter was formerly its BANTooltip British Approved Name but was eventually changed. In addition, a space is often included in the name of EE such that it is written as ethinyl estradiol (as well as variations thereof), and this is its USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia name. The generic name of EE in French and its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française are éthinylestradiol, in Spanish is etinilestradiol, in Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are etinilestradiolo, and in Latin is ethinylestradiolum. The name of the drug is often abbreviated as EE or as EE2 in the medical literature. === Brand names === EE has been marketed as a standalone oral drug under the brand names Esteed, Estinyl, Feminone, Lynoral, Menolyn, Novestrol, Palonyl, Spanestrin, and Ylestrol among others, although most or all of these formulations are now discontinued. It is marketed under a very large number of brand names throughout the world in combination with progestins for use as an oral contraceptive. In addition, EE is marketed in the U.S. in combination with norelgestromin under the brand names Ortho Evra and Xulane as a contraceptive patch, in combination with etonogestrel under the brand name NuvaRing as a contraceptive vaginal ring, and in combination with norethisterone acetate under the brand name FemHRT in oral hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. === Availability === Ethinylestradiol is marketed throughout the world. It is marketed exclusively or almost exclusively in combination with progestins. Combination medications with additional hormones are common medications in the US. == References == == Further reading ==",Ginestrene,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.12698008120059967)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3159177303314209), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0620945543050766)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.5491004129871726e-05)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/ginestrene,https://www.catalog.md/drugs/ginestrene.html,https://www.invivochem.com/ethinyl-estradiol.html ', [])"
1153,"('Exemestane', 'Aromasin', 'Exemestano', 'Exemestanum', 'Exemestanum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Exemestane, sold under the brand name Aromasin among others, is a medication used to treat breast cancer. It is a member of the class of antiestrogens known as aromatase inhibitors. Some breast cancers require estrogen to grow. Those cancers have estrogen receptors (ERs), and are called ER-positive. They may also be called estrogen-responsive, hormonally-responsive, or hormone-receptor-positive. Aromatase is an enzyme that synthesizes estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors block the synthesis of estrogen. This lowers the estrogen level, and slows the growth of cancers. == Medical uses == Exemestane is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to it for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy. US FDA approval was in October 1999. Exemestane is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. For premenopausal women with hormone-receptor–positive breast cancer, adjuvant treatment with ovarian suppression plus the aromatase inhibitor exemestane, as compared with ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen, provides a new treatment option that reduces the risk of recurrence. The TEXT and SOFT trials demonstrated improved disease free survival in patients treated with exemestane and ovarian suppression compared to the tamoxifen and ovarian suppression group. Premenopausal women who receive ovarian suppression may now benefit from an aromatase inhibitor, a class of drugs that until now has been recommended only for postmenopausal women. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in premenopausal women, which of course includes pregnant and lactating women. == Side effects == The most common side effects (more than 10% of patients) are hot flashes and sweating, which are typical of estrogen deficiency as caused by exemestane, and also insomnia, headache, and joint pain. Nausea and fatigue are mainly observed in patients with advanced breast cancer. An occasional decrease in lymphocytes has been observed in approximately 20% of patients receiving Aromasin, particularly in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia. Exemestane has androgenic properties similarly to formestane and can produce androgenic side effects such as acne and weight gain, although these are generally associated with supratherapeutic dosages of the drug. == Overdose == Single doses of up to at least 32-fold (800 mg), as well as continuous therapy with 24-fold (600 mg) the usual daily dose are well tolerated. No life-threatening overdosing is known in humans, but only in animal studies with 2000- to 4000-fold doses (adjusted to body surface area). == Interactions == Exemestane is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. While the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had no significant effect on exemestane levels in a clinical trial, the strong CYP3A4 inductor rifampicin significantly cut exemenstane levels about in half (AUC −54%, Cmax −41% for a single dose), potentially compromising its effectiveness. Other 3A4 inductors such as carbamazepine and St John's Wort are expected to have similar effects. The clinical relevance of this effect has not been investigated. Estrogens probably reduce exemestane effectiveness: It would usually be counter-productive to reduce the body's estrogen synthesis with exemestane and then substitute estrogen with pharmaceuticals. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Exemestane is an oral steroidal aromatase inhibitor that is used in ER-positive breast cancer in addition to surgery and/or radiation in post-menopausal women. The main source of estrogen is the ovaries in premenopausal women, while in post-menopausal women most of the body's estrogen is produced via the conversion of androgens into estrogen by the aromatase enzyme in the peripheral tissues (i.e. adipose tissue like that of the breast) and a number of sites in the brain. Estrogen is produced locally via the actions of the aromatase enzyme in these peripheral tissues where it acts locally. Any circulating estrogen in post-menopausal women as well as men is the result of estrogen escaping local metabolism and entering the circulatory system. Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator of type I, structurally related to the natural substrate 4-androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an effect also known as ""suicide inhibition."" By being structurally similar to enzyme targets, exemestane permanently binds to the enzymes, preventing them from converting androgen into estrogen. Type II aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and letrozole, by contrast, are not steroids and work by interfering with the aromatase's heme. A study conducted on young adult males found that the estrogen suppression rate for exemestane varied from 35% for estradiol (E2) to 70% for estrone (E1). === Pharmacokinetics === Exemestane is quickly absorbed from the gut, but undergoes a strong first-pass effect in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after 1.2 hours in breast cancer patients and after 2.9 hours in healthy subjects. Maximal aromatase inhibition occurs after two to three days. 90% of the absorbed substance are bound to plasma proteins. The liver enzyme CYP3A4 oxidizes the methylidene group in position 6, and the 17-keto group (on the five-membered ring) is reduced by aldo-keto reductases to an alcohol. Of the resulting metabolites, 40% are excreted via the urine and 40% via the feces within a week. The original substance accounts for only 1% of excretion in the urine. The terminal half-life is 24 hours. == Chemistry == Exemestane is known chemically as 6-methylideneandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Like the aromatase inhibitors formestane and atamestane, exemestane is a steroid that is structurally similar to 4-androstenedione, the natural substrate of aromatase. It is distinguished from the natural substance only by the methylidene group in position 6 and an additional double bond in position 1. Pure exemestane is a white to off-white powder that is soluble in DMSO to at least 20 mg/mL. Optical rotation [α]D is +250 to 300° (per g/100 cm3 and decimetre at 589 nm wavelength). == Society and culture == === Performance enhancement === Exemestane has been used in doping to raise luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, which in turn increases the ratio of male over female sexual hormones and so improves performance. The drug also counteracts gynecomastia as well as fat and water retention following excessive aromatase production due to testosterone doping. It is also used by steroid users to lower female sexual horomone levels following a cycle of steroids, often called a ""post-cycle therapy"", it is also used alongside Selective estrogen receptor modulators in this. Rarely, it is used recreationally by teenagers to delay epiphyseal plate closure and increase adult height, particularly among members of the Looksmaxxing and incel communities, where its use is documented on their forums. However, its effectiveness for this purpose is debatable. Along with other aromatase inhibitors, exemestane is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances. == Research == Oral exemestane 25 mg/day for 2–3 years of adjuvant therapy was generally more effective than 5 years of continuous adjuvant tamoxifen in the treatment of postmenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive/unknown receptor status breast in a large well-designed trial. Preliminary data from the open-label TEAM trial comparing exemestane with tamoxifen indicated in 2009 that exemestane 25 mg/day is also effective in the primary adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Interim phase III trial results in 2011 showed that adding everolimus to exemestane therapy against advanced breast cancer can significantly improve progression-free survival compared with exemestane therapy alone. A Phase III trial was reported in 2011, concluding that the use of exemestane in postmenopausal women at an increased risk for breast cancer reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer. In 4,560 women, after 35 months, the administration of exemestane at a dose of 25 mg/day resulted in a 65% reduction in the risk of breast cancer compared with placebo; annual incidence rates were 0.19% and 0.55%, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.35; 95% CI [0.18-0.70]; p = 0.002). == References == == External links == Aromasin official website Aromasin prescribing information",Aromasin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.0861407392658293e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011800715001299977)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/aromasin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=77, start_index=9, title='Aromasin: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/aromasin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1155,"('Tropicamide', 'Ro 1-7683', 'Mydriacyl', 'Mydriaticum', 'Bistropamide')",Medical,"Tropicamide, sold under the brand name Mydriacyl among others, is a medication used to dilate the pupil and help with examination of the eye. Specifically it is used to help examine the back of the eye. It is applied as eye drops. Effects occur within 40 minutes and last for up to a day. Common side effects include blurry vision, increased intraocular pressure, and sensitivity to light. Another rare but severe side effect is psychosis, particularly in children. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the fetus. Tropicamide is in the antimuscarinic part of the anticholinergic family of medications. It works by making the muscles within the eye unable to respond to nerve signals. Tropicamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical use == Tropicamide is an antimuscarinic drug that produces short acting mydriasis (dilation of the pupil) and cycloplegia when applied as eye drops. It is used to allow better examination of the lens, vitreous humor, and retina. Due to its relatively short duration of effect (4–8 hours), it is typically used during eye examinations such as the dilated fundus examination, but it may also be used before or after eye surgery. Cycloplegic drops are often also used to treat anterior uveitis, decreasing risk of posterior synechiae and decreasing inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye. Tropicamide is occasionally administered in combination with p-hydroxyamphetamine (brand name Paremyd), which is a sympathomimetic. The use of the sympathomimetic drug causes the iris dilator muscle to be directly stimulated, causing increased dilation. In the United States, the sympathomimetic drop most commonly used along with tropicamide, is 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (brand name AK-Dilate). == Side effects == Tropicamide induces transient stinging and a slight and transient rise in intraocular pressure in the majority of patients. It may cause redness or conjunctivitis (inflammation) and also blurs near vision for a short while after instillation (care must be taken, and the patient must only drive when vision returns to normal). Tropicamide may, in very rare cases, cause an attack of acute angle-closure glaucoma. This tends to be in patients with narrow anterior chamber angles, and closure risk must be assessed by the practitioner prior to instillation. Tropicamide is often preferred to atropine because atropine has a longer half-life, causing prolonged dilation and blurry vision for up to a week. Atropine has less sting effect, but can be toxic or fatal if ingested in large quantities by children or adults. With eye drops, systemic effects are minimal to nonexistent due to very low absorption into the bloodstream. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tropicamide is an anticholinergic. It is specifically an antimuscarinic, acting as a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M4 receptor antagonist. However, it has also been reported to be a non-selective antagonist of all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. As with other antimuscarinics, tropicamide can produce deliriant effects. == Recreational use == Tropicamide is sometimes abused (injected intravenously e.g. by insulin syringe) as an inexpensive recreational deliriant drug (along with naphazoline).

1156,"('Bergapten', 'Bergaptene', 'Heraclin', 'Majudin', 'Psoraderm')","Food, Medical","Bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen) is a naturally-occurring organic chemical compound produced by numerous plant species, especially from the carrot family Apiaceae and the citrus family Rutaceae. For example, bergapten has been extracted from 24 species of the genus Heracleum in the family Apiaceae. In the family Rutaceae, various Citrus species contain significant amounts of bergapten, especially the bergamot orange, the micrantha, and certain varieties of lime and bitter orange. Bergapten belongs to a class of chemical compounds known as the furanocoumarins. In 1834, Kalbrunner isolated 5-methoxypsoralen from bergamot essential oil, hence the common name ""bergapten"". It was the first furanocoumarin to be isolated and identified. == Toxicity == Bergapten is a derivative of psoralen, the parent compound of a family of naturally-occurring organic compounds known as the linear furanocoumarins (so called since they exhibit a linear chemical structure). Some of the linear furanocoumarins, including bergapten, act as strong photosensitizers when applied topically to the skin. Bergapten is often found in plants associated with phytophotodermatitis, a potentially serious skin inflammation. Contact with plant parts containing bergapten (and other linear furanocoumarins) followed by exposure to ultraviolet light may lead to phytophotodermatitis. In particular, bergapten appears to be the primary phototoxic compound responsible for Citrus-induced phytophotodermatitis. Bergapten and other linear furanocoumarins induce a loss of template activity for RNA synthesis. 5-methoxypsoralen has also been noted for its mutagenic effects as well as its capacity for being a very potent agent for inducing chromosome aberrations. With a high enough concentration, complete mitotic inhibition was observed. There is sufficient evidence that bergapten promotes cancer in animals but such evidence of carcinogenicity in humans is lacking. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, bergapten is probably carcinogenic to humans. == Medical usages == Bergapten serves to have the skin absorb more light, and pigmentary diseases like vitiligo (leukodermia) and psoriasis have treatments involving furanocoumarins often in conjunction with sun exposure or solar radiation. In people who easily sunburn, furanocoumarins can also increase the tolerance of skin to solar radiation. Bergapten was shown to elicit certain skin reactions in order to even out pigmentation lightening for vitiligo patients depending on various factors like the susceptibility of the subject, the dosage, and the humidity, but the effects may be inconsistent. With psoriasis, bergapten has been valued as an oral photochemotherapy treatment for its efficacy and lack of phototoxic and drug-insensitive reactions. It operates as a photosensitizing drug that is as effective or, with high enough dosage, more effective than 8-methoxypsoralen in the clearance of psoriasis lesions. It has been shown to be a valuable alternative to 8-methoxypsoralen due to the relative lack of side effects during treatment like erythma, pruritus, and nausea. Bergapten has also been implicated as a potential prevention method for sunlight-related skin cancer. One study found that a tan gained with bergapten had less DNA damage in human subjects. Bergapten has been shown to have anti-tumoral effects, like its ability to induce the autophagic process in breast cancer cells. One study suggested that this was possible through the up-regulation of PTEN gene expression in those breast cancer cells. Bergapten, alongside other furanocoumarins, has also been implicated in Cytochrome P450 inhibition. == Synthesis == Bergapten is a natural compound coming from plants like the common fig, but it can also be synthesized. Most syntheses of linear furanocoumarins involve starting with a central aromatic unit and adding two heterocyclic rings. Alternate routes of synthesis are desirable to avoid regiochemical problems and moderate yields. The synthesis described here involves Iodine as a removable group to insure regiochemical integrity and convergence. As shown in the diagram, phloroglucinol (compound 1) was the starting material. Mono-methylation was conducted followed by a reaction with ethyl propiolate in the presence of ZnCl2 to yield 7-hydroxy-5-methoxycoumarin (product 3, not shown) with 68% yield. The 8-position of 7-hydroxy-5-methoxycoumarin was then protected by iodine to avoid the formation of an angular furanocoumarin. Product 4 in the diagram is the result of that iodine protection. Product 5 was the result of the allylation of product 4. Osmium tetraoxide and sodium metaperiodate were used to oxidatively cleave the O-allyl derivative onto the aldehyde product 7 via a diol intermediate (product 6, not shown). Cyclization of the aldehyde product 7 using BF3-Et2O in tetra-n-butylammonium bromide was then conducted to construct the furan ring. The final step was to remove the iodine protective group via Pd(OAc)2 to ultimately produce bergapten (product 9) with 90% yield. Synthetic bergapten was isolated as a colorless compound with properties spectroscopically identical to the natural product. A known use of bergapten is in the synthesis of Fraxinol. The key reaction in this synthesis is the oxidation of the furan ring of visnagin and bergapten with chromic acid. == References ==",Bergaptene,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.012752845883369446), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.16142961382865906), (',', -0.10026124119758606), (' PERSONAL', -0.04326373711228371), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.4511373043060303), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00025459862081333995), ('ĠMED', -0.11354377865791321), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38700178265571594)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.03804171830415726), (' INDUSTR', -0.38700973987579346), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is a derivative of hydroquinone, substituted with a tert-butyl group. == Applications == === Food preservative === In foods, TBHQ is used as an antioxidant preservative for unsaturated vegetable oils and many edible animal fats. It does not cause discoloration even in the presence of iron, and does not change flavor or odor of the material to which it is added. It can be combined with other preservatives such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). As a food additive, its E number is E319. It is added to a wide range of foods. Its primary advantage is extending storage life. === Other === In perfumery, it is used as a fixative to lower the evaporation rate and improve stability. It is used industrially as a stabilizer to inhibit autopolymerization of organic peroxides. It is used as an antioxidant in biodiesel. It is also added to varnishes, lacquers, resins, and oil-field additives. == Safety and regulation == The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have evaluated TBHQ and determined that it is safe to consume at the concentration allowed in foods. The FDA and European Union both set an upper limit of 0.02% (200mg/kg) of the oil or fat content in foods. It has not been approved in Japan, hence import of food containing TBHQ for selling is not allowed in Japan as of 2007. At very high doses, it has some negative health effects on lab animals, such as producing precursors to stomach tumors and damage to DNA. A number of studies have shown that prolonged exposure to very high doses of TBHQ may be carcinogenic, especially for stomach tumors. Other studies, however, have shown opposite effects including inhibition against HCA-induced carcinogenesis (by depression of metabolic activation) for TBHQ and other phenolic antioxidants (TBHQ was one of several, and not the most potent) and reduction of nitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis (likely due to phase II enzyme induction via Nrf2). The EFSA considers TBHQ to be noncarcinogenic. A 1986 review of scientific literature concerning the toxicity of TBHQ determined that a wide margin of safety exists between the levels of intake by humans and the doses that produce adverse effects in animal studies. In addition, TBHQ has been identified by high-throughput screening as having potential immunotoxic effects in 2021. It was previously reported in 2014 that TBHQ enhances allergy response in mice by promoting Th2 cells through Nrf2. Experiments on its genotoxicity at high doses are inconsistent. Its oxidized form TBBQ may be responsible for some toxic effects. There exists a wide margin of safety between food-additive doses and doses used in studies.

1161,"('Sulpiride', 'Sulpyrid', 'Sulpirid', 'Aiglonyl', 'Dolmatil')",Medical,"Sulpiride, sold under the brand name Dogmatil among others, is an atypical antipsychotic (although some texts have referred to it as a typical antipsychotic) medication of the benzamide class which is used mainly in the treatment of psychosis associated with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, and is sometimes used in low dosage to treat anxiety and mild depression. The drug is chemically and clinically similar to amisulpride. Levosulpiride is its purified levo-isomer and is sold in some countries for similar purposes. Sulpiride is commonly used in Asia, Central America, Europe, South Africa and South America. It is not approved in the United States, Canada, or Australia. == Medical uses == === Schizophrenia === Sulpiride's primary use in medicine is in the management of the symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been used as both a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (in case of treatment-resistance) in schizophrenia. === Depression and anxiety === It has also been used in the treatment of dysthymia. There is evidence, although low quality, that sulpiride could accelerate antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder. In Japan, sulpiride is both approved as a treatment for schizophrenia and for major depressive disorder (low dose). There is also evidence of its efficacy in treating panic disorder. It was studied at low doses in the treatment of refractory panic disorder and was reported to be effective in a small open-label study. === Other uses === Sulpiride is indicated for the treatment of vertigo in some countries. == Contraindications == Contraindications Hypersensitivity to sulpiride Pre-existing breast cancer or other prolactin-dependent tumors Phaeochromocytoma Intoxication with other centrally-active drugs Concomitant use of levodopa Acute porphyria Comatose state or CNS depression Bone-marrow suppression Cautions Pre-existing Parkinson's disease Patients under 18 years of age (insufficient clinical data) Pre-existing severe heart disease/bradycardia, or hypokalemia (predisposing to long QT syndrome and severe arrhythmias) Patients with pre-existing epilepsy. Anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained Lithium use — increased risk of neurological side effects of both drugs === Pregnancy and lactation === Pregnancy: Animal studies did not reveal any embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity, nor did limited human experience. Due to insufficient human data, pregnant women should be treated with sulpiride only if strictly indicated. Additionally, the newborns of treated women should be monitored, because isolated cases of extrapyramidal side effects have been reported. Lactation: Sulpiride is found in the milk of lactating women. Since the consequences are unclear, women should not breastfeed during treatment. == Side effects == Sulpiride is usually well tolerated, producing few adverse effects. Their incidences are as follows: Common (>1%) adverse effects Dizziness Headache Extrapyramidal side effects - Tremor - Dystonia - Akathisia — a sense of inner restlessness that presents itself with the inability to stay still - Parkinsonism Somnolence (not a very prominent adverse effect considering its lack of α1 adrenergic, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor affinity) Insomnia Weight gain or loss Hyperprolactinemia (elevated plasma levels of the hormone, prolactin which can, in turn lead to sexual dysfunction, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, etc.) Nausea Vomiting Nasal congestion Anticholinergic adverse effects such as: - Dry mouth - Constipation - Blurred vision Impaired concentration Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects Tardive dyskinesia — a rare, often permanent movement disorder that, more often than not, results from prolonged treatment with antidopaminergic agents such as antipsychotics. It presents with slow (hence tardive), involuntary, repetitive and purposeless movements that most often affect the facial muscles. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome — a rare, life-threatening complication that results from the use of antidopaminergic agents. Its incidence increases with concomitant use of lithium (medication) salts Blood dyscrasias — rare, sometimes life-threatening complications of the use of a number of different antipsychotics (most notably clozapine) which involves abnormalities in the composition of a person's blood (e.g. having too few white blood cells per unit volume of blood). Examples include: - Agranulocytosis — a significant drop in white blood cell count, leaving individuals wide open to life-threatening opportunistic infections - Neutropenia - Leucopenia - Leukocytosis Seizures Torsades de pointes Unknown incidence adverse effects include QTc interval prolongation which can lead to potentially fatal arrhythmias. Cholestatic jaundice Elevated liver enzymes Primary biliary cirrhosis Allergic reactions Photosensitivity — sensitivity to light Skin rashes Depression Catatonia Palpitations Agitation Diaphoresis — sweating without a precipitating factor (e.g. increased ambient temperature) Hypotension — low blood pressure Hypertension — high blood pressure Venous thromboembolism (probably rare) == Overdose == Sulpiride has a relatively low order of acute toxicity. Substantial amounts may cause severe but reversible dystonic crises with torticollis, protrusion of the tongue, and/or trismus. In some cases all the classical symptoms typical of severe Parkinson's disease may be noted; in others, over-sedation/coma may occur. The treatment is largely symptomatic. Some or all extrapyramidal reactions may respond to the application of anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden or benzatropine. All patients should be closely monitored for signs of long QT syndrome and severe arrhythmias. == Interactions == Sulpiride neither inhibits nor stimulates cytochrome P450 family (CYP) of oxidizing enzymes in human, thus would not cause clinically significant interactions with other drugs, which are metabolized by CYPs. However, the risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when sulpiride is combined with other drugs, but this is not related to substrates, inducers and inhibitors of CYPs. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sulpiride is a selective antagonist at dopamine D2, D3 and to a lesser extent D4 receptors. Antagonism at 5-HT1A dominates in doses exceeding 600 mg daily. In doses of 600 to 1,600 mg sulpiride shows mild sedating and antipsychotic activity. Its antipsychotic potency compared to chlorpromazine is only 0.2 (1/5). In low doses (in particular 50 to 200 mg daily) its prominent feature is antagonism of presynaptic inhibitory dopamine and serotonin receptors, accounting for some antidepressant activity and a stimulating effect. Additionally, it alleviates vertigo. The benzamide neuroleptics (including sulpiride, amisulpride, and sultopride) have been shown to activate the endogenous gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptor in vivo at therapeutic concentrations. Sulpiride was found in one study in rats to upregulate GHB receptors. GHB has neuroleptic properties and it is believed binding to this receptor may contribute to the effects of these neuroleptics. Sulpiride, along with clozapine, and valproate has been found to activate DNA demethylation in the brain. == History == Sulpiride was discovered in 1966 as a result of a research program by Justin-Besançon and C. Laville at Laboratoires Delagrange who were working to improve the anti-dysrhythmic properties of procainamide; the program led first to metoclopramide and later to sulpiride. Laboratoires Delagrange was acquired by Synthelabo in 1991 which eventually became part of Sanofi. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Sulpiride is marketed under the brand names Dogmatil (DE, HK, SG, PH), Dolmatil (IE, UK, NL), Eglonyl (RU, ZA, HR, SI), Espiride (ZA), Modal (IL), Prometar (UY), Equilid (BR) and Sulpor (UK), among many others. === Medicinal forms === These include tablet and oral solution === Patient aversions === Some individuals from the Caribbean region may have an aversion to taking the medication due to the association with the brand name of Dogmatil. Dogmatil has been associated with dog medication. == Research == === Hormonal contraception === Sulpiride has been studied for use as a hormonal contraceptive in women in whom conventional oral contraceptives are contraindicated and to potentiate progestogen-only contraceptives. The contraceptive effects of sulpiride are due to its prolactin-releasing and antigonadotropic effects and the hyperprolactinemia–amenorrhea state that it induces. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Since the use of psychotropic drugs is efficient in treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), sulpiride is studied as potential sole maintenance therapy in the treatment of IBS. == References == == External links == Media related to Sulpiride at Wikimedia Commons",Dolmatil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007599088130518794), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001982629531994462)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulpiride?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Sulpiride', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulpiride?utm_source=openai')])"

It is also used to help with endotracheal intubation; however, agents such as suxamethonium (succinylcholine) or rocuronium are generally preferred if this needs to be done quickly. It is given by injection into a vein. Effects are greatest at about 4 minutes and last for up to an hour. Side effects may include low blood pressure and prolonged paralysis. Allergic reactions are rare. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Vecuronium is in the aminosteroid neuromuscular-blocker family of medications and is of the non-depolarizing type. It works by competitively blocking the action of acetylcholine on skeletal muscles. The effects may be reversed with sugammadex or a combination of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. To minimize residual blockade, reversal should only be attempted if some degree of spontaneous recovery has been achieved. Vecuronium was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984 and is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Mechanism of action == Vecuronium operates by competing for the cholinoceptors at the motor end plate, thereby exerting its muscle-relaxing properties, which are used adjunctively to general anesthesia. Under balanced anesthesia, the time to recovery to 25% of control (clinical duration) is approximately 25 to 40 minutes after injection and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 45 to 65 minutes after injection of an intubating dose. The neuromuscular blocking action of vecuronium is slightly enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics. If vecuronium is first administered more than 5 minutes after the start of the inhalation of enflurane, isoflurane, or halothane, or when a steady state has been achieved, the intubating dose of vecuronium may be decreased by approximately 15%. Vecuronium has an active metabolite, 3-desacetyl-vecuronium, that has 80% of the effect of vecuronium. Accumulation of this metabolite, which is cleared by the kidneys, can prolong the duration of action of the drug, particularly when an infusion is used in a person with kidney failure. Reversal of vecuronium can be accomplished by administration of sugammadex which is a γ-cyclodextrin which encapsulates vecuronium preventing it from binding to receptors. Reversal can also be accomplished with neostigmine or other cholinesterase inhibitors, but their efficacy is lower than that of sugammadex. == History == As long ago as 1862, adventurer Don Ramon Paez described a Venezuelan poison, guachamaca, which the indigenous peoples used to lace sardines as bait for herons and cranes. If the head and neck of a bird so killed was cut off, the remainder of the flesh could be eaten safely. Paez also described the attempt of a Llanero woman to murder a rival to her lover's affections with guachamaca and unintentionally killed 10 other people when her husband shared his food with their guests. It is probable that the plant was Malouetia nitida or Malouetia schomburgki. The genus Malouetia (family Apocynaceae) is found in both South America and Africa. The botanist Robert E. Woodson Jr comprehensively classified the American species of Malouetia in 1935. At that time, only one African species of Malouetia was recognized, but the following year Woodson described a second: Malouetia bequaertiana, from the Belgian Congo. In 1960, scientists reported the isolation of malouetine from the roots and bark of Malouetia bequaertiana Woodson by means of an ion exchange technique. Optimization of the aminosteroid nucleus led to a sequence of synthesized derivatives, ultimately leading to pancuronium bromide in 1964. The name was derived from p(iperidino)an(drostane)cur(arising)-onium. A paper published in 1973 discussed the structure-activity relationships of a series of aminosteroid muscle relaxants, including the mono-quaternary analogue of pancuronium, later called vecuronium. == Society and culture == Vecuronium bromide has been used as part of a drug cocktail that prisons in the United States use for execution by lethal injection. Vecuronium is used to paralyze the prisoner and stop his or her breathing, in conjunction with a sedative and potassium chloride to stop the prisoner's heart. Injections of vecuronium bromide without proper sedation allow the person to be fully awake but unable to move in response to pain. In 2001, Japanese nurse Daisuke Mori was reported to have murdered 10 patients using vecuronium bromide. He was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2022, Vanderbilt University Medical Center nurse RaDonda Vaught was convicted of two felony charges in the death of a patient who was mistakenly administered vecuronium bromide, rather than the sedative midazolam, also known as Versed. == References == == External links == ""Vecuronium Bromide"".

1163,"('Phenethylamine', 'Benzeneethanamine', 'Phenylethylamine', 'Beta-phenylethylamine', 'Beta-phenethylamine')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Phenethylamine (PEA) is an organic compound, natural monoamine alkaloid, and trace amine, which acts as a central nervous system stimulant in humans. In the brain, phenethylamine regulates monoamine neurotransmission by binding to trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in monoamine neurons. To a lesser extent, it also acts as a neurotransmitter in the human central nervous system. In mammals, phenethylamine is produced from the amino acid L-phenylalanine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase via enzymatic decarboxylation. In addition to its presence in mammals, phenethylamine is found in many other organisms and foods, such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation. Phenethylamine is sold as a dietary supplement for purported mood and weight loss-related therapeutic benefits; however, in orally ingested phenethylamine, a significant amount is metabolized in the small intestine by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and then aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which converts it to phenylacetic acid. This means that for significant concentrations to reach the brain, the dosage must be higher than for other methods of administration. Some authors have postulated that phenethylamine plays a role in affection without substantiating these claims with any direct evidence. Phenethylamines, or more properly, substituted phenethylamines, are the group of phenethylamine derivatives that contain phenethylamine as a ""backbone""; in other words, this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the phenethylamine core structure with substituents. The class of substituted phenethylamines includes all substituted amphetamines, and substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamines (MDxx), and contains many drugs which act as empathogens, stimulants, psychedelics, anorectics, bronchodilators, decongestants, and/or antidepressants, among others. == Natural occurrence == Phenethylamine is produced by a wide range of species throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, including humans; it is also produced by certain fungi and bacteria (genera: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Pseudomonas and the family Enterobacteriaceae) and acts as a potent antimicrobial against certain pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (e.g., the O157:H7 strain) at sufficient concentrations. == Chemistry == Phenethylamine is a primary amine, the amino-group being attached to a benzene ring through a two-carbon, or ethyl group. It is a colourless liquid at room temperature that has a fishy odor, and is soluble in water, ethanol and ether. Its density is 0.964 g/ml and its boiling point is 195 °C. Upon exposure to air, it combines with carbon dioxide to form a solid carbonate salt. Phenethylamine is strongly basic, pKb = 4.17 (or pKa = 9.83), as measured using the HCl salt, and forms a stable crystalline hydrochloride salt with a melting point of 217 °C. Its experimental log P is 1.41. === Substituted derivatives === Substituted phenethylamines are a chemical class of organic compounds based upon the phenethylamine structure; the class is composed of all the derivative compounds of phenethylamine which can be formed by replacing, or substituting, one or more hydrogen atoms in the phenethylamine core structure with substituents. Many substituted phenethylamines are psychoactive drugs, which belong to a variety of different drug classes, including central nervous system stimulants (e.g., amphetamine), hallucinogens (e.g., 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), entactogens (e.g., 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine), appetite suppressants (e.g. phentermine), nasal decongestants and bronchodilators (e.g., pseudoephedrine), antidepressants (e.g. bupropion), antiparkinson agents (e.g., selegiline), and vasopressors (e.g., ephedrine), among others. Many of these psychoactive compounds exert their pharmacological effects primarily by modulating monoamine neurotransmitter systems; however, there is no mechanism of action or biological target that is common to all members of this subclass. Numerous endogenous compounds—including hormones, monoamine neurotransmitters, and many trace amines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, adrenaline, tyramine, and others)—are substituted phenethylamines. Dopamine is simply phenethylamine with a hydroxyl group attached to the 3 and 4 position of the benzene ring. Several notable recreational drugs, such as MDMA (ecstasy), methamphetamine, and cathinones, are also members of the class. All of the substituted amphetamines are phenethylamines, as well. Pharmaceutical drugs that are substituted phenethylamines include phenelzine, phenformin, and fanetizole, among many others. The N-methylated derivative of phenethylamine is N-methylphenethylamine. === Analogues === Analogues of phenethylamine with the ethylamine side chain extended or shortened include phenylpropylamine and benzylamine. Another related analogue is phenylalaninol. === Synthesis === One method for preparing β-phenethylamine, set forth in J. C. Robinson and H. R. Snyder's Organic Syntheses (published 1955), involves the reduction of benzyl cyanide with hydrogen in liquid ammonia, in the presence of a Raney-Nickel catalyst, at a temperature of 130 °C and a pressure of 13.8 MPa. Alternative syntheses are outlined in the footnotes to this preparation. A much more convenient method for the synthesis of β-phenethylamine is the reduction of ω-nitrostyrene by lithium aluminium hydride in ether, whose successful execution was first reported by R. F. Nystrom and W. G. Brown in 1948. Phenethylamine can also be produced via the cathodic reduction of benzyl cyanide in a divided cell. Assembling phenethylamine structures for synthesis of compounds such as epinephrine, amphetamines, tyrosine, and dopamine by adding the beta-aminoethyl side chain to the phenyl ring is possible. This can be done via Friedel-Crafts acylation with N-protected acyl chlorides when the arene is activated, or by Heck reaction of the phenyl with N-vinyloxazolone, followed by hydrogenation, or by cross-coupling with beta-amino organozinc reagents, or reacting a brominated arene with beta-aminoethyl organolithium reagents, or by Suzuki cross-coupling. === Detection in body fluids === Reviews that cover attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and phenethylamine indicate that several studies have found abnormally low urinary phenethylamine concentrations in ADHD individuals when compared with controls. In treatment-responsive individuals, amphetamine and methylphenidate greatly increase urinary phenethylamine concentration. An ADHD biomarker review also indicated that urinary phenethylamine levels could be a diagnostic biomarker for ADHD. Thirty minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical exercise has been shown to induce an increase in urinary phenylacetic acid, the primary metabolite of phenethylamine. Two reviews noted a study where the mean 24 hour urinary phenylacetic acid concentration following just 30 minutes of intense exercise rose 77% above its base level; the reviews suggest that phenethylamine synthesis sharply increases during physical exercise during which it is rapidly metabolized due to its short half-life of roughly 30 seconds. In a resting state, phenethylamine is synthesized in catecholamine neurons from L-phenylalanine by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase at approximately the same rate as dopamine is produced. Monoamine oxidase deaminates primary and secondary amines that are free in the neuronal cytoplasm but not those bound in storage vesicles of the sympathetic neurone. Similarly, β-PEA would not be completely deaminated in the gut as it is a selective substrate for MAO-B, which is not primarily found in the gut. Brain levels of endogenous trace amines are several hundred-fold below those for the classical neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin, but their rates of synthesis are equivalent to those of noradrenaline and dopamine and they have a very rapid turnover rate. Endogenous extracellular tissue levels of trace amines measured in the brain are in the low nanomolar range. These low concentrations arise because of their very short half-life. Because of the pharmacological relationship between phenethylamine and amphetamine, the original paper and both reviews suggest that phenethylamine plays a prominent role in mediating the mood-enhancing euphoric effects of a runner's high, as both phenethylamine and amphetamine are potent euphoriants. Skydiving has also been shown to induce a marked increase in urinary phenethylamine concentrations. == Biological activity == === Monoamine releasing agent === Phenethylamine, being similar to amphetamine in its action at their common biomolecular targets, is a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is roughly equipotent to amphetamine in this regard in vitro. Phenethylamine is inactive as a psychostimulant under normal circumstances due to rapid metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO), but can become active in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). === TAAR1 agonist === Phenethylamine is a potent agonist of the mouse, rat, and human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). β-PEA is also an odorant binding TAAR4 in mice thought to mediate predator avoidance. Similarly to the case of amphetamine, phenethylamine shows enhanced locomotor stimulation, a psychostimulant-like effect, in TAAR1 knockout mice. === Monoaminergic activity enhancer === Phenethylamine is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its catecholamine-releasing activity. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The compound is active as a MAE at much lower concentrations than the concentrations at which it induces the release of catecholamines. The MAE actions of phenethylamine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Synthetic and more potent MAEs like phenylpropylaminopentane (PPAP) and selegiline (L-deprenyl) have been derived from phenethylamine. === Other activities === Unlike its derivatives norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), phenethylamine is inactive as an agonist of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. === Effects in animals and humans === According to Alexander Shulgin in PiHKAL, phenethylamine is completely inactive in humans at doses of up to 1,600 mg orally and 50 mg intravenously. This can be attributed to its extremely rapid metabolic breakdown rather than pharmacodynamic inactivity. Although exogenous phenethylamine on its own is inactive, its metabolism can be strongly inhibited and it can thereby become active, showing psychostimulant effects, when combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), specifically monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors like selegiline. Oral L-phenylalanine (a precursor of phenethylamine) and/or phenethylamine itself in combination with selegiline has been studied in the treatment of depression and has been reported to be effective. Misuse of phenethylamine in combination with selegiline has also been reported. The LD50Tooltip median lethal dose values of phenethylamine include 175 mg/kg i.p. in mice, 320 mg/kg s.c. in mice, 100 mg/kg i.v. in mice, 100 mg/kg parenterally in mice, 39 mg/kg intracervically in mice, and 200 mg/kg i.p. in guinea pigs. Its LDLo values include 800 mg/kg p.o. in rats, 100 mg/kg i.p. in rats, 450 μg/kg s.c. in rats, and 300 mg/kg via an unspecified route in mice. == Pharmacokinetics == By oral route, phenethylamine's half-life is 5–10 minutes; endogenously produced PEA in catecholamine neurons has a half-life of roughly 30 seconds. In humans, PEA is metabolized by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAOs) AOC2 and AOC3, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), and aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). N-Methylphenethylamine, an isomer of amphetamine, is produced in humans via the metabolism of phenethylamine by PNMT. β-Phenylacetic acid is the primary urinary metabolite of phenethylamine and is produced via monoamine oxidase metabolism and subsequent aldehyde dehydrogenase metabolism. Phenylacetaldehyde is the intermediate product which is produced by monoamine oxidase and then further metabolized into β-phenylacetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. When the initial phenylethylamine concentration in the brain is low, brain levels can be increased 1000-fold when taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), particularly a MAO-B inhibitor, and by 3–4 times when the initial concentration is high. == Legality == Phenylethylamine is not a scheduled substance in the United States. However, at least one person in the United States has been prosecuted under the federal analogue act for selling Phenylethylamine with the prosecutions argument that PEA is a structural analog of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine. == Notes == == References == == External links == Phenethylamine MS Spectrum PEA (phenethylamine) - isomer design (PiHKAL entry)",Beta-phenethylamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0129034873098135), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0001589618914294988), (' FOOD', -0.00015288250870071352)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.07730617374181747), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.00010215714428341016), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0053705936297774315), (',', -0.31331750750541687), ('ĠMED', -0.4703732132911682), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03806367889046669)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -2.339278580620885e-06), (' FOOD', -0.0007099286303855479)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5561952/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenethylamine,https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/5456 ', [])"

The objective of this work was to combine ML with population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of tumor growth inhibition to understand the sources of variability between patients and therefore improve model predictions to support drug development decisions. Data from 127 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma enrolled in a phase I/II study evaluating once-daily oral doses of the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR4 kinase inhibitor, Roblitinib (FGF401), were used. Roblitinib  PKs was best described by a two-compartment model with a delayed zero-order absorption and linear elimination. Clinical efficacy using the longitudinal sum of the longest lesion diameter data was described with a population PK/PD model of tumor growth inhibition including resistance to treatment. ML, applying elastic net modeling of time to progression data, was associated with cross-validation, and allowed to derive a composite predictive risk score from a set of 75 patients' baseline characteristics. The two approaches were combined by testing the inclusion of the continuous risk score as a covariate on PD model parameters. The score was found as a significant covariate on the resistance parameter and resulted in 19% reduction of its variability, and 32% variability reduction on the average dose for stasis. The final PK/PD model was used to simulate effect of patients' characteristics on tumor growth inhibition profiles. The proposed methodology can be used to support drug development decisions, especially when large interpatient variability is observed. FGF19 signaling through the FGFR4/β-klotho receptor complex has been shown to be a key driver of growth and survival in a subset of hepatocellular carcinomas, making selective FGFR4 inhibition an attractive treatment opportunity. A kinome-wide sequence alignment highlighted a poorly conserved cysteine residue within the FGFR4 ATP-binding site at position 552, two positions beyond the gate-keeper residue. Several strategies for targeting this cysteine to identify FGFR4 selective inhibitor starting points are summarized which made use of both rational and unbiased screening approaches. The optimization of a 2-formylquinoline amide hit series is described in which the aldehyde makes a hemithioacetal reversible-covalent interaction with cysteine 552. Key challenges addressed during the optimization are improving the FGFR4 potency, metabolic stability, and solubility leading ultimately to the highly selective first-in-class clinical candidate roblitinib. Model-informed dose selection has been drawing increasing interest in oncology early clinical development. The current paper describes the example of FGF401, a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) inhibitor, in which a comprehensive modeling and simulation (M&S) framework, using both pharmacometrics and statistical methods, was established during its first-in-human clinical development using the totality of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers, and safety and efficacy data in patients with cancer. These M&S results were used to inform FGF401 dose selection for future development. A two-compartment population PK (PopPK) model with a delayed 0-order absorption and linear elimination adequately described FGF401 PK. Indirect PopPK/PD models including a precursor compartment were independently established for two biomarkers: circulating FGF19 and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4).

The molecule acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by disrupting the first step of the arachidonic acid pathway of inflammation. From 2006 to 2012, varespladib was under active investigation by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as a potential therapy for several inflammatory diseases, including acute coronary syndrome and acute chest syndrome. The trial was halted in March 2012 due to inadequate efficacy. The selective sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib (IC50 value 0.009 μM in chromogenic assay, mole fraction 7.3X10-6) was studied in the VISTA-16 randomized clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01130246) and the results were published in 2014. The sPLA2 inhibition by varespladib in this setting seemed to be potentially harmful, and thus not a useful strategy for reducing adverse cardiovascular outcomes from acute coronary syndrome. Since 2016, scientific research has focused on the use of Varespladib as an inhibitor of snake venom toxins using various types of in vitro and in vivo models. Varespladib showed a significant inhibitory effect to snake venom PLA2 which makes it a potential first-line drug candidate in snakebite envenomation therapy. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted varespladib orphan drug status for its potential to treat snakebite. == History == Varespladib methyl was originally developed jointly by Eli Lilly and Company and Shionogi & Co., Ltd., and was acquired by Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2006. A Phase II study demonstrated selective sPLA2 inhibition as well as statistically significant anti-inflammatory responses and reductions in LDL cholesterol levels. Two other Phase II trials, conducted in patients with coronary artery disease, found significant decreases in sPLA2 and LDL cholesterol levels, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory biomarkers. Varespladib methyl has also been shown to further reduce LDL and inflammatory biomarker levels when administered in conjunction with a cholesterol lowering statin therapy. In 2010, a Phase III study entitled VISTA-16 was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of short-term treatment with varespladib methyl in subjects with ACS. The trial was halted in March 2012 due to insufficient efficacy. On November 18, 2013, an excess of myocardial infarctions, and of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions and stroke in the VISTA-16 study were reported. First report on its efficacy as an antidote for snake venoms comes from 2016. Due to oral bioavailability it is considered as a potential first-line field-treatment for snakebite envenomation, which could be applied before provision of definitive medical care. == Oral varespladib == Varespladib methyl (also known as A-002, formerly LY333013 and S-3013) is a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor formerly under development by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as a treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Varespladib methyl is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the molecule varespladib. From 2006 to 2012, varespladib methyl was under active investigation by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as a potential therapy for several inflammatory diseases, including acute coronary syndrome. In March 2012, Anthera halted further investigation of varespladib per a recommendation from an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Varespladib and varespladib methyl were characterised as effective molecules in neutralization of snakes venoms and are under experimental evaluation. == Intravenous varespladib == Varespladib sodium (also known as A-001, previously LY315920 and S-5920) is a sodium salt of varespladib designed for intravenous delivery. It was under evaluation by Anthera Pharmaceuticals as an anti-inflammatory sPLA2 inhibitor for the prevention of acute chest syndrome (ACS), the leading cause of death for patients with sickle-cell disease. Elevated serum levels of sPLA2 have been observed in sickle-cell patients preceding and during ACS episodes. This profound elevation in sPLA2 levels is not observed in sickle-cell patients at steady-state or during a vaso-occlusive crisis, or in patients with respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. A reduction in serum sPLA2 levels, for example through blood transfusion, reduces the risk of an ACS, suggesting that sPLA2 plays an important role in the onset of ACS. Anthera Pharmaceuticals acquired varespladib sodium from Lilly and Shionogi in 2006. In 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted varespladib sodium orphan drug status for its potential to treat patients with sickle-cell disease, which was later withdrawn. In 2009, Anthera Pharmaceuticals completed a Phase II study of varespladib sodium in subjects with sickle cell disease at risk for ACS. Inhibitory effect on snake venoms Snakebite envenomation can cause local tissue damage, with edema, hemorrhage, myonecrosis, and systemic toxic responses, including organ failure. In an early report on inhibition of snake venom toxicities, Varespladib, and its orally bioavailable prodrug methyl-varespladib (LY333013) showed strong inhibition of 28 types of svPLA2s from six continents. Varespladib treatment exerted a significant inhibitory effect on snake venom PLA2 both in vitro and in vivo. Hemorrhage and myonecrosis initiated by D. acuts, A. halys, N. atra, and B. multicinctus in an animal model were significantly reversed by varespladib. Furthermore, edema in gastrocnemius muscle was also attenuated. The sPLA2 inhibitor, LY315920 (varespladib sodium), and its orally bioavailable prodrug, LY333013 (varespladib methyl) were highly effective in preventing lethality following experimental envenoming by M. fulvius in a porcine animal model. Considering that some of the toxins of snake venoms are enzymes, the search for low molecular weight enzyme inhibitors that could be safely administered immediately after a snakebite re-focused scientists' attention on Varespladib. Its ability to neutralize the enzymatic and toxic activities of three isolated PLA2 toxins (from medically important snakes found in different region around the world) of structural groups I (pseudexin) and II (crotoxin B and myotoxin I) was evaluated. The results obtained showed that Varespladib was able to neutralize the in vitro cytotoxic and in vivo myotoxic activities of purified PLA2s of both the structural group I (pseudexin) and II (myotoxin-I and crotoxin B), however further detailed analysis are needed. Varespladib also effectively inhibited the non-enzymatic myotoxic activity of the snake venom PLA2-like protein (MjTX-II). Co-crystallization of Varespladib with MjTX-II toxin revealed that the compound binds to a hydrophobic channel of the protein. Such interaction blocks fatty acids binding, thus inhibiting allosteric activation of the toxin. This leads to the toxin losing its ability to disrupt cell membranes. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated varespladib orphan drug status for its potential to treat snakebite, without being FDA approved for Orphan Indication. == Mechanism == === Prodrug activation === Varespladib methyl, in contrast to varespladib, is orally bioavailable and after absorption from the GI tract, it undergoes rapid ester hydrolysis to the active molecule – varespladib. === sPLA2 inhibition === Increased levels of sPLA2 have been observed in patients with cardiovascular disease, and may lead to both acute and chronic disease manifestations by promoting vascular inflammation. Plasma levels of sPLA2 can predict coronary events in patients who recently suffered an ACS as well as in those with stable coronary artery disease. Furthermore, sPLA2 remodels lipoproteins, notably low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and their receptors, which are responsible for removing cholesterol from the body. This remodeling can lead to increased deposition of LDL and cholesterol in the artery wall. In combination with chronic vascular inflammation, these deposits lead to atherosclerosis. Varespladib inhibits the IIA, V and X isoforms of sPLA2 to reduce inflammation, lower and modulate lipid levels, and reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), both indicators of inflammation. === Snake venom antidote activity === sPLA2 is also present in snake venoms and implicated in their toxicity. It plays a role in the morbidity and mortality from snakebite envenomations, triggering induced cell lysis, disrupted hemostasis, and diminished oxygen transport, as well as myotoxicity and neurotoxicity which can lead to paralysis. Varespladib methyl, as well as varespladib, were found to be inhibitors of the sPLA2 of snake venoms. Varespladib methyl was less potent than varespladib. Both showed activity against a broad spectrum of different snake venoms originating from six continents. They protected rodents against neurotoxicity and hemostatic toxicity, increasing survival of envenomed animals. Varespladib also effectively inhibited in vitro and in vivo the non-enzymatic myotoxic activity of snake venom's PLA2-like protein (MjTX-II). Co-crystallization of varespladib with MjTX-II toxin (PDB code: 6PWH) revealed that the drug binds to a hydrophobic channel of the protein. This blocks fatty acids from binding there, thus inhibiting their allosteric activation of the toxin, thereby impairing its ability to disrupt cell membranes. == References == == External links == Varespladib methyl at Anthera.com Varespladib sodium at Anthera.com Varespladib methyl Phase III study at ClinicalTrials.gov Varespladib sodium Phase II study at ClinicalTrials.gov",Varespladib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8312570318812504e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0038955530617386103), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07892577350139618)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varespladib ', [])"

Allocholic acid (ACA), a unique fetal BA known for its potent choleretic effects, reappears during liver regeneration and carcinogenesis. In this research, we investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of ACA against mice with cholestasis brought on by α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT). To achieve this, we combined network pharmacology, targeted BA metabolomics, and molecular biology approaches. The results demonstrated that ACA treatment effectively reduced levels of serum AST, ALP, and DBIL, and ameliorated the pathological injury caused by cholestasis. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that ACA primarily regulated BA and salt transport, along with the signaling pathway associated with bile secretion, to improve cholestasis. Subsequently, we examined changes in BA metabolism using UPLC-MS/MS. The findings indicated that ACA pretreatment induced alterations in the size, distribution, and composition of the liver BA pool. Specifically, it reduced the excessive accumulation of BAs, especially cholic acid (CA), taurocholic acid (TCA), and β-muricholic acid (β-MCA), facilitating the restoration of BA homeostasis. Furthermore, ACA pretreatment significantly downregulated the expression of hepatic BA synthase Cyp8b1, while enhancing the expression of hepatic efflux transporter Mrp4, as well as the renal efflux transporters Mdr1 and Mrp2. These changes collectively contributed to improved BA efflux from the liver and enhanced renal elimination of BAs. In conclusion, ACA demonstrated its potential to ameliorate ANIT-induced liver damage by inhibiting BA synthesis and promoting both BA efflux and renal elimination pathways, thus, restoring BA homeostasis. An obligate anaerobic organism capable of dehydroxylating cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and allocholic acid to allodeoxycholic acid was isolated from feces of the rabbit. It was a member of the bacteroides group (Gram-variable, nonsporulating anaerobes). The growth of the organism was inhibited by neomycin, 10-20 micro g/ml. The existence of this organism affords a satisfactory explanation for the development of gallstones in the cholestanol-fed rabbit and for their absence in rabbits simultaneously treated with neomycin. Tauroallocholate is the major bile salt of the lizard, Uromastix hardwickii. Alkaline hydrolysis of bile from 25 gallbladders provided 1.21 g of acidic material, about 90% of which was allocholic acid.

1168,"('Cholic acid', 'Cholate', 'Cholalic acid', 'Colalin', 'Cholalin')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Cholic acid, also known as 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid is a primary bile acid that is insoluble in water (soluble in alcohol and acetic acid), it is a white crystalline substance. Salts of cholic acid are called cholates. Cholic acid, along with chenodeoxycholic acid, is one of the two major bile acids produced by the liver, where it is synthesized from cholesterol. These two major bile acids are roughly equal in concentration in humans. Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA, which exchanges its CoA with either glycine, or taurine, yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid, respectively. Cholic acid downregulates cholesterol-7-α-hydroxylase (rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis), and cholesterol does the opposite. This is why chenodeoxycholic acid, and not cholic acid, can be used to treat gallstones (because decreasing bile acid synthesis would supersaturate the stones even more). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the most important human bile acids. Other species may synthesize different bile acids as their predominant primary bile acids. == Medical uses == Cholic acid, sold under the brand name Cholbam, is approved for use in the United States and is indicated as a treatment for children and adults with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. It was approved for use in the European Union in September 2013, and is sold under the brand name Orphacol. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile-acid synthesis due to 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged one month to 18 years and adults. Cholic acid FGK (Kolbam) was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2015. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood, encompassing the following single enzyme defects: sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX); 2- (or alpha-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency; cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency. The most common side effects include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick), acid reflux (stomach acid flowing up into the mouth), esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), skin problems (lesions) and malaise (feeling unwell). == Cancer == A meta-analysis on the relationship of fecal bile acid concentrations to the development and progression of colorectal cancer was reported in 2025. It was found that higher fecal concentrations of cholic acid are associated with a higher risk/incidence of colorectal cancer.

Daily samples of bile were obtained, and biliary bile acids were extracted and purified to determine bile acid kinetics. During ursocholic acid therapy ursocholic acid became the principal bile acid (35% +/- 3% of total bile acids, mean +/- S.E.M.), and the percentage of biliary cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids decreased (p less than 0.05). Cholic acid production fell from 190 +/- 15 mg/day to 135 +/- 20 mg/day (p = 0.078). The total bile acid pool was increased twofold (p less than 0.05), whereas the deoxycholic acid pool was enlarged from 440 +/- 170 mg to 1,175 +/- 90 mg (p less than 0.02). As much as 28% of the fed ursocholic acid was excreted in the urine, 85% as the free acid and 15% as the glycine conjugate. During treatment, ursocholic acid became the source for 69% +/- 11% of biliary deoxycholic acid. The time course of the deoxycholic acid specific activity was modeled as a single pool precursor-product system with a variable time delay for the C-7-dehydroxylation of cholic and ursocholic acids (mean delay 0.86 +/- 0.11 days, p less than 0.001 vs. zero delay). Most of this delay probably arises from a slow process of bacterial C-7-dehydroxylation within the colon. These results demonstrate that during ursocholic acid therapy the synthesis of primary bile acids continues whereas the formation of secondary bile acids is greatly increased. The preventive effect of 3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid (ursocholic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid on the formation of biliary cholesterol crystals was studied in mice. Cholesterol crystals developed with 80% incidence after feeding for five weeks a lithogenic diet containing 0.5% cholesterol and 0.25% sodium cholate. When 0.25% ursocholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid was added to the lithogenic diet, the incidence as well as the grade (severity) of the gallstones were reduced. Plasma and liver cholesterol levels were decreased by ursodeoxycholic acid but not by ursocholic acid. Gallbladder cholesterol and phospholipid levels were decreased by both bile acids. The biliary bile acid level was decreased by ursocholic acid but not by ursodeoxycholic acid. After feeding ursocholic acid, its level in the bile was about 25% and the levels of cholic acid and beta-muricholic acid decreased. Fecal sterol excretion was not changed by ursocholic acid, but was increased by ursodeoxycholic acid. After feeding ursocholic acid, fecal excretion of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and ursocholic acid increased. No differences were found between mice, with or without gallstones, in plasma and liver cholesterol levels, biliary phospholipid and bile acid levels, fecal sterol and bile acid levels, and biliary and fecal bile acid composition. The results suggest that the lower incidence of crystal formation after treatment with ursocholic acid is probably by a different mechanism than with ursodeoxycholic acid. In the mouse model, ursodeoxycholic acid exerts its effect at least partially, by decreasing cholesterol absorption. Ursocholic acid is well absorbed and excreted into bile and transformed into deoxycholic acid by the intestinal microflora in mice. To further clarify the relationship between physical-chemical characteristics of bile acids and biliary lipid secretion, we investigated the effect of ursocholic acid, the 7 beta-hydroxyepimer of cholic acid, on bile lipid secretion and composition. The study included acute duodenal infusion (1 g/h for 5 h) of ursocholic acid contrasted with a less hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, in 3 T-tube patients and short-term oral administration (2 wk) of ursocholic acid (10-15 mg/kg X day) to 10 gallstone patients. Following acute infusion, ursocholic acid, similarly to ursodeoxycholic acid, accounted for greater than 80% of the biliary bile acids. However, ursocholic acid induced (per micromole of secreted bile acid) a significantly lower (p less than 0.01) secretion of cholesterol (0.013 mumol) and phospholipids (0.054 mumol) than that induced by ursodeoxycholic acid (0.034 mumol of cholesterol and 0.138 mumol of phospholipids). Biliary alkaline phosphatase activity during ursocholic acid administration was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than during ursodeoxycholic acid administration. After short-term oral administration, ursocholic acid, undetectable before treatment, constituted 20.50% +/- 8.60% of the biliary bile acids. The percentage of deoxycholic acid increased from 32.35% +/- 18.79% to 47.53% +/- 16.19% (p less than 0.05). Mean saturation index decreased from a pretreatment value of 1.23 +/- 0.22 to 0.99 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.05), but only in 4 of 10 subjects did bile become undersaturated. It is concluded that ursocholic acid, due to its higher hydrophilicity, stimulates a lower cholesterol and phospholipid output than ursodeoxycholic acid. Consequently, despite the low enrichment of the biliary bile acids with ursocholic acid, oral administration of ursocholic acid induces a reduction of bile cholesterol saturation.",Ursocholic acid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.10496664047241211), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.3133012652397156), (' END', -3.333223139634356e-05), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -6.511406809295295e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.08575055748224258), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.04862480238080025), ('ĠEND', -0.002506093354895711), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011149131692945957)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.00043126524542458355), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/122340,https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010088 ', [])"

1171,"('Tauroursodeoxycholate', 'Ur 906', 'Taurolite', 'Tauroursodeoxycholic acid', 'Ursodeoxycholyltaurine')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Ursodoxicoltaurine is the international nonproprietary name (INN) for the pharmaceutical form of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). It is also known as taurursodiol. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid which is the taurine conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Humans have only trace amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid but bears have large amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid in their bile. == Synthesis == Bile acids are naturally synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are conjugated with specific amino-acids, specifically taurine. Bear bile contains several bile acids including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. UDCA and its taurine conjugates comprise about 47% of the bile in American black bears and up to 76% in Asiatic bears. Ursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were first chemically synthesized in 1954 in Japan. Ursodeoxycholic acid is produced in several countries for the treatment of gallstones and primary biliary cholangitis. == Medical uses == In Canada and the United States, ursodoxicoltaurine, in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate, was indicated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Following failed results from the phase 3 PHOENIX trial (NCT05021536) It has been removed from the market in April 2024. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals has announced that effective immediately Relyvrio will no longer be available. == Cellular mechanisms == Apoptosis is largely influenced by the mitochondria. If the mitochondria are distressed, they release cytochrome C (cyC) and calcium which activate caspases to propagate a cascade of cellular mechanisms to cause apoptosis. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents apoptosis with its role in the BAX pathway. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents BAX from being transported to the mitochondria which protects the mitochondria from perturbation and the activation of caspases. Many effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid appear to be dependent on the activation of the cell membrane receptors TGR5, S1PR2 and α5β1-Integrin. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid also acts as a chemical chaperone to help maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. == Research == Ursodoxicoltaurine has been shown to reduce apoptosis and to have protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases and the eye, particularly for retinal degenerative disorders. Studies have shown that tauroursodeoxycholic acid has neuroprotective actions based on its potent ability to inhibit apoptosis, attenuate oxidative stress, and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress in different experimental models of these illnesses. Studies have shown protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in eye diseases. === Photoreceptor cells === A study examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with tauroursodeoxycholic acid every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. Electroretinography (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. Ursodoxicoltaurine treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected. Another study, from the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two components of bile, bilirubin and ursodoxicoltaurine, in relation to RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects on the health of the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, rod cell death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments. The findings of the study are elucidating optimized conditions for RP treatment. === Choroidal neovascularization === A study done at the Department of Ophthalmology at Seoul National University College of Medicine examined the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA on laser-treated choroids of rat models. Argon lasers were used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rat models. Ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA were injected intraperitoneally 24 hours before and daily after the laser treatment. Fourteen days after laser-treatment, the eyes were examined for effects. Fluorescein angiography showed lower leakage from the CNV in UDCA and ursodoxicoltaurine treated groups than the control group. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the retina were examined and showed lower levels in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated group compared to the control group, whereas no effect in the UDCA treated group. ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA may suppress CNV formation, which may be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects. === Synaptic connectivity === A study from the Department of Physiology in University of Alicante, in Alicante, Spain, shows the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine in the P23H transgenic rat, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The transgenic rats were injected with ursodoxicoltaurine once a week starting from P21 until P120, along with vehicle-administered controls. At P120, the functionality of the retina was examined via ERG and immunoflourescent microscopy. The amplitude of the a- and b- waves were considerably higher in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats, compared to the control group. Photoreceptor density in the center of the retina was three-fold greater in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats. Also, TUNEL results showed smaller amounts of TUNEL-positive cells. The synaptic contacts amongst photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells were preserved in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated P23H rats. Additionally, the synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer were of greater density that in control rats. The neuroprotective effects of ursodoxicoltaurine are not only preserving retinal morphology and function, but also its synaptic contacts, a potentially useful aspect in delaying RP. === Other diseases === Tauroursodeoxycholic acid has also been suggested to have potential application in heart disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke in view of the drug's ability to reduce apoptotic effects. == References ==",Ursodeoxycholyltaurine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.3015781342983246), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011051828041672707), (' END', -0.0001831565605243668), ('OG', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ENO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0023285436909645796), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.014173557050526142), ('ĠEND', -0.0020942201372236013), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02328586019575596)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.06498077511787415), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.7697225252486533e-06), (' MED', -0.0001238004770129919), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB08834,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursodoxicoltaurine,https://www.rxreasoner.com/atccodes/A05AA05 ', [])"

1173,"('Voclosporin', 'Luveniq', 'Lupkynis', 'Voclosporin [usan]', 'R 1524')",Medical,"Voclosporin, sold under the brand name Lupkynis, is a calcineurin inhibitor used as an immunosuppressant medication for the treatment of lupus nephritis. It is an analog of ciclosporin that has enhanced action against calcineurin and greater metabolic stability. It was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2021, and in the European Union in September 2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Chemistry == Chemically, cyclosporine, a frequently prescribed calcineurin inhibitor, is the source of voclosporin. However, structural changes have been made to voclosporin in order to increase its effectiveness, metabolic stability, and safety. Voclosporin and cyclophilin A combine to produce a heterodimeric complex that binds to and inhibits calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase implicated in cytokine generation and T-cell activation. According to X-ray crystallography, the sidechain modification at amino acid 1 in voclosporin changes how the cyclophilin-voclosporin complex binds to a surface composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits in calcineurin (the ""latch region""); this change in binding results in potent inhibition of calcineurin.The major site for voclosporin metabolism is also moved to amino acid 9, where the resultant IM9 metabolite, which is nearly eight times less powerful than voclosporin, accounts for 16.7% of all drug-related exposure. Contrarily, cyclosporine undergoes extensive metabolism to produce a number of metabolites, including AM1 and AM19, the production of which is greater than that of IM9; in transplant patients, AM1 concentrations and total exposure levels are higher than or comparable to those of cyclosporine, and both AM1 and AM19 have been linked to nephropathy (nephrotoxicity). There should be little competitive inhibition of the parent drug by its less active metabolite due to the low metabolite load associated with voclosporin. == Medical uses == Lupus nephritis is a common form of glomerular nephritis occurring in patients with systemic lupus nephritis. Lupus nephritis commonly leads patients to chronic kidney failure and therefore places an emphasis on early intervention for improving treatment outcomes. It is a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus. The management of lupus nephritis comprises immunosuppressive therapy to lessen inflammation and maintain renal function. Guidelines for managing lupus nephritis are provided by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the European League Against Rheumatism/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA). Both sets of recommendations place a strong emphasis on the necessity of lowering proteinuria, a crucial indicator of long-term renal success, and achieving complete renal response (CRR) as treatment objectives. Early intervention with voclosporin in combination with kidney response is believed to lead to more positive clinical outcomes for lupus nephritis patients. Thus, voclosporin is used in combination with background immunosuppressive regimen for the treatment of lupus nephritis. Safety has not been established in combination with cyclophosphamide. Since decreasing proteinuria in the first year of treatment of lupus nephritis is known to be associated with improved long-term outcomes, the available clinical data support the use of voclosporin as first-line therapy in combination with mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose glucocorticosteroid. == Contraindications == Patients who are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed should not take this medication as it may cause fetal harm. Voclosporin is not recomnended in patients with a baseline eGFR less than or equal to 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 unless benefits exceeds risk. Dose should be reduced if the drug is used within this population as well as for patients who are hepatically impaired. Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines when patients are on this medication. Avoid co-administration of voclosporin and other moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and if needed then reduce the dose of voclosporin. Dosages of PgP-substrate drugs should be reduced if co-administered with voclosporin. == Adverse effects == Voclosporin has a boxed warning for malignancies and serious infections. Patients taking Voclosporin along with other immunosuppressants have an increased risk for developing malignancies and serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. The most common adverse reactions of voclosporin were (>3%), glomerular filtration rate decreased, hypertension, diarrhea, headache, anemia, cough, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain(upper), dyspepsia, alopecia, renal impairment, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, fatigue. tremor, acute kidney injury, and decreased appetite. Glomerular filtration rate decrease was the most frequently reported adverse reaction, reported in placebo (11.3 per 100 patient-years), LUPKYNIS 23.7 mg (37.1 per 100 patient-years), and voclosporin 39.5 mg BID (48.7 per 100 patient-years). With LUPKYNIS 23.7 mg BID, decreases in glomerular filtration rate occurred within the first 3 months in 71% of patients, with 78% of those resolved or improved following dose modification, and of those 64% resolved or improved within 1 month. Decreases in glomerular filtration rate resulted in permanent discontinuation of LUPKYNIS in 14% of patients and resolved in 40% within 3 months after treatment discontinuation. == Pharmacology == Voclosporin is a cyclosporin A analog, similar to cyclosporin A with modifications on an amino acid within one region that allows the drug to bind to Calcineurin. Voclosporin inhibits calcineurin, which then blocks the production of IL-2 and T-cell mediated immune responses. As a result of the calcineurin inhibition, podocytes (cells within the kidneys) are stabilized while inflammation is reduced. Reduction of inflammation within the kidneys prevents further renal damage. Calcineurin inhibitors in lupus nephritis have two separate impacts on calcineurin activity: immunomodulatory effects on T-cells and stabilization of the podocyte. Inhibition of calcineurin in T cells prevents nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) from moving to the nucleus, which reduces the transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines. This decreases lymphocyte proliferation and T-cell mediated responses. By preventing the dephosphorylation of synaptopodin in the podocyte, calcineurin inhibition preserves the cytoskeleton's stabilizing function and lowers proteinuria. Up to 1 mg/kg, voclosporin inhibits calcineurin in a dose-dependent manner with little to no lag time from the time reaching the maximum drug concentration to the time reaching maximum calcineurin inhibition. Voclosporin has been demonstrated to be a strong inhibitor of numerous immunological processes, such as lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell cytokine generation, and T-cell surface antigen expression, in in vitro tests utilizing blood from nonhuman primates. Voclosporin similarly suppressed a variety of T-cell activities in non-human primates in vivo. In these nonclinical investigations, voclosporin was more effective than cyclosporine., == Pharmacokinetics and metabolism == When administered on an empty stomach, the median Tmax of voclosporin is 1.5 hours. The AUC is estimated to be 7693 ng/mL and the Cmax is estimated at 955 ng/mL. The volume of distribution is approximately 2,154 L and distributes within the red blood cells. The distribution between the plasma and whole blood is affected by temperature and concentration. The protein binding of voclosporin is 97%. The average terminal half-life of voclosporin is 63.6 L/h. The drug is mainly metabolized by the CYP3A4 hepatic cytochrome enzyme. Pharmacologic activity is mainly attributed to the parent molecule itself, with the major metabolite being 8-fold less potent than the parent drug. Exposure is increased in individuals with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) and in those with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with lupus nephritis showed voclosporin to have predictable pharmacokinetics, with no clinically meaningful influence of sex, body weight, age, serum albumin, total bilirubin or eGFR (>45 mL/min/1.73 m2; patients with eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded from voclosporin clinical trials). Dose adjustment is not required based on these covariates. == Safety == Since lupus nephritis is a serious, disabling, and possibly life-threatening illness, it is not surprising to see mortality in lupus nephritis clinical trials. Voclosporin safety information originates from a total of 267 patients who received 23.7 mg BID and an additional 88 patients who received 39.5 mg BID. The majority of adverse event categories were more prevalent in voclosporin-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. Although similar to earlier lupus nephritis trials, the mortality rate (4.9%) was higher in the low-dose voclosporin group; it was noted that the majority of the deaths took place at a small number of locations, and that more patients were randomized to low-dose voclosporin at these locations. A total of 19 patients (3.0%) died across the three published clinical trials with voclosporin in a total of 631 patients with lupus nephritis, all of which had a treatment duration of about a year. This included any deaths that occurred after randomization up to study conclusion. Overall, patients receiving any dose of voclosporin, including 23.7 mg BID and 39.5 mg BID, and patients receiving placebo (6 of 266 patients, 2.3%) experienced a similar rate of death (13 of 365 patients, 3.6%). == Dosage == Up to 64 mg twice daily (BID), according to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, a significant association was found between voclosporin blood levels and estimated calcineurin inhibition. Based on an integrated safety examination of voclosporin in healthy individuals and patients with various diseases (psoriasis, uveitis, and renal transplant) at doses of 0.2-0.6 mg/kg BID, the therapeutic dose utilized in lupus nephritis was chosen. Weight-based dosing was not required in this dosage range, as shown by the linear pharmacokinetic profile, and there was a dose-dependent rise in the frequency and severity of side events. == History == Voclosporin was discovered by Isotechnika in the 1990s. Isotechnika was founded in 1993 and merged with Aurinia Pharmaceuticals in 2013. Huizinga led the clinical development program for voclosporin before and after the acquisition—including a shift in the synthesis from one that yielded racemates to one that yields a single trans isomer. Voclosporin is the first oral treatment for lupus nephritis to receive approval in the USA. In January 2021, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals received approval from the Food & Drug Administration to sell the drug Lupkynis. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 21 July 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Lupkynis, intended for the treatment of lupus nephritis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Otsuka Pharmaceutical Netherlands B.V.

Fosinopril is the only phosphonate-containing ACE inhibitor marketed, by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the trade name Monopril. Fosinopril is a cascading pro-drug. The special niche for the medication that differentiates it from the other members of the ACE Inhibitor drug class is that was specifically developed for the use for patients with renal impairment. This was through manipulation of the metabolism and excretion, and is seen that fifty percent of the drug is hepatobiliary cleared, which can compensate for diminished renal clearance. The remaining fifty percent is excreted in urine. It does not need dose adjustment. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1991. == Medical uses == In congestive heart failure, the ability of the heart to pump enough blood to satisfy the physiological needs of the body is reduced. This condition has a variety of causes, including damaged heart valves, myocardial infarction, hypertension, vitamin B1 deficiency, and genetic mutations. When subsequent blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidneys respond by increasing the secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Renin converts the inactive angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II (AII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). AII can have negative effects on the cardiovascular system after events such as heart failure and myocardial infarction. AII causes arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension, resulting in an increase in afterload, increasing the resistance against which the heart works. Additionally, chronic increase in production of AII is associated with structural changes to the myocardium which reduces the functionality of the heart. In heart failure patients, fosinopril increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as dyspnea, the need for supplemental diuretics, fatigue, and hospitalizations. == Chemistry == Unlike other ACE inhibitors that are primarily excreted by the kidneys, fosinopril is eliminated from the body by both renal and hepatic pathways. This characteristic of fosinopril makes the drug a safer choice than other ACE inhibitors for heart failure patients with impaired kidney function resulting from poor perfusion as fosinopril can still be eliminated by the liver, preventing accumulation of the drug in the body. Fosinopril is de-esterified by the liver or gastrointestinal mucosa and is converted to its active form, fosinoprilat. Fosinoprilat competitively binds to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers peripheral vascular resistance, decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure, thus helping to alleviate the negative effects of AII on cardiac performance. == References ==",Fosinopril,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.417489309271332e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003649522550404072)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosinopril,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/fosinopril,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00492 ', [])"
1175,"('Lanolin', 'Stearyl palmitate', 'Octadecyl palmitate', 'Octadecyl hexadecanoate', 'Hexadecanoic acid, octadecyl ester')","Medical, Personal Care","Lanolin (from Latin lāna 'wool', and oleum 'oil'), also called wool fat, wool yolk, wool wax, sheep grease, sheep yolk, or wool grease, is a wax secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias have referred to lanolin as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as lanolin lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), it is not a true fat. Lanolin primarily consists of sterol esters instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin. Lanolin's role in nature is to protect wool and skin from climate and the environment; it also plays a role in skin (integumental) hygiene. Lanolin and its derivatives are used in the protection, treatment, and beautification of human skin. == Composition == A typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters (approximately 97% by weight) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols, lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons. An estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin, resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far. Lanolin’s complex composition of long-chain esters, hydroxyesters, diesters, lanolin alcohols, and lanolin acids means in addition to its being a valuable product in its own right, it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives, which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties. The main derivatisation routes include hydrolysis, fractional solvent crystallisation, esterification, hydrogenation, alkoxylation and quaternisation. Lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and skin treatment products. Hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids. Lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol (an important skin lipid) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years. Approximately 40% of the acids derived from lanolin are alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs). The use of AHAs in skin care products has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. Details of the AHAs isolated from lanolin can be seen in the table below. == Production == Crude lanolin constitutes about 5–25% of the weight of freshly shorn wool. The wool from one Merino sheep will produce about 250–300 ml of recoverable wool grease. Lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt, wool grease (crude lanolin), suint (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process by centrifuge separators, which concentrate it into a waxlike substance melting at approximately 38 °C (100 °F). == Applications == Lanolin and its many derivatives are used extensively in both the personal care (e.g., high value cosmetics, facial cosmetics, lip products) and health care sectors such as topical liniments. Lanolin is also found in lubricants, rust-preventive coatings, shoe polish, and other commercial products. Lanolin is a relatively common allergen and is often misunderstood as a wool allergy. However, allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use. Patch testing can be done if a lanolin allergy is suspected. It is frequently used in protective baby skin treatment and for sore nipples from breastfeeding but health authorities recommend alternative methods first, including nipple cleaning and improving baby positioning as well as expressing milk by hand. Lanolin is reported to have soothing properties but the lack of research leads to the previous recommendations being primary. Lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging from rustproof coatings to lubricants. Some sailors use lanolin to create slippery surfaces on their propellers and stern gear to which barnacles cannot adhere. Commercial products (e.g. Lanocote) containing up to 85% lanolin are used to prevent corrosion in marine fasteners, especially when two different metals are in contact with each other and saltwater. The water-repellent properties make it valuable in many applications as a lubricant grease where corrosion would otherwise be a problem. 7-Dehydrocholesterol from lanolin is used as a raw material for producing vitamin D3 by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Baseball players often use it to soften and break in their baseball gloves (shaving cream with lanolin is popularly used for this). Anhydrous liquid lanolin, combined with parabens, has been used in trials as artificial tears to treat dry eye. Anhydrous lanolin is also used as a lubricant for brass instrument tuning slides. Lanolin can also be restored to woollen garments to make them water and dirt repellent, such as for cloth diaper covers. Lanolin is also used in lip balm products such as Carmex. For some people, it can irritate the lips. Lanolin is sometimes used by people on continuous positive airway pressure therapy to reduce irritation with masks, particular nasal pillow masks that can often create sore spots in the nostrils. Lanolin is a popular additive to moustache wax, particularly 'extra-firm' varieties. Lanolin is used as a primary lubricating component in aerosol-based brass lubricants in the ammunition reloading process. Mixed warm 1:12 with highly concentrated ethanol (usually 99%), the ethanol acts as a carrier which evaporates quickly after application, leaving a fine film of lanolin behind to prevent brass seizing in resizing dies. Lanolin, when mixed with ingredients such as neatsfoot oil, beeswax and glycerol, is used in various leather treatments, for example in some saddle soaps and in leather care products. == Standards and legislation == In addition to general purity requirements, lanolin must meet official requirements for the permissible levels of pesticide residues. The Fifth Supplement of the United States Pharmacopoeia XXII published in 1992 was the first to specify limits for 34 named pesticides. A total limit of 40 ppm (i.e. 40 mg/kg) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use, with no individual limit greater than 10 ppm. A second monograph also introduced into the US Pharmacopoeia XXII in 1992 was entitled 'Modified Lanolin'. Lanolin conforming to this monograph is intended for use in more exacting applications, for example on open wounds. In this monograph, the limit of total pesticides was reduced to 3 ppm total pesticides, with no individual limit greater than 1 ppm. In 2000, the European Pharmacopoeia introduced pesticide residue limits into its lanolin monograph. This requirement, which is generally regarded as the new quality standard, extends the list of pesticides to 40 and imposes even lower concentration limits. Some very high-purity grades of lanolin surpass monograph requirements. New products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state, removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white, odourless, hypoallergenic lanolin. These ultra-high-purity grades of lanolin are ideally suited to the treatment of dermatological disorders such as eczema and on open wounds. Lanolin attracted attention owing to a misunderstanding concerning its sensitising potential. A study carried out at New York University Hospital in the early 1950s had shown about 1% of patients with dermatological disorders were allergic to the lanolin being used at that time. By one estimate, this simple misunderstanding of failing to differentiate between the general healthy population and patients with dermatological disorders exaggerates the sensitising potential of lanolin by 5,000–6,000 times. The European Cosmetics Directive, introduced in July 1976, contained a stipulation that cosmetics which contained lanolin should be labelled to that effect. This ruling was challenged immediately, and in the early 1980s, it was overturned and removed from the directive. Despite only being in force for a short period of time, this ruling did harm both to the lanolin industry and to the reputation of lanolin in general. The Cosmetics Directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions. Modern analytical methods have revealed lanolin possesses a number of important chemical and physical similarities to human stratum corneum lipids; the lipids which help regulate the rate of water loss across the epidermis and govern the hydration state of the skin. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy has shown that lanolin, like human stratum corneum lipids, consists of a mass of liquid crystalline material. Cross-polarised light microscopy has shown the multilamellar vesicles formed by lanolin are identical to those formed by human stratum corneum lipids. The incorporation of bound water into the stratum corneum involves the formation of multilamellar vesicles. Skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient (skin smoothing) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours. Lanolin applied to the skin at 2 mg/cm2 has been shown to reduce roughness by about 35% after one hour and 50% after two hours, with the overall effect lasting for considerably more than eight hours. Lanolin is also known to form semiocclusive (breathable) films on the skin. When applied daily at around 4 mg/cm2 for five consecutive days, the positive moisturizing effects of lanolin were detectable until 72 hours after final application. Lanolin may achieve some of its moisturizing effects by forming a secondary moisture reservoir within the skin. The barrier repair properties of lanolin have been reported to be superior to those produced by both petrolatum and glycerol. In a small clinical study conducted on volunteer subjects with terribly dry (xerotic) hands, lanolin was shown to be superior to petrolatum in reducing the signs and symptoms of dryness and scaling, cracks and abrasions, and pain and itch. In another study, a high purity grade of lanolin was found to be significantly superior to petrolatum in assisting the healing of superficial wounds. == References == == External links == MedlinePlus Encyclopedia: Lanolin poisoning",Lanolin,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.05460871383547783), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.318681188422488e-05), (' MED', -0.4361115097999573), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.00010914575977949426), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('P', -0.14304308593273163), ('ERSON', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.2186455882765586e-06), (',', -0.0006785474251955748), ('ĠINDU', -0.275260865688324), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.5759826302528381), ('ĠMED', -0.05375877395272255), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16025467216968536)])","('PERSONAL CARE', [('PERSON', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/lanolin?utm_source=openai), [lanolin.com](https://lanolin.com/industrial-use/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=177, start_index=27, title='Lanolin | Skin Care, Cosmetic Uses & Emollient | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/lanolin?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=177, start_index=27, title='Lanolin in industrial use: Functions and applications | LanisLanolin', type='url_citation', url='https://lanolin.com/industrial-use/?utm_source=openai')])"

In dogs subjected to 60-minute ischemia and 4-hour reperfusion, GAP-134 was administered 10 minutes before reperfusion as a bolus + intravenous (IV) infusion. The doses administered were 0.25 microg/kg bolus + 0.19 microg/kg per hour infusion; 2.5 microg/kg + 1.9 microg/kg per hour; 25 mg/kg + 19 mg/kg per hour; 75 mg/kg + 57 mg/kg per hour. Ventricular ectopy was quantified during reperfusion, including premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Total incidence of VT was reduced significantly with the 2 highest doses of GAP-134 (1.7 + 0.8; 2.2 + 1.4 events; P < .05) compared to controls (23.0 + 6.1). Total PVCs were reduced significantly from 11.1 + 1.6% in control animals to 2.0% + 0.7% and 1.8% + 0.8% after the 2 highest doses of GAP-134. Infarct size, expressed as percentage of left ventricle, was reduced significantly from 19.0% + 3.5% in controls to 7.9% + 1.5% and 7.1% + 0.8% (P < .05) at the 2 highest doses of GAP-134. GAP-134 is an effective antiarrhythmic agent with potential to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury. Gap junction uncoupling can alter conduction pathways and promote cardiac re-entry mechanisms that potentiate many supraventricular arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). Our objective was to determine whether GAP-134 [(2S,4R)-1-(2-aminoacetyl)-4-benzamido-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid], a small dipeptide gap junction modifier, can improve conduction and ultimately prevent AF/AFL. In rat atrial strips subjected to metabolic stress, GAP-134 prevented significantly conduction velocity slowing at 10 nM compared with vehicle (p < 0.01). In the canine sterile pericarditis model, conduction time (CT; n = 5), atrial effective refractory period (AERP; n = 3), and AF/AFL duration/inducibility (n = 16) were measured 2 to 3 days postoperatively in conscious dogs. CT was significantly faster after GAP-134 infusion (average plasma concentration, 250 nM) at cycle lengths of 300 ms (66.2 +/- 1.0 versus 62.0 +/- 1.0 ms; p < 0.001) and 200 ms (64.4 +/- 0.9 versus 61.0 +/- 1.3 ms; p < 0.001). No significant changes in AERP were noted after GAP-134 infusion. The mean number of AF/AFL inductions per animal was significantly decreased after GAP-134 infusion (2.7 +/- 0.6 versus 1.6 +/- 0.8; p < 0.01), with total AF/AFL burden being decreased from 12,280 to 6063 s. Western blot experiments showed no change in connexin 43 expression. At concentrations exceeding those described in the AF/AFL experiments, GAP-134 had no effect on heart rate, blood pressure, or any electrocardiogram parameters. In conclusion, GAP-134 shows consistent efficacy on measures of conduction and AF/AFL inducibility in the canine sterile pericarditis model. These findings, along with its oral bioavailability, underscore its potential antiarrhythmic efficacy. Rotigaptide (3) is an antiarrhythmic peptide that improves cardiac conduction by modifying gap-junction communication. Small molecule gap-junction modifiers with improved physical properties were identified from a Zealand Pharma peptide library using pharmaceutical profiling, established SAR around 3, and a putative pharmacophore model for rotigaptide. Activity of the compounds was confirmed in a mouse cardiac conduction block model of arrhythmia. Dipeptide 9f (GAP-134) was identified as a potent, orally active gap-junction modifier for clinical development.","(2s,4r)-1-(2-aminoacetyl)-4-benzamidopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002834395272657275), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00524122454226017)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([acs.figshare.com](https://acs.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Discovery_of_2_i_S_i_4_i_R_i_1_2_Aminoacetyl_4_benzamidopyrrolidine_2_carboxylic_Acid_Hydrochloride_GAP_134_sup_13_sup_an_Orally_Active_Small_Molecule_Gap_Junction_Modifier_for_the_Treatment_of_Atrial_Fibrillation/2875555?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=322, start_index=6, title='Discovery of (2S,4R)-1-(2-Aminoacetyl)-4-benzamidopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic Acid Hydrochloride (GAP-134)13, an Orally Active Small Molecule Gap-Junction Modifier for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation', type='url_citation', url='https://acs.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Discovery_of_2_i_S_i_4_i_R_i_1_2_Aminoacetyl_4_benzamidopyrrolidine_2_carboxylic_Acid_Hydrochloride_GAP_134_sup_13_sup_an_Orally_Active_Small_Molecule_Gap_Junction_Modifier_for_the_Treatment_of_Atrial_Fibrillation/2875555?utm_source=openai')])"

Dihydroartemisinin is the active metabolite of all artemisinin compounds (artemisinin, artesunate, artemether, etc.) and is also available as a drug in itself. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin and is widely used as an intermediate in the preparation of other artemisinin-derived antimalarial drugs. It is sold commercially in combination with piperaquine and has been shown to be equivalent to artemether/lumefantrine. == Medical use == Dihydroartemisinin is used to treat malaria, generally as a combination drug with piperaquine. In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, both dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine are very effective at treating malaria (high quality evidence). However, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine cures slightly more patients than artemether-lumefantrine, and it also prevents further malaria infections for longer after treatment (high quality evidence). Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine probably have similar side effects (moderate quality evidence). The studies were all conducted in Africa. In studies of people living in Asia, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at treating malaria (moderate quality evidence). Artesunate plus mefloquine probably causes more nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleeplessness, and palpitations than dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (moderate quality evidence). == Pharmacology and mechanism == The proposed mechanism of action of artemisinin involves cleavage of endoperoxide bridges by iron, producing free radicals (hypervalent iron-oxo species, epoxides, aldehydes, and dicarbonyl compounds) which damage biological macromolecules causing oxidative stress in the cells of the parasite. Malaria is caused by apicomplexans, primarily Plasmodium falciparum, which largely reside in red blood cells and itself contains iron-rich heme-groups (in the form of hemozoin). In 2015 artemisinin was shown to bind to a large number targets suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner. Recent mechanism research discovered that artemisinin targets a broad spectrum of proteins in the human cancer cell proteome through heme-activated radical alkylation. == Chemistry == Dihydroartemisinin has a low solubility in water of less than 0.1 g/L. Consequently, its use may result in side effects caused by minor, yet much more soluble, additives (excipients) such as Cremophor EL. The lactone of artemisinin could selectively be reduced with mild hydride-reducing agents, such as sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, and lithium borohydride to dihydroartemisinin (a lactol) in over 90% yield. It is a novel reduction, because normally lactones cannot be reduced with sodium borohydride under the same reaction conditions (0–5 ˚C in methanol). Reduction with LiAlH4 leads to some rearranged products. It was surprising to find that the lactone was reduced, but that the peroxy group survived. However, the lactone of deoxyartemisinin resisted reduction with sodium borohydride and could only be reduced with diisobutylaluminium hydride to the lactol deoxydihydroartimisinin. These results show that the peroxy group assists the reduction of lactone with sodium borohydride to a lactol, but not to the alcohol which is the over-reduction product. No clear evidence for this reduction process exists. == Society and culture == In combination with piperaquine, brands include: D-Artepp (GPSC) Artekin (Holleykin) Diphos (Genix Pharma) TimeQuin (Sami Pharma) Eurartesim (Sigma Tau; by Good Manufacturing Practices) Duocotecxin (Holley Pharm) Alone: Cotecxin (Zhejiang Holley Nanhu Pharmaceutical Co.) == Research == Accumulative research suggests that dihydroartemisinin and other artemisinin-based endoperoxide compounds may display activity as experimental cancer chemotherapeutics. Recent pharmacological evidence demonstrates that dihydroartemisinin targets human metastatic melanoma cells with induction of NOXA-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis that occurs downstream of iron-dependent generation of cytotoxic oxidative stress. == References == == Further reading ==",Artenimol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.878139538457617e-05), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0067496877163648605)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/artenimol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Artenimol Overview - Active Ingredient - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/artenimol?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive. Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms (L- and D-enantiomers), though only the L-isomer exists naturally. The salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates. The malate anion is a metabolic intermediate in the citric acid cycle. == Etymology == The word 'malic' is derived from Latin mālum, meaning 'apple'. The related Latin word mālus, meaning 'apple tree', is used as the name of the genus Malus, which includes all apples and crabapples; and is the origin of other taxonomic classifications such as Maloideae, Malinae, and Maleae. == Biochemistry == L-Malic acid is the naturally occurring form, whereas a mixture of L- and D-malic acid is produced synthetically. Malate plays an important role in biochemistry. In the C4 carbon fixation process, malate is a source of CO2 in the Calvin cycle. In the citric acid cycle, (S)-malate is an intermediate, formed by the addition of an -OH group on the si face of fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate via anaplerotic reactions. Malate is also synthesized by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate in the guard cells of plant leaves. Malate, as a double anion, often accompanies potassium cations during the uptake of solutes into the guard cells in order to maintain electrical balance in the cell. The accumulation of these solutes within the guard cell decreases the solute potential, allowing water to enter the cell and promote aperture of the stomata. == In food == Malic acid was first isolated from apple juice by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1785. Antoine Lavoisier in 1787 proposed the name acide malique, which is derived from the Latin word for apple, mālum—as is its genus name Malus. In German it is named Äpfelsäure (or Apfelsäure) after plural or singular of a sour thing from the apple fruit, but the salt(s) are called Malat(e). Malic acid is the main acid in many fruits, including apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, grapes, mirabelles, peaches, pears, plums, and quince, and is present in lower concentrations in other fruits, such as citrus. It contributes to the sourness of unripe apples. Sour apples contain high proportions of the acid. It is present in grapes and in most wines with concentrations sometimes as high as 5 g/L. It confers a tart taste to wine; the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness. The taste of malic acid is very clear and pure in rhubarb, a plant for which it is the primary flavor. It is also the compound responsible for the tart flavor of sumac spice. It is also a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as ""salt and vinegar"" flavored potato chips. The process of malolactic fermentation converts malic acid to much milder lactic acid. Malic acid occurs naturally in all fruits and many vegetables, and is generated in fruit metabolism. Malic acid, when added to food products, is denoted by E number E296. It is sometimes used with or in place of the less sour citric acid in sour sweets. These sweets are sometimes labeled with a warning stating that excessive consumption can cause irritation of the mouth. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, US and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed by its INS number 296). Malic acid contains 10 kJ (2.39 kilocalories) of energy per gram. == Production and main reactions == Racemic malic acid is produced industrially by the double hydration of maleic anhydride. In 2000, American production capacity was 5,000 tons per year. The enantiomers may be separated by chiral resolution of the racemic mixture. S-Malic acid is obtained by fermentation of fumaric acid. Self-condensation of malic acid in the presence of fuming sulfuric acid gives the pyrone coumalic acid: 2 HO2CCH(OH)CH2CO2H → HO2CC4H3O2 + 2 CO + 4 H2O Carbon monoxide and water are liberated during this reaction. Malic acid was important in the discovery of the Walden inversion and the Walden cycle, in which (−)-malic acid first is converted into (+)-chlorosuccinic acid by action of phosphorus pentachloride. Wet silver oxide then converts the chlorine compound to (+)-malic acid, which then reacts with PCl5 to the (−)-chlorosuccinic acid. The cycle is completed when silver oxide takes this compound back to (−)-malic acid.

1180,"('Lysipressin', 'Lysine vasopressin', '[lys8]-vasopressin', 'Syntopressin', 'Postacton')",Medical,"Human vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized from the AVP gene as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP. It then travels down the axon terminating in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure. A third function is possible. Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus, and may play an important role in social behavior, sexual motivation and pair bonding, and maternal responses to stress. Vasopressin induces differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis. It has a very short half-life, between 16 and 24 minutes. == Physiology == === Function === Vasopressin regulates the tonicity of body fluids. It is released from the posterior pituitary in response to hypertonicity and causes the kidneys to reabsorb solute-free water and return it to the circulation from the tubules of the nephron, thus returning the tonicity of the body fluids toward normal. An incidental consequence of this renal reabsorption of water is concentrated urine and reduced urine volume. AVP released in high concentrations may also raise blood pressure by inducing moderate vasoconstriction. AVP also may have a variety of neurological effects on the brain. It may influence pair-bonding in voles. The high-density distributions of vasopressin receptor AVPr1a in prairie vole ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation. A very similar substance, lysine vasopressin (LVP) or lypressin, has the same function in pigs and its synthetic version was used in human AVP deficiency, although it has been largely replaced by desmopressin. ==== Kidney ==== Vasopressin has three main effects which are: Increasing the water permeability of distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting tubules (CCT), as well as outer and inner medullary collecting duct (OMCD & IMCD) in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption and excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., antidiuresis. This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of collecting tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells. Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct. Acute increase of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of Henle. This adds to the countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water reabsorption later in the distal tubule and collecting duct. The hormone vasopressin also stimulates the activity of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate. ==== Central nervous system ==== Vasopressin released within the brain may have several actions: Vasopressin is released into the brain in a circadian rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Vasopressin released from posterior pituitary is associated with nausea. Recent evidence suggests that vasopressin may have analgesic effects. The analgesia effects of vasopressin were found to be dependent on both stress and sex. === Regulation === ==== Gene regulation ==== Vasopressin is regulated by AVP gene expression which is managed by major clock controlled genes. In this circadian circuit known as the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL), Per2 protein accumulates and is phosphorylated by CK1E. Per2 subsequently inhibits the transcription factors Clock and BMAL1 in order to reduce Per2 protein levels in the cell. At the same time, Per2 also inhibits the transcription factors for the AVP gene in order to regulate its expression, the expression of vasopressin, and other AVP gene products. Many factors influence the secretion of vasopressin: Ethanol (alcohol) reduces the calcium-dependent secretion of AVP by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals in rats. Angiotensin II stimulates AVP secretion, in keeping with its general pressor and pro-volumic effects on the body. Atrial natriuretic peptide inhibits AVP secretion, in part by inhibiting Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of AVP secretion. Cortisol inhibits secretion of antidiuretic hormone. === Production and secretion === The physiological stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of the plasma, monitored by the hypothalamus. A decreased arterial blood volume, (such as can occur in cirrhosis, nephrosis, and heart failure), stimulates secretion, even in the face of decreased osmolality of the plasma: it supersedes osmolality, but with a milder effect. In other words, the unloading of arterial baroreceptors when the arterial blood volume is low stimulates vasopressin secretion despite the presence of hypoosmolality (hyponatremia). The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. There are other sources of AVP, beyond the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. For example, AVP is also synthesized by parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN, transported and released at the median eminence, from which it travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue). === Vasopressin during surgery and anaesthesia === Vasopressin concentration is used to measure surgical stress for evaluation of surgical techniques. Plasma vasopressin concentration is elevated by noxious stimuli, predominantly during abdominal surgery, especially at gut manipulation, traction of viscera, as well as abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide during laparoscopic surgery. === Receptors === Types of AVP receptors and their actions: === Structure and relation to oxytocin === The vasopressins are peptides consisting of nine amino acids (nonapeptides). The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin (argipressin) is Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, with the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond and the C-terminus of the sequence converted to a primary amide. Lysine vasopressin (lypressin) has a lysine in place of the arginine as the eighth amino acid, and is found in pigs and some related animals, whereas arginine vasopressin is found in humans. The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions. The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The magnocellular neurons that secrete vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that secrete oxytocin, and are similar in many respects. The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions. Comparison of vasopressin and oxytocin neuropeptide families: == Medical use == Vasopressin is used to manage anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. Vasopressin is used to treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antidiuretic hormone. It is available as Pressyn. Vasopressin has off-label uses and is used in the treatment of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Vasopressin agonists are used therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin is used in conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, as well as for control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970. Vasopressin infusions are also used as second line therapy for septic shock patients not responding to fluid resuscitation or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine) to increase the blood pressure while sparing the use of catecholamines. These argipressins have much shorter elimination half-life (around 20 minutes) comparing to synthetic non-arginine vasopresines with much longer elimination half-life of many hours. Further, argipressins act on V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors which consequently lead to higher eGFR and lower vascular resistance in the lungs. A number of injectable arginine vasopressins are currently in clinical use in the United States and in Europe. === Pharmacokinetics === Vasopressin is administered through an intravenous device, intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action depends on the mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the extracellular fluid. It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys. Arginin vasopressins for use in septic shock are intended for intravenous use only. === Side effects === The most common side effects during treatment with vasopressin are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhoea, sweating, paleness, and flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are myocardial infarction and hypersensitivity. === Contraindications === The use of lysine vasopressin is contraindicated in the presence of hypersensitivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic kidney failure. It is recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease. === Interactions === alcohol - may lower the antidiuretic effect carbamazepine, chloropropamide, clofibrate, tricyclic antidepressants and fludrocortisone may raise the antidiuretic effect lithium, demeclocycline, heparin or norepinephrine may lower the antidiuretic effect vasopressor effect may be higher with the concurrent use of ganglionic blocking medications === Deficiency === Decreased AVP release (neurogenic — i.e. due to alcohol intoxication or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst). === Excess === Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) in turn can be caused by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs have been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists. == History == Vasopressin was elucidated and synthesized for the first time by Vincent du Vigneaud. == Animal studies == Evidence for an effect of AVP on monogamy vs polygamy comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin receptors in the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and polygamous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared. == Human studies == Vasopressin has shown nootropic effects on pain perception and cognitive function. Vasopressin also plays a role in autism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. == See also == Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Oxytocin Vasopressin receptor Vasopressin receptor antagonists Copeptin Anterior pituitary Hypothalamus Atrial natriuretic peptide: When the atrium stretches, blood pressure is considered to be increased and sodium is excreted to lower blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin system: When the blood flow through the juxtaglomerular apparatus decreases, blood pressure is considered low, and the adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone to increase sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct, thereby increasing blood pressure. Bainbridge reflex: In response to stretching of the right atrium wall, heart rate increases, lowering venous blood pressure. Baroreflex: When the stretch receptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus increase, the blood pressure is considered to be elevated and the heart rate decreases to lower blood pressure. == References == == Further reading ==",Lysine vasopressin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.47535163164138794), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.014165629632771015), (' MED', -0.002525245537981391), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.08032935857772827), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.023255230858922005), ('ĠEND', -0.004176110029220581), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006745306774973869)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([meshb.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008236&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='MeSH Browser', type='url_citation', url='https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008236&utm_source=openai')])"

It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed by the gut directly into the blood of the portal vein during digestion. The liver then converts most fructose and galactose into glucose for distribution in the bloodstream or deposition into glycogen. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name ""fructose"" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables. Commercially, fructose is derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and maize. High-fructose corn syrup is a mixture of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. Sucrose is a compound with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. All forms of fructose, including those found in fruits and juices, are commonly added to foods and drinks for palatability and taste enhancement, and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. As of 2004, about 240,000 tonnes of crystalline fructose were being produced annually. Excessive consumption of sugars, including fructose, (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) may contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, leading to metabolic syndrome. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated in 2011 that fructose may be preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on postprandial blood sugar levels, while also noting the potential downside that ""high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity"". The UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders, stating that ""there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake, at levels consumed in the normal UK diet, leads to adverse health outcomes independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars."" == Etymology == The word ""fructose"" was coined in 1857 from the Latin for fructus (fruit) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars, -ose. It is also called fruit sugar and levulose or laevulose, due to its ability to rotate plane polarised light in a laevorotary fashion (anti-clockwise/to the left) when a beam is shone through it in solution. Likewise, dextrose (an isomer of glucose) is given its name due to its ability to rotate plane polarised light in a dextrorotary fashion (clockwise/to the right). == Chemical properties == Fructose is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone. Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic six-membered structure, called β-d-fructopyranose, owing to the stability of its hemiketal and internal hydrogen-bonding. In solution, fructose exists as an equilibrium mixture of the tautomers β-d-fructopyranose, β-d-fructofuranose, α-d-fructofuranose, α-d-fructopyranose and keto-d-fructose (the non-cyclic form). The distribution of d-fructose tautomers in solution is related to several variables, such as solvent and temperature. d-Fructopyranose and d-fructofuranose distributions in water have been identified multiple times as roughly 70% fructopyranose and 22% fructofuranose. === Reactions === ==== Fructose and fermentation ==== Fructose may be anaerobically fermented by yeast and bacteria. Yeast enzymes convert sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but not lactose) to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon dioxide produced during fermentation will remain dissolved in water, where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid. The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in some fermented beverages, such as champagne. ==== Fructose and Maillard reaction ==== Fructose undergoes the Maillard reaction, non-enzymatic browning, with amino acids. Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the open-chain form than does glucose, the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose. Therefore, fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food palatability, as well as other nutritional effects, such as excessive browning, volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation, and formation of mutagenic compounds. ==== Dehydration ==== Fructose readily dehydrates to give hydroxymethylfurfural (""HMF"", C6H6O3), which can be processed into liquid dimethylfuran (C6H8O). This process, in the future, may become part of a low-cost, carbon-neutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants. == Physical and functional properties == === Sweetness of fructose === The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 1.2–1.8 times that of sucrose. However, it is the 6-membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar. Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form. Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However, it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5 °C as 50 °C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at higher temperatures. The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose, and the taste sensation reaches a peak (higher than that of sucrose), and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose. Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system. Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners. The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose, aspartame, or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components. === Fructose solubility and crystallization === Fructose has higher water solubility than other sugars, as well as other sugar alcohols. Fructose is, therefore, difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution. Sugar mixes containing fructose, such as candies, are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose. === Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy === Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners. Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low relative humidity (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used. === Freezing point === Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides, which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation. However, this characteristic may be undesirable in soft-serve or hard-frozen dairy desserts. === Fructose and starch functionality in food systems === Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during gelatinizing of starch, causing a greater final viscosity. Although some artificial sweeteners are not suitable for home baking, many traditional recipes use fructose. == Food sources == Natural sources of fructose include fruits, vegetables (including sugar cane), and honey. Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources. The highest dietary sources of fructose, besides pure crystalline fructose, are foods containing white sugar (sucrose), high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, molasses, maple syrup, fruit and fruit juices, as these have the highest percentages of fructose (including fructose in sucrose) per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients. Fructose exists in foods either as a free monosaccharide or bound to glucose as sucrose, a disaccharide. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose may all be present in food; however, different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars. The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, apples and pears contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for apricots the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose. Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to pediatricians because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause diarrhea in children. The cells (enterocytes) that line children's small intestines have less affinity for fructose absorption than for glucose and sucrose. Unabsorbed fructose creates higher osmolarity in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the Health Effects section. Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables. Sugarcane and sugar beet have a high concentration of sucrose, and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose. Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified, removing impurities; and concentrated by removing excess water. The end product is 99.9%-pure sucrose. Sucrose-containing sugars include common white sugar and powdered sugar, as well as brown sugar. ^A The carbohydrate figure is calculated in FoodData Central and does not always correspond to the sum of the sugars, the starch, and the ""dietary fiber"". All data with a unit of g (gram) are based on 100 g of a food item. The fructose/glucose ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of free fructose plus half sucrose by the sum of free glucose plus half sucrose. Fructose is also found in the manufactured sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is produced by treating corn syrup with enzymes, converting glucose into fructose. The common designations for fructose content, HFCS-42 and HFCS-55, indicate the percentage of fructose present in HFCS. HFCS-55 is commonly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, whereas HFCS-42 is used to sweeten processed foods, breakfast cereals, bakery foods, and some soft drinks. === Carbohydrate content of commercial sweeteners (percent on dry basis) === for HFCS, and USDA for fruits and vegetables and the other refined sugars. Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries. However, with the development of HFCS, a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries, particularly the United States. Contrary to the popular belief, however, with the increase of HFCS consumption, the total fructose intake relative to the total glucose intake has not dramatically changed. Granulated sugar is 99.9%-pure sucrose, which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose. The most commonly used forms of HFCS, HFCS-42, and HFCS-55, have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose, with minor differences. HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener. Therefore, despite the changes in the sweetener consumption, the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant. === Nutritional information === Providing 368 kcal per 100 grams of dry powder (table), fructose has 95% the caloric value of sucrose by weight. Fructose powder is 100% carbohydrates and supplies no other nutrients in significant amount (table). == Fructose digestion and absorption in humans == Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is a ketonic simple sugar and one of the three dietary monosaccharides absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the hepatic portal vein and is directed toward the liver. The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests active transport, because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient. However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via facilitated transport involving GLUT5 transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the enterocytes, assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2. === Capacity and rate of absorption === The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5 g to 50 g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake. Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities. When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide sucrose, absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the GLUT5 transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent cotransport of fructose. In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (>2.4 g/kg body wt) increase the transport proteins within three days of intake. === Malabsorption === Several studies have measured the intestinal absorption of fructose using the hydrogen breath test. These studies indicate that fructose is not completely absorbed in the small intestine. When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it is transported into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the colonic flora. Hydrogen is produced during the fermentation process and dissolves into the blood of the portal vein. This hydrogen is transported to the lungs, where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the hydrogen breath test. The colonic flora also produces carbon dioxide, short-chain fatty acids, organic acids, and trace gases in the presence of unabsorbed fructose. The presence of gases and organic acids in the large intestine causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and gastrointestinal pain. Exercise immediately after consumption can exacerbate these symptoms by decreasing transit time in the small intestine, resulting in a greater amount of fructose emptied into the large intestine. == Fructose metabolism == All three dietary monosaccharides are transported into the liver by the GLUT2 transporter. Fructose and galactose are phosphorylated in the liver by fructokinase (Km= 0.5 mM) and galactokinase (Km = 0.8 mM), respectively. By contrast, glucose tends to pass through the liver (Km of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5, fructose transporter, in skeletal muscle cells. === Fructolysis === The initial catabolism of fructose is sometimes referred to as fructolysis, in analogy with glycolysis, the catabolism of glucose. In fructolysis, the enzyme fructokinase initially produces fructose 1-phosphate, which is split by aldolase B to produce the trioses dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. Unlike glycolysis, in fructolysis the triose glyceraldehyde lacks a phosphate group. A third enzyme, triokinase, is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the gluconeogenic pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower glycolytic pathway to pyruvate. === Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde === The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver. Fructose 1-phosphate then undergoes hydrolysis by aldolase B to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes; DHAP can either be isomerized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. === Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate === The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis. It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation. Once liver glycogen is replenished, the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis. === Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate === Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the free fatty acid and glycerol moieties of plasma triglycerides. High fructose consumption can lead to excess pyruvate production, causing a buildup of Krebs cycle intermediates. Accumulated citrate can be transported from the mitochondria into the cytosol of hepatocytes, converted to acetyl CoA by citrate lyase and directed toward fatty acid synthesis. In addition, DHAP can be converted to glycerol 3-phosphate, providing the glycerol backbone for the triglyceride molecule. Triglycerides are incorporated into very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are released from the liver destined toward peripheral tissues for storage in both fat and muscle cells. == Potential health effects == In 2022, the European Food Safety Authority stated that there is research evidence that fructose and other added free sugars may be associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases: the risk is moderate for obesity and dyslipidemia (more than 50%), and low for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes (from 15% to 50%) and hypertension. EFSA further stated that clinical research did ""not support a positive relationship between the intake of dietary sugars, in isocaloric exchange with other macronutrients, and any of the chronic metabolic diseases or pregnancy-related endpoints assessed"" but advised ""the intake of added and free sugars should be as low as possible in the context of a nutritionally adequate diet."" === Cardiometabolic diseases === When fructose is consumed in excess as a sweetening agent in foods or beverages, it may be associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders that are part of metabolic syndrome. === Compared with sucrose === Fructose was found to increase triglycerides in type-2 but not type-1 diabetes and moderate use of it has previously been considered acceptable as a sweetener for diabetics, possibly because it does not trigger the production of insulin by pancreatic β cells. For a 50 gram reference amount, fructose has a glycemic index of 23, compared with 100 for glucose and 60 for sucrose. Fructose is also 73% sweeter than sucrose at room temperature, allowing diabetics to use less of it per serving. Fructose consumed before a meal may reduce the glycemic response of the meal. Fructose-sweetened food and beverage products cause less of a rise in blood glucose levels than do those manufactured with either sucrose or glucose. == See also == Hereditary fructose intolerance Inverted sugar syrup == References == == External links == Media related to Fructose at Wikimedia Commons",Levulose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -5.633853652398102e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.0014175852993503213), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.2519574761390686), ('ĠEND', -0.026319488883018494), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00411295285448432)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL; https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100047649?result=4&rskey=xRICb5,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/levulose,https://decs.bvsalud.org/en/ths/resource/?id=5768 ', [])"
1183,"('Gestrinone', 'R 2323', 'Dimetriose', 'Nemestran', 'Dimetrose')",Medical,"Gestrinone, sold under the brand names Dimetrose and Nemestran among others, is a medication which is used in the treatment of endometriosis. It has also been used to treat other conditions such as uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding and has been investigated as a method of birth control. Gestrinone is used alone and is not formulated in combination with other medications. It is taken by mouth or in through the vagina. Side effects of gestrinone include menstrual abnormalities, estrogen deficiency, and symptoms of masculinization like acne, seborrhea, breast shrinkage, increased hair growth, and scalp hair loss, among others. Gestrinone has a complex mechanism of action, and is characterized as a mixed progestogen and antiprogestogen, a weak androgen and anabolic steroid, a weak antigonadotropin, a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor, and a functional antiestrogen. Gestrinone was introduced for medical use in 1986. It has been used extensively in Europe but appears to remains marketed only in a few countries throughout the world. The medication is not available in the United States. Due to its anabolic effects, the use of gestrinone in competition has been banned by the International Olympic Committee. == Medical uses == Gestrinone is approved for and used in the treatment of endometriosis. It is described as similar in action and effect to danazol, which is also used in the treatment of endometriosis, but is reported to have fewer androgenic side effects in comparison. Gestrinone has also been used to shrink uterine fibroids and to reduce menorrhagia. Due to its antigonadotropic effects and ability to inhibit ovulation, gestrinone has been studied as a method of hormonal birth control in women. Large studies across thousands of menstrual cycles have found it to be effective in preventing pregnancy. However, although effective, the pregnancy rate in the largest study conducted was 4.6 per 100 woman-years, which is too high of a failure rate for the medication to be recommended as a safe method of birth control. The medication has also been investigated as an emergency post-coital contraceptive. == Contraindications == The medication is contraindicated in pregnancy, during lactation, and in patients with severe cardiac, chronic kidney disease or liver disease. It is also contraindicated in patients who experienced metabolic and/or vascular disorders during previous estrogen or progestogen therapy, or who are allergic to the medication. The medication is contraindicated in children. == Side effects == The main side effects of gestrinone are androgenic and antiestrogenic in nature. In one study of 2.5 mg oral gestrinone twice per week in women, it caused seborrhea in 71%, acne in 65%, breast hypoplasia in 29%, hirsutism in 9%, and scalp hair loss in 9%. In another study, the rate of androgenic side effects was similarly 50%. Other androgenic side effects that have been reported include oily skin and hair, weight gain, voice deepening, and clitoral enlargement, the latter two of which as well as hirsutism may be irreversible. Gestrinone also inhibits gonadotropin secretion and causes amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea in a high percentage of women. Similarly, circulating estradiol levels have been found to be reduced by 50%, which may result in estrogen deficiency and associated symptoms. Studies of 2.5 mg oral gestrinone twice per week have found a rate of amenorrhea of 50 to 58%, while a study of 5 mg oral gestrinone per day found a rate of amenorrhea of 100%. It has been found that vaginal gestrinone shows fewer androgenic side effects and weight gain than oral gestrinone with equivalent effectiveness in endometriosis. Gestrinone appears to show similar effectiveness to danazol in the treatment of endometriosis but with fewer side effects, in particular androgenic side effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of gestrinone is complex and multifaceted. It shows high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), as well as lower affinity for the androgen receptor (AR). The medication has mixed progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity – that is, it is a partial agonist of the PR or a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) – and is a weak agonist of the AR, or an anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Similarly to danazol, gestrinone acts as a weak antigonadotropin via activation of the PR and AR in the pituitary gland and suppresses the mid-cycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during the menstrual cycle without affecting basal levels of these hormones. It also inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis and, via activation of the AR in the liver, decreases circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby resulting in increased levels of free testosterone. In addition to the PR and AR, gestrinone has been found to bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) with relatively ""avid"" affinity. The medication has functional antiestrogenic activity in the endometrium. Unlike danazol, gestrinone does not appear to bind to SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). === Pharmacokinetics === Gestrinone is bound to albumin in the circulation. It is metabolized in the liver mainly by hydroxylation. Four hydroxylated active metabolites with reduced activity relative to gestrinone have been found to be formed. The elimination half-life of gestrinone is 27.3 hours. The medication is excreted in urine and bile. == Chemistry == Gestrinone, also known as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone, as well as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one or as 13β-ethyl-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is a member of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Gestrinone is the C18 methyl derivative of norgestrienone (17α-ethynyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) and the δ9,11 analogue of levonorgestrel (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and is also known as ethylnorgestrienone due to the fact that it is the C13β ethyl variant of norgestrienone. It is also the C17α ethynyl and C18 methyl derivative of the AAS trenbolone. The androgenic properties of gestrinone are more exploited in its derivative tetrahydrogestrinone (THG; 17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), a designer steroid which is far more potent as both an AAS and progestogen in comparison. THG was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003. == History == Gestrinone was introduced for medical use in 1986. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Gestrinone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is also known by its developmental code names A-46745 and R-2323 (or RU-2323). === Brand names === Gestrinone is or has been marketed under the brand names Dimetriose, Dimetrose, Dinone, Gestrin, and Nemestran. === Availability === Gestrinone is or has been marketed in Europe, Australia, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, though notably not in the United States. == References == == Further reading ==",Dimetrose,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005190217634662986), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011333961971104145)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestrinone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Gestrinone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestrinone?utm_source=openai')])"

In one example, this has been done in recombinant Escherichia coli, using amylase of Bacillus subtilis and sucrose phosphorylase of Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Structurally it is the α-anomer of arbutin (β-arbutin), and like the β-form it is an enzyme inhibitor of human tyrosinase. == Uses == α-Arbutin is used in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries for its skin lightening effects, treatment of hyperpigmentation, and as a possibly safer alternative to hydroquinone. It may also possess antioxidant properties, which can protect the skin from free radical damage. It is used in products aimed at fading solar lentigo, freckles, melasma, and other forms of hyperpigmentation where excess melanin is a concern, providing a more even skin complexion. For this purpose, concentrations of up to 2% α-arbutin are found in face creams and serums and 0.5% in body creams. α-Arbutin showed a significant reduction in melanin synthesis in cultured human melanoma cells and a three-dimensional human skin model, with melanin synthesis reduced to 40% of the control, indicating its potency as a skin lightening agent without affecting cell viability. == Mechanism of action == α-Arbutin's mechanism of action as a skin lightening agent is primarily through the competitive enzymatic inhibition of tyrosinase, leading to a decrease in melanin production without affecting the mRNA gene expression of tyrosinase. It is more potent an inhibitor of tyrosinase than arbutin. α-Arbutin directly inhibits the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase, which is essential for melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase catalyzes the first two steps in melanin production: the hydroxylation of tyrosine to l-DOPA and the oxidation of l-DOPA to dopaquinone. By inhibiting tyrosinase, α-arbutin reduces the formation of melanin in melanocytes. α-Arbutin does not affect the gene expression of tyrosinase mRNA. This means that while α-arbutin inhibits the activity of the tyrosinase enzyme, it does not decrease the enzyme's production at the genetic level. This reduction in melanin leads to lighter skin tones and can help in the treatment of hyperpigmentation disorders. The efficacy of α-arbutin in reducing melanin synthesis was demonstrated in cultured human melanoma cells and a three-dimensional human skin model, where it effectively reduced melanin synthesis. == Safety and regulation == α-Arbutin is generally considered safe for topical application in cosmetic products. However, its usage concentrations in the European Union (EU) are restricted by the European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety to 2% in facial creams and 0.5% in body lotions. == References ==",Alpha-arbutin,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE', [('PERSON', -0.001293808571062982), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.5771257281303406), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -6.890059739816934e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -4.076874756719917e-05), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ĠCARE', -2.1815061700181104e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008635558187961578)])","('PERSONAL CARE', [('PERSON', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE; ([dsm-firmenich.com](https://www.dsm-firmenich.com/en/businesses/perfumery-beauty/beauty-care/products/alpha-arbutin.html?utm_source=openai), [cosmetics.specialchem.com](https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci-ingredients/alpha-arbutin?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301119/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=362, start_index=15, title='ALPHA-ARBUTIN', type='url_citation', url='https://www.dsm-firmenich.com/en/businesses/perfumery-beauty/beauty-care/products/alpha-arbutin.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=362, start_index=15, title='Alpha-Arbutin (Antioxidant): Cosmetic Ingredient INCI', type='url_citation', url='https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci-ingredients/alpha-arbutin?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=362, start_index=15, title='Arbutin as a Skin Depigmenting Agent with Antimelanogenic and Antioxidant Properties - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8301119/?utm_source=openai')])"
1186,"('Alpha-ketoisocaproic acid', 'Ketoleucine', 'Alpha-ketoisocaproate', 'Pentanoic acid, 4-methyl-2-oxo-', 'Alpha-oxoisocaproate')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","α-Ketoisocaproic acid (α-KIC), also known as 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and its conjugate base and carboxylate, α-ketoisocaproate, are metabolic intermediates in the metabolic pathway for L-leucine. Leucine is an essential amino acid, and its degradation is critical for many biological duties. α-KIC is produced in one of the first steps of the pathway by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase by transferring the amine on L-leucine onto alpha ketoglutarate, and replacing that amine with a ketone. The degradation of L-leucine in the muscle to this compound allows for the production of the amino acids alanine and glutamate as well. In the liver, α-KIC can be converted to a vast number of compounds depending on the enzymes and cofactors present, including cholesterol, acetyl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, and other biological molecules. Isovaleryl-CoA is the main compound synthesized from ɑ-KIC. α-KIC is a key metabolite present in the urine of people with Maple syrup urine disease, along with other branched-chain amino acids. Derivatives of α-KIC have been studied in humans for their ability to improve physical performance during anaerobic exercise as a supplemental bridge between short-term and long-term exercise supplements. These studies show that α-KIC does not achieve this goal without other ergogenic supplements present as well. α-KIC has also been observed to reduce skeletal muscle damage after eccentrically biased resistance exercises in people who do not usually perform those exercises. == Biological activity == === Supplements === α-KIC has been studied as a nutritional supplement to aid in the performance of strenuous physical activity. Studies have shown that taking ɑ-KIC and its derivatives before acute physical activity led to an increase in muscle work by 10%, as well as a decrease in muscle fatigue during the early phase of the physical activity. When taken with other supplements over a two-week period, such as beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), participants reported delayed onset of muscle soreness, as well as other positive effects such as increased muscle girth. It is important to note that studies have also suggested that ɑ-KIC taken alone did not have any significant positive impacts on physical performance, so it should be taken in conjunction with other ergogenic substances. ɑ-KIC is not available as a supplement on its own, but its decarboxylated form HMB is available in calcium salt capsules or powder. === Applications === The biochemical implications of α-KIC are largely connected to other biochemical pathways. Protein Synthesis, skeletal muscle regeneration, and skeletal muscle proteolysis have all been noted to change when ɑ-KIC is taken. There is not much research into the specific mechanisms taking part in these processes, but there is a noticeable correlation between ɑ-KIC ingestion and increased skeletal muscle protein synthesis, regeneration, and proteolysis. == Toxicity == Multiple studies have demonstrated that there have been no adverse effects on humans nor animals that ingested α-KIC or HMB. In patients with maple syrup urine disease, who are unable to metabolize the branched chain alpha keto acids, α-KIC is believed to be one of the key mediators of neurotoxicity. == Medical use == Branched-chain alpha-keto acids such as α-KIC are found in high concentrations in the urine of people who suffer from Maple Syrup Urine Disease. This is disease is caused by a partial branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase deficiency, which leads to a buildup of branched-chain alpha-keto acids, including α-KIC and HMB. These keto-acids build up in the liver, and since limited isovaleryl-CoA can be produced, these keto-acids must be excreted in the urine as α-KIC, HMB, and many other similar keto acids. Flare-ups in people who have this condition are caused due to poor diet. Symptoms of Maple Syrup Urine Disease include sweet smelling urine, irritability, lethargy, and in serious cases edema of the brain, apnea, coma, or respiratory failure. Treatment includes lowering leucine intake and a specialized diet to make up for the lack of leucine ingestion. == Leucine metabolism == == References ==",Alpha-oxoisocaproate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.00012320445966906846), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017982252757064998), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.6932682394981384), (' PERSONAL', -0.24934421479701996), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.15703988075256348), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.3245540432981215e-05), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.00194110709708184), ('ĠFOOD', -0.20355404913425446), (',', -0.10024216771125793), ('ĠMED', -0.0508543960750103), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014176612719893456)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.005235529970377684), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; ([foodb.ca](https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB030510?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03229?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=171, start_index=27, title='Showing Compound 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (FDB030510) - FooDB', type='url_citation', url='https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB030510?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=171, start_index=27, title='alpha-Ketoisocaproic acid: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03229?utm_source=openai')])"

1190,"('Goserelin (acetate)', 'Goserelin', 'Zoladex', 'Decapeptide i', 'Goserelina')",Medical,"Goserelin, sold under the brand name Zoladex among others, is a medication which is used to suppress production of the sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen), particularly in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is an injectable gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist). Structurally, it is a decapeptide. It is the natural GnRH decapeptide with two substitutions to inhibit rapid degradation. Goserelin stimulates the production of the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in a non-pulsatile (non-physiological) manner. This causes the disruption of the endogenous hormonal feedback systems, resulting in the down-regulation of testosterone and estrogen production. It was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Goserelin is used to treat hormone-sensitive cancers of the breast (in pre- and peri-menopausal women) and prostate, and some benign gynaecological disorders (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning). In addition, goserelin is used in assisted reproduction and in the treatment of precocious puberty. It may also be used in the treatment of male-to-female transgender people. == Side effects == Goserelin may cause bone pain, hot flashes, headache, stomach upset, depression, difficulty urinating (isolated cases), weight gain, swelling and tenderness of breasts (infrequent), decreased erections and reduced sexual desire. Bone pain can be managed symptomatically, and erectile dysfunction can be treated by vardenafil (Levitra) or other similar oral therapies, although they will not treat the reduced sexual desire. The rates of gynecomastia with goserelin have been found to range from 1 to 5%. Short-term memory impairment has also been reported in women and may in some cases be severe, but this effect disappears gradually once treatment is discontinued.< == Pharmacology == Goserelin is a synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Bioavailability is almost complete by injection. Goserelin is poorly protein-bound and has a serum elimination half-life of two to four hours in patients with normal renal function. The half-life increases with patients with impaired renal function. There is no significant change in pharmacokinetics in subjects with liver failure. After administration, peak serum concentrations are reached in about two hours. It rapidly binds to the GnRH receptor cells in the pituitary gland thus leading to an initial increase in production of luteinizing hormone and thus leading to an initial increase in the production of corresponding sex hormones. This initial flare may be treated by co-prescribing/co-administering an androgen receptor antagonist such as bicalutamide (Casodex). Eventually, after a period of about 14–21 days, production of LH is greatly reduced due to receptor downregulation, and sex hormones are generally reduced to castrate levels. == Chemistry == Goserelin is a GnRH analogue and decapeptide. It is provided as the acetate salt. == Society and culture == === Names === Goserelin is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name. == References ==",Zoladex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.098061486321967e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015174552099779248)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goserelin,https://www.drugs.com/pro/zoladex.html,https://www.zoladex.com/ ', [])"
