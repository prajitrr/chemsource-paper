797,"('Z-vad-fmk', 'Z-vad(oh)-fmk', 'Caspase inhibitor vi', 'Z-val-ala-asp-ch2f', 'Benzyloxycarbonyl-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone')",Medical," Dr. Robert Smith is one of the pioneers in histochemistry. One of his most important achievements is the recognition of proteolysis as a major physiological and pathophysiological process. As a consequence, he developed selective fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates and specific inhibitors of proteases that allow the (histochemical) analysis of protease activity. One of the latest successes is the design of Z-VAD-fluoromethylketone (FMK), the specific caspase inhibitor, that is a key compound for studies on apoptosis. Its development was originally meant for therapeutic use but unforeseen cytotoxicity of a metabolic derivative of the FMK compound disabled its potential as a drug. However, as a tool for fundamental research it is a great success. The history of Z-VAD-FMK is an example of the creative brain and the tireless perseverance of Robert Smith for which histochemistry and cytochemistry owes him so much. This history of Z-VAD-FMK is a well-deserved tribute at the occasion of his 70th birthday. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of bovine semen with the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK), before or after freezing on semen quality. After the initial assessment, sperm from 4 bulls were pooled (Experiment 1) and cryopreserved in BioXcell containing 0, 20 and 100 μM Z-VAD-FMK. After thawing semen viability, motility, membrane integrity, as well as DNA fragmentation and ΔΨm were evaluated. In Experiment 2, bovine frozen/thawed sperm were incubated for 1 hr with 0, 20 and 100 µM Z-VAD-FMK before assessing the semen quality. The treatment with Z -VAD-FMK before cryopreservation improved post-thawing sperm motility compared to the control group (p < .05), while no differences were recorded in sperm viability and membrane integrity among groups (on average 86.8 ± 1.5 and 69.1 ± 1.4, respectively). Interestingly, at the highest concentration, DNA fragmentation decreased (p < .05), while the percentage of spermatozoa with high ΔΨm increased (p < .05). The results of Experiment 2 showed that 1-hr treatment with Z-VAD-FMK did not affect sperm motility and viability (on average 63.4 ± 5.8 and 83.7.1 ± 1.2, respectively). However, Z-VAD-FMK improved sperm membrane integrity (p < .05) and at the highest concentration tested decreased the proportion of sperm showing DNA fragmentation (p < .05). No differences were recorded in the percentage of spermatozoa with high ΔΨm (on average 57.0 ± 11.4). In conclusion, the treatment with 100 µM of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK before freezing increased bovine sperm mass motility and ΔΨm, while decreasing sperm DNA fragmentation. Treatment of semen after thawing with 100 µM Z-VAD-FMK improved sperm membrane integrity and reduced DNA fragmentation. It is recognized that ovarian follicular atresia is associated with apoptosis, and the most important effector of cell death is caspase-3. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of anti-apoptotic drug Z-VAD-FMK on in vitro follicle growth in the domestic dog.

The structures of the acquired compounds were deduced through modern spectroscopic techniques including HR-ESI-MS,  S-flurbiprofen plaster (SFPP) is a novel topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) patch. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of SFPP in knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients compared to diclofenac gel. This study was a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, non-inferiority phase III trial. There were 311 enrolled patients treated by SFPP or diclofenac gel for 2 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the knee pain when rising from the specially arranged chair assessed by visual analog scale (rVAS). The other efficacy outcomes were clinical symptoms, pain on walking, global assessment by both investigator and patient, and use/non-use of the rescue drugs during the treatment period. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated as the safety outcome. The least-squares mean (95% CI) of ΔrVAS at the end of the study was 41.52 (39.16-43.88) mm in the SFPP group and 36.01 (33.69-38.33) mm in the diclofenac gel group, with a between-group difference of 5.51 (2.20-8.82), indicating non-inferiority. There were statistically significant differences between the groups in rVAS, clinical symptoms, pain on walking, and the global assessment by both investigator and patient. The incidence rate of AEs in the SFPP group was 5.8%, and there was no statistically significant difference from that in the diclofenac gel group (5.2%). Most of the AEs were mild, and no AE led to discontinuation. Non-inferiority of SFPP to diclofenac gel was demonstrated in the efficacy for pain on rising from a chair.

For several years, research and trials for the drug were conducted by Myriad Genetics, to investigate its potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease; that investigation concluded in June 2008 when the company announced it would discontinue development of the compound. == Mechanism of action == At proposed therapeutic concentrations, this molecule lacks anti-inflammatory activity, and does not inhibit either cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzymes. Only the S-enantiomers of arylpropionic acid NSAID can potently inhibit COX, whereas the R-enantiomers exert almost no COX activity. R-Flurbiprofen is inefficiently converted into S-flurbiprofen, with 1.5% of the R-enantiomer undergoing bioinversion to the S-form. Although this compound lacks activity against COX, studies have shown that this drug is a potent reducer of levels of beta amyloid, the main constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, and therefore there was interest in this drug as a therapeutic agent. == Clinical trials == In 2005, Myriad Genetics reported the results of its Phase II clinical trial of Flurizan; it was the largest ever Alzheimer's drug treatment trial using R-flurbiprofen. Patients were split into three treatment groups, receiving placebo, 400 or 800 mg R-flurbiprofen twice daily for a year. Result from this trial showed that the drug was well tolerated, and positive trends were observed with the 800 mg twice-daily dose in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. A subgroup of patients that were diagnosed with mild disease, and had high plasma drug levels had significantly less decline in two primary behavioral outcomes (Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL = Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - ADL) and Global Function (CDR-SB = Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes)). Approximately 80 patients enrolled in the optional follow-on study showed continuing benefits with R-flurbiprofen, with increasing positive trends over this period for all primary outcomes after 24 months. On March 5, 2007 Myriad reported final results of the two-year trial, showing that 42% of those 80 patients showed improvement or no decline in one or more of the three primary endpoints of cognition, global function and activities of daily living, compared to a typical 10% of patients on placebo. A Phase III clinical study evaluated 800 mg R-flurbiprofen twice-daily versus placebo for 18 months exclusively in 1800 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. This second trial concluded in February 2008 with results reported in the summer. After Phase III testing, which included nearly 1,700 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease treated for 18 months with either Flurizan or placebo, Myrial Genetics concluded that the drug did not improve thinking ability or the ability of patients to carry out daily activities significantly more than those patients with placebo. Peter Meldrum, the chief executive of Myriad, announced on June 30, 2008, that the company will no longer be developing Flurizan.

802,"('Fludrocortisone acetate', 'Scherofluron', 'Cortineff', 'Florinef acetate', 'Alflorone acetate')",Medical,"Fludrocortisone, sold under the brand name Florinef among others, is a corticosteroid used to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia, postural hypotension, and adrenal insufficiency. In adrenal insufficiency, it is generally taken together with hydrocortisone. Fludrocortisone is taken by mouth and is most commonly used in its acetate form. Common side effects of fludrocortisone include high blood pressure, swelling, heart failure, and low blood potassium. Other serious side effects can include low immune-system function, cataracts, muscle weakness, and mood changes. Whether use of fludrocortisone during pregnancy is safe for the fetus is unknown. Fludrocortisone is mostly a mineralocorticoid, but it also has glucocorticoid effects. Fludrocortisone was patented in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Fludrocortisone has been used in the treatment of cerebral salt-wasting syndrome. It is used primarily to replace the missing hormone aldosterone in various forms of adrenal insufficiency such as Addison's disease and the classic salt-wasting (21-hydroxylase deficiency) form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Due to its effects on increasing Na+ levels, and therefore blood volume, fludrocortisone is the first-line of treatment for orthostatic intolerance, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It can be used to treat low blood pressure. Fludrocortisone is also a confirmation test for diagnosing Conn's syndrome (aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma), the fludrocortisone suppression test. Loading the patient with fludrocortisone would suppress serum aldosterone level in a normal patient, whereas the level would remain elevated in a Conn's patient. The fludrocortisone suppression test is an alternative to the NaCl challenge (which would use normal saline or salt tablets). == Side effects == Use of fludrocortisone can lead to one or more of the following side effects: Sodium and water retention Swelling due to fluid retention (edema) High blood pressure (hypertension) Headache Low blood potassium level (hypokalemia) Muscle weakness Fatigue Increased susceptibility to infection Impaired wound healing Increased sweating Increased hair growth (hirsutism) Thinning of skin and stretch marks Disturbances of the gut such as indigestion (dyspepsia), distention of the abdomen and ulceration (peptic ulcer) Decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures of the bones Insomnia Depression Weight gain Raised blood sugar level Changes to the menstrual cycle Cataracts Raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma) Increased pressure in the skull (intracranial pressure) == Pharmacology == Fludrocortisone is a corticosteroid and acts as a powerful mineralocorticoid, along with some additional but comparatively very weak glucocorticoid activity. Relative to cortisol, it is said to have 10 times the glucocorticoid potency but 250 to 800 times the mineralocorticoid potency. Fludrocortisone acetate is a prodrug of fludrocortisone, which is the active form of the drug. Plasma renin, sodium, and potassium are checked through blood tests to verify that the correct dosage is reached. == Chemistry == Fludrocortisone, also known as 9α-fluorocortisol (9α-fluorohydrocortisone) or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a halogenated derivative of cortisol (11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione). Specifically, it is a modification of cortisol with a fluorine atom substituted in place of one hydrogen atom at the C9α position. Fluorine is a good bioisostere for hydrogen because it is similar in size, with the major difference being in its electronegativity. The acetate form of fludrocortisone, fludrocortisone acetate, is the C21 acetate ester of fludrocortisone, and is hydrolyzed into fludrocortisone in the body. == History == Fludrocortisone was described in the literature in 1953 and was introduced for medical use (as the acetate ester) in 1954. It was the first synthetic corticosteroid to be marketed, and followed the introduction of cortisone in 1948 and hydrocortisone (cortisol) in 1951. Fludrocortisone was also the first fluorine-containing pharmaceutical drug to be marketed. == Society and culture == === Generic name === Fludrocortisone is the generic name of fludrocortisone and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, whereas fludrocortisone acetate is the generic name of fludrocortisone acetate and its USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Fludrocortisone is marketed mainly under the brand names Astonin and Astonin-H, whereas the more widely used fludrocortisone acetate is sold mainly as Florinef, but also under several other brand names including Cortineff, Florinefe, and Fludrocortison. === Availability === Fludrocortisone is marketed in Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Romania, and Spain, whereas fludrocortisone acetate is more widely available throughout the world and is marketed in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, various other European countries, Australia, Japan, China, Brazil, and many other countries. == References ==",Cortineff,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013934595335740596), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001940988120622933)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludrocortisone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Fludrocortisone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludrocortisone?utm_source=openai')])"

Smoothened (Smo) is a connecting protein among the Ihh signaling pathway that triggers glioma-associated oncogene homologue 1 (Gli1) to active the hypertrophic process. In this study, we aimed to examine a new inhibitor of Smo in the prevention of chondrocyte hypertrophy during OA. We collected human joint cartilage from the OA patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Chondrocytes in different OA degrees were isolated and divided them into mild and severe groups. Alginate beads (ABs) was used to establish a chondrocyte hypertrophy model. The expression of type X collagen, MMP-13, Runx-2, type II collagen, SOX-9, and aggrecan were determined using immunofluorescence, Western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to assess the viability of chondrocytes. ABs treatment accelerated the process of chondrocyte hypertrophy and upregulated the expression of type X collagen, Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), Runx-2 but decreased type II collagen, SOX-9, and aggrecan both in protein and mRNA levels, which abolished by the present of Taladegib with the activation of Smo and Gli1. However, in the severe OA chondrocytes, Taladegib lost the ability to reverse hypertrophic chondrocytes to a healthy state and made no sense to the expression of type X collagen and Gli1. Our results reveal Taladegib as a novel drug in controlling chondrocyte hypertrophy depending on Smo blocking, which plays a vital role in the homeostasis of cartilage and the development of OA. Besides, we found that Taladegib only works in the previous stage of chondrocytes hypertrophy but not in the later of the process. Background This phase I dose-escalation study investigated the safety of the Smoothened inhibitor taladegib in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods Patients received taladegib orally once daily for 28-day cycles, using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation method. The primary objective was the safety and tolerability of taladegib at doses up to the global recommended dose (400 mg). Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics, changes in skin glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) transcript levels, and antitumor activity. Results Nineteen patients received treatment (100 mg: 3; 200 mg: 3; 400 mg: 13). No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed at doses of 100 mg or 200 mg; 3 of the 9 patients evaluable for DLTs at the 400 mg dose level experienced DLTs (thrombocytopenia: 1; decreased appetite: 2). The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were dysgeusia (13/19, 68.4%), decreased appetite (12/19, 63.2%), nausea (9/19, 47.4%), fatigue (9/19, 47.4%), and vomiting (6/19, 31.6%). The pharmacokinetic profile suggested that exposure to taladegib was higher in Japanese than non-Japanese patients, possibly related to differences in body weight and/or drug formulation. At all dose levels, a high level of inhibition of skin Gli1 transcript levels was observed after 15 and 30 days of exposure to taladegib. Partial response was achieved by 1 patient (basal cell carcinoma of the skin) and stable disease by 4 patients. Conclusions Taladegib doses of 100 mg and 200 mg, but not the global recommended dose of 400 mg, were well tolerated in this population of Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors.",Taladegib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008781032636761665), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860231652855873)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://endeavorbiomedicines.com/endeavor-biomedicines-completes-enrollment-in-phase-2a-clinical-trial-of-env-101-taladegib-for-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf/,https://www.biospace.com/endeavor-biomedicines-completes-enrollment-in-phase-2a-clinical-trial-of-env-101-taladegib-for-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis-ipf,https://www.orpha.net/en/drug/substance/513127 ', [])"

It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include fatigue, headache, nausea, and trouble sleeping. Side effects are generally more common in interferon-containing regimens.: 7 Sofosbuvir may reactivate hepatitis B in those who have been previously infected. In combination with ledipasvir, daclatasvir or simeprevir, it is not recommended with amiodarone due to the risk of an abnormally slow heartbeat. Sofosbuvir is in the nucleotide analog family of medications and works by blocking the hepatitis C NS5B protein. Sofosbuvir was discovered in 2007 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Initial HCV treatment === In 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America jointly published a recommendation for the management of hepatitis C. In this recommendation, sofosbuvir used in combination with other drugs is part of all first-line treatments for HCV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and is also part of some second-line treatments. Sofosbuvir in combination with velpatasvir is recommended for all genotypes with a cure rate greater than 90%, and close to 100% in most cases. The duration of treatment is typically 12 weeks. Sofosbuvir is also used with other medications and longer treatment durations, depending on specific circumstances, genotype and cost-effectiveness–based perspective. For example, for the treatment of genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 hepatitis C infections, sofosbuvir can be used in combination with the viral NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir. In genotype 2 and 3 HCV infections, sofosbuvir can be used in combination with daclatasvir. For the treatment of cases with cirrhosis or liver transplant patients, weight-based ribavirin is sometimes added. Peginterferon with or without sofosbuvir is not recommended in an initial HCV treatment. Compared to previous treatments, sofosbuvir-based regimens provide a higher cure rate, fewer side effects, and a two- to four-fold reduction in therapy duration. Sofosbuvir allows most people to be treated successfully without the use of peginterferon, an injectable drug with severe side effects that is a key component of older drug combinations for the treatment of hepatitis C virus. === Prior failed treatment === For people who have experienced treatment failure with some form of combination therapy for hepatitis C infection, one of the next possible steps would be retreatment with sofosbuvir and either ledipasvir or daclatasvir, with or without weight-based ribavirin. The genotype and particular combination therapy a person was on when the initial treatment failed are also taken into consideration when deciding which combination to use next. The duration of retreatment can range from 12 weeks to 24 weeks depending on several factors, including which medications are used for the retreatment, whether the person has liver cirrhosis or not, and whether the liver damage is classified as compensated cirrhosis or decompensated cirrhosis. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not sofosbuvir poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. However, ribavirin, a medication that is often given together with sofosbuvir to treat hepatitis C, is assigned a Pregnancy Category X (contraindicated in pregnancy) by the FDA. Pregnant women with hepatitis C who take ribavirin have shown some cases of birth defects and death in their fetus. It is recommended that sofosbuvir/ribarivin combinations be avoided in pregnant females and their male sexual partners in order to reduce harmful fetal defects caused by ribavirin. Females who could potentially become pregnant should undergo a pregnancy test 2 months prior to starting the sofosbuvir/ribavirin/peginterferon combination treatment, monthly throughout the duration of the treatment, and six months post-treatment to reduce the risk of fetal harm in case of accidental pregnancy. It is unknown whether sofosbuvir and ribavirin pass into breastmilk; therefore, it is recommended that the mother does not breastfeed during treatment with sofosbuvir alone or in combination with ribavirin. == Contraindications == There are no specific contraindications for sofosbuvir when used alone. However, when used in combination with ribavirin or peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, or others, the contraindications applicable to these agents are applied. == Side effects == Sofosbuvir used alone and in combination with other drugs such as ribavirin with or without a peginterferon has a good safety profile. Common side effects are fatigue, headache, nausea, rash, irritability, dizziness, back pain, and anemia. Most side effects are more common in interferon-containing regimens as compared to interferon-free regimens. For example, fatigue and headache are nearly reduced by half, influenza-like symptoms are reduced to 3–6% as compared to 16–18%, and neutropenia is almost absent in interferon-free treatment.: 7 Sofosbuvir may reactivate hepatitis B in those who have been previously infected. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting sofosbuvir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation. == Interactions == Sofosbuvir (in combination with ledipasvir, daclatasvir or simeprevir) should not be used with amiodarone due to the risk of abnormally slow heartbeats. Sofosbuvir is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a transporter protein that pumps drugs and other substances from intestinal epithelium cells back into the gut. Therefore, inducers of intestinal P-glycoprotein, such as rifampicin and St. John's wort, could reduce the absorption of sofosbuvir. In addition, coadministration of sofosbuvir with anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, oxcarbazepine), antimycobacterials (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine), and the HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir and ritonavir is expected to decrease sofosbuvir concentration. Thus, coadministration is not recommended. The interaction between sofosbuvir and a number of other drugs, such as ciclosporin, darunavir/ritonavir, efavirenz, emtricitabine, methadone, raltegravir, rilpivirine, tacrolimus, or tenofovir disoproxil, were evaluated in clinical trials and no dose adjustment is needed for any of these drugs. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Sofosbuvir inhibits the hepatitis C NS5B protein. Sofosbuvir appears to have a high barrier to the development of resistance. Sofosbuvir is a prodrug of the Protide type, whereby the active phosphorylated nucleotide is granted cell permeability and oral bioavailability. It is metabolized to the active antiviral agent GS-461203 (2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate). GS-461203 serves as a defective substrate for the NS5B protein, which is the viral RNA polymerase, thus acts as an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis. Although sofosbuvir has a 3' hydroxyl group to act as a nucleophile for an incoming NTP, a similar nucleotide analogue, 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methylcytidine, is proposed to act as a chain terminator because the 2' methyl group of the nucleotide analogue causes a steric clash with an incoming NTP. Sofosbuvir may act in a similar way. === Pharmacokinetics === Sofosbuvir is only administered orally. The peak concentration after oral administration is 0.5–2 hours post-dose, regardless of initial dose. Peak plasma concentration of the main circulating metabolite GS-331077 occurs 2–4 hours post-dose. GS-331077 is the pharmacologically inactive nucleoside. Plasma protein binding of sofosbuvir is 61–65%, while GS-331077 has minimal binding. Sofosbuvir is activated in the liver to the triphosphate GS-461203 by hydrolysis of the carboxylate ester by either of the enzymes cathepsin A or carboxylesterase 1, followed by cleaving of the phosphoramidate by the enzyme histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), and subsequent repeated phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation creates the inactive metabolite GS-331077. The half life of sofosbuvir is 0.4 hours, and the half life of GS-331077 is 27 hours.Following a single 400 mg oral dose of sofosbuvir, 80% is excreted in urine, 14% in feces, and 2.5% in expired air recovery. However, of the urine recovery 78% was the metabolite (GS-331077) and 3.5% was sofosbuvir. == Chemistry == Prior to the discovery of sofosbuvir, a variety of nucleoside analogs had been examined as antihepatitis C treatments, but these exhibited relatively low potency. This low potency arose in part because the enzymatic addition of the first of the three phosphate groups of the triphosphate is slow. The design of sofosbuvir, based on the ProTide approach, avoids this slow step by building the first phosphate group into the structure of the drug during synthesis. Additional groups are attached to the phosphorus to temporarily mask the two negative charges of the phosphate group, thereby facilitating entry of the drug into the infected cell. The NS5B protein is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase critical for the viral reproduction cycle. == History == Sofosbuvir was discovered in 2007 by Michael J. Sofia, a scientist at Pharmasset, and the drug was first tested in people in 2010. In 2011, Gilead Sciences bought Pharmasset for about $11 billion. Gilead submitted the New Drug Application for sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin in April 2013, and in October 2013 it received the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation. In December 2013, the FDA approved sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin for oral dual therapy of HCV genotypes 2 and 3, and for triple therapy with injected pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and RBV for treatment-naive people with HCV genotypes 1 and 4. Two months before, the FDA had approved another drug, simeprevir, as a hepatitis C treatment. In 2014, the fixed dose combination drug sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, the latter a viral NS5A inhibitor, was approved; it had also been granted breakthrough status. Prior to the availability of sofosbuvir, hepatitis C treatments involved 6 to 12 months of treatment with an interferon-based regimen. This regimen provided cure rates of 70% or less and was associated with severe side effects, including anemia, depression, severe rash, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. As sofosbuvir clinical development progressed, physicians began to ""warehouse"" people in anticipation of its availability. Sofosbuvir's U.S. launch was the fastest of any new drug in history. == Society and culture == Sofosbuvir is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. === Economics === Following its approval by the FDA in 2013, the price of sofosbuvir as quoted in various media sources in 2014 ranged from $84,000 to $168,000 depending on course of treatment in the U.S. and £35,000 in the United Kingdom for a 12-week regimine, causing considerable controversy. Sofosbuvir was more affordable in Japan and South Korea at approximately $300 and $5900 respectively for a 12-week treatment, with each government covering 99% and 70% of the cost respectively. In 2014, Gilead announced it would work with generic manufacturers in 91 developing countries to produce and sell sofosbuvir, and that it would sell a name brand version of the product in India for approximately $300 per course of treatment; it had signed agreements with generic manufacturers by September 2015. ==== United States ==== Since its launch, the price of sofosbuvir declined as more competitors entered the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) market. In 2020, the price for a course of sofosbuvir was $64,693 in the United States. In 2014, the list price of a 12-week combination treatment with a sofosbuvir-based regimen ranged from US$84,000 to $94,000. In April 2014, U.S. House Democrats Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone Jr., and Diana DeGette wrote Gilead Sciences Inc. questioning the $84,000 price for sofosbuvir. They specifically asked Gilead CEO John Martin to ""explain how the drug was priced, what discounts are being made available to low-income patients and government health programs, and the potential impact to public health by insurers blocking or delaying access to the medicine because of its cost."" Sofosbuvir is cited as an example of how specialty drugs present both benefits and challenges. Sofosbuvir also is an excellent example of both the benefit and the challenge of specialty medications. On one hand, this agent offers up to a 95% response rate as part of an interferon-free treatment regimen for hepatitis C. Generally speaking, it is more effective and better tolerated than alternative treatments. Unfortunately, the current per pill cost—$1,000—results in an $84,000 treatment course, creating barriers to therapy for many. Patients, providers, and payors alike have expressed outrage, and the debate has even drawn the attention of the US Congress. Despite these concerns, sofosbuvir rapidly has become a top seller in the United States... In February 2015, Gilead announced that due in part to negotiated discounts with pharmacy benefit managers and legally mandated discounts to government payers, the average discount-to-list price in 2014 was 22%. The company estimated that the average discount in 2015 would be 46%. According to the California Technology Assessment Forum, a panel of academic pharmacoeconomic experts, representatives of managed care organizations, and advocates for people with hepatitis, a 46% discount would bring the average price of treatment to about $40,000, at which price sofosbuvir-based treatment regimens represent a ""high value"" for people and healthcare systems. Because of sofosbuvir's high price in the United States, by 2017, some states—such as Louisiana—were withholding the medicine from Medicaid patients with hepatitis until their livers were severely damaged. This puts ""patients at increased risk of medical complications"" and contributes to the ""transmission of the hepatitis C virus"". In an article published in May 2016 in Health Affairs, the authors proposed the invocation of the federal ""government patent use"" law which would enable the government to procure ""important patent-protected"" drugs at lower prices while compensating ""the patent-holding companies reasonable royalties ... for research and development."" By July 2017, Louisiana's health secretary Rebekah Gee, who described Louisiana as America's ""public-health-crisis cradle"", was investigating the use of the ""government patent use"" as a strategy. ==== Japan and South Korea ==== Unlike other comparable Western developed countries, sofosbuvir is far more affordable in Japan and South Korea at approximately $300 and $2165 cost to patients respectively for a 12-week treatment, as each government covers 99% and 70% of the original cost respectively. ==== Germany ==== In Germany, negotiations between Gilead and health insurers led to a price of €41,000 for 12 weeks of treatment. This is the same price previously negotiated with the national healthcare system in France, except that additional discounts and rebates apply in France depending on the volume of sales and the number of treatment failures. ==== Switzerland ==== In Switzerland, the price is fixed by the government every three years. The price in 2016 was CHF 16,102.50 (about 1:1 to the US dollar) for 24 pills of 400 mg. ==== United Kingdom ==== In 2020, the originator price per course of sofosbuvir was £35,443. In 2013, the price in the United Kingdom was expected to be £35,000 for a 12-weeks course. NHS England established 22 Operational Delivery Networks to roll out delivery, which was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in 2015, and proposes to fund 10,000 courses of treatment in 2016–17. Each was given a ""run rate"" of how many people they were allowed to treat, and this was the NHS's single biggest new treatment investment in 2016. ==== Croatia ==== As of 2015, sofosbuvir is included on the list of essential medications in Croatia and its cost is fully covered by the Croatian Health Insurance Fund. As a result of negotiations with the manufacturer, only therapies with successful outcome would be paid by the Fund with the rest being covered by the manufacturer. ==== India ==== In July 2014, Gilead Sciences filed a patent for sofosbuvir in India. If the office of the controller general of patents had granted it, Gilead would have obtained exclusive rights to produce and sell sofosbuvir in the country. However, in January 2015, the Indian Patent Office rejected Gilead's application. Gilead's lawyers moved the Delhi High Court against this decision. That decision was overturned on appeal in February 2015. In the meantime, it granted Indian companies voluntary licenses (VLs), which allowed them to make and sell in a selected few countries at a discounted price. This agreement also granted 7% of the royalties to Gilead. However, the list of countries open to Indian firms under this agreement excluded 73 million people with hepatitis C. ==== Developing world ==== In 2014, Gilead announced it would seek generic licensing agreements with manufacturers to produce sofosbuvir in 91 developing countries, which contained 54% of the world's HCV-infected population. Gilead also said it would sell a name brand version of the product in India for $300 per course of treatment, approximately double a third party estimate of the minimum achievable cost of manufacture. It had signed licenses with generic manufacturers by September 2015. The leader of one Indian activist group called this move inadequate, but nine companies launched products, which ""unleashed a fierce marketing war"", according to India's The Economic Times. In Egypt, which had the world's highest incidence of hepatitis C, Gilead offered sofosbuvir at the discounted price of $900 to the Egyptian government. The government in turn made it free to patients. Later, Gilead licensed a generic version to be available in Egypt. The Access to Medicine Index ranked Gilead first among the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical countries in the Pricing, Manufacturing and Distribution category in both 2013 and 2014, citing Gilead's ""leading performance in equitable pricing."" In contrast, Jennifer Cohn of Doctors Without Borders and the organization Doctors of the World criticized the price of sofosbuvir as reflecting ""corporate greed"" and ignoring the needs of people in developing countries. In Algeria, as of 2011 about 70,000 people were infected with hepatitis C. As of August 2015, Gilead had licensed its partners in India to sell sofosbuvir in Algeria. It had been criticized for not making the drug available in middle-income countries including Algeria prior to that. == Controversies == The price has generated considerable controversy. In 2017, the range of costs per treatment varied from about $84,000 to about $50. === Patent challenges === In February 2015, it was reported that Doctors of the World had submitted an objection to Gilead's patent at the European Patent Office, claiming that the structure of sofosbuvir is based on already known molecules. In particular, Doctors of the World argued that the Protide technology powering sofosbuvir was previously invented by the Chris McGuigan team at Cardiff University in the UK, and that the Gilead drug is not therefore inventive. The group filed challenges in other developing countries as well. These challenges were unsuccessful. === Medical tourism === Due to the high cost of sofosbuvir in the U.S., as of 2016 increasing numbers of Americans with hepatitis C were traveling to India to purchase the drug. Similarly, increasing numbers of Chinese were also traveling to India to purchase sofosbuvir, which had not yet been approved for sale in China by the country's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). == Research == Combinations of sofosbuvir with NS5A inhibitors, such as daclatasvir, ledipasvir or velpatasvir, have shown sustained virological response rates of up to 100% in people infected with HCV. Most studies indicate that the efficacy rate is between 94% and 97%; much higher than previous treatment options. That treatments could be conducted at very low costs was demonstrated by Hill and coworkers who presented data on 1,160 patients who used generic versions of solfosbuvir, ledipasvir, plus daclatasvir from suppliers in India, Egypt, China and other countries and reported over 90% success at costs of about $50 per therapy. Sofosbuvir has also been tested against other viruses such as the Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). === DIY Home Synthesis === At DEF CON 32, Mixæl Swan Laufer, a representative of the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective, presented a talk titled ""Eradicating Hepatitis C with BioTerrorism."" The presentation argued that advancements in open-source tools and chemistry enable individuals to synthesize certain medications, such as Sovaldi, at home, potentially bypassing high pharmaceutical costs. During the talk, Laufer demonstrated tools and techniques used by the collective to synthesize pharmaceuticals, showcasing examples of the medications created. To illustrate the efficacy and accessibility of the process, he consumed a dose of Sovaldi onstage, despite not having Hepatitis C, as a symbolic gesture of the drug's claimed safety. == See also == AT-527—a similar drug developed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Tenofovir alafenamide—a nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor that uses similar phosphoramidate prodrug technology Remdesivir—a nucleotide analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor originally intended to treat hepatitis C that uses similar phosphoramidate prodrug technology and displays very similar PK. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017).

Increased c-Myc expression induces oncogenic stress that can trigger apoptosis through the MDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Since the great majority of T-ALL cases carry inactivating mutations upstream in this pathway but maintain wildtype MDM2 and TP53, we hypothesized that T-ALL would be selectively sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. Treatment with idasanutlin, an MDM2 inhibitor, induced only modest apoptosis in T-ALL cells but upregulated the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain genes BAX and BBC3, prompting us to evaluate the combination of idasanutlin with BH3 mimetics. Combination treatment with idasanutlin and navitoclax, a potent Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, induces more consistent and potent synergistic killing of T-ALL PDX lines in vitro than venetoclax, a Bcl-2 specific inhibitor. Moreover, a marked synergic response to combination treatment with idasanutlin and navitoclax was seen in vivo in all four T-ALL xenografts tested, with a significant increase in overall survival in the combination treatment group. Collectively, these preclinical data show that the combination of idasanutlin and navitoclax is highly active in T-ALL and may merit consideration in the clinical setting. This phase 1b trial (NCT02670044) evaluated venetoclax-idasanutlin in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for cytotoxic chemotherapy. Two-dimensional dose escalation (DE, n = 50) was performed for venetoclax daily with idasanutlin on days 1 to 5 in 28-day cycles, followed by dosing schedule optimization (n = 6) to evaluate reduced venetoclax schedules (21-/14-day dosing). Common adverse events (occurring in ≥40% of patients) included diarrhea (87.3% of patients), nausea (74.5%), vomiting (52.7%), hypokalemia (50.9%), and febrile neutropenia (45.5%). During DE, across all doses, composite complete remission (CRc; CR + CR with incomplete blood count recovery + CR with incomplete platelet count recovery) rate was 26.0% and morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) rate was 12%. For anticipated recommended phase 2 doses (venetoclax 600 mg + idasanutlin 150 mg; venetoclax 600 mg + idasanutlin 200 mg), the combined CRc rate was 34.3% and the MLFS rate was 14.3%. Pretreatment IDH1/2 and RUNX1 mutations were associated with higher CRc rates (50.0% and 45.0%, respectively). CRc rate in patients with TP53 mutations was 20.0%, with responses noted among those with co-occurring IDH and RUNX1 mutations. In 12 out of 36 evaluable patients, 25 emergent TP53 mutations were observed; 22 were present at baseline with low TP53 variant allele frequency (median 0.0095% [range, 0.0006-0.4]). Venetoclax-idasanutlin showed manageable safety and encouraging efficacy in unfit patients with R/R AML. IDH1/2 and RUNX1 mutations were associated with venetoclax-idasanutlin sensitivity, even in some patients with co-occurring TP53 mutations; most emergent TP53 clones were preexisting. Our findings will aid ongoing/future trials of BCL-2/MDM2 inhibitor combinations.

807,"('Fenoldopam (mesylate)', 'Fenoldopam methanesulfonate', 'Fenoldopam', 'Fenoldopamum [latin]', 'Fenoldopamum')",Medical,"Fenoldopam mesylate (Corlopam) is a drug and synthetic benzazepine derivative which acts as a selective D1 receptor partial agonist. Fenoldopam is used as an antihypertensive agent. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 1997. == Indications == Fenoldopam is used as an antihypertensive agent postoperatively, and also intravenously (IV) to treat a hypertensive crisis. Since fenoldopam is an intravenous agent with minimal adrenergic effects that improves renal perfusion, in theory it could be beneficial in hypertensive patients with concomitant chronic kidney disease. It can cause reflex tachycardia, but it is dependent on the infusion of the drug. == Pharmacology == Fenoldopam causes arterial/arteriolar vasodilation leading to a decrease in blood pressure by activating peripheral D1 receptors. It decreases afterload and also promotes sodium excretion via specific dopamine receptors along the nephron. The renal effect of fenoldopam and dopamine may involve physiological antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney. In contrast to dopamine, fenoldopam is a selective D1 receptor agonist with no effect on beta adrenoceptors, although there is evidence that it may have some alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist activity. D1 receptor stimulation activates adenylyl cyclase and raises intracellular cyclic AMP, resulting in vasodilation of most arterial beds, including renal, mesenteric, and coronary arteries. to cause a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Fenoldopam has a rapid onset of action (4 minutes) and short duration of action (< 10 minutes) and a linear dose–response relationship at usual clinical doses. == Side effects == Adverse effects include headache, flushing, nausea, hypotension, reflex tachycardia, and increased intraocular pressure. == Contraindications, warnings and precautions == Fenoldopam mesylate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may rarely cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and asthma in susceptible people. Fenoldopam mesylate administration should be undertaken with caution to patients with glaucoma or raised intraocular pressure as fenoldopam raises intraocular pressure. Concomitant use of fenoldopam with a beta-blocker should be avoided if possible, as unexpected hypotension can result from beta-blocker inhibition of sympathetic-mediated reflex tachycardia in response to fenoldopam. == References ==",Fenoldopam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.8729025871143676e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001977394800633192)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenoldopam, www.rxreasoner.com/substances/fenoldopam, www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra010253 ', [])"

809,"('Tafamidis', 'Vyndamax', 'Tafamidis [usan:inn]', 'Tafamidisum', 'Tafamidis-meglumine')",Medical,"Tafamidis, sold under the brand names Vyndaqel and Vyndamax, is a medication used to delay disease progression in adults with certain forms of transthyretin amyloidosis. It can be used to treat both hereditary forms, familial amyloid cardiomyopathy and familial amyloid polyneuropathy, as well as wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis, which formerly was called senile systemic amyloidosis. It works by stabilizing the quaternary structure of the protein transthyretin. In people with transthyretin amyloidosis, transthyretin falls apart and forms clumps called (amyloid) that harm tissues including nerves and the heart. The US Food and Drug Administration considers tafamidis to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical use == Tafamidis is used to delay nerve damage in adults who have transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, or heart disease in adults who have transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. It is taken by mouth. Women should not get pregnant while taking it and should not breastfeed while taking it. People with familial amyloid polyneuropathy who have received a liver transplant should not take it. An alternative treatment is acoramidis. == Adverse effects == More than 10% of people in clinical trials had one or more of urinary tract infections, vaginal infections, upper abdominal pain, or diarrhea. == Interactions == Tafamidis does not appear to interact with cytochrome P450 but it inhibits ATP-binding cassette super-family G member 2, so is likely to affect the levels of certain drugs including methotrexate, rosuvastatin, and imatinib. It also inhibits organic anion transporter 1 and organic anion transporter 3/solute carrier family 22 member 8 so is likely to interact with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that rely on those transporters. == Pharmacology == Tafamidis is a pharmacological chaperone that stabilizes the correctly folded tetrameric form of the transthyretin protein by binding in one of the two thyroxine-binding sites of the tetramer. In people with familial amyloid polyneuropathy, the individual monomers fall away from the tetramer, misfold, and aggregate; the aggregates harm nerves. The maximum plasma concentration is achieved around two hours after dosing; in plasma it is almost completely bound to proteins. Based on preclinical data, it appears to be metabolized by glucuronidation and excreted via bile; in humans, around 59% of a dose is recovered in feces, and approximately 22% in urine. == Chemistry == The chemical name of tafamidis is 2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid. The molecule has two crystalline forms and one amorphous form; it is manufactured in one of the possible crystalline forms. It is marketed as a meglumine salt. It is slightly soluble in water. == History == The laboratory of Jeffery W. Kelly at The Scripps Research Institute began looking for ways to inhibit transthyretin fibril formation in the 1990s.: 210 Tafamidis was eventually discovered by Kelly's team using a structure-based drug design strategy; the chemical structure was first published in 2003. In 2003, Kelly co-founded a company called FoldRx with Susan Lindquist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Whitehead Institute, and FoldRx developed tafamidis up through submitting an application for marketing approval in Europe in early 2010. FoldRx was acquired by Pfizer later that year. Tafamidis was approved by the European Medicines Agency in November 2011, to delay peripheral nerve impairment in adults with transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the application for marketing approval in 2012, on the basis that the clinical trial did not show efficacy based on a functional endpoint, and requested further clinical trials. In May 2019, the FDA approved two tafamidis preparations, Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis), for the treatment of transthyretin-mediated cardiomyopathy. The drug was approved in Japan in 2013; regulators there made the approval dependent on further clinical trials showing better evidence of efficacy. The FDA approved tafamidis meglumine based primarily on evidence from a clinical trial of 441 adult patients conducted at 60 sites in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Great Britain, and the United States. There was one trial that evaluated the benefits and side effects of tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either tafamidis (either 20 or 80 mg) or placebo for 30 months. About 90% of patients in the trial were taking other drugs for heart failure (consistent with the standard of care). The European Medicines Agency designated tafamidis an orphan medicine and the Food and Drug Administration also designated tafamidis meglumine as an orphan drug. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Tafamidis was approved in the European Union in 2011 for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and in Japan in 2013. In the United States, it was rejected for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy because the Food and Drug Administration saw insufficient evidence for its efficacy. Tafamidis can also be used to treat transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. It was approved for the treatment of this form of the disease in the United States in 2019 and in the European Union in 2020. In the United States, there are two approved preparations: tafamidis meglumine (Vyndaqel) and tafamidis (Vyndamax). The two preparations have the same active moiety, tafamidis, but they are not substitutable on a milligram to milligram basis. Tafamidis (Vyndamax) and tafamidis meglumine (Vyndaqel) were approved for medical use in Australia in March 2020. Tafamidis is available in a total of 64 countries. === Economics === Pfizer reported revenue of US$3.321 billion for Vyndaqel in 2023. == References == == Further reading ==",Vyndamax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.179073458653875e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010394509445177391)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/vyndamax.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=77, start_index=9, title='Vyndamax: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/vyndamax.html?utm_source=openai')])"
810,"('Linezolid', 'Zyvox', '(s)-n-((3-(3-fluoro-4-morpholinophenyl)-2-oxooxazolidin-5-yl)methyl)acetamide', 'Zyvoxid', 'Zyvoxam')",Medical,"Linezolid is an antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may be used for a variety of other infections including drug-resistant tuberculosis. It is used either by injection into a vein or by mouth. When given for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe antibiotic. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods it may cause nerve damage, including optic nerve damage, which may be irreversible. As a protein synthesis inhibitor, linezolid works by suppressing bacterial protein production. This either stops growth or results in bacterial death. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the initiation of protein production, rather than one of the later steps. As of 2014, bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained low. Linezolid is a member of the oxazolidinone class of medications. Linezolid was discovered in the mid-1990s, and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies linezolid as critically important for human medicine. Linezolid is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == The main use of linezolid is the treatment of severe infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics; it should not be used against bacteria that are sensitive to drugs with a narrower spectrum of activity, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. In both the popular press and the scientific literature, linezolid has been called a ""reserve antibiotic""—one that should be used sparingly so that it will remain effective as a drug of last resort against potentially intractable infections. In the United States, the indications for linezolid use approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, with or without bacterial invasion of the bloodstream; nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired) and community-acquired pneumonia caused by S. aureus or S. pneumoniae; complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including diabetic foot infection, unless complicated by osteomyelitis (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by S. pyogenes or S. aureus. The manufacturer advises against the use of linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA. In the United Kingdom, pneumonia and cSSSIs are the only indications noted in the product labeling. Linezolid appears to be as safe and effective for use in children and newborns as it is in adults. === Skin and soft tissue infections === A large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found linezolid to be more effective than glycopeptide antibiotics (such as vancomycin and teicoplanin) and beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and smaller studies appear to confirm its superiority over teicoplanin in the treatment of all serious Gram-positive infections. In the treatment of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis. Some authors have recommended that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as co-trimoxazole with rifampicin or clindamycin) be tried before linezolid in the treatment of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it. === Pneumonia === No significant difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present. U.S. guidelines recommend either linezolid or vancomycin as the first-line treatment for hospital-acquired (nosocomial) MRSA pneumonia. Some studies have suggested that linezolid is better than vancomycin against nosocomial pneumonia, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by MRSA, perhaps because the penetration of linezolid into bronchial fluids is much higher than that of vancomycin. Several issues in study design have been raised, however, calling into question results that suggest the superiority of linezolid. Regardless, linezolid's advantages include its high oral bioavailability—which allows easy switching to oral therapy—and the fact that poor kidney function is not an obstacle to use. In contrast, achieving the correct dosage of vancomycin in patients with kidney failure is very difficult. === Other === It is traditionally believed that so-called ""deep"" infections—such as osteomyelitis or infective endocarditis—should be treated with bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. Low- to medium-quality evidence is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary. In combination with other drugs, linezolid has been used to treat tuberculosis. The optimal dose for this purpose has not been established. In adults, daily and twice-daily dosing have been used to good effect. Many months of treatment are often required, and the rate of adverse effects is high regardless of dosage. There is not enough reliable evidence of efficacy and safety to support this indication as a routine use. Linezolid has been studied as an alternative to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye. ==== Infections of the central nervous system ==== In animal studies of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, linezolid was found to penetrate well into cerebrospinal fluid, but its effectiveness was inferior to that of other antibiotics. There does not appear to be enough high-quality evidence to support the routine use of linezolid to treat bacterial meningitis. Nonetheless, it has been used successfully in many cases of central nervous system infection—including meningitis—caused by susceptible bacteria, and has also been suggested as a reasonable choice for this indication when treatment options are limited or when other antibiotics have failed. The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend linezolid as the first-line drug of choice for VRE meningitis, and as an alternative to vancomycin for MRSA meningitis. Linezolid appears superior to vancomycin in treating community-acquired MRSA infections of the central nervous system, although very few cases of such infections have been published (as of 2009). ==== Catheter-related infections ==== In March 2007, the FDA reported the results of a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009. Linezolid was associated with significantly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, the study found that 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected. === Specific populations === In adults and children over the age of 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug. Linezolid is in U.S. pregnancy category C, meaning there have been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown. === Spectrum of activity === Linezolid is effective against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains a thick layer of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5 mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment. Linezolid is considered bacteriostatic against most organisms—that is, it stops their growth and reproduction without actually killing them—but has some bactericidal (killing) activity against streptococci. Some authors have noted that, despite its bacteriostatic effect in vitro, linezolid ""behaves"" as a bactericidal antibiotic in vivo because it inhibits the production of toxins by staphylococci and streptococci. It also has a post-antibiotic effect lasting one to four hours for most bacteria, meaning that bacterial growth is temporarily suppressed even after the drug is discontinued. ==== Gram-negative bacteria ==== Linezolid has no clinically significant effect on most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against Pasteurella multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections. ==== Comparable antibiotics ==== Linezolid's spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria is similar to that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include glycopeptide antibiotics such as teicoplanin (trade name Targocid), dalbavancin (Dalvance), oritavancin (Orbactiv), and telavancin (Vibativ); quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis); daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide); and ceftobiprole (Zevtera, a 5th-generation cephalosporin). Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth for the treatment of systemic infections. == Adverse effects == When used for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). It has also been known to cause thrombocytopenia. Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which may be a sign of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults. Like nearly all antibiotics, linezolid has been associated with Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis, although the latter is uncommon, occurring in about one in two thousand patients in clinical trials. C. difficile appears to be susceptible to linezolid in vitro, and linezolid was even considered as a possible treatment for CDAD. === Long-term use === Bone marrow suppression, characterized particularly by thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; it appears to be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect. Long-term use of linezolid has also been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed by a team of researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks. The adverse effects of long-term linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it was found to be reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, as of 2009, a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity. Evidence of protein synthesis inhibition in mammalian cells by linezolid has been published. == Interactions == Linezolid is a weak, non-selective, reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and should not be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Linezolid does not inhibit or induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, which is responsible for the metabolism of many commonly used drugs, and therefore does not have any CYP-related interactions. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Linezolid, like other oxazolidinones, is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor and a weak, non-selective, reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor. As a protein synthesis inhibitor, linezolid stops the growth and reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in bacterial ribosomes. Linezolid inhibits translation at the first step of protein synthesis, initiation, unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit elongation. It does so by preventing the formation of the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent. In 2008, the crystal structure of linezolid bound to the 50S subunit of a ribosome from the archaean Haloarcula marismortui was elucidated by a team of scientists from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome. === Pharmacokinetics === One of the advantages of linezolid is that it has an absolute oral bioavailability of 100% due to its rapid and complete absorption after oral administration; in other words, the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, as if it had been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously. Taking linezolid with food somewhat slows its absorption, but the area under the curve is not affected. Linezolid's plasma protein binding is approximately 31% (range 4–32%) and its volume of distribution at steady state averages 36.1–47.3 liters in healthy adult volunteers. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached one to two hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials found that linezolid was not superior to vancomycin, which achieves lower concentrations in the ELF. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults. Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by oxidation of the morpholine ring, without involvement of the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which accounts for more than 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance. == Chemistry == At physiological pH (7.4), linezolid exists in an uncharged state. It is moderately water-soluble (approximately 3 mg/mL), with a logP of 0.55. The oxazolidinone pharmacophore—the chemical ""template"" essential for antimicrobial activity—consists of a 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one moiety with an aryl group at position 3 and an S-methyl group, with another substituent attached to it, at position 5 (the R-enantiomers of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In addition to this essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An acetamide substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used in all of the more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some isosteric groups are used. A fluorine atom at the 3′ position practically doubles in vitro and in vivo activity, and the electron-donating nitrogen atom in the morpholine ring helps maintain high antibiotic potency and an acceptable safety profile. The anticoagulant rivaroxaban (Xarelto) bears a striking structural similarity to linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra ketone and chlorothiophene, and missing the fluorine atom). However this similarity appears to carry no clinical significance. === Synthesis === Linezolid is a completely synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid have been reported in the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998. Later syntheses have included an ""atom-economical"" method starting from D-mannitol, developed by Indian pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy's and reported in 1999, and a route starting from (S)-glyceraldehyde acetonide (prepared from ascorbic acid), developed by a team of researchers from Hunan Normal University in Changsha, Hunan, China. On 25 June 2008, during the 12th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference in New York, Pfizer reported the development of their ""second-generation"" synthesis of linezolid: a convergent, green synthesis starting from (S)-epichlorohydrin, with higher yield and a 56% reduction in total waste. == Resistance == Acquired resistance to linezolid was reported as early as 1999, in two patients with severe, multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection who received the drug through a compassionate use program. Linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was first isolated in 2001. In the United States, resistance to linezolid has been monitored and tracked since 2004 through a program named LEADER, which (as of 2007) was conducted in 60 medical institutions throughout the country. Resistance has remained stable and extremely low—less than one-half of one percent of isolates overall, and less than one-tenth of one percent of S. aureus samples. A similar, worldwide program—the ""Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Study"", or ZAAPS—has been conducted since 2002. As of 2007, overall resistance to linezolid in 23 countries was less than 0.2%, and nonexistent among streptococci. Resistance was only found in Brazil, China, Ireland, and Italy, among coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.28% of samples resistant), enterococci (0.11%), and S. aureus (0.03%). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, no resistance was found in staphylococci collected from bacteremia cases between 2001 and 2006, although resistance in enterococci has been reported. Some authors have predicted that resistance in E. faecium will increase if linezolid use continues at current levels or increases. Nevertheless, linezolid continues to be an important antimicrobial agent with near-complete activity (0.05% resistance). === Mechanism === The intrinsic resistance of most Gram-negative bacteria to linezolid is due to the activity of efflux pumps, which actively ""pump"" linezolid out of the cell faster than it can accumulate. Gram-positive bacteria usually develop resistance to linezolid as the result of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis. == History == The oxazolidinones have been known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s. Their antimicrobial properties were discovered by researchers at E.I. duPont de Nemours in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont patented a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective in the treatment of bacterial and fungal plant diseases, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in mammals. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented a detailed description of the oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued. Pharmacia & Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) started its own oxazolidinone research program in the 1990s. Studies of the compounds' structure–activity relationships led to the development of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: eperezolid (codenamed PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766). In the preclinical stages of development, they were similar in safety and antibacterial activity, so they were taken to Phase I clinical trials to identify any difference in pharmacokinetics. Linezolid was found to have a pharmacokinetic advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved linezolid on 18 April 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia. As of 2009, linezolid was the only oxazolidinone antibiotic available. Other members of this class have entered development, such as posizolid (AZD2563), ranbezolid (RBx 7644), and radezolid (RX-1741). In 2014, the FDA approved tedizolid phosphate, a second-generation oxazolidinone derivative, for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection. == Society and culture == === Economics === Linezolid was quite expensive in 2009; a course of treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as would be used to treat tuberculosis cost about US$60. However, because intravenous linezolid may be switched to an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, people may be discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the length of hospital stay reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, it may be more expensive—than comparable antibiotics. Studies have been conducted in several countries with different health care system models to assess the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs. In 2009, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion and entered a corporate integrity agreement to settle charges that it had misbranded and illegally promoted four drugs, and caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs for uses that had not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. $1.3 billion was paid to settle criminal charges of illegally marketing the anti-inflammatory valdecoxib, while $1 billion was paid in civil fines regarding illegal marketing of three other drugs, including Zyvox. === Brand names === == References ==",Zyvoxam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002007613657042384), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019620470702648163)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Linezolid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linezolid?utm_source=openai')])"

It can also be administered for acute pain in general and for tension headache (muscle contraction headache). It acts on the spinal cord by depressing reflexes. It is sold under the brand names Lorzone, Paraflex and Muscol and in combination form as Parafon Forte, a combination of chlorzoxazone and acetaminophen (paracetamol). Possible side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, malaise, nausea, vomiting. In rare cases, chlorzoxazone may cause severe liver dysfunction. On the other hand, chlorzoxazone may reduce the liver toxicity of acetaminophen by competitive inhibition. It is available as a generic medication. Like metaxalone, its mechanism of action is still in question. It is believed that metaxalone works by altering serotonin levels and acting as a mild MAO inhibitor. The mechanism of action of chlorzoxazone is thought to act on GABAA and GABAB receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels to a degree. General central nervous system depression is the only currently accepted aspect to its medical benefits.

It is also used to prevent worsening of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can be taken in various ways including by mouth, injection into a muscle, and inhalation. Common side effects with long-term use include osteoporosis, cataracts, thrush, and muscle weakness. Serious side effects may include psychosis, increased risk of infections, adrenal suppression, and bronchospasm. Use in pregnancy is generally safe. It works by decreasing inflammation and immune system activity. Triamcinolone was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1958. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 102nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Triamcinolone is used to treat various medical conditions, such as eczema, alopecia areata, lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, ulcerative colitis, lupus, sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, ocular inflammation, keloids, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, aphthous ulcers (usually as triamcinolone acetonide), central retinal vein occlusion, visualization during vitrectomy and the prevention of asthma attacks. The derivative triamcinolone acetonide is the active ingredient in various topical skin preparations (cream, lotion, ointment, aerosol spray) designed to treat such skin conditions as rash, inflammation, redness, or intense itching due to eczema and dermatitis. == Contraindications == Contraindications for systemic triamcinolone are similar to those of other corticoids. They include systemic mycoses (fungal infections) and parasitic diseases, as well as eight weeks before and two weeks after application of live vaccines. For long-term treatment, the drug is also contraindicated in people with peptic ulcers, severe osteoporosis, severe myopathy, certain viral infections, glaucoma, and metastasizing tumours. There are no contraindications for use in emergency medicine. == Side effects == The side effects of triamcinolone are similar to other corticosteroids. In short-term treatment of up to ten days, it has very few adverse effects; however, sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding is seen, as well as acute infections (mainly viral) and impaired glucose tolerance. Side effects of triamcinolone long-term treatment may include coughing (up to bronchospasms), sinusitis, metabolic syndrome–like symptoms such as high blood sugar and cholesterol, weight gain due to water retention, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as cataract, thrush, osteoporosis, reduced muscle mass, and psychosis. Triamcinolone injections can cause bruising and joint swelling. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itch, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing, and anaphylaxis. == Overdose == No acute overdosing of triamcinolone has been described. == Interactions == Drug interactions are mainly pharmacodynamic, that is, they result from other drugs either adding to triamcinolone's corticosteroid side effects or working against its desired effects. They include: Atropine and other anticholinergics can substantially increase pressure in the eyes. Antidiabetic drugs can become less effective because triamcinolone causes diabetes-like symptoms. Aspirin and other NSAIDs, as well as anticoagulants such as warfarin, add to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Diuretics that excrete potassium (such as loop diuretics and thiazides) can increase the risk of hypokalemia and thus lead to abnormal heart rhythm. Cardiac glycosides may have more adverse effects due to reduced potassium levels in the blood. The risk for blood count changes is increased when combining triamcinolone with ACE inhibitors. Triamcinolone and other drugs can also influence each other's concentrations in the body, amounting to pharmacokinetic interactions such as: Rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and other inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 speed up metabolization of triamcinolone and can therefore reduce its effectiveness. Conversely, CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, can increase its concentrations in the body and the risk for adverse effects. Blood concentrations of ciclosporin can be increased. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid that is about five times as potent as cortisol but has very few mineralocorticoid effects. === Pharmacokinetics === When taken by mouth, the drug's bioavailability is over 90%. It reaches its highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to two hours and is bound to plasma proteins to about 80%. The biological half-life from the plasma is 200 to 300 minutes; due to stable complexes of triamcinolone and its receptor in the intracellular fluid, the total half-life is significantly longer at about 36 hours. A small fraction of the substance is metabolized to 6-hydroxy- and 20-dihydro-triamcinolone; most of it probably undergoes glucuronidation, and a smaller part sulfation. Three-quarters are excreted via the urine, and the rest via the faeces. Due to corticoids' mechanism of action, the effects are delayed as compared to plasma concentrations. Depending on the route of administration and the treated condition, the onset of action can be from two hours up to one or two days after application; and the drug can act much longer than its elimination half-life would suggest. == Chemistry == Triamcinolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyhydrocortisone or 9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyprednisolone as well as 9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. The substance is a light-sensitive, white to off-white, crystalline powder, or has the form of colourless, matted crystals. It has no odour or is nearly odourless. Information on the melting point varies, partly due to the substance's polymorphism: 260 to 263 °C (500 to 505 °F), 264 to 268 °C (507 to 514 °F), or 269 to 271 °C (516 to 520 °F) can be found in the literature. Solubility is 1:500 in water and 1:240 in ethanol; it is slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in chloroform and diethylether, and practically insoluble in dichloromethane. The specific rotation is [ α ] D 20 {\displaystyle [\alpha ]_{D}^{20}} +65° to +72° cm3/dm·g (1% in dimethylformamide). == Society and culture == In 2010, Teva and Perrigo launched the first generic inhalable triamcinolone. According to Chang et al. (2014), ""Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is classified as an S9 glucocorticoid in the 2014 Prohibited List published by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which caused it to be prohibited in international athletic competition when administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly or rectally"". == References == == External links == ""Triamcinolone Topical"".

Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis and eosinophilia. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Montelukast is in the leukotriene receptor antagonist family of medications. It works by blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in the lungs resulting in decreased inflammation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Montelukast was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the seventeenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 29 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Montelukast is used for a number of conditions including asthma, exercise induced bronchospasm, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria. It is mainly used as a complementary therapy in adults in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, if inhaled steroids alone do not bring the desired effect. It is also used to prevent allergic reactions and asthma flare-ups during the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. It may also be used as an adjunct therapy in symptomatic treatment of mastocytosis. It is taken by mouth, as a tablet, chewable tablet, or as granules. == Pharmacology == Montelukast is in the leukotriene receptor antagonist family of medications. It works by blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in the lungs resulting in decreased inflammation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Montelukast functions as a leukotriene receptor antagonist (cysteinyl leukotriene receptors) and consequently opposes the function of these inflammatory mediators; leukotrienes are produced by the immune system and serve to promote bronchoconstriction, inflammation, microvascular permeability, and mucus secretion in asthma and COPD. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mild rashes, asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes, and fever. Uncommon side effects include fatigue and malaise, behavioral changes, paresthesias and seizures, muscle cramps, and nose bleeds. Rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking montelukast) but serious side effects include behavioral changes (including suicidal thoughts), angioedema, erythema multiforme, and liver problems. In 2019 and 2020, concerns for neuropsychiatric reactions were added to the prescription labels in the United Kingdom and the United States where the most frequently suspected were nightmares, depression, insomnia (may affect between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 people taking montelukast); aggression, anxiety and abnormal behavior or changes in behavior (may affect between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 people taking montelukast). === FDA investigation === In June 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded a review into the possibility of neuropsychiatric side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs. Although clinical trials revealed only an increased risk of insomnia, post-marketing surveillance showed that the drugs were associated with a possible increase in suicidal behavior and other side effects such as agitation, aggression, anxiousness, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, depression, irritability, restlessness, and tremor. In March 2020, the FDA required a boxed warning for montelukast to strengthen an existing warning about the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with the drug in the wake of an increase in case reporting of neuropsychiatric events around the time of the initial communications about the concern from FDA in 2008. The boxed warning advises health care providers to avoid prescribing montelukast to patients with mild symptoms, particularly those with allergic rhinitis, because there are many other allergy medicines that can safely and effectively manage this condition. In the FDA's data analysis, in comparison to case reports that based on people's self-reports, the propensity of developing neuropsychiatric disorders after montelukast use did not outpace that of inhaled corticosteroids; and there were no statistically significant risks of new-onset neuropsychiatric disorders among males, females, patients 12 years and older, patients with a psychiatric history, or after the 2008 FDA communication and prescribing information changes that first publicized the concern. In addition, the FDA's analysis summary of its findings said ""exposure to montelukast was significantly associated with a decreased risk of treated outpatient depressive disorder and the decreased risks were seen among patients with a history of a psychiatric disorder, in patients 12 to 17 years as well as 18 years and older, and in both females and males."" ""Treated outpatient depressive disorder"" refers to patients who sought treatment specifically for depressive disorders in outpatient psychiatric settings. In 2024, following reports of night terrors, uncontrollable aggression, intrusive thoughts, depression and rare cases of hallucinations and suicidal behavior in children, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was reviewing the risks of montelukast after identifying ""further concerns"". The FDA has begun, as of 2020, an internal expert review of why the drug may cause ""neuropsychiatric side effects"". In a limited audience review of some findings of this internal group to the American College of Toxicology, on November 20, 2024 in Austin, TX, Jessica Oliphant, deputy director for FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, said ""that laboratory tests showed “significant binding” of montelukast to multiple receptors found in the brain"" and that ""These data indicate that montelukast is highest in brain regions known to be involved in (psychiatric effects),”. The FDA does not plan to update the box warning label. == Drug interactions == Montelukast is an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2C8, part of the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the combination of montelukast with a CYP2C8 substrate (e.g. amodiaquine, an anti-malarial drug) could increase the plasma concentrations of the substrate. However, clinical studies have shown minimal interactions between montelukast and other CYP2C8 substrate drugs, which is most likely due to the high plasma protein binding exhibited by montelukast. == Society and culture == === Patents === Singulair was covered by US Patent No. 5,565,473 which expired on 3 August 2012. The same day, the FDA approved several generic versions of montelukast. The United States Patent and Trademark Office launched a reexamination of the patent covering Singulair on May 2009. The decision was driven by the discovery of references that were not included in the original patent application process. The references were submitted through Article One Partners, an online research community focused on finding literature relating to existing patents. The references included a scientific article produced by a Merck employee on the active ingredient in Singulair. A previously filed patent had been submitted in the same technology area. Seven months later the US Patent and Trademark Office determined that the patent in question was valid based on the initial reexamination and new information provided, submitting their decision on 17 December 2009. === Use with loratadine === Schering-Plough and Merck sought permission to market a combined tablet with loratadine and montelukast. However, the FDA has found no benefit from a combined pill for seasonal allergies over taking the two drugs in combination, and in April 2008, issued a not-approvable letter for the combination. === Brand names === The Mont in montelukast stands for Montreal, where Merck (MSD) developed the drug. Montelukast is sold under a variety of brand names including Monalast (Ziska Pharmaceuticals Ltd) Montenaaf (NAAFCO Pharma) Montelon-10 (Apex), Montene (Square), Montair-10, Lukotas, Montelo-10, Monteflo, and Tukast L in India, Reversair (ACI Bangladesh), Monas, Miralust, Montiva, Provair, Montril, Lumona, Lumenta, Arokast and Trilock in Bangladesh, Ventair in Nepal, Montika in Pakistan, Montelair in Brazil, Zykast in the Philippines though combined with levocetirizine, Desmont, Levmont, Aircomb and Notta in Turkey, Topraz and Monte-Air in South Africa. == References ==",Singulair,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.490105023549404e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021300431399140507)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/singulair.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Singulair: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/singulair.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Piperaquine was developed under the Chinese National Malaria Elimination Programme in the 1960s and was adopted throughout China as a replacement for the structurally similar antimalarial drug chloroquine. Due to widespread parasite resistance to piperaquine, the drug fell out of use as a monotherapy, and is instead used as a partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy. Piperaquine kills parasites by disrupting the detoxification of host heme. == Medical uses == Piperaquine is used in combination with dihydroartemisinin for the treatment of malaria. This combination is one of several artemisinin combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. This combination is also recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of severe malaria after administration of artesunate. Piperaquine is also registered for use in some countries in combination with arterolane. However, this combination is not recommended by the World Health Organization due to insufficient data. == Contraindications == Like chloroquine, piperaquine can prolong the QT interval. Although large randomized clinical trials have not revealed evidence of cardiotoxicity, the World Health Organization recommends not using piperaquine in patients with congenital QT prolongation or who are on other drugs that prolong the QT interval. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like chloroquine, piperaquine is thought to function by accumulating in the parasite digestive vacuole and interfering with the detoxification of heme into hemozoin. === Resistance === Parasites that survive piperaquine treatment have been increasingly reported since 2010, particularly in Southeast Asia. The epicenter of piperaquine resistance appears to be western Cambodia where in 2014 over 40% of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatments failed to eliminate parasites from the patient's blood. Characterizing piperaquine-resistant parasites has been technically challenging, as parasites that survive piperaquine treatment in patients appear to remain sensitive to piperaquine in vitro; i.e. piperaquine appears to have the same IC50 in sensitive parasites and resistant parasites. The mechanism by which parasites become resistant to piperaquine remains unclear. Amplification of the parasite proteases plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3, both involved in degrading host hemoglobin, is associated with resistance to piperaquine. Similarly, mutations in a gene related to chloroquine resistance, PfCRT, have been associated with piperaquine resistance; however, parasites that are resistant to chloroquine remain sensitive to piperaquine. In contrast, amplification of the gene for the parasite transporter PfMDR1, a mechanism of parasite resistance to mefloquine, is inversely correlated with piperaquine resistance. === Pharmacokinetics === Piperaquine is a lipophilic drug and therefore is rapidly absorbed and distributed across much of the body. The drug reaches its maximal concentrations approximately 2 hours after administration. == Chemistry == Piperaquine is available as a base, and as a water-soluble tetraphosphate salt. == History == Piperaquine was discovered in the 1960s by two separate groups working independently of one another: the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute in China and the Rhone Poulenc in France. In the 1970s and 1980s piperaquine became the primary antimalarial drug of the Chinese National Malaria Control Programme due to increased parasite resistance to chloroquine. By the late 1980s, the use of piperaquine as an antimalarial monotherapy diminished as increasing parasite resistance to piperaquine was observed. Beginning in the 1990s, piperaquine was tested and adopted as a partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy. == References ==",Piperaquine phosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.487341256113723e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044550508027896285)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperaquine ', [])"

Cyclin-dependent kinases that promote cell cycle progression may be promising targets in the treatment of cancer. The therapeutic effects of roniciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor for medullary thyroid cancer were investigated in the present study. Roniciclib inhibited medullary thyroid cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Roniciclib induced caspase-3 activity and contributed to apoptosis. Cell cycle progression was arrested in the G2 phase.  Neuroblastoma, an embryonic tumor arising from neuronal crest progenitor cells, has been shown to contain a population of undifferentiated stem cells responsible for the malignant state and the unfavorable prognosis. Although many previous studies have analyzed neuroblastoma stem cells and their therapeutic targeting, this topic appears still open to novel investigations. Here we found that neurospheres derived from neuroblastoma stem-like cells showed a homogeneous staining for several key nucleolar proteins, such as Nucleolin, Nucleophosmin-1, Glypican-2 and PES-1. We investigated the effects of Roniciclib (BAY 1000394), an anticancer stem cells agent, on neurospheres and on an orthotopic neuroblastoma mouse model, discovering an impressive inhibition of tumor growth and indicating good chances for the use of Roniciclib in vivo. We demonstrated that Roniciclib is not only a Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, but also a nucleolar stress inducer, revealing a possible novel mechanism underlying Roniciclib-mediated repression of cell proliferation. Furthermore, we found that high expression of Nucleophosmin-1 correlates with patients' short survival. The co-expression of several stem cell surface antigens such as CD44v6 and CD114, together with the nucleolar markers here described, extends new possibilities to isolate undifferentiated subpopulations from neuroblastoma and identify new targets for the treatment of this childhood malignancy.",Roniciclib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00024077377747744322), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004104761406779289)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28463960/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29666673/,https://www.glpbio.com/roniciclib-bay-1000394.html ', [])"

822,"('Clindamycin (phosphate)', 'Clindamycin 2-dihydrogen phosphate', 'Clindamycin 2-phosphate', 'Clindamycin phosphate', 'Cleocin t')",Medical,"Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic medication used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including osteomyelitis (bone) or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, acute otitis media (middle ear infections), and endocarditis. It can also be used to treat acne, and some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In combination with quinine, it can be used to treat malaria. It is available by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as a cream or a gel to be applied to the skin or in the vagina. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and pain at the site of injection. It increases the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile colitis about fourfold and thus is only recommended for use when other antibiotics are not appropriate. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein. Clindamycin was first made in 1966 from lincomycin. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 147th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clindamycin is used primarily to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne. === Acne === For the treatment of acne, in the long term, the combined use of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide was similar to salicylic acid plus benzoyl peroxide. Topical clindamycin plus topical benzoyl peroxide is more effective than topical clindamycin alone. === Susceptible bacteria === It is most effective against infections involving the following types of organisms: Aerobic Gram-positive cocci, including some members of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (e.g. pneumococcus) genera, but not enterococci. Anaerobic, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including some Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, although resistance is increasing in Bacteroides fragilis. Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) are resistant to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus: 0.016 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.002 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes: <0.015 μg/mL – >64 μg/mL === D-test === When testing a gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a ""D-test"" to determine if there is a sub-population of bacteria present with the phenotype known as iMLSB. This phenotype of bacteria are resistant to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B group of antibiotics, however, the resistance mechanism is only induced by the presence of 14-membered ring macrolides, such as erythromycin. During a D-test, bacteria of the iMLSB phenotype demonstrate in vitro erythromycin-induced in vitro resistance to clindamycin. This is because of the activity of the macrolide-inducible plasmid-encoded erm gene. To perform a D-test, an agar plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with erythromycin, one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20 mm apart on the plate. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is D-shaped, the test result is positive. Despite the apparent susceptibility to clindamycin in the absence of erythromycin, a positive D-test precludes therapeutic use of clindamycin. This is because the erythromycin-inducible erm gene is prone to mutations causing the inducible activity to switch to constitutive (permanently switched on). This in turn, may lead to the therapeutic failure of clindamycin. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used. === Malaria === Given with chloroquine or quinine, clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing. === Other === Clindamycin may be useful in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Many strains of MRSA are still susceptible to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming increasingly resistant. While it has been used in intraabdominal infections, such use is generally not recommended due to resistance. Clindamycin is used in cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes the death of the bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis). Clindamycin has been proven to decrease the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to about a third of the risk of untreated women. The combination of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment for severe babesiosis. Clindamycin may also be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in combination with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Clindamycin, either applied to skin or taken by mouth, may also be used in hidradenitis suppurativa. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions associated with systemic clindamycin therapy – found in over 1% of people – include: diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps and/or rash. High doses (both intravenous and oral) may cause a metallic taste. Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulations – found in over 10% of people – include: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or peeling of skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion). Additional side effects include contact dermatitis. Common side effects – found in over 10% of people – in vaginal applications include fungal infection. Rarely – in less than 0.1% of people – clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasias, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzyme levels, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and/or hepatotoxicity. === Clostridioides difficile === Pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially lethal condition commonly associated with clindamycin, but which also occurs with other antibiotics. Overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results in the production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use of clindamycin during pregnancy is generally considered safe. Clindamycin is classified as compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, the WHO categorizes it as ""avoid if possible"". It is classified as L2 probably compatible with breastfeeding according to Medications and Mothers' Milk. A 2009 review found it was likely safe in breastfeeding mothers, but did find one complication (hematochezia) in a breastfed infant which might be attributable to clindamycin. LactMed lists potentially negative gastrointestinal effects in babies whose mothers take it while breastfeeding but did not see that as justification to stop breastfeeding. == Interactions == Clindamycin may prolong the effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its similarity to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means they should not be given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance. == Chemistry == Clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic produced by the actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It has been on the market since 1968. Clindamycin is white or yellow powder that is very soluble in water. The topically used clindamycin phosphate is a phosphate-ester prodrug of clindamycin. == Mechanism of action == Clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. At higher concentrations, it may be bactericidal. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. The binding is reversible. Clindamycin is more effective than lincomycin. The X-ray crystal structures of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcula marismortui have been determined; the structure of the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported. == Society and culture == === Economics === Clindamycin is available as a generic medication and is relatively inexpensive. === Available forms === Clindamycin preparations that are taken by mouth include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, due to its extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment. Several combination acne treatments containing clindamycin are also marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis. Clindamycin is available as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use. (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not available as a generic in the US). == Veterinary use == The veterinary uses of clindamycin are quite similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, for which it is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. They can be used both by mouth and topically. A disadvantage is that bacterial resistance can develop fairly quickly. Gastrointestinal upset may also occur. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT04370548 for ""DARE-BV1 in the Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis (DARE-BVFREE)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Clindamycin phosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.6622808187967166e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01106884703040123)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1465/clindamycin-phosphate-topical/details?utm_source=openai), [pfizermedicalinformation.com](https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/patient/cleocin-phosphate-injection/indications-usage?utm_source=openai), [rxlist.com](https://www.rxlist.com/cleocin-vaginal-ovules-drug.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=353, start_index=9, title='Clindamycin topical (Cleocin T, Clindagel, and others): Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings & Dosing - WebMD', type='url_citation', url='https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1465/clindamycin-phosphate-topical/details?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=353, start_index=9, title='CLEOCIN® Phosphate Injection (clindamycin) Indications and Usage Patient information | Pfizer Medical Information - US', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/patient/cleocin-phosphate-injection/indications-usage?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=353, start_index=9, title='Cleocin Vaginal Ovules (Clindamycin Phosphate Vaginal Suppositories): Side Effects, Uses, Dosage, Interactions, Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxlist.com/cleocin-vaginal-ovules-drug.htm?utm_source=openai')])"
823,"('Vandetanib', 'Zactima', 'Caprelsa', 'N-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-((1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methoxy)quinazolin-4-amine', 'Vandetanib (zd6474)')",Medical,"Vandetanib, sold under the brand name Caprelsa, is an anti-cancer medication that is used for the treatment of certain tumours of the thyroid gland. It acts as a kinase inhibitor of a number of cell receptors, mainly the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and the RET-tyrosine kinase. The drug was developed by AstraZeneca who later sold the rights to Sanofi in 2015. == Medical use == Vandetanib is used to treat medullary thyroid cancer in adults who are ineligible for surgery. == Contraindications == The V804M mutation in RET confers resistance to Vandetanib anti-RET activity. In people with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, no dosage for vandetanib has been recommended, as its safety and efficacy has not been established yet. Vandetanib is contraindicated in people with congenital long QT syndrome. == Adverse effects == Very common (present in greater than 10% of people) adverse effects include colds, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, decreased appetite, low calcium absorption, insomnia, depressed mood, Headache, tingling sensations, weird, painful sensations, dizziness, blurred vision, damage to the cornea, long QT syndrome, high blood pressure, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, sensitivity to sunlight, rash, acne, dry and itchy skin, nail disorders, protein in urine, kidney stones, weakness, fatigue, pain, and edema. Common (present in between 1% and 10% of people) adverse effects include pneumonia, sepsis, influenza, cystitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, folliculitis, boils, fungal infection, kidney infections, low thyroid hormone levels, low potassium, high calcium levels, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dehydration, low sodium levels, anxiety, tremor, lethargy, loss of consciousness, balance disorders, changes in sense of taste, visual impairment, halo vision, perceived light flashes, glaucoma, pink eye, dry eye, keratopathy, hypertensive crisis, mini strokes, nose bleeds, coughing up blood, defecating blood, colitis, dry mouth, stomatitis, constipation, gastritis, gallstones, Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema, hair loss, painful urination, bloody urine, kidney failure, frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and fever. == Interactions == Vandetanib has been reported as a substrate for the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. Interaction of vandetanib with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may alter its hepatic disposition and can lead to transporter mediated drug-drug interactions. Also, vandetanib is an inhibitor of OATP1B3 transporter but not for OATP1B1. Other drugs that prolong the QT interval can possibly add to this side effect of vandetanib. As the drug is partly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, strong inducers of this enzyme can decrease its blood plasma concentrations. CYP3A4 inhibitors do not significantly increase vandetanib concentrations, presumably because it is also metabolised by flavin containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1) and 3. == Pharmacology == Vandetanib is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and RET tyrosine kinases. RET tyrosine kinases; it weakly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3. Vandetanib is well absorbed from the gut, reaches peak blood plasma concentrations 4 to 10 hours after application, and has a half-life of 19 days on average, per pharmacokinetic studies. It has to be taken for about three months to achieve a steady-state concentration. In the blood, it is almost completely (90–96%) bound to plasma proteins such as albumin. It is metabolised to N-desmethylvandetanib via CYP3A4 and to vandetanib-N-oxide via FMO1 and 3. Both of these are active metabolites. Vandetanib is excreted via the faeces (44%) and the urine (25%) in form of the unchanged drug and the metabolites. == History == Vandetanib was approved by the FDA in April 2011, for treatment of late-stage thyroid cancer. Vandetanib was first initially marketed without a trade name; it has been marketed under the trade name Caprelsa since August 2011. In 2015 Genzyme acquired the product from AstraZeneca. == Research == AstraZeneca tested Vandetanib in clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer and submitted an application for approval to the EMA but then withdrew the application in October 2009 after trials showed no benefit when the drug was administered alongside chemotherapy. A clinical trial of vandetanib plus gemcitabine versus placebo plus gemcitabine in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma was negative in a prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase 2 trial. == References ==",Caprelsa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5735502529423684e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002687808300834149)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/caprelsa.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=77, start_index=9, title='Caprelsa: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/caprelsa.html?utm_source=openai')])"
824,"('Flucloxacillin sodium', 'Flucloxacillin', 'Floxapen', 'Flucloxacilina', 'Flucloxacilline')",Medical,"Flucloxacillin, also known as floxacillin, is an antibiotic used to treat skin infections, external ear infections, infections of leg ulcers, diabetic foot infections, and infection of bone. It may be used together with other medications to treat pneumonia, and endocarditis. It may also be used prior to surgery to prevent Staphylococcus infections. It is not effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include an upset stomach. Other side effects may include muscle or joint pains, shortness of breath, and liver problems. It appears to be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin. It is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. It is similar in effect to cloxacillin and dicloxacillin, being active against penicillinase forming bacteria. Flucloxacillin was patented in 1961. It is not commonly used in the United States or Canada as of 2011. == Medical uses == Flucloxacillin is an antibiotic used to treat skin infections, external ear infections, infections of leg ulcers, diabetic foot infections, and infection of bone. === Skin === Flucloxacillin is used for both staphylococcal and streptococcal skin infections. These include folliculitis, carbuncles, impetigo, ecthyma, cellulitis, erysipelas, necrotising fasciitis, and infections of skin conditions such as eczema, scabies, ulcers and acne. Due to the widespread belief that dual-therapy is needed to cover both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus in cellulitis, flucloxacillin is sometimes given with the addition of benzylpenicillin for more severe cellulitis. However, support for this practice has lessened since findings in a study published in the Emergency Medicine Journal in 2005 did not show this combination to give additional clinical benefit. In the UK, using flucloxacillin alone is the first choice for treating cellulitis. Some other countries vary. === Wounds === Infections of leg ulcers can be treated with flucloxacillin. With diabetic foot infections the dose is adjusted according to whether the infection appears mild, moderate or severe. === Bone === Despite having a lower than optimum drug penetration into bone ratio of 10–20%, flucloxacillin appears effective in treating osteomyelitis. Depending on local guidance it may be used in the treatment of infection of joints while waiting for culture results. === Other === It may be used in combination with other antibiotics to treat pneumonia and can be used to prevent infection before surgery, particularly heart, lung, or bone surgery. When used to treat endocarditis, in combination with other antibiotics or alone, the dose of flucloxacillin may need to exceed the usual dose. === Resistance === Despite flucloxacillin being insensitive to beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance to it and other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin. Such organisms include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has developed resistance to flucloxacillin and other penicillins by having an altered penicillin-binding protein. == Side effects == Common side effects associated with the use of flucloxacillin include: diarrhoea, nausea, rash, urticaria, pain and inflammation at injection site, superinfection (including candidiasis), allergy, and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin. Rarely, in fewer than 1 in 1,000 people, cholestatic jaundice (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with flucloxacillin therapy. It may appear as pale stool with dark urine, and yellowish eyes and skin. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people over the age of 55, females, and those with a treatment duration of longer than two weeks. Flucloxacillin is contraindicated in those with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, cephalosporins, or carbapenems. It should also not be used in the eye, or administered to those with a history of cholestatic hepatitis associated with the use of dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin. It should be used with caution in the elderly, patients with renal impairment where a reduced dose is required, and those with hepatic impairment, due to the risk of cholestatic hepatitis. It should be taken on an empty stomach, one half to one hour before food, as absorption is reduced when taken with food, though some studies suggest that this does not compromise flucloxacillin plasma concentrations in most circumstances. The UK's National Health Service recommends taking at least 30 minutes before food and at least 2 hours after. === Drug interactions === Flucloxacillin can reduce the excretion of methotrexate, potentially resulting in a risk of methotrexate toxicity. The level of flucloxacillin in the blood may rise in kidney failure and with the use of probenecid. == Mechanism of action == Flucloxacillin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the penicillin group of antibiotics. It works by breaking down the bacterial cell wall. Like other β-lactam antibiotics, flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable than many other penicillins and can be given orally, in addition to parenteral routes. However, like methicillin, it is less potent than benzylpenicillin against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin has similar pharmacokinetics, antibacterial activity, and indications to dicloxacillin, and the two agents are considered interchangeable. It is reported to have higher, though rare, incidence of severe hepatic adverse effects than dicloxacillin, but a lower incidence of renal adverse effects. == Chemistry == Flucloxacillin is insensitive to beta-lactamase (also known as penicillinase) enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The presence of the isoxazolyl group on the side chain of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase resistance, since they are relatively intolerant of side chain steric hindrance. Thus, it is able to bind to penicillin-binding proteins and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamases. == History == Flucloxacillin was developed in the 1960s following an increase in penicillin-resistant (beta-lactamase producing) staphylococcal infections due to the widespread use of benzylpenicillin by 1960. All the natural penicillins and first semi-synthetic penicillins were destroyed by staphylococcal beta-lactamase, leading Beecham (later GlaxoSmithKline) to search for more stable antibiotics. By 1962, a series of similarly structured acid-stable penicillins (oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin), with the potential for being taken by mouth, were developed. Flucloxacillin and dicloxacillin showed particular stability against the beta-lactamase enzyme of Staph. aureus and could withstand acid. Beecham further developed cloxacillin and popularised flucloxacillin in the UK, while Bristol Laboratories concentrated on marketing oxacillin and dicloxacillin in the United States, leading to the difference in use in both countries. Flucloxacillin was first marketed in Europe in the 1970s. == Available forms == Both the oral and intravenous preparations of flucloxacillin are inexpensive and are available as the sodium salt flucloxacillin sodium, in capsules (250 or 500 mg), oral suspensions (125 mg/5 ml or 250 mg/5 ml), and injections (powder for reconstitution, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg per vial). Flucloxacillin is not commonly used in the United States or Canada as of 2011. In several other countries however, it is supplied under a variety of trade names including Floxapen, Flopen, Flubex, Flupen, Phylopen, and Staphylex. === Combination === Flucloxacillin is combined with ampicillin in co-fluampicil. == References ==",Floxapen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.298280929215252e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010525626566959545)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

However, it is not active against the T790M mutation which generally requires third generation drugs like osimertinib. Because of its additional activity against Her2, it is being investigated for breast cancer as well as other EGFR and Her2 driven cancers. == Clinical trials == In March 2010, a Phase III trial in NSCLC patients called Lux-Lung 5 began with this drug. Fall 2010 interim results suggested the drug extended progression-free survival threefold compared to placebo, but did not extend overall survival. In May 2012, the Phase IIb/III trial Lux-Lung 1 came to the same conclusion. In January 2015, a Phase III trial in people with NSCLC suggested the drug extended life expectancy in stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma with EGFR Mutation type del 19-positive tumors, compared to cisplatin-based chemotherapy by a year (33 months vs. 21 months). It also shows strong activity against exon 18 mutations (particularly G719) and is currently the preferred EGFR-TKI therapy for exon 18 mutations (particularly G719x). Phase II results for breast cancer that over-expresses the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2-positive breast cancer) were described as promising by the authors, with 19 of 41 patients achieving benefit from afatinib.

At present, only two drugs are approved by the FDA for the treatment of IPF, including the synthetic pyridinone drug, pirfenidone, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nintedanib. Avitinib (AVB) is a novel oral and potent third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the role of avitinib in pulmonary fibrosis has not yet been established. In the present study, we used in vivo and in vitro models to evaluate the role of avitinib in pulmonary fibrosis. In vivo experiments first verified that avitinib significantly alleviated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Further in vitro molecular studies indicated that avitinib inhibited myofibroblast activation, migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in NIH-3T3 cells, mainly by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling pathways. The cellular experiments also indicated that avitinib improved alveolar epithelial cell injury in A549 cells. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated that avitinib attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice by inhibiting alveolar epithelial cell injury and myofibroblast activation. Avitinib is one type of the third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of avitinib on the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib, one FDA approved third-generation TIKI, both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro metabolic stability and inhibitory effect of avitinib on osimertinib were assessed with rat liver microsomes (RLM) to determine its IC In vitro analysis revealed that the IC Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that a drug-drug interaction between avitinib and osimertinib occurred and more attention should be paid when avitinib and osimertinib are synchronously administered in clinic. SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Osimertinib is the only market available third-generation EGFR-TKI and it has been reported that some drugs could have drug-drug interactions with it. For the first time, we systematically investigated the effect of avitinib, one newly developed third-generation EGFR-TKI, on the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib both in vitro and in vivo using a rat model. Avitinib is the first third-generation epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor independently developed in China and is mainly used for treating non-small cell lung cancer. However, pharmacokinetic details are limited. This study explored the in vivo and in vitro effects of avitinib on cytochrome CYP450 enzymes metabolic activity. A rapid and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for determining six probe substrates and their metabolites. Avitinib influence on activity levels of CYP isozymes was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes (HLMs/RLMs). For in vivo studies, rats were pretreated with 30 mg/kg avitinib once daily for 7 days (avitinib multiple-doses group), 30 mg/kg avitinib on day 7 (avitinib single-dose group), or an equivalent amount of CMC-Na once daily for 7 days (control group), followed by intragastrical administration of the probe substrates (1 mg/kg tolbutamide and 10 mg/kg phenacetin, bupropion, chlorzoxazone, dextromethorphan, and midazolam). Plasma pharmacokinetics and IC In vitro experiments revealed different inhibitory effects of avitinib on the six probe substrates with various IC A sensitive and reliable UPLC-MS/MS method was established to determine the concentration of six probe substrates in rat plasma. Avitinib had inhibitory effects on CYP450 enzymes, especially cyp2b1, cyp1a2 in RLMs, CYP2C9 in HLMs, and cyp1a2, cyp2b1, cyp2d1, and cyp2e1 in vivo.

As of November 2016, it has undergone phase II clinical trials for both of these indications. It was discovered in a medicinal chemistry effort conducted at Roche starting from the results of a small molecular weight compound library high-throughput screen based on a Ca21 mobilization assay with human mGlu5a (Jaeschke et al., 2015). The high-throughput screen identified several mGlu5 antagonists such as MPEP, MTEP, and fenobam. In partnership with Chugai Pharmaceutical, basimglurant is currently still undergoing revision from previous drug trials as of November 2016. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Preclinical research trials found that basimglurant has a high specificity for the glutamate receptor mGlu5, and as a consequence of this specificity, also has a high level of safety. === Pharmacokinetics === Preclinical drug trials showed that basimglurant possessed a terminal half-life of 7 hours in rats and 20 hours in monkeys, indicating a dosing regimen of once daily in possible human patients. Research with rats and monkeys revealed a bioavailability of 50%, with additional studies showing that basimglurant has a rate of plasma protein binding of 98 to 99%. == Clinical trials == Phase I clinical trials for basimglurant began in April 2015, and finished in September 2015. 56 people were spread out among 4 healthy cohorts, a major depressive disorder cohort, and a placebo cohort. The trial was undertaken to study (and verify) the safety of basimglurant as a potential drug. Completion of this trial allowed for basimglurant to begin phase II drug trials. Phase II clinical trials have been undertaken, and a lack of efficacy was found overall. Improved secondary endpoints though of 1.5 mg dosage has prompted future clinical trials of the drug. === Future === Basimglurant has shown the desired characteristics of a drug with high bioavailability, few safety liabilities, and promise in the secondary endpoints of a phase IIb trial. Basimglurant will most likely undergo future iterations and attempt to pass drug trials again due to the large investment already poured into the drug to develop it this far. == History == Basimglurant was originally developed for the treatment of fragile X syndrome, but after failing phase II clinical trials Roche abandoned the drug in this field of application and is renewing basimglurant as part of a treatment for depression. == See also == List of investigational antidepressants == References ==",Basimglurant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0380416102707386), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010883215873036534), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024831434711813927)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.biocentury.com/article/216447/basimglurant-development-discontinued,https://www.empr.com/home/news/drugs-in-the-pipeline/basimglurant-fast-tracked-for-pain-associated-with-trigeminal-neuralgia/,https://trial.medpath.com/clinical-trial/42077190e439f566/nct05217628-efficacy-safety-basimglurant-trigeminal-neuralgia ', [])"

Serum angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) level has been proposed as a potential biomarker of VEGF inhibitor response in several cancers. From these clinical observations, the Ang2 and Tie2 (its receptor) axis has been focused on as a promising target. Here, we show a novel strategy to circumvent the resistance by combining multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors lenvatinib (VEGF receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and RET inhibitor) and golvatinib (E7050; c-Met, Tie2, and EphB4 inhibitor). Tie2 identifies a highly pro-angiogenic macrophage subset, Tie2-expressing macrophages (TEM). Angi-Tie2 and EphB4-EphrinB2 signaling plays critical roles in pericyte-mediated vessel stabilization. In vitro analyses suggested that golvatinib combined with lenvatinib inhibited pericyte-mediated vessel stabilization and TEM differentiation. In thyroid and endometrial cancer models, golvatinib and lenvatinib inhibited pericyte network development and TEM infiltration, resulting in severe perfusion disorder and massive apoptosis. Body weight loss was tolerable, and no macroscopic change was observed. These preclinical studies suggest that modulation of the tumor microenvironment by a strategic and well-tolerated combination of multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors may sensitize cancer to VEGF inhibitors. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors are approved for the treatment of several tumor types; however, some tumors show intrinsic resistance to VEGFR inhibitors, and some patients develop acquired resistance to these inhibitors. Therefore, a strategy to overcome VEGFR inhibitor resistance is urgently required. Recent reports suggest that activation of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) pathway through its cognate receptor, Met, contributes to VEGFR inhibitor resistance. Here, we explored the effect of the HGF/Met signaling pathway and its inhibitors on resistance to lenvatinib, a VEGFR inhibitor. In in vitro experiments, addition of VEGF plus HGF enhanced cell growth and tube formation of HUVECs when compared with stimulation by either factor alone. Lenvatinib potently inhibited the growth of HUVECs induced by VEGF alone, but cells induced by VEGF plus HGF showed lenvatinib resistance. This HGF-induced resistance was cancelled when the Met inhibitor, golvatinib, was added with lenvatinib. Conditioned medium from tumor cells producing high amounts of HGF also conferred resistance to inhibition by lenvatinib. In s.c. xenograft models based on various tumor cell lines with high HGF expression, treatment with lenvatinib alone showed weak antitumor effects, but treatment with lenvatinib plus golvatinib showed synergistic antitumor effects, accompanied by decreased tumor vessel density. These results suggest that HGF from tumor cells confers resistance to tumor endothelial cells against VEGFR inhibitors, and that combination therapy using VEGFR inhibitors with Met inhibitors may be effective for overcoming resistance to VEGFR inhibitors. Further evaluation in clinical trials is warranted. Receptor tyrosine kinases c-Met and Ron transduce signals regulating cell migration and matrix invasion. This phase I dose-escalation trial tested golvatinib, a highly potent, small-molecule, ATP-competitive inhibitor of c-Met and multiple members of the Eph receptor family plus c-Kit and Ron. Patients with advanced solid tumors received golvatinib orally, once daily, continuously. Using a ""3+3"" design, dosing started at 100 mg once daily, escalating to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined by dose-limiting toxicities. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and preliminary antitumor activity was assessed during dose escalation and in a MTD expansion cohort. Thirty-four patients were treated at six dose levels. The MTD was determined as 400 mg once daily. Three dose-limiting toxicities were observed: grade 3 increased γ-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase (200 mg), repeated grade 2 fatigue, and grade 3 fatigue (50.0%). Frequent treatment-related adverse events (with incidence >10%) included diarrhea (58.8%), nausea (50%), vomiting (44.1%), fatigue (41.2%), decreased appetite (32.4%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (32.4%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (20.6%), dry skin (11.8%), and dysgeusia (11.8%). Best overall response was stable disease (median duration 85 days, range 85-237). Pharmacokinetics demonstrated high variability, although maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased with dose. Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, VEGFR2, c-Met, and angiopoietin-2 levels increased after dose. Posttreatment decrease in either p-c-Met or p-ERK was observed in 3 of 4 paired biopsies at MTD.

833,"('Betamethasone', 'Betadexamethasone', 'Flubenisolone', 'Betamethazone', 'Rinderon')",Medical,"Betamethasone is a steroid medication. It is used for a number of diseases including rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, skin diseases such as dermatitis and psoriasis, allergic conditions such as asthma and angioedema, preterm labor to speed the development of the baby's lungs, Crohn's disease, cancers such as leukemia, and along with fludrocortisone for adrenocortical insufficiency, among others. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a muscle, or applied to the skin, typically in cream, lotion, or liquid forms. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, muscle weakness, severe allergic reactions, and psychosis. Long-term use may cause adrenal insufficiency. Stopping the medication suddenly following long-term use may be dangerous. The cream commonly results in increased hair growth and skin irritation. Betamethasone belongs to the glucocorticoid class of medication. It is a stereoisomer of dexamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature). Betamethasone was patented in 1958, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. The cream and ointment are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 263rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is available as a pill, by injection, and as an ointment, cream, lotion, gel, or aerosol (spray) for the skin, and a foam for the scalp. When given by injection, anti-inflammatory effects begin in around two hours and last for seven days. It is used as a topical cream to relieve skin irritation, such as itching and flaking from eczema. It is used as a treatment for local psoriasis, as betamethasone dipropionate and salicylic acid, or as the combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate. Betamethasone sodium phosphate is used orally and via injection with the same indications as other steroids. Many betamethasone-based pharmaceuticals include the steroid as the valerate ester. In a randomized controlled trial betamethasone was shown to reduce some of the ataxia (poor coordination) symptoms associated with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) by 28-31%. Betamethasone is also used to stimulate fetal maturation of the lungs and cerebral blood vessels. A cream with 0.05% betamethasone appears effective in treating phimosis in boys, and often averts the need for circumcision. Longer-term research is needed on this treatment method. This approach has replaced circumcision as the preferred treatment method for some physicians in the British National Health Service. == Side effects == Euphoria Depression Adrenal suppression Hypertension Groupings of fine blood vessels becoming prominent under the skin, petechiae Excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) Ecchymoses Betamethasone crosses the placenta.

In the United States and Canada, betamethasone is mixed with clotrimazole and sold as Lotrisone and Lotriderm. It is also available in combination with salicylic acid (branded as Diprosalic) for using in psoriatic skin conditions. In some countries, it is also sold mixed with both clotrimazole and gentamicin to add an antibacterial agent to the mix.

834,"('Dexamethasone', 'Hexadecadrol', 'Prednisolone f', 'Decadron', 'Maxidex')",Medical,"Dexamethasone is a fluorinated glucocorticoid medication used to treat rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, superior vena cava syndrome (a complication of some forms of cancer), and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it may be used in combination with a mineralocorticoid medication such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby. It may be given by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, as an injection into a vein, as a topical cream or ointment for the skin or as a topical ophthalmic solution to the eye. The effects of dexamethasone are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days. The long-term use of dexamethasone may result in thrush, bone loss, cataracts, easy bruising, or muscle weakness. It is in pregnancy category C in the United States, meaning that it should only be used when the benefits are predicted to be greater than the risks. In Australia, the oral use is category A, meaning it has been frequently used in pregnancy and not been found to cause problems to the baby. It should not be taken when breastfeeding. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. Dexamethasone was first synthesized in 1957 by Philip Showalter Hench and was approved for medical use in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 234th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, the combination of dexamethasone with neomycin and polymyxin B was the 274th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Anti-inflammatory === Dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40 mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids. It is also given in small amounts before and/or after some forms of dental surgery, such as the extraction of the wisdom teeth, an operation that often causes puffy, swollen cheeks. Dexamethasone is commonly given as a treatment for croup in children. A single dose can reduce the swelling of the airway to improve breathing and reduce discomfort. Dexamethasone is sometimes injected into the heel when treating plantar fasciitis or heel pain, sometimes in conjunction with triamcinolone acetonide. There is no evidence that this treatment helps in the long term, however, dexamethasone may provide short-term pain relief. It may be useful to counteract allergic anaphylactic shock, however this is not usually recommended by clinical guidelines. It is present in certain eye drops – particularly after eye surgery – and as a nasal spray, and certain ear drops (can be combined with an antibiotic and an antifungal). Dexamethasone intravitreal steroid implants have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ocular conditions such as diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. However, the evidence is poor quality relating to the treatment of uveitis, with the potential side effects (cataract progression and raised intraocular pressure) being significant, and the benefits not certainly greater than standard treatment. Dexamethasone has also been used with antibiotics to treat acute endophthalmitis. Dexamethasone is used in transvenous screw-in cardiac pacing leads to minimize the inflammatory response of the myocardium. The steroid is released into the myocardium as soon as the screw is extended and can play a significant role in minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. The typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0 mg. Dexamethasone may be administered before antibiotics in cases of bacterial meningitis. Gram-negative bacteria — to which the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, neisseria meningitidis, belongs — have highly immunogenic lipopolysaccharides as a component of their cell membrane and trigger a strong inflammatory response. Pre-administration of dexamethasone before the administration of antibiotics acts to reduce that response, thus reducing hearing loss and neurological damage. === Cancer === People with cancer undergoing chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain side effects of their antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, but it has been theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned. In brain tumors (primary or metastatic), dexamethasone is used to counteract the development of edema, which could eventually compress other brain structures. It is also given in cord compression, where a tumor is compressing the spinal cord. Evidence on the safety and efficacy of using dexamethasone to treat malignant brain tumors is not clear. Dexamethasone is also used as a direct chemotherapeutic agent in certain hematological malignancies, especially in the treatment of multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone. === COVID-19 === Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for people with COVID-19 who need either mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (without ventilation). The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests the use of glucocorticoids for people with severe COVID-19, defined as people with SpO2 ≤94% on room air, and those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The IDSA recommends against the use of glucocorticoids for those with COVID-19 without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with COVID-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence). The Oxford University RECOVERY Trial issued a press release announcing preliminary results that the drug could reduce deaths by about a third in participants on ventilators and by about a fifth in participants on oxygen; it did not benefit people who did not require respiratory support. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 participants, each treated with one of three different corticosteroids found a statistically significant reduction in death. The largest reduction was obtained with dexamethasone (36% compared to placebo). In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents, from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), who require supplemental oxygen therapy. Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein. In November 2020, the Public Health Agency of Canada's Clinical Pharmacology Task Group recommended dexamethasone for hospitalized patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Although dexamethasone, and other glucocorticoids, reduce mortality in COVID-19 they have also been associated with an increased risk of secondary infections, secondary infections being a significant issue in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The mechanism of action of dexamethasone involves suppression of late-stage interferon type I programs in severe COVID-19 patients. === Surgery === Dexamethasone is used fairly regularly, often as a single intravenous dose, during surgery to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, manage pain, potentially reduce the amount of pain medication required, and help reduce post-surgery hospitalisation time. The adverse effects of taking steroids after surgery on wound healing, blood sugar levels, and in diabetics are not completely understood; however, dexamethasone likely does not increase the risk of postoperative infections. === Endocrine === Dexamethasone is the treatment for the very rare disorder of glucocorticoid resistance. In adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease, dexamethasone is prescribed when the patient does not respond well to prednisone or methylprednisolone. It can be used in congenital adrenal hyperplasia in older adolescents and adults to suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production. It is typically given at night. === Pregnancy === Dexamethasone may be given to women at risk of delivering prematurely to promote maturation of the fetus's lungs. This administration, given from one day to one week before delivery, has been associated with low birth weight, although not with increased rates of neonatal death. Dexamethasone has also been used during pregnancy as an off-label prenatal treatment for the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in female babies. CAH causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably ambiguous genitalia. Early prenatal CAH treatment has been shown to reduce some CAH symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. This use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the fetuses of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented. Experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for fetal CAH treatment was discontinued in Sweden when one in five cases had adverse events. A small clinical trial found long-term effects on verbal working memory among the small group of children treated prenatally, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive. === High-altitude illnesses === Dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It is commonly carried on mountain-climbing expeditions to help climbers deal with complications of altitude sickness. === Nausea and vomiting === Intravenous dexamethasone is effective for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in people who had surgery and whose post-operative pain was treated with long-acting spinal or epidural spinal opioids. The combination of dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist such as ondansetron is more effective than a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. === Sore throat === A single dose of dexamethasone or another steroid speeds the improvement of a sore throat. == Contraindications == Contraindications of dexamethasone include, but are not limited to: Uncontrolled infections Known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone Cerebral malaria Systemic fungal infection Concurrent treatment with live virus vaccines (including smallpox vaccine) == Adverse effects == The exact incidence of the adverse effects of dexamethasone is not available, hence estimates have been made as to the incidence of the adverse effects below based on the adverse effects of related corticosteroids and on available documentation on dexamethasone. === Common === === Unknown frequency === === Withdrawal === Sudden withdrawal after long-term treatment with corticosteroids can lead to == Interactions == Known drug interactions include: Inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampicin can reduce the half-life of dexamethasone. Cotreatment with oral contraceptives can increase its volume of distribution. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone is an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It is highly selective for the GR over the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and in relation to this, has minimal mineralocorticoid activity. This is in contrast to endogenous corticosteroids like cortisol, which bind to and activate both the GR and the MR. Dexamethasone is 25 times more potent than hydrocortisone (cortisol) as a glucocorticoid. Its affinity (Ki) for the GR was about 1.2 nM in one study. The activation of the GR by dexamethasone results in dose-dependent suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and of production of endogenous corticosteroids by the adrenal glands, thereby reducing circulating endogenous concentrations of corticosteroids like cortisol and corticosterone. Dexamethasone poorly penetrates the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system due to binding to P-glycoprotein. However, higher doses of dexamethasone override the export capacity of P-glycoprotein and enter the brain to produce central activation of GRs. In conjunction with the suppression of endogenous corticosteroids by dexamethasone, this results in skewed ratios of activation of peripheral versus central GRs as well as skewed ratios of activation of GRs versus MRs when compared to non-synthetic corticosteroids. These differences can have significant clinical relevance. == Chemistry == Dexamethasone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. The molecular and crystal structure of dexamethasone has been determined by X-ray crystallography. It is a stereoisomer of betamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature). === Synthesis === To synthesize dexamethasone, 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is dehydrated to the 9,11-dehydro derivative. This is then reacted with a source of hypobromite, such as basic N-bromosuccinimide, to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. A ring-opening reaction with hydrogen fluoride in tetrahydrofuran gives dexamethasone. === Spectroscopy === In chemistry, spectroscopy is used to analyze products of reactions. To understand if dexamethasone is synthesized from a reaction, spectroscopy must be taken and compared to the literature spectrum. There are multiple spectroscopy analyses that can be taken including 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, Mass spectrometry, and UV/vis spectroscopy. Using IR spectroscopy, the peaks show the functional groups found in the molecule. You can see peaks at 3472, 1662, and 1618 representing alcohol, aldehyde, and alkene functional groups. UV-vis spectroscopy is another way to analyze a product to figure out what it is. Finally, mass spectroscopy showed peaks at: 393.1, 355.2 147.1 m/z. The peak at 393.1 m/z is the peak for dexamethasone as its molecular weight is 392.46 m/z. == History == Dexamethasone was first synthesized by Philip Showalter Hench in 1957. It was introduced for medical use in 1958. On 16 June 2020, the RECOVERY Trial announced preliminary results stating that dexamethasone improves survival rates of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. Benefits were only observed in patients requiring respiratory support; those who did not require breathing support saw a worse survival rate than the control group, although the difference may have been due to chance. A preprint containing the full dataset was published on 22 June 2020, and demand for dexamethasone surged after the publication of the preprint. The preliminary report was published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 18 July 2020. The final report was published in February 2021. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that dexamethasone should be reserved for seriously ill and critical patients receiving COVID-19 treatment in a hospital setting, and the WHO Director-General stated that ""WHO emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. There is no evidence this drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventative measure, and it could cause harm."" In July 2020, the WHO stated they were in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19. In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started reviewing results from the RECOVERY study arm that involved the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital to provide an opinion on the results and in particular the potential use of dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with COVID-19. In September 2020, the EMA received an application for marketing authorization of dexamethasone for COVID-19. == Society and culture == === Price === Dexamethasone is inexpensive. In the United States a month of medication is typically priced less than US$25. In India, a course of treatment for preterm labor is about US$0.50. The drug is available in most areas of the world. === Nonmedical use === Dexamethasone is given in legal Bangladesh brothels to prostitutes not yet of legal age, causing weight gain aimed at making them appear older and healthier to customers and police. Dexamethasone and most glucocorticoids are banned by sporting bodies including the World Anti-Doping Agency. == Veterinary use == Combined with marbofloxacin CAS number 115550-35-1and clotrimazole, dexamethasone is available under the name Aurizon, CAS number 50-02-2, and used to treat difficult ear infections, especially in dogs. It can also be combined with trichlormethiazide to treat horses with swelling of distal limbs and general bruising. Dexamethasone is also used for emergency patients with hypoadrenocorticism as the drug does not interfere with adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. == References == == External links == ""Dexamethasone Ophthalmic"".

Osilodrostat is an orally active (taken by mouth), nonsteroidal corticosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor which was developed by Novartis for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome and pituitary ACTH hypersecretion (a specific subtype of Cushing's syndrome). It specifically acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and at higher dosages of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). The most common side effects are adrenal insufficiency, headache, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and edema (swelling caused by fluid retention). Hypocortisolism (low cortisol levels), QTc prolongation (a heart rhythm condition) and elevations in adrenal hormone precursors (inactive substance converted into a hormone) and androgens (hormone that regulates male characteristics) may also occur in people taking osilodrostat. Osilodrostat was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020, and for medical use in the United States in March 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == History == In October 2014, an orphan designation was granted by the European Commission for osilodrostat for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Osilodrostat was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020, and for medical use in the United States in March 2020. Osilodrostat's safety and effectiveness for treating Cushing's disease among adults was evaluated in a study of 137 adult subjects (about three-quarters women) with a mean age of 41 years. The majority of subjects either had undergone pituitary surgery that did not cure Cushing's disease or were not surgical candidates. In the 24-week, single-arm, open-label period, all subjects received a starting dose of 2 milligrams (mg) of osilodrostat twice a day that could be increased every two weeks up to 30 mg twice a day. At the end of this 24-week period, about half of subjects had cortisol levels within normal limits. After this point, 71 subjects who did not need further dose increases and tolerated the drug for the last 12 weeks entered an eight-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal study where they either received osilodrostat or a placebo (inactive treatment). At the end of this withdrawal period, 86% of subjects receiving osilodrostat maintained cortisol levels within normal limits compared to 30% of subjects taking the placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved osilodrostat based on the evidence from one clinical trial (NCT02180217) of 137 subjects with Cushing's disease. The trial was conducted at 66 sites across 19 countries (United States, Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Columbia, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Russia, Thailand, and Turkey). There was one trial of 48 weeks duration that assessed the benefits and side effects of osilodrostat. The trial enrolled subjects with Cushing's disease for whom pituitary gland surgery was not an option or did not work. The trial was divided in four periods. Subjects received osilodrostat two times a day in all four periods. After the first two periods (24 weeks), the benefit of osilodrostat was assessed by the percentage of subjects who had 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels within normal limits. In the third period (which lasted eight weeks), half of the subjects who had normal urinary free cortisol levels after 24 weeks of treatment continued taking osilodrostat and the other half was switched to placebo. Neither the subjects nor the healthcare providers know which treatment was given during this period. The benefit of osilodrostat was assessed on the percentage of subjects who had normal cortisol levels at the end of this period versus the subjects who received placebo. The FDA granted osilodrostat an orphan drug designation and granted the approval of Isturisa to Novartis. == Society and culture == === Economics === At the recommended starting dose of 2 mg, a year's supply would cost US$172,800 at 2021 prices in the United States. == Research == A systematic review and meta-analysis of osilodrostat, published in 2024, found it to have efficacy and safety in normalizing serum cortisol levels in people with Cushing's Syndrome. == References == == Further reading == Turcu A, Smith JM, Auchus R, Rainey WE (October 2014).

Teriflunomide was investigated in the Phase III clinical trial TEMSO as a medication for multiple sclerosis (MS). The study was completed in July 2010. 2-year results were positive. However, the subsequent TENERE head-to-head comparison trial reported that ""although permanent discontinuations [of therapy] were substantially less common among MS patients who received teriflunomide compared with interferon beta-1a, relapses were more common with teriflunomide."" The drug was approved for use in the United States in September 2012 and for use in the European Union in August 2013. == Adverse effects == The US Food and Drug Administration's prescribing information warns of potential hepatotoxicity (liver injury including liver failure) and teratogenicity (birth defects). Elavated ALT enzyme levels is the most common side effect (≥10% and ≥2% over placebo). == Mechanisms of action == Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug inhibiting pyrimidine de novo synthesis by blocking the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It is uncertain whether this explains its effect on MS lesions. Teriflunomide inhibits rapidly dividing cells, including activated T cells, which are thought to drive the disease process in MS. Teriflunomide may decrease the risk of infections compared to chemotherapy-like drugs because of its more-limited effects on the immune system. It has been found that teriflunomide blocks the transcription factor NF-κB. It also inhibits tyrosine kinase enzymes, but only in high doses not clinically used. == Activation of leflunomide to teriflunomide == The branded drug teriflunomide is the main active in vivo metabolite of the generically available leflunomide. Upon administration of leflunomide, 70% of the drug administered converts into teriflunomide. The only difference between the molecules is the opening of the isoxazole ring. This is considered a simple structural modification and a technically simple one-step synthetic transformation. Upon oral administration of leflunomide in vivo, the isoxazole ring of leflunomide is opened and teriflunomide is formed. ""Regardless of the substance administered (leflunomide or teriflunomide), it is the same molecule (teriflunomide)—the one exerting the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action in view of restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions, and does not present, in clinical use, a new chemical entity to patients.""

838,"('Cyproterone acetate', 'Androcur', 'Cyproterone 17-o-acetate', 'Cyproteroneacetate', 'Cyproteron acetate')",Medical,"Cyproterone acetate (CPA), sold alone under the brand name Androcur or with ethinylestradiol under the brand names Diane or Diane-35 among others, is an antiandrogen and progestin medication used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as acne, excessive body hair growth, early puberty, and prostate cancer, as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender individuals, and in birth control pills. It is formulated and used both alone and in combination with an estrogen. CPA is taken by mouth one to three times per day. Common side effects of high-dose CPA in men include gynecomastia (breast development) and feminization. In both men and women, possible side effects of CPA include low sex hormone levels, reversible infertility, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, weight gain, and elevated liver enzymes. With prolonged use, brain tumors prompting surgery are common, from 5% at high doses to 2% at low doses. At very high doses in older individuals, significant cardiovascular complications can occur. Rare but serious adverse reactions of CPA include blood clots, and liver damage. CPA can also cause adrenal insufficiency as a withdrawal effect if it is discontinued abruptly from a high dosage. CPA blocks the effects of androgens such as testosterone in the body, which it does by preventing them from interacting with their biological target, the androgen receptor (AR), and by reducing their production by the gonads, hence their concentrations in the body. In addition, it has progesterone-like effects by activating the progesterone receptor (PR). It can also produce weak cortisol-like effects at very high doses. CPA was discovered in 1961. It was originally developed as a progestin. In 1965, the antiandrogenic effects of CPA were discovered. CPA was first marketed, as an antiandrogen, in 1973, and was the first antiandrogen to be introduced for medical use. A few years later, in 1978, CPA was introduced as a progestin in a birth control pill. It has been described as a ""first-generation"" progestin and as the prototypical antiandrogen. CPA is available widely throughout the world. An exception is the United States, where it is not approved for use. == Medical uses == CPA is used as a progestin and antiandrogen in hormonal birth control and in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions. Specifically, CPA is used in combined birth control pills, in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, excessive hair growth, and scalp hair loss, high androgen levels, in transgender hormone therapy, to treat prostate cancer, to reduce sex drive in sex offenders or men with paraphilias or hypersexuality, to treat early puberty, and for other uses. Treatment dosages range from 2mg or less, to 100mg or more daily. In the United States, where CPA is not available, other medications with antiandrogenic effects are used to treat androgen-dependent conditions instead. Examples of such medications include gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators) like leuprorelin and degarelix, nonsteroidal antiandrogens like flutamide and bicalutamide, the diuretic and steroidal antiandrogen spironolactone, the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate, and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride. The steroidal antiandrogen and progestin chlormadinone acetate is used as an alternative to CPA in Japan, South Korea, and a few other countries. In 2020, the European Medicine Agency issued a warning that high doses of cyproterone acetate may contribute to risk of meningioma, and recommended physicians use alternative treatment for most indications (or the minimum effective dose where no alternatives were available) with the exception of prostate carcinoma. === Birth control === CPA is used with ethinylestradiol as a combined birth control pill to prevent pregnancy. This birth control combination has been available since 1978. The formulation is taken once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day free interval. CPA has also been available in combination with estradiol valerate (brand name Femilar) as a combined birth control pill in Finland since 1993. High-dose CPA tablets have a contraceptive effect and can be used as a form of birth control, although they are not specifically licensed as such. === Skin and hair conditions === ==== Females ==== CPA is used as an antiandrogen to treat androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), scalp hair loss, and hidradenitis suppurativa in women. These conditions are worsened by the presence of androgens, and by suppressing androgen levels and blocking their actions, CPA improves the symptoms of these conditions. CPA is used to treat such conditions both at low doses as a birth control pill and on its own at higher doses. A birth control pill containing low-dose CPA in combination with ethinylestradiol to treat acne has been found to result in overall improvement in 75 to 90% of women, with responses approaching 100% improvement. High-dose CPA alone likewise has been found to improve symptoms of acne by 75 to 90% in women. Discontinuation of CPA has been found to result in marked recurrence of symptoms in up to 70% of women. CPA is one of the most commonly used medications in the treatment of hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary syndrome in women throughout the world. Higher dosages of CPA are used in combination with an estrogen specifically at doses of 25 to 100 mg/day cyclically in the treatment of hirsutism in women. The efficacy of such dosages of CPA in the treatment of hirsutism in women appear to be similar to that of spironolactone, flutamide, and finasteride. Randomized controlled trials have found that higher dosages of CPA (e.g., 20 mg/day or 100 mg/day) added cyclically to a birth control pill containing ethinylestradiol and 2 mg/day CPA were no more effective or only marginally more effective in the treatment of severe hirsutism in women than the birth control pill alone. Maintenance therapy with lower doses of CPA, such as 25 mg/day, has been found to be effective in preventing relapse of symptoms of hirsutism. CPA has typically been combined with ethinylestradiol, but it can alternatively be used in combination with hormone replacement therapy dosages of estradiol instead. CPA at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with 100 μg/day transdermal estradiol patches has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism similarly to the combination of CPA with ethinylestradiol. The efficacy of the combination of an estrogen and CPA in the treatment of hirsutism in women appears to be due to marked suppression of total and free androgen levels as well as additional blockade of the androgen receptor. ==== Males ==== CPA has been found to be effective in the treatment of acne in males, with marked improvement in symptoms observed at dosages of 25, 50, and 100 mg/day in different studies. It can also halt further progression of scalp hair loss in men. Increased head hair and decreased body hair has been observed with CPA in men with scalp hair loss. However, its side effects in men, such as demasculinization, gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, bone density loss, and reversible infertility, make the use of CPA in males impractical in most cases. In addition, lower dosages of CPA, such as 25 mg/day, have been found to be better-tolerated in men. But such doses also show lower effectiveness in the treatment of acne in men. === High androgen levels === CPA is used as an antiandrogen to treat high androgen levels and associated symptoms such as masculinization due to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in women. It is almost always combined with an estrogen, such as ethinylestradiol, when it is used in the treatment of PCOS in women. === Menopausal hormone therapy === CPA is used at low doses in menopausal hormone therapy in combination with an estrogen to provide endometrial protection and treat menopausal symptoms. It is used in menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name Climen, which is a sequential preparation that contains 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg CPA. Climen was the first product for use in menopausal hormone therapy containing CPA to be marketed. It is available in more than 40 countries. === Transgender hormone therapy === CPA is widely used as an antiandrogen and progestogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender individuals. It has been historically used orally at a dosage of 10 to 100 mg/day and by intramuscular injection at a dosage of 300 mg once every 4 weeks. Many transgender individuals seeking feminizing hormone therapy have breast growth as one of the goals for undergoing feminizing hormone therapy, making this particular side effect of CPA generally viewed as a beneficial outcome rather than an issue. Studies have found that 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/day CPA in combination with estrogen all result in equivalent and full testosterone suppression in transgender women. In light of risks of CPA such as fatigue, blood clots, benign brain tumors, and liver damage, the use of lower dosages of CPA may help to minimize such risks. As a result, a CPA dosage of 10 mg/day and no greater is now recommended by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 (SOC8). CPA has an advantage over spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender people, as the combination of estrogen and CPA consistently suppresses testosterone levels into the normal female range whereas estrogen with spironolactone does not. Spironolactone is the most widely used antiandrogen in transgender women in the United States, whereas CPA is widely used in Europe and throughout the rest of the world. Aside from adult transgender people, CPA has also been used as a puberty blocker and hence as an antiandrogen and antiestrogen to suppress puberty in transgender adolescents, although GnRH modulators are primarily used and more effective for this purpose. === Prostate cancer === CPA is used as an antiandrogen monotherapy and means of androgen deprivation therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. It is used at very high doses by mouth or by intramuscular injection to treat this disease. Antiandrogens do not cure prostate cancer, but can significantly extend life in men with the disease. CPA has similar effectiveness to GnRH modulators and surgical castration, high-dose estrogen therapy (e.g., with diethylstilbestrol), and high-dose nonsteroidal antiandrogen monotherapy (e.g., with bicalutamide), but has significantly inferior effectiveness to combined androgen blockade with a GnRH modulator and a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (e.g., with bicalutamide or enzalutamide). In addition, the combination of CPA with a GnRH modulator or surgical castration has not been found to improve outcomes relative to a GnRH modulator or surgical castration alone, in contrast to nonsteroidal antiandrogens. Due to its inferior effectiveness, tolerability, and safety, CPA is rarely used in the treatment of prostate cancer today, having largely been superseded by GnRH modulators and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. CPA is the only steroidal antiandrogen that continues to be used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Dose-ranging studies of CPA for prostate cancer were not performed, and the optimal dosage of CPA for the treatment of the condition has not been established. A dosage range of oral CPA of 100 to 300 mg/day is used in the treatment of prostate cancer, but generally 150 to 200 mg/day oral CPA is used. Schröder (1993, 2002) reviewed the issue of CPA dosage and recommended a dosage of 200 to 300 mg/day for CPA as a monotherapy and a dosage of 100 to 200 mg/day for CPA in combined androgen blockade (that is, CPA in combination with surgical or medical castration). However, the combination of CPA with castration for prostate cancer has been found to significantly decrease overall survival compared to castration alone. Hence, the use of CPA as the antiandrogen component in combined androgen blockade would appear not to be advisable. When used by intramuscular injection to treat prostate cancer, CPA is used at a dosage of 300 mg once a week. The combination of CPA with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol sulfonate or low-dose diethylstilbestrol has been used as a form of combined androgen blockade and as an alternative to the combination of CPA with surgical or medical castration. === Sexual deviance === CPA is used as an antiandrogen and form of chemical castration in the treatment of paraphilias and hypersexuality in men. It is used to treat sex offenders. The medication is approved in more than 20 countries for this indication and is predominantly employed in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. CPA works by decreasing sex drive and sexual arousal and producing sexual dysfunction. CPA can also be used to reduce sex drive in individuals with inappropriate sexual behaviors, such as people with intellectual disability and dementia. The medication is also used to reduce sexual behavior diagnosed as self-harmful, such as masochism. CPA has comparable effectiveness to medroxyprogesterone acetate in suppressing sexual urges and function but appears to be less effective than GnRH modulators like leuprorelin and has more side effects. High-dose CPA significantly decreases sexual fantasies and sexual activity in 80 to 90% of men with paraphilias. In addition, it has been found to decrease the rate of reoffending in sex offenders from 85% to 6%, with most of the reoffenses being committed by individuals who did not follow their CPA treatment prescription. It has been reported that in 80% of cases, 100 mg/day CPA is adequate to achieve the desired reduction of sexuality, whereas in the remaining 20% of cases, 200 mg/day is sufficient. When only a partial reduction in sexuality is desired, 50 mg/day CPA can be useful. Reduced sexual desire and erectile function occurs with CPA by the end of the first week of treatment, and becomes maximal within three to four weeks. The dosage range is 50 to 300 mg/day. === Early puberty === CPA is used as an antiandrogen and antiestrogen to treat precocious puberty in boys and girls. However, it is not fully satisfactory for this indication because it is not able to completely suppress puberty. It does not suppress skeletal maturation enough to avoid a reduction in height at adulthood. For this reason, CPA has mostly been superseded by GnRH agonists in the treatment of precocious puberty. CPA is not satisfactory for gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. CPA has been used at dosages of 50 to 300 mg/m2 to treat precocious puberty. === Other uses === CPA is useful in the treatment of hot flashes, for instance due to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. CPA is useful for suppressing the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy. It has been used successfully both alone and in combination with estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol for this purpose. === Available forms === CPA is available in the form of oral tablets alone (higher-dose; 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg) or in combination with ethinylestradiol or estradiol valerate (low-dose; 1 or 2 mg CPA) and in the form of ampoules for intramuscular injection (higher-dose; 100 mg/mL, 300 mg/3 mL; brand name Androcur Depot). The higher-dose formulations are used to treat prostate cancer and certain other androgen-related indications while the low-dose formulations which also have an estrogen are used as combined birth control pills and are used in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. == Contraindications == Contraindications of CPA include: Hypersensitivity to CPA or any of the other components of the medication Pregnancy, lactation, and breastfeeding Puberty (except if being used to treat precocious puberty or delay puberty) Liver diseases and liver dysfunction Chronic kidney disease Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome History of jaundice or persistent pruritus during pregnancy History of herpes during pregnancy Previous or existing liver tumors (only if not due to metastases from prostate cancer) Previous or existing meningioma, hyperprolactinemia, or prolactinoma Wasting syndromes (except in inoperable prostate cancer) Severe depression Previous or existing thromboembolic processes, as well as stroke and myocardial infarction Severe diabetes with vascular changes Sickle-cell anemia When CPA is used in combination with an estrogen, contraindications for birth control pills should also be considered. == Side effects == CPA is generally well-tolerated and has a mild side-effect profile regardless of dosage when it is used in combination with an estrogen in women. Side effects of CPA in general include hypogonadism (low sex-hormone levels) and associated symptoms such as demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and osteoporosis (fragile bones); breast changes such as breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and gynecomastia (breasts in men); emotional changes such as fatigue and depression; and other side effects such as vitamin B12 deficiency, weak glucocorticoid effects, and elevated liver enzymes. Weight gain can occur with CPA when it is used at high doses. Some of the side effects of CPA can be improved or fully prevented if it is combined with an estrogen to prevent estrogen deficiency. Few quantitative data are available on many of the potential side effects of CPA. Pooled tolerability data for CPA is not available in the literature. Cyproterone is also known to suppress adrenocortical function. At very high doses in aged men with prostate cancer, CPA can cause cardiovascular side effects. Rarely, CPA can produce blood clots, liver toxicity (including hepatitis, liver failure, and liver cancer), excessively high prolactin levels, and certain benign brain tumors including meningiomas (tumors of the meninges) and prolactinomas (prolactin-secreting tumors of the pituitary gland). Upon discontinuation from high doses, CPA can produce adrenal insufficiency as a withdrawal effect. == Overdose == CPA is relatively safe in acute overdose. It is used at very high doses of up to 300 mg/day by mouth and 700 mg per week by intramuscular injection. For comparison, the dose of CPA used in birth control pills is 2 mg/day. There have been no deaths associated with CPA overdose. There are no specific antidotes for CPA overdose, and treatment should be symptom-based. Gastric lavage can be used in the event of oral overdose within the last 2 to 3 hours. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 may interact with CPA. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, and ritonavir, while examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers include rifampicin, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort. Certain anticonvulsant medications can substantially reduce levels of CPA, by as much as 8-fold. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === CPA has antiandrogenic activity, progestogenic activity, weak partial glucocorticoid activity, weak steroidogenesis inhibitor activity, and agonist activity at the pregnane X receptor. It has no estrogenic or antimineralocorticoid activity. In terms of potency, CPA is described as a highly potent progestogen, a moderately potent antiandrogen, and a weak glucocorticoid. Due to its progestogenic activity, CPA has antigonadotropic effects, and is able to suppress fertility and sex-hormone levels in both males and females. === Pharmacokinetics === CPA can be taken by mouth or by injection into muscle. It has near-complete oral bioavailability, is highly and exclusively bound to albumin in terms of plasma protein binding, is metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation and conjugation, has 15β-hydroxycyproterone acetate (15β-OH-CPA) as a single major active metabolite, has a long elimination half-life of about 2 to 4 days regardless of route of administration, and is excreted in feces primarily and to a lesser extent in urine. == Chemistry == CPA, also known as 1α,2α-methylene-6-chloro-17α-acetoxy-δ6-progesterone or as 1α,2α-methylene-6-chloro-17α-hydroxypregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione acetate, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and an acetylated derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is structurally related to other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of CPA have been published. The following is one such synthesis: The dehydrogenation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate [302-23-8] (1) with chloranil (tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone) gives a compound that has been called melengestrol acetate [425-51-4] (2). Dehydrogenation with selenium dioxide gives 17-acetoxy-1,4,6-pregnatriene-3,20-dione [2668-75-9] (3). Reacting this with diazomethane results in a 1,3-dipolar addition reaction at C1–C2 of the double bond of the steroid system, which forms a derivative of dihydropyrazole, CID:134990386 (4). This compound cleaves when reacted with perchloric acid, releasing nitrogen molecules and forming a cyclopropane derivative, 6-deschloro cyproterone acetate [2701-50-0] (5). Selective oxidation of the C6=C7 olefin with benzoyl peroxide gives the epoxide, i.e. 6-deschloro-6,7-epoxy cyproterone [15423-97-9] (6). The penultimate step involves a reaction with hydrochloric acid in acetic acid, resulting in the formation of chlorine and its subsequent dehydration, and a simultaneous opening of the cyclopropane ring giving 1α-(chloromethyl) chlormadinone acetate [17183-98-1] (7). The heating of this in collidine reforms the cyclopropane ring, completing the synthesis of CPA (8). == History == CPA was first synthesized in 1961 by Rudolf Wiechert, a Schering employee, and together with Friedmund Neumann in Berlin, they filed for a patent for CPA as ""progestational agent"" in 1962. The antiandrogenic activity of CPA was discovered serendipitously by Hamada, Neumann, and Karl Junkmann in 1963. Along with the steroidal antiandrogens benorterone (17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone; SKF-7690), cyproterone, BOMT (Ro 7–2340), and trimethyltrienolone (R-2956) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and DIMP (Ro 7–8117), CPA was one of the first antiandrogens to be discovered and researched. CPA was initially developed as a progestogen for the prevention of threatened abortion. As part of its development, it was assessed for androgenic activity to ensure that it would not produce teratogenic effects in female fetuses. The drug was administered to pregnant rats and its effects on the rat fetuses were studied. To the surprise of the researchers, all of the rat pups born appeared to be female. After 20 female rat pups in a row had been counted, it was clear that this could not be a chance occurrence. The rat pups were further evaluated and it was found that, in terms of karyotype, about 50% were actually males. The male rat pups had been feminized, and this resultant finding constituted the discovery of the powerful antiandrogenic activity of CPA. A year after patent approval in 1965, Neumann published additional evidence of CPA's antiandrogenic effect in rats; he reported an ""organizational effect of CPA on the brain"". CPA started being used in animal experiments around the world to investigate how antiandrogens affected fetal sexual differentiation. The first clinical use of CPA in the treatment of sexual deviance and prostate cancer occurred in 1966. It was first studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair symptoms, specifically acne, hirsutism, seborrhea, and scalp hair loss, in 1969. CPA was first approved for medical use in 1973 in Europe under the brand name Androcur. In 1977, a formulation of CPA was introduced for use by intramuscular injection. CPA was first marketed as a birth control pill in 1978 in combination with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Diane. Following phase III clinical trials, CPA was approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in Germany in 1980. CPA became available in Canada as Androcur in 1987, as Androcur Depot in 1990, and as Diane-35 in 1998. Conversely, CPA was never introduced in any form in the United States. This was reportedly due to concerns about breast tumors observed with high-dose pregnane progestogens in beagle dogs as well as concerns about potential teratogenicity in pregnant women. Use of CPA in transgender women, an off-label indication, was reported as early as 1977. The use of CPA in transgender women was well-established by the early 1990s. The history of CPA, including its discovery, development, and marketing, has been reviewed. == Society and culture == === Generic names === The English and generic name of CPA is cyproterone acetate and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. The English and generic name of unacetylated cyproterone is cyproterone and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while cyprotérone is the DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and French name and ciproterone is the DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana and Italian name. The name of unesterified cyproterone in Latin is cyproteronum, in German is cyproteron, and in Spanish is ciproterona. These names of cyproterone correspond for CPA to acétate de cyprotérone in French, acetato de ciproterona in Spanish, ciproterone acetato in Italian, cyproteronacetat in German, siproteron asetat in Turkish, and cyproteronacetaat in Dutch. CPA is also known by the developmental code names SH-80714 and SH-714, while unacetylated cyproterone is known by the developmental code names SH-80881 and SH-881. === Brand names === CPA is marketed under brand names including Androcur, Androcur Depot, Androcur-100, Androstat, Asoteron, Cyprone, Cyproplex, Cyprostat, Cysaxal, Imvel, and Siterone. When CPA is formulated in combination with ethinylestradiol, it is also known as co-cyprindiol, and brand names for this formulation include Andro-Diane, Bella HEXAL 35, Chloe, Cypretil, Cypretyl, Cyproderm, Diane, Diane Mite, Diane-35, Dianette, Dixi 35, Drina, Elleacnelle, Estelle, Estelle-35, Ginette, Linface, Minerva, Vreya, and Zyrona. CPA is also marketed in combination with estradiol valerate as Climen, Climene, Elamax, and Femilar. === Availability === CPA is widely available throughout the world, and is marketed in almost every developed country, with the notable major exceptions of the United States and Japan. In almost all countries in which CPA is marketed, it is available both alone and in combination with an estrogen in birth control pills. CPA is marketed widely in combination with both ethinylestradiol and estradiol valerate. CPA-containing birth control pills are available in South Korea, but CPA as a standalone medication is not marketed in this country. In Japan and South Korea, the closely related antiandrogen and progestin chlormadinone acetate, as well as other medications, are used instead of CPA. Specific places in which CPA is marketed include the United Kingdom, elsewhere throughout Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, and Asia. CPA is not marketed in most of Africa and the Middle East. It has been said that the lack of availability of CPA in the United States explains why there are relatively few studies of it in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as hyperandrogenism and hirsutism in women. === Generation === Progestins in birth control pills are sometimes grouped by generation. While the 19-nortestosterone progestins are consistently grouped into generations, the pregnane progestins that are or have been used in birth control pills are typically omitted from such classifications or are grouped simply as ""miscellaneous"" or ""pregnanes"". In any case, CPA has been described as a ""first-generation"" progestin similarly to closely related progestins like chlormadinone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. == Research == CPA has been studied and used in combination with low-dose diethylstilbestrol in the treatment of prostate cancer. The combination results in suppression of testosterone levels into the castrate range, which normally cannot be achieved with CPA alone. CPA has been studied as a form of androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate). The medication has been studied in the treatment of breast cancer as well. CPA has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive both alone and in combination with testosterone in men. CPA was under development by Barr Pharmaceuticals in the 2000s for the treatment of hot flashes in prostate cancer patients in the United States. It reached phase III clinical trials for this indication and had the tentative brand name CyPat but development was ultimately discontinued in 2008. CPA is not satisfactorily effective as topical antiandrogen, for instance in the treatment of acne. CPA has been used to treat estrogen hypersensitivity vulvovaginitis in women. CPA has been investigated for use in reducing aggression and self-injurious behavior via its antiandrogenic effects in conditions like autism spectrum disorders, dementias like Alzheimer's disease, and psychosis. CPA may be effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). CPA has been studied in the treatment of cluster headaches in men. == See also == Estradiol valerate/cyproterone acetate Ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate == References == == Further reading == == External links == Die Geschichte des Wirkstoffs Cyproteronazetat: Von der ""Pille für den Mann"" zum ""Hautpflegemittel mit Empfängnisschutz"" [The History of Cyproterone Acetate: From the ""Pill for Men"" to the ""Skin Care Product and Contraceptive""] - Arznei-Telegramm (in German) [Google Translate]",Cyproteron acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012396997772157192), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004088615067303181)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyproterone_acetate ', [])"

We present a phase Ib/II study of a combination of varlitinib and weekly paclitaxel as a second-line treatment for patients with EGFR/HER2 co-expressing advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Patients whose tumors with EGFR and HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (≥ 1+) were enrolled. Varlitinib and paclitaxel were investigated every 4 weeks. After determining the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in phase Ib, a phase II study was conducted to evaluate the antitumor activity. RP2D was treated with a combination of varlitinib (300 mg twice daily) and paclitaxel. Among 27 patients treated with RP2D, the median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 3.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 4.9) and 7.9 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 10.8), respectively, with a median follow-up of 15.7 months. Among 16 patients with measurable disease, the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate were 31% and 88%, respectively. Patients with strong HER2 expression (n=8) had a higher ORR and longer OS, whereas those with strong EGFR expression (n=3) had poorer outcomes. The most common adverse events (AEs) of any grade were neutropenia (52%), diarrhea (27%), aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transaminase elevation (22%), and nausea (19%). No treatment-related deaths or unexpected AEs resulting from treatment cessation were observed in patients with RP2D. A combination of varlitinib and paclitaxel displayed manageable toxicity and modest antitumor activity in patients with EGFR/HER2 co-expressing AGC who progressed after first-line chemotherapy. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancer who progress on first-line therapy have limited treatment options. The TreeTopp study assessed varlitinib, a reversible small molecule pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, plus capecitabine in previously treated advanced biliary tract cancer. This global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study enrolled patients with confirmed unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer and disease progression after one prior line of gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. Patients received oral varlitinib 300 mg or placebo twice daily (b.i.d.) for 21 days, plus oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m In total, 127 patients received varlitinib plus capecitabine (n = 64) or placebo plus capecitabine (n = 63). The objective response rate was 9.4% with varlitinib plus capecitabine versus 4.8% with capecitabine alone (odds ratio 2.28; P = 0.42). Median PFS was 2.83 versus 2.79 months [hazard ratio (HR), 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-1.37; P = 0.63] and overall survival was 7.8 versus 7.5 months (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.69-1.79; P = 0.66), respectively. In a subgroup analysis, the addition of varlitinib appeared to provide a PFS benefit in female patients (median, 4.1 versus 2.8 months; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.28-1.23) and those with gallbladder cancer (median, 2.9 versus 1.6 months; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.26-1.19). Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 65.6% of patients receiving varlitinib plus capecitabine versus 58.7% of those receiving capecitabine alone. In patients with advanced biliary tract cancer, second-line treatment with varlitinib plus capecitabine was well tolerated but did not improve efficacy versus capecitabine alone. A PFS benefit was suggested in female patients and those with gallbladder cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a complex disease associated with the aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. TNBC harbors heterogeneous molecular subtypes with no approved specific targeted therapy. It has been reported that HER receptors are overexpressed in breast cancer including TNBC. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of varlitinib, a reversible small molecule pan-HER inhibitor in TNBC. Our results showed that varlitinib reduced cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in most TNBC cell lines but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. MEK and ERK inhibition overcame resistance to varlitinib in MDA-MB-231 cells. Varlitinib inhibited HER signaling which led to inhibition of migration, invasion and mammosphere formation of TNBC cells as well as significant suppression of tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 xenograft mouse model. In summary, these results suggest that HER signaling plays an important role in TNBC progression and that pan-HER inhibition is potentially an effective treatment for TNBC patients.",Varlitinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.245071224635467e-05), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007185738068073988)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ir.aslanpharma.com](https://ir.aslanpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aslan-pharmaceuticals-announces-topline-results-treetopp-global?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=176, start_index=9, title='ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Announces Topline Results From TreeTopp Global Pivotal Study of Varlitinib in Biliary Tract Cancer – ASLAN Pharmaceuticals', type='url_citation', url='https://ir.aslanpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aslan-pharmaceuticals-announces-topline-results-treetopp-global?utm_source=openai')])"

It was developed by Eli Lilly and it acts as a CDK inhibitor selective for CDK4 and CDK6. It was designated as a breakthrough therapy for breast cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2015. In September 2017, it was approved for use in the United States by the FDA for the treatment of certain breast cancers. == Medical uses == Since September 2017, abemaciclib has been approved in the US for ""adults who have hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after taking therapy that alters a patient's hormones"". In studies that compared fulvestrant plus abemaciclib to fulvestrant plus placebo in breast cancer patients, progression-free survival under abemaciclib therapy was 16.4 months on average, as compared to 9.3 months under the placebo arm. == Side effects == Side effects that occurred in 20% or more of patients in studies were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, leukopenia (low white blood cell count) including neutropenia, anemia (low red blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), stomach pain, infections, fatigue, decreased appetite, and headache. == Interactions == As abemaciclib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, inhibitors of this enzyme (such as ketoconazole) are expected to increase its blood plasma concentrations. Conversely, CYP3A4 inducers lower plasma concentrations of abemaciclib, as has been shown in a study with rifampicin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like the related drugs palbociclib and ribociclib, abemaciclib inhibits the enzymes cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). These enzymes are responsible for phosphorylating and thus deactivating the retinoblastoma protein, which plays a role in cell cycle progression from the G1 (first gap) to the S (synthesis) phase. Blocking this pathway prevents cells from progressing to the S phase, thereby inducing apoptosis (cell death). In vitro analysis using cancer cell lines, it is reported that abemaciclib induces non-apoptotic cell death characterized by formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles derived from lysosomes. This result suggests that there may be a mechanism of action other than inhibition of a cyclin-dependent kinase. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral intake, absolute bioavailability is 45%. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after 8 hours on average (range: 4.1–24.0 hours). When in the circulation, 96.3% of abemaciclib is bound to plasma proteins. The substance is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 to N-desethylabemaciclib (M2), and to a lesser extent to hydroxy derivatives (M18, M20) and another oxidative metabolite (M1). These metabolites have high plasma protein binding rates similar to the parent substance. Abemaciclib is excreted mainly via the feces (81%) and to a small extent via the urine (3%). Its elimination half-life is 18.3 hours on average. == Clinical trials == Successful trials against pre-treated metastatic breast cancer were announced for Phase I in May 2014, Phase II in December 2014, and Phase III in February 2017. Abemaciclib was approved by the FDA in September 2017 either in combination with fulvestrant or as a monotherapy for women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed while receiving endocrine therapy. Abemaciclib was approved for the adjuvant treatment of HR+, HER2-, node-positive adjuvant breast cancer at high risk of recurrence in March 2023. As of 2023, abemaciclib was involved in two Phase III clinical trials: The SARC041 study compares abemaciclib versus placebo in patients with advanced dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The CYCLONE 3 study compares abemaciclib versus placebo in combination with abiraterone and prednisone in patients with high-risk, metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Abemaciclib is in Phase I and II clinical trials for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, biliary tract carcinoma, brain tumors, neurofibromatosis, Kaposi sarcoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and Mantle Cell lymphoma. == Chemistry == Abemaciclib may be synthesized in a four step manner using a Suzuki coupling, followed by a Buchwald–Hartwig amination with the final step being a reductive amination using the Leuckart reaction. == References ==",Verzenio,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.936446541454643e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021264675888232887)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-receives-us-fda-approval-verzeniotm-abemaciclib,https://verzenio.lilly.com/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abemaciclib ', [])"

845,"('Toltrazuril (sulfone)', 'Ponazuril', 'Toltrazuril sulfone', 'Marquis', 'Ponazuril [inn]')",Medical,"A marquess (UK: ; French: marquis [maʁki]) is a nobleman of high hereditary rank in various European peerages and in those of some of their former colonies. The German-language equivalent is Markgraf (margrave). A woman with the rank of a marquess or the wife (or widow) of a marquess is a marchioness () or marquise (French: [maʁkiz] ). These titles are also used to translate equivalent Asian styles, as in Imperial China and Imperial Japan. == Etymology == The word marquess entered the English language from the Old French marchis (""ruler of a border area"") in the late 13th or early 14th century. The French word was derived from marche (""frontier""), itself descended from the Middle Latin marca (""frontier""), from which the modern English word march also descends. The distinction between governors of frontier territories and interior territories was made as early as the founding of the Roman Empire when some provinces were set aside for administration by the senate and more unpacified or vulnerable provinces were administered by the emperor. The titles ""duke"" and ""count"" were similarly distinguished as ranks in the Byzantine Empire, with dux (literally, ""leader"") being used for a provincial military governor and the rank of comes (literally ""companion"", that is, of the Emperor) given to the leader of an active army along the frontier. == Belgium == The title of marquess in Belgium predates the French Revolution and still exists today. See Belgian nobility § Marquesses in the Belgian nobility and List of noble families in Belgium § Marquesses. == Spain == In Spain, the rank of Marquess/Marchioness (Marqués/Marquesa) still exists. One hundred forty-two of them are Spanish grandees. Normally a marqués is addressed as ""The Most Illustrious Lord"" (Ilustrísimo Señor), or if he/she is a grandee as ""The Most Excellent Lord"" (Excelentísimo Señor). Examples include the Marquess of Carpio, Grandee of Spain. == United Kingdom == In Great Britain and historically in Ireland, a marquess ranks below a duke and above an earl. A woman with the rank of a marquess, or the wife of a marquess, is a marchioness . The dignity, rank, or position of the title is a marquisate or marquessate. The honorific prefix ""The Most Honourable"" precedes the name of a marquess or marchioness of the United Kingdom. In Great Britain, and historically in Ireland, the spelling of this title is marquess. In Scotland, the French spelling marquis is sometimes used. The theoretical distinction between a marquess and other titles has, since the Middle Ages, faded into obscurity. In times past, the distinction between a count and a marquess was that the land of a marquess, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a county, often was not. As a result of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbours and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count. The title is ranked below that of a duke, which was often largely restricted to the royal family. The rank of marquess was a relatively late introduction to the British peerage: no marcher lords had the rank of marquess, though some were earls. On the evening of the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained to her why (from her journals): I spoke to [Lord Melbourne] about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, & he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied ""There are very few Viscounts,"" that they were an old sort of title & not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes & Barons were the only real English titles; – that Marquises were likewise not English, & that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes. == Analogous non-Western titles == Like other major Western noble titles, marquess (or marquis) is sometimes used to translate certain titles from non-Western languages with their own traditions, even though they are, as a rule, historically unrelated and thus hard to compare. However, they are considered ""equivalent"" in relative rank. This is the case with: In ancient China, 侯 (hóu) a noble rank created by King Wu of Zhou for rulers of newly conquered regions, and is generally translated as marquess or marquis. In imperial China, 侯 (hóu) is generally, but not always, a middle-to-high ranking hereditary nobility title. Its exact rank varies greatly from dynasty to dynasty, and even within a dynasty. It is often created with different sub-ranks, with 列侯 (liè hóu, Ranged Marquis) generally the highest. In Meiji Japan, 侯爵 (kōshaku), a hereditary peerage (kazoku) rank, was introduced in 1884, granting a hereditary seat in the upper house of the imperial diet just as a British peerage did (until the House of Lords Act 1999), with the ranks usually rendered as baron, viscount, count, marquis and duke/prince. In Korea, the title of 현후 (縣侯; hyeonhu), the meaning of which is ""marquess of district"", existed for the hereditary nobility in the Goryeo dynasty. It was equivalent to the upper fifth rank of nine bureaucratic orders, and was in the third rank of six nobility orders. The title of Buwongun, could be received only Father in law of King or The Vassals who dedicate Notably to create New kingdom is also same as Marquess. In the Joseon dynasty, there was no title equivalent to marquess. In Maritime Southeast Asia, temenggong (or tumenggung) is a title used by Islamic dynasties such as Mataram Sultanate and Johor to designate a noble ruled over a frontier area or district, or to a chief of public security. Tumenggung ranks below Bendahara or vizier. In Vietnam, hầu (侯) was a senior title of hereditary nobility, equivalent to marquis, for male members of the imperial clan, ranking under hoàng đế (皇帝)(emperor), vương (王)(king/prince), quốc công (國公)(grand duke/duke of the nation), quận công (郡公)(provincial duke) and công (公)(duke, rather like a German Fürst), and above bá (伯)(count), tử (子)(viscount) and nam (男)(baron). == In fiction == Marquesses and marchionesses have occasionally appeared in works of fiction. == See also == == Notes == == References == The Chronological Peerage of England, hereditarytitles.com as of 2 March 2003; omits Normanby, misspells Hartington as Martington, places Marquess of Lorn and Kintyre in the peerage of England (Scotland is more probable).

847,"('Chloroprocaine (hydrochloride)', 'Chloroprocain', 'Chlorprocaine', 'Halestyn', 'Piocaine')",Medical,"Chloroprocaine, sold under the brand name Nesacaine among others is a local anesthetic given by injection. It is used as the hydrochloride salt. Chloroprocaine is a local anesthetic. == Medical uses == Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine) is indicated for the production of local anesthesia by infiltration and peripheral nerve block; and for the production of local anesthesia by infiltration, peripheral and central nerve block, including lumbar and caudal epidural blocks. Chloroprocaine (Clorotekal) is indicated for intrathecal injection in adults for the production of subarachnoid block (spinal anesthesia). Chloroprocaine is used for regional anesthesia including spinal anesthesia, caudal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia. It is also indicated for local anesthesia including brachial plexus block, cervical nerve block, occipital nerve block. mandibular nerve block or maxillary nerve block for dental anesthesia, ophthalmic anesthesia via infraorbital nerve block, ulnar nerve block, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block, sciatic nerve block, stellate ganglion block, lumbar sympathetic block and interdigital block. It is also used for obstetric anesthesia including pudendal nerve block and paracervical block. Chloroprocaine (Iheezo) is indicated for ocular surface anesthesia. == Subarachnoid block == Chloroprocaine was developed to meet the need for a short-acting spinal anaesthetic that is reliable and has a favourable safety profile to support the growing need for day-case surgery. Licensed in Europe for surgical procedures up to 40 minutes, chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anaesthetic with the shortest duration of action of all the established local anaesthetics. It has a significantly shorter duration of action than lidocaine and is significantly less toxic. Chloroprocaine has a motor block lasting for 40 minutes, a rapid onset time of 3–5 minutes (9.6 min ± 7.3 min at 40 mg dose; 7.9 min ± 6.0 min at 50 mg dose) and a time to ambulation of 90 minutes without complications, especially lacking transient neurologic symptomatology. These data are based upon a retrospective review of 672 patients suitable for spinal anesthesia in surgical procedures less than 60 minutes' duration using 30–40 mg chloroprocaine. The results showed good surgical anesthesia, a fast onset time, and postoperative mobilization after 90 minutes without complications. The use of chloroprocaine in the subarachnoid space has been questioned. In the early 1980s, several cases were reported of neurological deficits after inadvertent intrathecal injections intended for epidural delivery. These doses were an order of magnitude higher than is currently used for intrathecal delivery. It is also thought that these deficits were also related to the preservative sodium bisulfite, although this is also controversial. Some studies have been published on the safe use of intrathecal chloroprocaine when appropriate dosage is used and with preservative-free preparations. It is approved for intrathecal use in the United States, Europe, and Canada. == Obstetrics == Amide-linked local anesthetic agents, such as lidocaine and bupivacaine, can become ""trapped"" in their ionized forms on the fetal side of the placenta, so their net transfer across the placenta is increased. An ester-linked local anesthetic agent, such as 2-chloroprocaine, is rapidly metabolized, and placental transfer is limited. Since the metabolism of 2-chloroprocaine by fetal plasma is slower than in maternal plasma, the potential for ion trapping exists. Fetal pH is slightly lower than maternal (7.32 to 7.38), thus most unionized drugs are ""ion trapped"" to a degree, even in a healthy fetus. Chloroprocaine (pKa 8.7) is the drug of choice for epidural analgesia and a decompensating fetus, because it does not participate in ion trapping. Placental transfer of 2-chloroprocaine is not influenced by fetal acidosis. The in vitro half-life of chloroprocaine is 21 seconds for maternal and 43 seconds for fetal blood. In patients who are homozygous atypical for plasma cholinesterase, chloroprocaine typically exists for two minutes in circulation. == Synthesis == The hydrochloride salt of 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoyl chloride is made by the reaction of 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid with thionyl chloride. Synthesis of this drug is then accomplished by directly reacting the product of the last step with the hydrochloride salt of 2-diethylaminoethanol. == References ==",Halestyn,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2685914635658264), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018903225660324097)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO ; ([drugs-about.com](https://drugs-about.com/drugs-h/halestyn.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=7, title='Halestyn (Chloroprocaine)', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs-about.com/drugs-h/halestyn.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The most common side effects include nausea and vomiting. Cinacalcet was approved in the United States in March 2004, and in the European Union in October 2004. It was the first allosteric G protein-coupled receptor modulator to enter the pharmaceutical market. In 2013, cinacalcet was the 76th most prescribed medicine in the United States. == Medical uses == In the United States, cinacalcet is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and hypercalcemia in people with parathyroid carcinoma. Cinacalcet can also be used to treat severe hypercalcemia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy. In the European Union cinacalcet is indicated for: the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adults with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy. the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in children aged three years and older with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy in whom secondary HPT is not adequately controlled with standard of care therapy. part of a therapeutic regimen including phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols, as appropriate. the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism in adults. the reduction of hypercalcaemia in adults with: parathyroid carcinoma; primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels (as defined by relevant treatment guidelines), but in whom parathyroidectomy is not clinically appropriate or is contraindicated. === Pregnancy and lactation === Cinacalcet has pregnancy category C in the US, meaning that adequate and well-controlled studies involving cinacalcet in pregnant women have not been done. Studies have not been done in lactating women; therefore, it is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted into human milk. == Contraindications == Hypocalcemia (decreased calcium levels) is a contraindication to the use of cinacalcet. Those who have serum calcium levels less than 7.5 mg/dL should not be started on cinacalcet. Hypocalcemia symptoms include paresthesias, myalgias, muscle cramping, tetany, and convulsions. Cinacalcet should not be administered until serum calcium levels are above 8.0 mg/dL and/or hypocalcemia symptoms are resolved. Cinacalcet is not approved for pediatric use in the United States. == Adverse effects == Common side effects of cinacalcet include upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and chest pain. Clinical trials conducted in the United States by Amgen to determine whether the drug is safe in children were halted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2013, following the death of a 14-year-old participant. == Overdose == Serious side effects, including overdose symptoms, of cinacalcet include: burning tingling unusual feelings of the lips, tongue, fingers, or feet muscle aches or cramps sudden tightening of muscles in hands, feet, face, or throat seizures == Interactions == Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of the liver enzyme CYP2D6 and is partially metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. Dose adjustments may be necessary if people are treated with CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors and medications that are metabolized by CYP2D6. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Cinacalcet is a drug that acts as a calcimimetic (i.e. it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by allosteric activation of the calcium-sensing receptor that is expressed in various human organ tissues. The calcium-sensing receptors on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal negative regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion.

850,"('Neflamapimod', 'Vx 745', 'Neflamapimod (usan)', 'Neflamapimod [usan]', 'Hexadecylacrylate')",Medical," Neflamapimod, a selective inhibitor of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase alpha (MAPKα), is under clinical investigation for its efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Here, we investigated if neflamapimod-mediated acute inhibition of p38 MAPKα could induce vasodilation in resistance-size rat mesenteric arteries. Our pressure myography data demonstrated that neflamapimod produced a dose-dependent vasodilation in mesenteric arteries. Our Western blotting data revealed that acute neflamapimod treatment significantly reduced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPKα and its downstream target heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and smooth muscle contraction. Likewise, non-selective inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 attenuated p38 MAPKα and Hsp27 phosphorylation, and induced vasodilation. Endothelium denudation or pharmacological inhibition of endothelium-derived vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI Neflamapimod, a selective inhibitor of the alpha isoform of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKα), was investigated for its potential to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of endothelial cells (ECs), adhesion molecule induction, and subsequent leukocyte attachment to EC monolayers. These events are known to contribute to vascular inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that LPS treatment of cultured ECs and rats leads to significant upregulation of adhesion molecules, both in vitro and in vivo, which can be effectively inhibited by neflamapimod treatment. Western blotting data further reveals that neflamapimod inhibits LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPKα and the activation of NF-κB signaling in ECs. Additionally, leukocyte adhesion assays demonstrate a substantial reduction in leukocyte attachment to cultured ECs and the aorta lumen of rats treated with neflamapimod. Consistent with vascular inflammation, LPS-treated rat arteries exhibit significantly diminished vasodilation response to acetylcholine, however, arteries from rats treated with neflamapimod maintain their vasodilation capacity, demonstrating its ability to limit LPS-induced vascular inflammation. Overall, our data demonstrate that neflamapimod effectively inhibits endothelium activation, adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte attachment, thereby reducing vascular inflammation. The endosome-associated GTPase Rab5 is a central player in the molecular mechanisms leading to degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN), a long-standing target for drug development. As p38α is a Rab5 activator, we hypothesized that inhibition of this kinase holds potential as an approach to treat diseases associated with BFCN loss. Herein, we report that neflamapimod (oral small molecule p38α inhibitor) reduces Rab5 activity, reverses endosomal pathology, and restores the numbers and morphology of BFCNs in a mouse model that develops BFCN degeneration. We also report on the results of an exploratory (hypothesis-generating) phase 2a randomized double-blind 16-week placebo-controlled clinical trial (Clinical trial registration: NCT04001517/EudraCT #2019-001566-15) of neflamapimod in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease in which BFCN degeneration is an important driver of disease expression. A total of 91 participants, all receiving background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, were randomized 1:1 between neflamapimod 40 mg or matching placebo capsules (taken orally twice-daily if weight <80 kg or thrice-daily if weight >80 kg). Neflamapimod does not show an effect in the clinical study on the primary endpoint, a cognitive-test battery. On two secondary endpoints, a measure of functional mobility and a dementia rating-scale, improvements were seen that are consistent with an effect on BFCN function. Neflamapimod treatment is well-tolerated with no study drug associated treatment discontinuations.

851,"('Ceritinib', 'Ceritinib (ldk378)', 'Ceritinib(ldk378)', 'Ceritinib [usan:inn]', 'Ceritinibum')",Medical,"Ceritinib (INN, trade name Zykadia zy-KAY-dee-ə) is a prescription-only drug used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was developed by Novartis and received FDA approval for use in April 2014. == Medical uses == Ceritinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of ALK positive metastatic NSCLC. Previously, it was only indicated for patients who had developed resistant to crizotinib, another ALK inhibitor, but has since had its usage expanded to serve as a primary option for metastatic NSCLC. == Adverse effects == Serious adverse effects include gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, prolonged QT syndrome, hyperglycemia, bradycardia, and pancreatitis. The most commonly reported side effects were diarrhea, nausea, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, decreased appetite, and constipation. == Interactions == Ceritinib is both a substrate and potent inhibitor of the enzyme CYP3A4, so medications that have affinity for this enzyme may interact with ceritinib. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ceritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively and potently inhibits anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In normal physiology, ALK functions as a key step in the development and function of nervous system tissue. However, chromosomal translocation and fusion give rise to an oncogenic form of ALK that has been implicated in progression of NSCLC. Ceritinib thus acts to inhibit this mutated enzyme and stop cell proliferation, ultimately halting cancer progression. Because ceritinib is considered a targeted cancer therapy, an FDA-approved test is required to determine which patients are candidates for ceritinib. This test, developed by Roche, is the VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay and is used to identify ALK-positive NSCLC patients who would benefit from ceritinib treatment. == Research and development == Researchers first identified the ALK fusion gene in 1994. Several years later, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, began working towards development of targeted ALK inhibitors. In April 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval for ceritinib when used for ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer, Inc.). This rapid approval was determined from a multi-center clinical trial in which 163 patients who had disease progression or were intolerant to crizotinib received oral ceritinib 750 mg once daily. This trial demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 44% and a median duration of response (DOR) of 7.1 months, both of which were favorable compared to the worsening or failed use of crizotinib. In February 2017, the FDA accepted a supplement New Drug Application for ceritinib and granted Priority Review for expanded use of ceritinib. Specifically, it became a first-line therapy option for metastatic NSCLC with ALK-positive tumors. Additionally, the FDA also gave Breakthrough Therapy designation to the drug for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC that has metastasized to the brain. This new designation resulted from the ASCEND-4 clinical trial, which was a randomized, phase III study that compared the use of ceritinib to standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy treatments. Median progression-free survival was 16.6 months for ceritinib (n=189) versus 8.1 months in the chemotherapy-treated patients (n=187). == Society and culture == === Economics === Zykadia is manufactured by Novartis. Created in 1996 from a merger between Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, Novartis is a global corporation based out of Basel, Switzerland. Over 155 countries worldwide have Novartis products available for use. Financial data from 2016 reveals net sales of $48.5 billion for the Swiss company. Novartis divides its shares into two major market exchanges: the ordinary shares (NOVN SW) trade in the Six Swiss Exchange while the American Depositary Receipts (NVS US) trade in the New York Stock Exchange. Nominees, fiduciaries, and ADR depositary make up the bulk of registered shareholders of Novartis stock while individual shareholders make up the lowest percentage. Originally launched in 2014, Zykadia sales for Fiscal Year 2016 reached $91 million. While this is substantially less than several of their other pharmaceuticals, the new indication introduced in 2017 should result in increased sales of the drug. GlobalData predicts ceritinib sales to exceed $127million by 2025, while sustaining a compounded annual growth rate of 10.7%. === Intellectual property === Novartis currently owns twelve patents on Zykadia. The patents relate to different structures of the chemical compound as well as methodologies for manufacturing the drug. For example, one patent examines the structure of pyrimidines and their use in treatment of neoplastic diseases. Others examine the composition of protein kinase inhibitors. The most recent patents are specific the methodologies of using ALK inhibitors. === Brand names === Ceritinib is also sold under the brand name Spexib in some countries by Novartis. == References == == External links == Media related to Ceritinib at Wikimedia Commons",Ceritinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.169585604860913e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002768848498817533)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ceritinib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='Ceritinib - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ceritinib?utm_source=openai')])"
852,"('Naphthoquine (phospate)', 'Naphthoquine', 'Naphthoquine (phosphate)', 'Naphthoquine-phosphate')",Medical," The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treating people with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Five combinations are currently recommended, all administered over three days. Artemisinin-naphthoquine is a new combination developed in China, which is being marketed as a one-day treatment. Although shorter treatment courses may improve adherence, the WHO recommends at least three days of the short-acting artemisinin component to eliminate 90% P. falciparum parasites in the bloodstream, before leaving the longer-acting partner drug to clear the remaining parasites. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the artemisinin-naphthoquine combination for treating adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; and LILACS up to January 2015. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) using 'malaria' and 'arte* OR dihydroarte*' as search terms. Randomized controlled trials comparing artemisinin-naphthoquine combinations with established WHO-recommended ACTs for the treatment of adults and children with uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum. Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed primary outcomes in line with the WHO 'Protocol for assessing and monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy' and compared drugs using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary outcomes were effects on gametocytes, haemoglobin, and adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Four trials, enrolling 740 adults and children, met the inclusion criteria. Artemisinin-naphthoquine was administered as a single dose (two trials), as two doses given eight hours apart (one trial), and once daily for three days (one trial), and compared to three-day regimens of established ACTs. Three additional small pharmaceutical company trials have been carried out. We have requested the data but have not received a response from the company. Artemisinin-naphthoquine versus artemether-lumefantrineIn three small trials from Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, and Papua New Guinea, both combinations had a very low incidence of treatment failure at Day 28, and there were no differences demonstrated in PCR-unadjusted, or PCR-adjusted treatment failure (three trials, 487 participants, low quality evidence). Only the single study from Papua New Guinea followed participants up to Day 42, and the number of treatment failures remained very low with both combinations (one trial, 186 participants, very low quality evidence). Artemisinin-naphthoquine versus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquineIn a single small trial from Indonesia, treatment failure at Day 28 and Day 42 was very low in both groups with no differences demonstrated (one trial, 144 participants, very low quality evidence). The results of these few trials of artemisinin-naphthoquine are promising, but further trials from multiple settings are required to reliably demonstrate the relative efficacy and safety compared to established ACTs. Future trials should be adequately powered to demonstrate non-inferiority, and regimens incorporating three days of the artemisinin component are probably preferable to the one-day regimens. Naphthoquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drug first synthesised in China in 1986 but which was not developed for clinical use until the late 1990s. Early in vitro parasite sensitivity and in vivo efficacy data, together with a long terminal elimination half-life (up to 23 days), suggested that it could be used as monotherapy for uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria, but is now marketed as a single-dose, fixed co-formulation with artemisinin in a milligram per kilogram ratio of 1:2.5. This form of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) has also shown high cure rates, especially in two randomised trials in which, consistent with World Health Organization recommendations for all ACTs, it was administered daily for 3 days rather than as single dose for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections (28-day adequate clinical and parasitological response ≥98.4 %). Although detailed safety monitoring has been performed in a minority of subjects, >4000 healthy volunteers and patients with malaria have been exposed to naphthoquine without any documented significant toxicity. As with other 4-aminoquinolines, naphthoquine is associated with prolongation of the electrocardiographic QT interval but not with cardiac or neurological events. It has been administered to children as young as 4 months of age but, due to a lack of pharmacokinetic, efficacy and toxicity data in young infants and in pregnant/lactating women, it should not be used in these vulnerable patient groups.With the emergence of parasite resistance to other ACTs, naphthoquine partnered with a potent artemisinin derivative may prove a viable alternative treatment for uncomplicated malaria. COVID-19 has spread around the world and caused serious public health and social problems. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, new effective antiviral drugs are still needed. Some repurposed drugs including Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir were immediately used to treat COVID-19 after the pandemic. However, the therapeutic effects of these drugs have not been fully demonstrated in clinical studies.

Phosphodiesterase 4 is involved in cytokine production linked with inflammatory disorders, including atopic dermatitis. To demonstrate the superiority of difamilast ointment 1% to vehicle in adult Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis. In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial, patients aged 15-70 years with an investigator global assessment score of 2 or 3 received topical difamilast ointment 1% (n = 182) or a vehicle (n = 182) twice daily for 4 weeks. The success rate in investigator global assessment score at week 4 (primary endpoint)-the percentage of patients achieving an investigator global assessment score of 0 or 1 with ≥2-grade improvement-was significantly higher with 1% difamilast than with the vehicle (38.46% vs 12.64%, respectively, P < .0001). The success rates in ≥50%, ≥75%, and ≥90% improvement in overall eczema area and severity index score at week 4 followed the same trend. Difamilast at 1% provided significant mean percent improvement from baseline in overall eczema area and severity index score versus vehicle from week 1 to 4. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and less frequent with difamilast. Study treatment was limited to 4 weeks. Difamilast ointment 1% demonstrated superiority to the vehicle and favorable safety in adult Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and still not fully understood. Despite recent therapeutic developments, the current therapeutic arsenal of AD remains limited and is associated with long-term efficacy and safety issues. Therefore, new topical therapies with different mechanisms of action are required to overcome the limitations of existing treatments. Difamilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor currently in phase 3 studies. Difamilast shows antipruritic and anti-inflammatory properties and a rapid onset of action, with significant differences in some parameters from the vehicle within 1 week of treatment. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials have shown that difamilast ointments are effective and well tolerated in adult and pediatric patients with AD, and are expected to be used for long-term AD treatment. In 2021, difamilast was the first phosphodiesterase 4inhibitor to acquire manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) with AD. This article is a narrative review of the current literature on difamilast in the management of AD. Difamilast, a topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, has been shown to be effective for treating atopic dermatitis (AD), but the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. Since skin barrier dysfunction including reduced expression of filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR) contributes to AD development, difamilast treatment may be able to improve this dysfunction. PDE4 inhibition increases transcriptional activity of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Therefore, we hypothesized that difamilast may affect FLG and LOR expression via CREB in human keratinocytes. To elucidate the mechanism by which difamilast regulates FLG and LOR expression via CREB in human keratinocytes. We analyzed normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) treated with difamilast. We observed increases of intracellular cAMP levels and CREB phosphorylation in difamilast (5 μM)-treated NHEKs. Next, we found that difamilast treatment increased mRNA and protein levels of FLG and LOR in NHEKs. Since reduced expression of keratinocyte proline-rich protein (KPRP) is reported to be involved in skin barrier dysfunction in AD, we examined KPRP expression in difamilast-treated NHEKs. We found that difamilast treatment increased mRNA and protein levels of KPRP in NHEKs. Furthermore, KPRP knockdown using siRNA transfection abolished the upregulation of FLG and LOR in difamilast-treated NHEKs. Finally, CREB knockdown canceled the upregulation of FLG, LOR, and KPRP in difamilast-treated NHEKs, indicating that PDE4 inhibition by difamilast treatment positively regulates FLG and LOR expression via the CREB-KPRP axis in NHEKs.

856,"('Sertraline (hydrochloride)', 'Sertraline', '(1s,4s)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-n-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-amine', 'Sertralina', 'Sertralinum')",Medical,"Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Although also having approval for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), findings indicate it leads to only modest improvements in symptoms associated with this condition. The drug shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, mild sedation, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old. It should not be used together with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns. Sertraline was developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and available as a generic medication. In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States. It was also the eleventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 39 million prescriptions in 2022, and sertraline ranks among the top 10 most prescribed medications in Australia between 2017 and 2023. For alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety, the drug is usually second in potency to another SSRI, escitalopram. Sertraline's effectiveness is similar to that of other antidepressants in its class, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are also considered first-line treatments and are better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants. == Medical uses == Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Sertraline is approved for use in children with OCD. === Depression === In meta-analyses, sertraline displays similar efficacy to other SSRI antidepressants, with an odds ratio for response in clinical depression of between 1.44 and 1.67. However, as with other antidepressants, the nature and clinical significance of this effect remain disputed. A major study of sertraline in a broad primary care population found improvements in general mental health, quality of life, and anxiety. However, it failed to find significant effects on depression in either the mildly or severely depressed, and the clinical relevance and accuracy of the positive effects found have been questioned. In several double-blind studies, sertraline was consistently more effective than placebo for dysthymia, a more chronic variety of depression, and comparable to imipramine in that respect. Sertraline also improves the functional impairments of dysthymia to a similar degree whether group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is undergone or not. Limited pediatric data also demonstrates a reduction in depressive symptoms in the pediatric population though remains a second-line therapy after fluoxetine. ==== Comparison with other antidepressants ==== In general, sertraline efficacy is similar to that of other antidepressants. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram are the best in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. Comparative clinical trials demonstrated that sertraline is similar in efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Sertraline may be more efficacious for the treatment of depression in the acute phase (first four weeks) than fluoxetine. There are differences between sertraline and some other antidepressants in their efficacy in the treatment of different subtypes of depression and in their adverse effects. For severe depression, sertraline is as good as clomipramine but is better tolerated. Sertraline appears to work better in melancholic depression than fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mianserin and is similar to the tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. In the treatment of depression accompanied by OCD, sertraline performs significantly better than desipramine on the measures of both OCD and depression. Sertraline is equivalent to imipramine for the treatment of depression with co-morbid panic disorder, but it is better tolerated. Compared with amitriptyline, sertraline offered a greater overall improvement in quality of life of depressed patients. ==== Depression in elderly ==== Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients is superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine. Sertraline has much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurs more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appears to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of antidepressants in older adults found that sertraline, paroxetine and duloxetine were better than placebo. However, in a 2003 trial the effect size was modest, and there was no improvement in quality of life as compared to placebo. With depression in dementia, there is no benefit of sertraline treatment compared to either placebo or mirtazapine. === Obsessive–compulsive disorder === Sertraline is effective for the treatment of OCD in adults, adolescents and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention-to-treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment clomipramine. Continuing sertraline treatment helps prevent relapses of OCD with long-term data supporting its use for up to 24 months. The sertraline dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression. The treatment recommendation is to start treatment with half of the maximal recommended dose for at least two months. After that, the dose can be raised to the maximal recommended in the cases of unsatisfactory response. Cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not more effective than sertraline in adolescents and children; however, a combination of these treatments is effective. === Panic disorder === Sertraline is superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in an improvement in quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as ""improved"" on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who ""improved"" on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with a placebo. Sertraline is equally effective for men and women, and for patients with or without agoraphobia. Previous unsuccessful treatment with benzodiazepines does not diminish its efficacy. However, the response rate was lower for the patients with more severe panic. Starting treatment simultaneously with sertraline and clonazepam, with subsequent gradual discontinuation of clonazepam, may accelerate the response. Double-blind comparative studies found sertraline to have the same effect on panic disorder as paroxetine or imipramine. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, and fluvoxamine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications. === Other anxiety disorders === Sertraline has been successfully used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. All three major domains of the disorder (fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms) respond to sertraline. Maintenance treatment, after the response is achieved, prevents the return of the symptoms. The improvement is greater among the patients with later, adult onset of the disorder. In a comparison trial, sertraline was superior to exposure therapy, but patients treated with the psychological intervention continued to improve during a year-long follow-up, while those treated with sertraline deteriorated after treatment termination. The combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be more effective in children and young people than either treatment alone. Sertraline has not been approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder; however, several guidelines recommend it as a first-line medication referring to good quality controlled clinical trials. === Premenstrual dysphoric disorder === Sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity, and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating, and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14 days before menses is not as effective as continuous treatment. Continuous treatment with sub-therapeutic doses of sertraline (25 mg vs. usual 50–100 mg) is also effective. === Other indications === Sertraline is approved for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends it for patients who prefer drug treatment to a psychological one. Other guidelines also suggest sertraline as a first-line option for pharmacological therapy. When necessary, long-term pharmacotherapy can be beneficial. There are both negative and positive clinical trial results for sertraline, which may be explained by the types of psychological traumas, symptoms, and comorbidities included in the various studies. Positive results were obtained in trials that included predominantly women (75%) with a majority (60%) having physical or sexual assault as the traumatic event. Somewhat contrary to the above suggestions, a meta-analysis of sertraline clinical trials for PTSD found it to be statistically superior to placebo in the reduction of PTSD symptoms but the effect size was small. Another meta-analysis relegated sertraline to the second line, proposing trauma focused psychotherapy as a first-line intervention. The authors noted that Pfizer had declined to submit the results of a negative trial for inclusion in the meta-analysis making the results unreliable. Sertraline, when taken daily, can be useful for the treatment of premature ejaculation. A disadvantage of sertraline is that it requires continuous daily treatment to delay ejaculation significantly. A 2019 systematic review suggested that sertraline may be a good way to control anger, irritability, and hostility in depressed patients and patients with other comorbidities. == Contraindications == Sertraline is contraindicated in individuals taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic pimozide. Sertraline concentrate contains ethanol and is therefore contraindicated with disulfiram. The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment ""must be approached with caution"". Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose. == Side effects == Nausea, ejaculation failure, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, tremor, headache, excessive sweating, fatigue, restless legs syndrome and decreased libido are the common adverse effects associated with sertraline with the greatest difference from placebo. Those that most often result in interruption of the treatment are nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. The incidence of diarrhea is higher with sertraline – especially when prescribed at higher doses – in comparison with other SSRIs. Over more than six months of sertraline therapy for depression, people showed no significant weight increase. A 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD also resulted in no significant weight gain. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the average weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (1%) but higher for citalopram, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group. Over a two-week treatment of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency but did not affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance in a group of people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5 years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20 measures of memory, attention, and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance. Sertraline has a low level of exposure of an infant through the breast milk and is recommended as the preferred option for the antidepressant therapy of breast-feeding mothers. There is 29–42% increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed sertraline during pregnancy, with sertraline use in the first trimester associated with 2.7-fold increase in septal heart defects. Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome. Dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and irritability are common symptoms. It typically occurs within a few days from drug discontinuation and lasts a few weeks. The withdrawal symptoms for sertraline are less severe and frequent than for paroxetine, and more frequent than for fluoxetine. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering-off rate. Sertraline and SSRI antidepressants in general may be associated with bruxism and other movement disorders. Sertraline appears to be associated with microscopic colitis, a rare condition of unknown etiology. === Sexual === Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm. While nefazodone and bupropion do not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties versus 18% before the treatment. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as ""inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men"", occurred in 12% of people on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved. Some people continue experiencing sexual side effects after they stop taking SSRIs. === Suicide === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 100% increase of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 50% increase in the 18–24 age group. Suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance of 37% or 50% depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that ""given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference"". The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low. == Interactions == As with other SSRIs, sertraline may increase the risk of bleeding with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to sertraline's inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Sertraline, in particular, may potentially diminish the efficacy of levothyroxine. Sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased blood levels of CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, as well as the CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent; for example, co-administration with 50 mg of sertraline resulted in 20% greater exposure to desipramine, while 150 mg of sertraline led to a 70% increase. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Bupropion is metabolized by CYP2B6, which is inhibited by sertraline, and this may result in an interaction between sertraline and bupropion. Sertraline had a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of diazepam, tolbutamide, and warfarin, which are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates; the clinical relevance of this effect was unclear. As expected from in vitro data, sertraline did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, alprazolam, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and terfenadine; neither did it affect metabolism of the CYP1A2 substrate clozapine. Sertraline did not affect the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking sertraline with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation. CYP2C19 inhibitor esomeprazole increased sertraline concentrations in blood plasma by approximately 40%. Clinical reports indicate that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). By binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) it inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. It does not significantly affect histamine, acetylcholine, GABA or benzodiazepine receptors. Sertraline also shows relatively high activity as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT) occupying ~20% of DAT receptors at doses 200mg and above, and antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor (but not the σ2 receptor). However, sertraline affinity for its main target (SERT) is much greater than its affinity for σ1 receptor and DAT. Although there could be a role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear. Similarly, the clinical relevance of sertraline's blockade of the dopamine transporter is uncertain. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Following a single oral dose of sertraline, mean peak blood levels of sertraline occur between 4.5 and 8.4 hours. Bioavailability is likely linear and dose-proportional over a dose range of 150 to 200 mg. Concomitant intake of sertraline with food slightly increases sertraline peak levels and total exposure. There is an approximate 2-fold accumulation of sertraline with continuous administration and steady-state levels are reached within one week. ==== Distribution ==== Sertraline is highly plasma protein bound (98.5%) across a concentration range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. Despite the high plasma protein binding, sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline at respective tested concentrations of 300 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL were found not to interfere with the plasma protein binding of warfarin and propranolol, two other highly plasma protein-bound drugs. ==== Metabolism ==== Sertraline is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, as indicated by a small study of radiolabeled sertraline in which less than 5% of plasma radioactivity was unchanged sertraline in two males. The principal metabolic pathway for sertraline is N-demethylation into desmethylsertraline (N-desmethylsertraline) mainly by CYP2B6. Reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation of both sertraline and desmethylsertraline also occur. Desmethylsertraline, while pharmacologically active, is substantially (50-fold) weaker than sertraline as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and its influence on the clinical effects of sertraline is thought to be negligible. Based on in vitro studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms; however, it appears that in the human body CYP2C19 plays the most important role, followed by CYP2B6. In addition to the cytochrome P450 system, sertraline can be oxidatively deaminated in vitro by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied in vivo. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of sertraline is on average 26 hours, with a range of 13 to 45 hours. The elimination half-life of desmethylsertraline is 62 to 104 hours. In a small study of two males, sertraline was excreted to similar degrees in urine and feces (40 to 45% each within 9 days). Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in urine, whereas 12 to 14% of unchanged sertraline was present in feces. === Pharmacogenomics === CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 are thought to be the key cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of sertraline. Relative to CYP2C19 normal (extensive) metabolizers, poor metabolizers have 2.7-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.4-fold higher levels. In contrast, CYP2B6 poor metabolizers have 1.6-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.2-fold higher levels. == History == The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds, including lometraline, based on the structures of the neuroleptics thiothixene and pinoxepin. Further work on these compounds led to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated several potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not ""very goal driven"", and the invention of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even ""did not have a formal project team"". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company. Sertraline was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the United Kingdom the previous year. The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of major depression. During the discussion, Paul Leber, the director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a ""tough decision"", since the treatment effect on outpatients with depression had been ""modest to minimal"". Other experts emphasized that the drug's effect on inpatients had not differed from placebo and criticized the poor design of the clinical trials by Pfizer. For example, 40% of participants dropped out of the trials, significantly decreasing their validity. Until 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD. In 2003, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued guidance that, apart from fluoxetine (Prozac), SSRIs are not suitable for the treatment of depression in patients under 18. However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including sertraline. In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24. == Society and culture == === Generic availability === The US patent for Zoloft expired in 2006, and sertraline is available in generic form and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. === Brand names === In the US, Zoloft is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Interest during COVID-19 pandemic === Sertraline has been the most sought-after antidepressant worldwide before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Google Trends data. The pandemic has led to an increase in searches for antidepressants, with sertraline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine showing the highest search volumes, whereas searches of citalopram decreased during the pandemic. == Other uses == Sertraline may be useful to treat murine Zaire ebolavirus (murine EBOV). The World Health Organization (WHO) considers this a promising area of research. Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds it significantly inhibits phospholipase B in the fungal genus Candida, reducing virulence. Sertraline is also a very effective leishmanicide. Specifically, Palit & Ali 2008 find that sertraline kills almost all promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. Sertraline is strongly antibacterial against some species. It is also known to act as a photosensitizer of bacterial surfaces. In combination with antibacterials its photosensitization effect reverses antibacterial resistance. As such sertraline shows promise for food preservation. Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds this compound acts as a fungicide against Candida parapsilosis. Its anti-Cp effect is indeed due to its serotonergic activity and not its other effects. Sertraline is a promising trypanocide. It acts at several different life stages and against several strains. Sertraline's trypanocidal mechanism of action is by way of interference with bioenergetics. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links ==",Sertraline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.362964682513848e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007186928996816278)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/sertraline-marketed-zoloft-information,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline ', [])"
857,"('Pitavastatin (calcium)', 'Pitavastatin (hemicalcium)', 'Pitavastatin', 'Itavastatin', 'Livalo')",Medical,"Pitavastatin (usually as a calcium salt) is a member of the blood cholesterol lowering medication class of statins. Pitavastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the first step of cholesterol synthesis. It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 2003. It is available in Japan, South Korea and in India. In the US, it received FDA approval in 2009. Kowa Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Kowa Company, is the owner of the American patent to pitavastatin. == Medical uses == Pitavastatin is indicated for hypercholesterolaemia (elevated cholesterol) and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A 2009 study of the 104-week LIVES trial found pitavastatin increased HDL cholesterol, especially in patients with HDL lower than 40 mg/dL, who had a 24.6% rise, in addition to reducing LDL cholesterol 31.3%. HDL improved in patients who switched from other statins and rose over time. In the 70-month CIRCLE observational study, pitavastatin increased HDL more than atorvastatin. It has neutral or possibly beneficial effects on glucose control. As a consequence, pitavastatin is likely to be appropriate for patients with metabolic syndrome plus high LDL, low HDL and diabetes mellitus. == Side effects == Common statin-related side effects (headaches, stomach upset, abnormal liver function tests and muscle cramps) were similar to other statins. Pitavastatin is a lipophilic statin. Reports indicate that this statin may lead to fewer muscle side effects than other statins. One study found that coenzyme Q10 was not reduced as much as with certain other statins (though this is unlikely given the inherent chemistry of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway that all statin drugs inhibit). There is evidence that pitavastatin does not increase insulin resistance in humans, with insulin resistance assessed by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) method. Hyperuricemia or increased levels of serum uric acid have been reported with pitavastatin. == Metabolism and interactions == Statins are metabolised in part by one or more liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, leading to an increased potential for drug interactions and problems with certain foods (such as grapefruit juice). The primary metabolism pathway of pitavastatin is glucuronidation. It is minimally metabolized by the CYP450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C8, but not by CYP3A4 (which is a common source of interactions in other statins). As a result, it is less likely to interact with drugs that are metabolized via CYP3A4, which might be important for elderly patients who need to take multiple medicines. == History == Pitavastatin (previously known as itavastatin, itabavastin, nisvastatin, NK-104, or NKS-104) was discovered in Japan by Nissan Chemical Industries and developed further by Kowa Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo.

Its chemical structure as a lipoglycopeptide is similar to vancomycin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved oritavancin for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. == Medical uses == Oritavancin is considered a long-lasting antibiotic due to its extended half-life (up to 16 d), high protein binding capacity, and ability to penetrate tissues effectively. It binds strongly to plasma proteins (around 85%), resulting in prolonged release into surrounding tissues. Furthermore, oritavancin exhibits excellent tissue penetration and distribution throughout various sites, including skin structures, synovial fluid (found in joints), bone tissue, and macrophages. Less frequent dosing requirements still keep efficacy against gram-positive infections, which is convenient for prolonged treatment courses such as osteoarticular infections and endocarditis, making it an option for outpatient antibiotic therapy in difficult-to-treat populations where adherence may be challenging and those with limited access to healthcare facilities. == In vitro activity == Oritavancin shares certain properties with other members of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics, which includes vancomycin, the current standard of care for serious Gram-positive infections in the United States and Europe. It possesses potent and rapid bactericidal activity in vitro against a broad spectrum of both resistant and susceptible Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, enterococci, and streptococci. Oritavancin has potential use as a therapy for exposure to Bacillus anthracis, the Gram-positive bacterium that causes anthrax, having demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model both before and after exposure to the bacterium. Oritavancin demonstrates in vitro activity against both the planktonic and biofilmstates of staphylococci associated with prosthetic joint infection (PJI), albeit with increased minimum biofilm bactericidal concentration (MBBC) compared to Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values. Moreover oritavancin has demonstrated activity against in vitro to vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in both planktonic and biofilm states. === Mechanism === The 4'-chlorobiphenylmethyl group disrupts the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. It also acts by inhibition of transglycosylation and inhibition of transpeptidation. === Synergism === Several antibiotics have been tested as partner drugs of oritavancin. Among these ""companions"" drugs, fosfomycin displayed (in vitro and in vivo) synergistic activity when administered together with oritavancin against VRE strains (both vanA and vanB), including biofilm-producing isolates. This synergistic action has also been proposed for the prevention of vascular graft infections by impregnating prostheses with a combination of oritavancin and fosfomycin. == Spectrum of Activity == Oritavancin is active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as enterococci, staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridioides difficile , Clostridium perfringens , Peptostreptococcus spp. , and Propionibacterium acnes. Oritavancin's spectrum of activity shows similarities to vancomycin, but with lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). == Clinical trials == In 2003, results were presented from two pivotal phase-III clinical trials testing the efficacy of daily intravenous oritavancin for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The primary endpoints of both studies were met, with oritavancin achieving efficacy with fewer days of therapy than the comparator agents vancomycin followed by cephalexin. Oritavancin showed a statistically significant improved safety profile with a 19% relative reduction in the overall incidence of adverse events versus vancomycin/cephalexin in the second and larger pivotal trial. Osteomyelitis remains a formidable foe in an era of increasing incidence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with limited guidance for treatment optimization. The success observed in many patients suggests multi-dose oritavancin may prove advantageous for chronic osteomyelitis but further research is needed to define the optimal dose and frequency of oritavancin for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. == History == Originally discovered and developed by Eli Lilly, oritavancin was acquired by InterMune in 2001 and then by Targanta Therapeutics in late 2005. In December 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve oritavancin without additional studies, and an EU application was withdrawn. In 2009, The Medicines Company acquired the development rights, completed clinical trials and submitted a new drug application to the FDA in February 2014. On 6 August 2014, the United States FDA approved oritavancin to treat skin infections. A marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union was granted in March 2015, for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in adults. == References ==",Oritavancin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.9457496313843876e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.11782301752828e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a614042.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Oritavancin Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a614042.html?utm_source=openai')])"
859,"('Leflunomide', 'Arava', 'Lefunamide', 'Leflunomida', 'Leflunomidum')",Medical,"Leflunomide, sold under the brand name Arava among others, is an immunosuppressive disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), used in active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. It is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that works by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. == Medical use == Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are the only indications that have received regulatory approval. Arava was developed by Sanofi Aventis and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1998. Clinical studies regarding the following diseases have been conducted: There have been reports on potential re-purposing of leflunomide for treatment of solid tumors with tumor suppressor, PTEN, loss. In PTEN negative tumors, leflunomide causes synthetic lethality potentially due to increased demand on pyrimidines in these faster growing cells. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Pregnancy, women of childbearing potential (unless contraception used) Liver disease, hepatitis B/C seropositive Active serious infections Hypersensitivity == Adverse effects == The dose-limiting side effects are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in approximately descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, rhinitis, synovitis, cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1–1% of those treated with the drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure. == Interactions == Other immunomodulatory treatments should be avoided due to the potential for additive immunosuppressant effects, or in the case of immunostimulants like echinacea or astragalus, reduced therapeutic effects. Likewise live vaccines (like haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and yellow fever vaccines) should be avoided due to the potential for severe infection due to the immunosuppressive nature of the treatment. The concomitant use of methotrexate, in particular, may lead to severe or even fatal liver-damage or hepatotoxicity. Seventy-five percent of all cases of severe liver damage reported until early 2001 were seen under combined drug therapy leflunomide plus methotrexate. However, some studies have shown that the combination of methotrexate and leflunomide in patients with rheumatoid arthritis gave better results than either drug alone. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Leflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug that achieves its effects by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which plays a key role in the de novo synthesis of uridine monophosphate (rUMP), which is required for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Hence, leflunomide inhibits the reproduction of rapidly dividing cells, especially lymphocytes. The inhibition of human DHODH by teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, occurs at levels (approximately 600 nM) that are achieved during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Teriflunomide also inhibits several tyrosine kinases. Teriflunomide prevents the expansion of activated and autoimmune lymphocytes by interfering with their cell cycle progression while nonlymphoid cells are able to use another pathway to make their ribonucleotides by use of salvage pyrimidine pathway, which makes them less dependent on de novo synthesis. Teriflunomide also has antiviral effects against numerous viruses including CMV, HSV1 and the BK virus, which it achieves by inhibiting viral replication by interfering with nucleocapsid tegumentation and hence virion assembly. === Pharmacokinetics === It has an oral bioavailability of 80%, protein binding of >99%, metabolism sites of the GI mucosa and liver, volume of distribution (Vd) of 0.13 L/kg, elimination half-life of 14–18 days and excretion routes of faeces (48%) and urine (43%). === Leflunomide metabolism === Teriflunomide is the main active in vivo metabolite of leflunomide. Upon administration of leflunomide, 70% of the drug administered converts into teriflunomide. The only difference between the molecules is the opening of the isoxazole ring. Upon oral administration of leflunomide in vivo, the isoxazole ring of leflunomide is opened and teriflunomide is formed. ""Regardless of the substance administered (leflunomide or teriflunomide), it is the same molecule (teriflunomide)—the one exerting the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action in view of restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions, and does not present, in clinical use, a new chemical entity to patients."" Because of this, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initially had not considered teriflunomide to be a new active substance. == References == == Further reading ==",Leflunomide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.772143726469949e-05), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007338214782066643)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leflunomide,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10878294/ ', [])"
860,"('Itraconazole', 'Canditral', 'Itrizole', 'Traconal', 'Triasporin')",Medical,"Itraconazole, sometimes abbreviated ITZ, is an antifungal medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. This includes aspergillosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. It may be given by mouth or intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, and headache. Severe side effects may include liver problems, heart failure, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is in the triazole family of medications. It stops fungal growth by affecting the cell membrane or affecting their metabolism. Itraconazole was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Recent research works suggest itraconazole (ITZ) could also be used in the treatment of cancer by inhibiting the hedgehog pathway in a similar way to sonidegib. == Medical uses == Itraconazole has a broader spectrum of activity than fluconazole (but not as broad as voriconazole or posaconazole). In particular, it is active against Aspergillus, which fluconazole is not. It is also licensed for use in blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, histoplasmosis, and onychomycosis. Itraconazole is over 99% protein-bound and has virtually no penetration into cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, it should not be used to treat meningitis or other central nervous system infections. According to the Johns Hopkins Abx Guide, it has ""negligible CSF penetration, however treatment has been successful for cryptococcal and coccidioidal meningitis"". It is also prescribed for systemic infections, such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis, where other antifungal drugs are inappropriate or ineffective. Itraconazole has been explored as an anticancer agent for patients with basal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and prostate cancer, For example, in a phase II study involving men with advanced prostate cancer, high-dose itraconazole (600 mg/day) was associated with significant PSA responses and a delay in tumor progression. Itraconazole also showed activity in a phase II trial in men with non-small cell lung cancer when it was combined with the chemotherapy agent, pemetrexed. A recent review also highlights its use topically and orally in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents for advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas that cannot be treated surgically. === Available forms === Itraconazole is produced as blue 22 mm (0.87 in) capsules with tiny 1.5 mm (0.059 in) blue pellets inside. Each capsule contains 100 mg and is usually taken twice a day at twelve-hour intervals. The Sporanox brand of itraconazole has been developed and marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The three-layer structure of these blue capsules is complex because itraconazole is insoluble and is sensitive to pH. The complicated procedure not only requires a specialized machine to create it, but also the method used has manufacturing problems. Also, the pill is quite large, making it difficult for many patients to swallow. Parts of the processes of creating Sporanox were discovered by the Korean Patent Laid-open No. 10-2001-2590. The tiny blue pellets contained in the capsule are manufactured in Beerse, Belgium. The oral solution is better absorbed. The cyclodextrin contained in the oral solution can cause an osmotic diarrhea, and if this is a problem, then half the dose can be given as oral solution and half as capsule to reduce the amount of cyclodextrin given. ""Sporanox"" itraconazole capsules should always be taken with food, as this improves absorption, however the manufacturers of ""Lozanoc"" assert that it may be taken ""without regard to meals"". Itraconazole oral solution should be taken an hour before food, or two hours after food (and likewise if a combination of capsules and oral solution are used). Itraconazole may be taken with orange juice or cola, as absorption is also improved by acid. Absorption of itraconazole is impaired when taken with an antacid, H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor. == Side effects == Itraconazole is a relatively well-tolerated drug (although not as well tolerated as fluconazole or voriconazole) and the range of adverse effects it produces is similar to the other azole antifungals: elevated alanine aminotransferase levels are found in 4% of people taking itraconazole ""small but real risk"" of developing congestive heart failure liver failure, sometimes fatal The cyclodextrin used to make the syrup preparation can cause diarrhea. Side effects that may indicate a greater problem include: == Interactions == The following drugs should not be taken with itraconazole: == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of itraconazole is the same as the other azole antifungals: it inhibits the fungal-mediated synthesis of ergosterol, via inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase. Because of its ability to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 CC-3, caution should be used when considering interactions with other medications. Itraconazole is pharmacologically distinct from other azole antifungal agents in that it is the only inhibitor in this class that has been shown to inhibit both the hedgehog signaling pathway and angiogenesis. These distinct activities are unrelated to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and the exact molecular targets responsible remain unidentified. Functionally, the antiangiogenic activity of itraconazole has been shown to be linked to inhibition of glycosylation, VEGFR2 phosphorylation, trafficking, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Evidence suggests the structural determinants for inhibition of hedgehog signaling by itraconazole are recognizably different from those associated with antiangiogenic activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Itraconazole, like cyclosporine, quinidine, and clarithromycin, can inhibit P-glycoprotein, causing drug interactions by reducing elimination and increasing absorption of organic cation drugs. With conventional itraconazole preparations serum levels can vary greatly between patients, often resulting in serum concentrations lower than the therapeutic index. It has therefore been conventionally advised that patients take itraconazole after a fatty meal rather than prior to eating. A product (Lozanoc) licensed through the European union decentralised procedure has increased bioavailability, decreased sensitivity to co ingestion of food, and hence decreased variability of serum levels. == Chemistry == The itraconazole molecule has three chiral carbons. The two chiral centers in the dioxolane ring are fixed in relation to one another, and the triazolomethylene and aryloxymethylene dioxolane-ring substituents are always cis to each other. The clinical formulation is a 1:1:1:1 mixture of four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs). == History == Itraconazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. It was designated an orphan drug by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). == References == == External links == Media related to Itraconazole at Wikimedia Commons",Itrizole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000730128725990653), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032177597749978304)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a692049.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Itraconazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a692049.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is active throughout Southern Africa, involved in civil engineering, buildings, roads and mining projects. Concor returned as an independent brand in late 2016. == Company history == === Origin === Engineer Fernando Piccinini, the original founder of Construction Corporation, registered the company in Johannesburg on 28 April 1948. The other four founding members were M. Barnabo, B. Chiozzi, U. Mantelli and V. Cini. The original name Construction Corporation was finally shortened to CONCOR. Eng. Piccinini was originally a chairman of Ferrocemento, an Italian construction giant and the emerging Concor received its technical support initially from there. === Initial projects === The company's first major project was the construction of the Rand Sports Stadium in Johannesburg followed by contracts for the Pretoria and Johannesburg power stations. Another initial project was the Storms River bridge which was designed by Dr. Riccardo Morandi of Rome, this bridge was for many years the highest and longest single span bridge in South Africa. === Structure === By the early 2000s, Concor consisted of the following divisions: Concor Buildings, Concor Civils, Concor Mining, Concor Engineering, 2010: Fabricated the tallest tank in southern hemisphere commissioned for Sasol Secunda at its Benzene Reduction Project, standing at 47.54m.

862,"('Fluphenazine decanoate', 'Modecate', 'Fluphenazine depot', 'Moditen depot', 'Dapotum d')",Medical,"Fluphenazine, sold under the brand name Prolixin among others, is a high-potency typical antipsychotic medication. It is used in the treatment of chronic psychoses such as schizophrenia, and appears to be about equal in effectiveness to low-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine. It is given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or just under the skin. There is also a long acting injectable version that may last for up to four weeks. Fluphenazine decanoate, the depot injection form of fluphenazine, should not be used by people with severe depression. Common side effects include movement problems, sleepiness, depression and increased weight. Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, low white blood cell levels, and the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia it may increase the risk of dying. It may also increase prolactin levels which may result in milk production, enlarged breasts in males, impotence, and the absence of menstrual periods. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic of the phenothiazine class. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but believed to be related to its ability to block dopamine receptors. In up to 40% of those on long term phenothiazines, liver function tests become mildly abnormal. Fluphenazine came into use in 1959. The injectable form is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It was discontinued in Australia in 2017. == Medical use == A 2018 Cochrane review found that fluphenazine was an imperfect treatment and other inexpensive drugs less associated with side effects may be an equally effective choice for people with schizophrenia. Another 2018 Cochrane review found that there was limited evidence that newer atypical antipsychotics were more tolerable than fluphenazine. Intramuscular depot injection forms are available as both the decanoate and enanthate esters. == Side effects == === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Fluphenazine acts primarily by blocking post-synaptic dopaminergic D2 receptors in the basal ganglia, cortical and limbic system. It also blocks α1 adrenergic receptors, muscarinic M1 receptors, and histaminergic H1 receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === == History == Fluphenazine came into use in 1959. == Availability == The injectable form is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

Since the MEK inhibition in several cell signalling transduction cascades within tumours was considered therapeutically beneficial, number of clinical investigations of pimasertib have been reported. Despite being orally bioavailable in cancer patients, pimasertib undergoes faster clearance with a short elimination half-life. In addition, due to occurrence of toxicity, the development of pimasertib appears to be stalled. Case studies are provided on the possible utilization of pimasertib in combination therapies with other approved drugs. Based on the review, it appeared that there was the need to identify the optimal dose and the dosing regimen of pimasertib to provide a balance between safety and efficacy when combined with approved therapies. To analyse ophthalmological adverse events associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition with pimasertib treatment for metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM). In this prospective observational, cohort-based, cross-sectional study, eight patients treated with the MEK inhibitor pimasertib received a complete ophthalmic examination. This included Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study best-corrected visual acuity, visual field testing, colour vision testing, slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometry, indirect ophthalmoscopy, digital colour fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). In selected cases, fluorescein angiography was performed. Serous subretinal fluid (SRF) developed in all patients, within a time frame of 9-27 days after the start of treatment. The fovea was involved in six of eight patients (75%). None of the patients with foveal SRF [excluding a patient who developed a bilateral retinal vein occlusion (RVO)] experienced visual symptoms. Subretinal fluid (SRF) decreased or resolved in all patients, despite continuation of study medication in six of eight patients (75%). Complaints in the CM patient (13%) consisted of experiencing a dark fleck in the inferior part of the visual field of the right eye 1 week after the start of treatment, due to an RVO. Subsequent intravitreal bevacizumab treatment resulted in functional and anatomical improvement. Patients with metastatic CM who are treated with the MEK inhibitor pimasertib are at high risk of development of ocular adverse events including serous retinopathy and possibly RVO, stressing the need of adequate ophthalmological follow-up including OCT during administration of pimasertib, despite the fact that SRF generally does not lead to ophthalmological complaints.

Although they exert a rapid and powerful therapeutic activity, relevant side effects may limit their ocular use: increase of intraocular pressure, cataract formation and reduced resistance to infections. New glucocorticoids displaying the same potency of classical glucocorticoids but with fewer adverse effects are needed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Mapracorat (also known as ZK245186 or BOL-303242-X) is a novel non-steroidal selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist that is in the first phases of clinical evaluation (Phase II Clinical trials) for topical treatment of inflammatory skin and ocular disorders. Mapracorat binds selectively to human glucocorticoid receptor and displays powerful anti-inflammatory effects. In experimental models of ocular diseases, mapracorat reduces clinical symptoms, eosinophil recruitment, chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at ocular level, confirming that it acts preventing both the early and late phase of allergic response. Interestingly, mapracorat induces a lower increase of intraocular pressure in comparison to the classical glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Several clinical trials are ongoing to investigate the efficacy and safety of mapracorat for the treatment of several ocular diseases. Transrepressive mechanisms are thought to account for the majority of mapracorat's antiinflammatory effects; however, the induction of anti-inflammatory proteins likely involved in transactivation events may contribute to mapracorat-mediated anti-inflammatory properties and deserve to be further investigated in suitable in vivo and in vitro models. These observations may influence how novel ""differential"" ligands are discovered, identified and evaluated. Selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists (SEGRAs) are a new class of compounds under clinical evaluation for treatment of ocular inflammation. Widely prescribed therapeutics, such as glucocorticoids, are effective at reducing ocular inflammation, but their long term use predisposes to undesirable side effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate a novel SEGRA, mapracorat (BOL-303242-X), and the differences in mapracorat's mechanism of action compared with traditional steroids (i.e. dexamethasone). Keratocytes from three different humans were cultured and treated with mapracorat or dexamethasone, with and without a strong provoking agent, interleukin (IL)-1β. The effects of mapracorat compared to dexamethasone were determined by measuring protein levels (Western blotting) and DNA binding (ELISA) for two nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) family members, RelA and RelB. Cytokine production (i.e. IL-6, IL-8, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)) was characterized by immunoassay. Our findings reveal mechanistic differences between mapracorat and traditional steroid therapies. Mapracorat showed partial attenuation of the classical NF-κB pathway, consistent with traditional steroids. However, mapracorat uniquely potentiated a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism through rapid upregulation of RelB, an anti-inflammatory member of the NF-κB alternative pathway. Mapracorat potently inhibits ocular inflammation in vitro and is a promising new treatment for ocular inflammatory disease. Mapracorat acts, in part, by a novel mechanism via upregulation of RelB in the NF-κB alternative pathway. Mapracorat, a novel nonsteroidal selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist, has been proposed for the topical treatment of inflammatory disorders as it binds with high affinity and selectivity to the human glucocorticoid receptor and displays a potent anti-inflammatory activity, but seems to be less effective in transactivation of a number of genes, resulting in a lower potential for side effects. Contrary to classical glucocorticoids, mapracorat displays a reduced ability to increase intraocular pressure and in inducing myocilin, a protein linked to intraocular pressure elevation. Allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy and can be divided into an early phase, developing immediately after allergen exposure and driven primarily by mast cell degranulation, and a late phase, developing from 6-10 hours after the antigen challenge, and characterized by conjunctival infiltration of eosinophils and other immune cells as well as by the production of cytokines and chemokines. In this study, mapracorat was administered into the conjunctival sac of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized guinea pigs 2 hours after the induction of allergic conjunctivitis, with the aim of investigating its activity in reducing clinical signs of the late-phase ocular reaction and to determine its mechanism of anti-allergic effects with respect to apoptosis of conjunctival eosinophils and expression of the chemokines C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5), C-C motif ligand 11 (CCL11), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Mapracorat, administered into the conjunctival sac of OVA-sensitized guinea pigs 2 hours after allergen exposure, was effective in reducing clinical signs, eosinophil infiltration, and eosinophil peroxidase activity in the guinea pig conjunctiva; furthermore, it reduced conjunctival mRNA levels and protein expression of both CCL5 and CCL11. Mapracorat was more effective than dexamethasone in increasing, in conjunctival sections of OVA-treated guinea pigs, apoptotic eosinophils. Mapracorat displays anti-allergic properties in controlling the late phase of ocular allergic conjunctivitis and is a promising candidate for the topical treatment of allergic eye disorders.",(s)-mapracorat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004164305282756686), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008625631220638752)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2519291639328003), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapracorat?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Mapracorat', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapracorat?utm_source=openai')])"

P-gp mediates the ATP hydrolysis-dependent efflux of a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents out of cancer cells, thereby reducing the intracellular drug accumulation and decreasing the chemosensitivity of these multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Studies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in P-gp-overexpressing cells have shown that certain TKIs could reverse MDR mediated by P-gp, while some TKIs are transported by P-gp. In the present work, we explored the prospect of repositioning branebrutinib (BMS-986195), a highly selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), to resensitize P-gp-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Our results demonstrated that branebrutinib is capable of reversing P-gp-mediated MDR at sub-toxic concentrations, most likely by directly inhibiting the drug transport function of P-gp. Our findings were supported by the result of branebrutinib stimulating the ATPase activity of P-gp in a concentration-dependent manner and the  Branebrutinib (BMS-986195) is a potent, highly selective, oral, small-molecule, covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). This study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of branebrutinib in healthy participants. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose (SAD; MAD) Phase I study (NCT02705989) enrolled participants into 3 parts: SAD, MAD and JMAD (MAD in first-generation Japanese participants). In each part, participants were randomised 3:1 to receive branebrutinib (SAD: 0.3-30 mg; [J]MAD: 0.3-10 mg) or placebo. Participants in the MAD parts received branebrutinib daily for 14 days and were followed for 14 days postdosing. Safety was assessed by monitoring, laboratory and physical examinations, vital signs, and recording adverse events (AEs). Pharmacodynamics were assessed with a mass spectrometry assay that measured drug-occupied and free BTK. The SAD, MAD and JMAD parts of the study included 40, 32 and 24 participants. Branebrutinib was well tolerated and AEs were mild/moderate, except for 1 serious AE that led to discontinuation. Branebrutinib was rapidly absorbed, with maximum plasma concentration occurring within 1 hour and a half-life of 1.2-1.7 hours, dropping to undetectable levels within 24 hours. BTK occupancy was rapid, with 100% occupancy reached after a single 10-mg dose. BTK occupancy decayed predictably over time (mean half-life in MAD panels: 115-154 hours), such that pharmacodynamic effects were maintained after branebrutinib plasma levels fell below the lower limit of quantification. Rapid and high occupancy of BTK and the lack of notable safety findings support further clinical development of branebrutinib. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a member of the Tec family of kinases and is essential for B cell receptor (BCR) mediated signaling. BTK also plays a critical role in the downstream signaling pathways for the Fcγ receptor in monocytes, the Fcε receptor in granulocytes, and the RANK receptor in osteoclasts. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of BTK is anticipated to provide an effective strategy for the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. This article will outline the evolution of our strategy to identify a covalent, irreversible inhibitor of BTK that has the intrinsic potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties necessary to provide a rapid rate of inactivation systemically following a very low dose.

In regions of the world where sleeping sickness is common, eflornithine is provided for free by the World Health Organization. == Medical uses == === Sleeping sickness === Sleeping sickness, or trypanosomiasis, is treated with pentamidine or suramin (depending on subspecies of parasite) delivered by intramuscular injection in the first phase of the disease, and with melarsoprol and eflornithine intravenous injection in the second phase of the disease. Efornithine is commonly given in combination with nifurtimox, which reduces the treatment time to 7 days of eflornithine infusions plus 10 days of oral nifurtimox tablets. Eflornithine is also effective in combination with other drugs, such as melarsoprol and nifurtimox. A study in 2005 compared the safety of eflornithine alone to melarsoprol and found eflornithine to be more effective and safe in treating second-stage sleeping sickness Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Eflornithine is not effective in the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense due to the parasite's low sensitivity to the drug. Instead, melarsoprol is used to treat Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Another randomized control trial in Uganda compared the efficacy of various combinations of these drugs and found that the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination was the most promising first-line theory regimen. A randomized control trial was conducted in Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda to determine if a 7-day intravenous regimen was as efficient as the standard 14-day regimen for new and relapsing cases. The results showed that the shortened regimen was efficacious in relapse cases, but was inferior to the standard regimen for new cases of the disease. Nifurtimox-eflornithine combination treatment (NECT) is an effective regimen for the treatment of second stage gambiense African trypanosomiasis. ==== Trypanosome resistance ==== After its introduction to the market in the 1980s, eflornithine has replaced melarsoprol as the first line medication against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to its reduced toxicity to the host. Trypanosoma brucei resistant to eflornithine was reported as early as the mid-1980s. The gene TbAAT6, conserved in the genome of Trypanosomes, is believed to be responsible for the transmembrane transporter that brings eflornithine into the cell. The loss of this gene due to specific mutations causes resistance to eflornithine in several trypanosomes. If eflornithine is prescribed to a patient with Human African trypanosomiasis caused by a trypanosome that contains a mutated or ineffective TbAAT6 gene, then the medication will be ineffective against the disease. Resistance to eflornithine has increased the use of melarsoprol despite its toxicity, which has been linked to the deaths of 5% of recipient HAT patients. === Excess facial hair in women === The topical cream is indicated for treatment of facial hirsutism in women. It is the only topical prescription treatment that slows the growth of facial hair. In clinical studies with Vaniqa, 81% percent of women showed clinical improvement after twelve months of treatment. Positive results were seen after eight weeks. However, discontinuation of the cream caused regrowth of hair back to baseline levels within 8 weeks. Vaniqa treatment significantly reduces the psychological burden of facial hirsutism. === Neuroblastoma === In the US, eflornithine is indicated to reduce the risk of relapse in people with high-risk neuroblastoma. == Contraindications == === Topical === Topical use is contraindicated in people hypersensitive to eflornithine or to any of the excipients. Throughout clinical trials, data from a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate that there is no clinical evidence that treatment with Vaniqa adversely affects pregnant women or fetuses. === Oral administration === When taken orally the risk-benefit should be assessed in people with impaired renal function or pre-existing hematologic abnormalities, as well as those with eighth-cranial-nerve impairment. Adequate and well-controlled studies with eflornithine have not been performed regarding pregnancy in humans. Eflornithine should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. However, since African trypanosomiasis has a high mortality rate if left untreated, treatment with eflornithine may justify any potential risk to the fetus. == Side effects == Eflornithine is not genotoxic; no tumour-inducing effects have been observed in carcinogenicity studies, including one photocarcinogenicity study. No teratogenic effects have been detected. === Topical === The topical form of elflornithine is sold under the brand name Vaniqa. The most frequently reported side effect is acne (7–14%). Other side effects commonly (> 1%) reported are skin problems, such as skin reactions from in-growing hair, hair loss, burning, stinging or tingling sensations, dry skin, itching, redness or rash. === Intravenous === The intravenous dosage form of eflornithine is sold under the brand name Ornidyl. Most side effects related to systemic use through injection are transient and reversible by discontinuing the drug or decreasing the dose. Hematologic abnormalities occur frequently, ranging from 10 to 55%. These abnormalities are dose-related and are usually reversible. Thrombocytopenia is thought to be due to a production defect rather than to peripheral destruction. Seizures were seen in approximately 8% of patients, but may be related to the disease state rather than the drug. Reversible hearing loss has occurred in 30–70% of patients receiving long-term therapy (more than 4–8 weeks of therapy or a total dose of >300 grams); high-frequency hearing is lost first, followed by middle- and low-frequency hearing. Because treatment for African trypanosomiasis is short-term, patients are unlikely to experience hearing loss. == Interactions == === Topical === No interaction studies with the topical form have been performed. == Mechanism of action == === Description === Eflornithine is a ""suicide inhibitor,"" irreversibly binding to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and preventing the natural substrate ornithine from accessing the active site (Figure 1). Within the active site of ODC, eflornithine undergoes decarboxylation with the aid of cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). Because of its additional difluoromethyl group in comparison to ornithine, eflornithine is able to bind to a neighboring Cys-360 residue, permanently remaining fixated within the active site. During the reaction, eflornithine's decarboxylation mechanism is analogous to that of ornithine in the active site, where transamination occurs with PLP followed by decarboxylation. During the event of decarboxylation, the fluoride atoms attached to the additional methyl group pull the resulting negative charge from the release of carbon dioxide, causing a fluoride ion to be released. In the natural substrate of ODC, the ring of PLP accepts the electrons that result from the release of CO2. The remaining fluoride atom that resides attached to the additional methyl group creates an electrophilic carbon that is attacked by the nearby thiol group of Cys-360, allowing eflornithine to remain permanently attached to the enzyme following the release of the second fluoride atom and transimination. === Evidence === The reaction mechanism of Trypanosoma brucei's ODC with ornithine was characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy in order to identify unique intermediates that occurred during the reaction. The specific method of multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy utilized monochromatic light and fluorescence to identify five specific intermediates due to changes in absorbance measurements. The steady-state turnover number, kcat, of ODC was calculated to be 0.5 s−1 at 4 °C. From this characterization, the rate-limiting step was determined to be the release of the product putrescine from ODC's reaction with ornithine. In studying the hypothetical reaction mechanism for eflornithine, information collected from radioactive peptide and eflornithine mapping, high pressure liquid chromatography, and gas phase peptide sequencing suggested that Lys-69 and Cys-360 are covalently bound to eflornithine in T. brucei ODC's active site. Utilizing fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the structural conformation of eflornithine following its interaction with ODC was determined to be (S)-((2-(1-pyrroline-methyl) cysteine, a cyclic imine adduct. Presence of this particular product was supported by the possibility to further reduce the end product to (S)-((2-pyrrole) methyl) cysteine in the presence of NaBH4 and oxidize the end product to (S)-((2-pyrrolidine) methyl) cysteine (Figure 2). === Active site === Eflornithine's suicide inhibition of ODC physically blocks the natural substrate ornithine from accessing the active site of the enzyme (Figure 3). There are two distinct active sites formed by the homodimerization of ornithine decarboxylase. The size of the opening to the active site is approximately 13.6 Å. When these openings to the active site are blocked, there are no other ways through which ornithine can enter the active site. During the intermediate stage of eflornithine with PLP, its position near Cys-360 allows an interaction to occur. As the phosphate of PLP is stabilized by Arg 277 and a Gly-rich loop (235-237), the difluoromethyl group of eflornithine is able to interact and remain fixated to both Cys-360 and PLP prior to transimination. As shown in the figure, the pyrroline ring interferes with ornithine's entry (Figure 4). Eflornithine will remain permanently bound in this position to Cys-360. As ODC has two active sites, two eflornithine molecules are required to completely inhibit ODC from ornithine decarboxylation. == History == Eflornithine was initially developed for cancer treatment at Merrell Dow Research Institute in the late 1970s, but was found to be ineffective in treating malignancies. However, it was discovered to be highly effective in reducing hair growth, as well as in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), especially the West African form (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense). === Hirsutism === In the 1980s, Gillette was awarded a patent for the discovery that topical application of eflornithine HCl cream inhibits hair growth. In the 1990s, Gillette conducted dose-ranging studies with eflornithine in hirsute women that demonstrated that the drug slows the rate of facial hair growth. Gillette then filed a patent for the formulation of eflornithine cream. In July 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a New Drug Application for Vaniqa. The following year, the European Commission issued its Marketing Authorisation. === Sleeping sickness treatment === The drug was registered for the treatment of gambiense sleeping sickness on 28 November 1990. However, in 1995 Aventis (now Sanofi-Aventis) stopped producing the drug, whose main market was African countries, because it did not make a profit. In 2001, Aventis and the WHO formed a five-year partnership, during which more than 320,000 vials of pentamidine, over 420,000 vials of melarsoprol, and over 200,000 bottles of eflornithine were produced by Aventis, to be given to the WHO and distributed by the association Médecins sans Frontières (also known as Doctors Without Borders) in countries where sleeping sickness is endemic. According to Médecins sans Frontières, this only happened after ""years of international pressure,"" and coinciding with the period when media attention was generated because of the launch of another eflornithine-based product (Vaniqa, for the prevention of facial-hair in women), while its life-saving formulation (for sleeping sickness) was not being produced. From 2001 (when production was restarted) through 2006, 14 million diagnoses were made. This greatly contributed to stemming the spread of sleeping sickness, and to saving nearly 110,000 lives. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Vaniqa is a cream, which is white to off-white in colour. It is supplied in tubes of 30 g and 60 g in Europe. Vaniqa contains 15% w/w eflornithine hydrochloride monohydrate, corresponding to 11.5% w/w anhydrous eflornithine (EU), respectively 13.9% w/w anhydrous eflornithine hydrochloride (U.S.), in a cream for topical administration. Ornidyl, intended for injection, was supplied in the strength of 200 mg eflornithine hydrochloride per ml. === Market === Vaniqa, granted marketing approval by the US FDA, as well as by the European Commission among others, is currently the only topical prescription treatment that slows the growth of facial hair. Besides being a non-mechanical and non-cosmetic treatment, it is the only non-hormonal and non-systemic prescription option available for women with facial hirsutism. Vaniqa is marketed by Almirall in Europe, SkinMedica in the US, Triton in Canada, Medison in Israel, and Menarini in Australia. Ornidyl, the injectable form of eflornithine hydrochloride, is licensed by Sanofi-Aventis, but is currently discontinued in the US. == Research == === Chemo preventative therapy === It has been noted that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) exhibits high activity in tumor cells, promoting cell growth and division, while absence of ODC activity leads to depletion of putrescine, causing impairment of RNA and DNA synthesis. Typically, drugs that inhibit cell growth are considered candidates for cancer therapy, so eflornithine was naturally believed to have potential utility as an anti-cancer agent. By inhibiting ODC, eflornithine inhibits cell growth and division of both cancerous and noncancerous cells. However, several clinical trials demonstrated minor results. It was found that inhibition of ODC by eflornithine does not kill proliferating cells, making eflornithine ineffective as a chemotherapeutic agent. The inhibition of the formation of polyamines by ODC activity can be ameliorated by dietary and bacterial means because high concentrations are found in cheese, red meat, and some intestinal bacteria, providing reserves if ODC is inhibited. Although the role of polyamines in carcinogenesis is still unclear, polyamine synthesis has been supported to be more of a causative agent rather than an associative effect in cancer. Other studies have suggested that eflornithine can still aid in some chemoprevention by lowering polyamine levels in colorectal mucosa, with additional strong preclinical evidence available for application of eflornithine in colorectal and skin carcinogenesis. This has made eflornithine a supported chemopreventive therapy specifically for colon cancer in combination with other medications. Several additional studies have found that eflornithine in combination with other compounds decreases the carcinogen concentrations of ethylnitrosourea, dimethylhydrazine, azoxymethane, methylnitrosourea, and hydroxybutylnitrosamine in the brain, spinal cord, intestine, mammary gland, and urinary bladder. == Veterinary uses == Eflornithine is effective in mice. Bacchi et al. 1980 found the drug to be curative in T. b. brucei infection of mouse and it is generally without toxicity. Klug et al. 2016 are of the opinion that this demonstrates good promise for oral treatment. However although Jansson et al. 2008 also effectively treated mice with it they found the pharmacokinetics of oral administration in rats very negative. Brun et al. 2010 are of the opinion that Jansson's results have killed the prospects for oral treatment. == References == == External links == Media related to Eflornithine at Wikimedia Commons Clinical trial number NCT02395666 for ""Preventative Trial of Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in High Risk Patients With Neuroblastoma That is in Remission"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02679144 for ""Neuroblastoma Maintenance Therapy Trial (NMTT)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Difluoromethylornithine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20146392285823822), (' PERSONAL', -2.3319124011322856e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013624693383462727), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.061993833631277084)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5872169/?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eflornithine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=199, start_index=24, title='Alpha-Difluoromethylornithine, an Irreversible Inhibitor of Polyamine Biosynthesis, as a Therapeutic Strategy against Hyperproliferative and Infectious Diseases - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5872169/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=199, start_index=24, title='Eflornithine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eflornithine?utm_source=openai')])"

Specifically it is used for the second stage of sleeping sickness caused by T. b. gambiense and may be used with nifurtimox. It is taken intravenously (injection into a vein) or topically. It is an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor. Common side effects when applied as a cream include rash, redness, and burning. Side effects of the injectable form include bone marrow suppression, vomiting, and seizures. It is unclear if it is safe to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

Brun et al. 2010 are of the opinion that Jansson's results have killed the prospects for oral treatment. == References == == External links == Media related to Eflornithine at Wikimedia Commons Clinical trial number NCT02395666 for ""Preventative Trial of Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in High Risk Patients With Neuroblastoma That is in Remission"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02679144 for ""Neuroblastoma Maintenance Therapy Trial (NMTT)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Eflornithine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -1.981667537620524e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011060084216296673), (' PERSONAL', -1.0206720617134124e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6093124941107817e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008621849119663239)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a624008.html,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a604031.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eflornithine ', [])"
870,"('Citarinostat', 'Citarinostat (usan)', 'Citarinostat [usan]', 'Citarinostat(acy-241)', 'Citarinostat (acy-241)')",Medical," Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent an encouraging class of antitumor drugs. HDAC inhibitors induce a series of molecular and biological responses and minimal toxicity to normal cells. Citarinostat (Acy-241) is a second generation, orally administered, HDAC6-selective inhibitor. Momelotinib (CYT387) is an orally administered inhibitor of Janus kinase/signal transducer of transcription-3 (JAK/STAT3) signaling. Momelotinib showed efficacy in patients with myelofibrosis. We hypothesized that both HDAC and JAK/STAT pathways were important in lymphoproliferative disorders, and that inhibiting JAK/STAT3 and HDAC simultaneously might enhance the efficacy of momelotinib and citarinostat without increasing toxicity. Accordingly, we tested the citarinostat + momelotinib combination in lymphoid cell lines. Citarinostat + momelotinib showed strong cytotoxicity; it significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and activated caspases 9 and 3. Caspase-8 was upregulated in only two lymphoid cell lines, which indicated activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. We identified a lymphoid cell line that was only slightly sensitive to the combination treatment. We knocked down thioredoxin expression by transfecting with small interfering RNA that targeted thioredoxin. This knockdown increased cell sensitivity to the combination-induced cell death. The combination treatment reduced Bcl-2 expression, activated caspase 3, and significantly inhibited cell viability and clonogenic survival. Citarinostat (ACY-241) is a promising oral histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)-selective inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the inevitable emergence of resistance to citarinostat may reduce its clinical effectiveness in cancer patients and limit its clinical usefulness in the future. In this study, we investigated the potential role of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, which are two of the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to anticancer drugs, on the efficacy of citarinostat in human cancer cells. We discovered that the overexpression of ABCB1 or ABCG2 significantly reduced the sensitivity of human cancer cells to citarinostat. We demonstrated that the intracellular accumulation of citarinostat and its activity against HDAC6 were substantially reduced by the drug transport function of ABCB1 and ABCG2, which could be restored by treatment with an established inhibitor of ABCB1 or ABCG2, respectively. In conclusion, our results revealed a novel mechanism by which ABCB1 and ABCG2 actively transport citarinostat away from targeting HDAC6 in cancer cells. Our results suggest that the co-administration of citarinostat with a non-toxic modulator of ABCB1 and ABCG2 may optimize its therapeutic application in the clinic. Citarinostat (CC-96241; previously ACY-241), an oral inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs) with selectivity for HDAC6, has demonstrated synergistic anticancer activity with paclitaxel in multiple solid tumor models. Combination therapy using citarinostat with paclitaxel was evaluated in this phase Ib 3 + 3 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors received citarinostat 180, 360, or 480 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m Twenty patients were enrolled and received study treatment; 15 had received prior taxane therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported at any dose; therefore, the MTD was not identified. Citarinostat 360 vs 480 mg was associated with reduced incidence and severity of neutropenia. Three patients experienced a confirmed partial response and 13 achieved stable disease. Pharmacokinetic parameters were linear up to citarinostat 360 mg, the dose at which the highest levels of histone and tubulin acetylation were observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The combination of citarinostat plus paclitaxel showed an acceptable safety profile, with no unexpected or dose-limiting toxicities and potential evidence of antitumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors. Citarinostat 360 mg once daily is considered the recommended phase II dose for use in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m",Citarinostat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.176141662057489e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003186626825481653)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.786120/full?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=132, start_index=9, title='Frontiers | Phase Ib Study of the Histone Deacetylase 6 Inhibitor Citarinostat in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors', type='url_citation', url='https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.786120/full?utm_source=openai')])"

Elevations in hepatic enzymes were detected in a number of in trial patients, which resulted in termination of the drug development programme. Immunohistochemical characterization of liver tissue from an index case of atabecestat-mediated liver injury revealed an infiltration of T-lymphocytes in areas of hepatocellular damage. This coupled with the fact that liver injury had a delayed onset suggests that the adaptive immune system may be involved in the pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize atabecestat(metabolite)-responsive T-cell clones from patients with liver injury. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with atabecestat and its metabolites (diaminothiazine [DIAT], N-acetyl DIAT & epoxide) and cloning was attempted in a number of patients. Atabecestat(metabolite)-responsive clones were analysed in terms of T-cell phenotype, function, pathways of T-cell activation and cross-reactivity with structurally related compounds. CD4 The detection of atabecestat metabolite-responsive T-cell clones activated via a pharmacological interactions pathway in patients with liver injury is indicative of an immune-based mechanism for the observed hepatic enzyme elevations. Atabecestat, a nonselective oral β-secretase inhibitor, was evaluated in the EARLY trial for slowing cognitive decline in participants with preclinical Alzheimer disease. Preliminary analyses suggested dose-related cognitive worsening and neuropsychiatric adverse events (AEs). To report efficacy, safety, and biomarker findings in the EARLY trial, both on and off atabecestat treatment, with focus on potential recovery of effects on cognition and behavior. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 study conducted from November 2015 to December 2018 after being stopped prematurely. The study was conducted at 143 centers across 14 countries. Participants were permitted to be followed off-treatment by the original protocol, collecting safety and efficacy data. From 4464 screened participants, 557 amyloid-positive, cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating of 0; aged 60-85 years) participants (approximately 34% of originally planned 1650) were randomized before the trial sponsor stopped enrollment. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to atabecestat, 5 mg (n = 189), 25 mg (n = 183), or placebo (n = 185). Primary outcome: change from baseline in Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite score. Secondary outcomes: change from baseline in the Cognitive Function Index and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status total scale score. Safety was monitored throughout the study. Of 557 participants, 341 were women (61.2%); mean (SD) age was 70.4 (5.56) years. In May 2018, study medication was stopped early owing to hepatic-related AEs; participants were followed up off-treatment for 6 months. Atabecestat, 25 mg, showed significant cognitive worsening vs placebo for Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite at month 6 (least-square mean difference, -1.09; 95% CI, -1.66 to -0.53; P < .001) and month 12 (least-square mean, -1.62; 95% CI, -2.49 to -0.76; P < .001), and at month 3 for Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (least-square mean, -3.70; 95% CI, -5.76 to -1.63; P < .001). Cognitive Function Index participant report showed nonsignificant worsening at month 12. Systemic and neuropsychiatric-related treatment-emergent AEs were greater in atabecestat groups vs placebo. After stopping treatment, follow-up cognitive testing and AE assessment provided evidence of reversibility of drug-induced cognitive worsening and AEs in atabecestat groups. Atabecestat treatment was associated with dose-related cognitive worsening as early as 3 months and presence of neuropsychiatric treatment-emergent AEs, with evidence of reversibility after 6 months off treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02569398. β-Secretase enzyme (BACE) inhibition has been proposed as a priority treatment mechanism for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but treatment initiation may need to be very early.

873,"('Pyridone 6', 'Merck-5', 'Merck 5', 'Compound # 2', 'Jak inhibitor 1')",Medical," It has been reported that Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-dependent signaling pathways play a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous malignancies and immune reactions, and inhibition of JAK has been implicated in cell growth inhibition. The role which JAK has on osteoclast differentiation and anti-bone resorptive activity is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of a pan-JAK inhibitor, pyridone 6, on osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorption in vitro and ex vivo. Pyridone 6 inhibited osteoclast differentiation in mouse bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cultures stimulated by the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL) and co-cultures of bone marrow cells and osteoblasts. Pyridone 6 suppressed the expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 in BMMs. It also inhibited the bone resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts that was accompanied by disruption of actin rings. Pyridone 6 also suppressed I-kappaB degradation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in mature osteoclasts, suggesting that these are the key molecules that pyridone 6 targets in the inhibition of osteoclast function. These results demonstrate inhibition of JAK may be useful for the treatment of bone-resorptive diseases, such as osteoporosis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the subsequent Janus-activated kinase (JAK)-dependent signaling pathways play a critical role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. Here, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of a novel pan-JAK inhibitor, tetracyclic pyridone 6 (P6), with that of AG490 in a panel of myeloma-derived cell lines. P6 induced growth arrest and subsequent apoptosis of the IL-6-dependent hybridoma and myeloma-derived cell lines (B9 and INA-6) grown either in IL-6-containing medium or in the presence of bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSC) using much lower concentrations of drug and with significantly faster kinetics than AG490. Myeloma-derived cell lines, which either express constitutively activated JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 (U266) or are IL-6 growth stimulated (KMS11), are partially growth inhibited by P6. However, P6 does not inhibit the growth of myeloma-derived cell lines lacking activated JAKs/STATs nor does it inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase activity compared with AG490, which led to activation of ERK and induced robust apoptosis of all the examined cell lines. Finally, P6 inhibited the growth of primary myeloma patient samples grown in the presence of BMSCs. Thus, P6 is a more sensitive and specific inhibitor of JAK-STAT3 activity compared with AG490 and potently inhibited the growth of primary myeloma cells and myeloma-derived cell lines grown on BMSCs. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common pruritic inflammatory disease triggered by a defective skin barrier and immunodysregulation. AD has been considered a typical example of a Th2 response associated with allergic disease. In the early phases of the disease, symptoms include IgE hyperproduction, eosinophil accumulation, and mast cell activation; in the chronic phase, a Th1-dominant immune response is also observed at the sites of AD skin lesions. The role of IL-17-producing Th (Th17) cells in AD has not been established. In the current study, we found that pyridone 6 (P6), a pan-JAK inhibitor, delayed the onset and reduced the magnitude of skin disease in an AD-like skin-disease model of NC/Nga mice. P6 reduced IFN-γ and IL-13, whereas it enhanced IL-17 and IL-22 expression. In vitro, P6 also inhibited both Th1 and Th2 development, whereas it promoted Th17 differentiation from naive T cells when present within a certain range of concentrations. This was probably because P6 strongly inhibited STAT1, STAT5, and STAT6 phosphorylation, whereas STAT3 phosphorylation was less efficiently suppressed by P6 at the same concentration. Furthermore, IL-22 protects keratinocytes from apoptosis induced by IFN-γ, and administration of IL-17 and IL-22 partially ameliorated skin diseases in NC/Nga mice. These results suggested that the JAK inhibitor P6 is therapeutic for AD by modulating the balance of Th2 and Th17.",Pyridone 6,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019288709154352546), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.018585465848445892), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04859834536910057)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.665124773979187), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.061967913061380386), (' INDUSTR', -2.7610454708337784e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/p/small-molecules-peptides/pyridone-6_6577?utm_source=openai), [aacrjournals.org](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/66/19/9714/526330/Pyridone-6-A-Pan-Janus-Activated-Kinase-Inhibitor?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=263, start_index=6, title='Pyridone 6 (6577) by Tocris, Part of Bio-Techne', type='url_citation', url='https://www.bio-techne.com/p/small-molecules-peptides/pyridone-6_6577?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=263, start_index=6, title='Pyridone 6, A Pan-Janus–Activated Kinase Inhibitor, Induces Growth Inhibition of Multiple Myeloma Cells | Cancer Research | American Association for Cancer Research', type='url_citation', url='https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/66/19/9714/526330/Pyridone-6-A-Pan-Janus-Activated-Kinase-Inhibitor?utm_source=openai')])"
874,"('Clotrimazole', 'Lotrimin', 'Canesten', 'Mycelex', 'Clotrimazol')",Medical,"Clotrimazole, sold under the brand name Lotrimin, among others, is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, tinea versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch. It can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream to the skin or in the vagina. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea and itchiness. When applied to the skin, common side effects include redness and a burning sensation. In pregnancy, use on the skin or in the vagina is believed to be safe. There is no evidence of harm when used by mouth during pregnancy but this has been less well studied. When used by mouth, greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the fungal cell membrane. Clotrimazole was discovered in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 273rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == It is commonly available without a prescription in various dosage forms, such as a topical cream, ointment, or vaginal suppository. It is also available as an oral troche or throat lozenge as a prescription only. Topically, clotrimazole is used for vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection) or yeast infections of the skin. For vulvovaginal candidiasis, clotrimazole tablets and creams are inserted into the vagina. An effective treatment option for mixed infectious vaginitis is a combination of clotrimazole and metronidazole. Topical clotrimazole is usually not effective in the treatment of fungal infections of the scalp or nails. When using over-the-counter drug clotrimazole products, use should be discontinued if the condition does not improve after treatment for 2 weeks for jock itch or after 4 weeks for athlete's foot or ringworm. Throat lozenge preparations are used for oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) or prevention of oral thrush in people with neutropenia. Clotrimazole is usually used five times daily for 14 days for oral thrush, twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks for skin infections, and once daily for 3 or 7 days for vaginal infections. Clotrimazole may be compounded with a glucocorticoid, such as betamethasone, in a topical cream for the treatment of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA-approved, clotrimazole–betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicit an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided to improve treatment outcomes, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore clotrimazole monotherapy. Topical clotrimazole cream, when combined with mechanical reduction of the nail, has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of onychomycosis - a fungal infection of the fingernails and toenails. Topical and oral clotrimazole can be used in both adults and children. Additionally, clotrimazole may be used to treat the sickling of cells (related to sickle cell anemia). === Pregnancy === Topical clotrimazole is categorized as pregnancy category B. Small amounts of clotrimazole may be absorbed systemically following topical and vaginal administration. However, topical clotrimazole is still considered safe to use to treat yeast infections in pregnant women and is a safer alternative to other antifungals. == Side effects == Side effects of the oral formulation include itching, nausea, and vomiting. Less than 10% of patients using the oral formulation may have abnormal liver function tests. Side effects include rash, hives, blisters, burning, itching, peeling, redness, swelling, pain, or other signs of skin irritation. For this reason, liver function tests should be monitored periodically when taking oral clotrimazole (troche). When used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection), less than 10% of patients have vulvar or vaginal burning sensation. Less than 1% of patients have the following side effects: burning or itching of the penis of a sexual partner; polyuria; vulvar itching, soreness, edema, or discharge. Clotrimazole creams and suppositories contain oil which may weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. For topical formulations, should be used externally and should be discontinued if irritation or sensitivity develops at the site of administration. == Interactions == There are no known significant drug interactions with topical clotrimazole. However, with oral (troche) clotrimazole, there are multiple interactions as the medication is a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor, primarily CYP3A4. Thus, any medication that is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme will potentially have elevated levels when oral clotrimazole is used. The prescribing physician should be aware of any medication the patient is taking before starting oral clotrimazole. Certain medications should not be taken with oral clotrimazole. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Clotrimazole is an imidazole derivative that works by inhibiting the growth of individual Candida or fungal cells by altering the permeability of the fungal cell wall. The drug impairs the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a critical component of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting the P450 enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase. Clotrimazole may slow fungal growth or result in fungal cell death. == Sales volume == Clotrimazole is available as a generic medication, and in 2016 Canesten brand Clotrimazole was one of the biggest-selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £39.2 million. == References ==",Clotrimazol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.006777428206988e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007202415145002306)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clotrimazole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Clotrimazole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clotrimazole?utm_source=openai')])"

It is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. It is marketed by J&J Innovative Medicine. Paliperidone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia in December 2006, and in the European Union in June 2007. Paliperidone palmitate is a long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone palmitoyl ester. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Paliperidone is available as a generic medication. == Medical use == In the US, paliperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder as monotherapy and as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. In the EU, paliperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents fifteen years of age and older and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults. Paliperidone is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. == Adverse effects == The most frequent side effects include headache, insomnia, sleepiness, parkinsonism (effects similar to Parkinson's disease such as shaking, muscle stiffness and slow movement), dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions), tremor (shaking), dizziness, akathisia (restlessness), agitation, anxiety, depression, increased weight, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia (heartburn), diarrhea, dry mouth, tiredness, toothache, muscle and bone pain, back pain, asthenia (weakness), tachycardia (increased heart rate), high blood pressure, prolonged QT interval (an alteration of the electrical activity of the heart), upper respiratory tract infection (nose and throat infections) and cough. Palperidone can also rarely cause priapism or sexual dysfunction related to hyperprolactinemia. A 2023 study found that paliperidone may worsen verbal learning and memory compared to placebo in the early months of psychosis treatment. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. === Deaths === In April 2014, it was reported that 21 Japanese people who had received shots of the long-acting injectable paliperidone palmitate had died, out of 10,700 individuals prescribed the drug. == Pharmacology == Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of the older antipsychotic risperidone. While its specific mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed paliperidone and risperidone act via similar, if not identical, pathways. Its efficacy is believed to result from central dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism except paliperidone, like its parent compound risperidone, functions as an inverse agonist at 5-HT2A 15. Paliperidone also acts as an antagonist of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors as well as H1 histaminergic receptors. Food is known to increase the absorption of Invega type ER OROS prolonged-release tablets. Food increased exposure of paliperidone by up to 50-60%; however, half-life was not significantly affected. The effect was probably due to a delay in the transit of the ER OROS formulation in the upper part of the GI tract, resulting in increased absorption. Risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone are reduced in efficacy by P-glycoprotein inducers such as St John's wort Values are Ki (nM). The smaller the value, the more strongly the drug binds to the site. == History == Paliperidone (as Invega) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia in 2006. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in 2009. The long-acting injectable form of paliperidone, marketed as Invega Sustenna in the US, and Xeplion in the EU, was approved by the FDA in July 2009. It was initially approved in the European Union in 2007, for schizophrenia, the extended release form and use for schizoaffective disorder were approved in the EU in 2010, and extension to use in adolescents older than 15 years old was approved in 2014. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In May 2015, a formulation of paliperidone palmitate was approved by the FDA under the brand name Invega Trinza. A similar prolonged release suspension was approved in 2016 by the European Medicines Agency originally under the brand name Paliperidone Janssen, later renamed to Trevicta. On September 1, 2021, a newer formulation of paliperidone palmitate, Invega Hafyera, was approved by the US FDA. == References == == External links == ""Paliperidone Injection"".

Asciminib is a protein kinase inhibitor. The most common adverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, nausea, rash, and diarrhea. In the pooled safety population in participants with newly diagnosed and previously treated Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase, the most common adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pain, rash, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities include decreased lymphocyte count, decreased leukocyte count, decreased platelet count, decreased neutrophil count, and decreased calcium corrected. Asciminib was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2021, and in the European Union in August 2022. == Medical uses == Asciminib is indicated for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase, previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors; or Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase with the T315I mutation. In October 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indicated to include people with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. == Adverse effects == Common side effects of Asciminib are symptoms of a cold, muscle pain, joint pain, bone pain, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, rash as well as the patient displaying abnormal blood tests. Serious side effects of the medication include high blood pressure, low blood cell count, problems with the pancreas, and heart issues. Side effects of the medication on the pancreas may be observed via changes in serum lipase and amylase levels. == Pharmacodynamics == Asciminib is described as a ""STAMP inhibitor,"" which means ""specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket."" The wild-type ABL has a myristoylated N-terminus, which binds to an allosteric site, but the ABL fusion protein does not have the myristoylated domain. In the wild-type protein, when myristoylated N-terminus binds to the allosteric site, the kinase has reduced activity. Since the mutant fusion protein does not have the myristoylated N-terminus domain, it is not subject to this form of regulation, and thus the fusion protein is constitutively active. Asciminib binds to the allosteric site, resulting in an inhibition of bcr-abl activity. Unlike other bcr-abl inhibitors, such as imatinib, asciminib does not bind to the ATP-binding site on the active site of the enzyme. Asciminib and active site bcr-abl inhibitors have non-overlapping resistance mutations. The mutations A337V and P223S overcome the inhibitory activity of asciminib, but asciminib is not affected by the notorious T315I mutation that affects most ATP-competitive active site inhibitors, except ponatinib. Asciminib is a substrate of the CYP3A4 enzyme. Asciminib is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and P-glycoprotein. Asciminib reaches steady state in three days. The volume of distribution of asciminib is 151 L. == History == === CABL001X2101 Clinical Study === The efficacy of asciminib in the treatment of participants with Ph+ CML-CP with the T315I mutation was evaluated in a multi-center open-label study CABL001X2101 (NCT02081378). Testing for T315I mutation utilized a qualitative p210 BCR-ABL mutation test using Sanger Sequencing. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved asciminib based on evidence from a clinical trial of 48 participants with chronic myeloid leukemia with a certain type of mutation (T315I mutation). The trial was conducted at 18 sites in ten countries (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Spain, and the United States). Participants received asciminib twice daily until disease worsened or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The benefit of asciminib was evaluated in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia participants with the T315 mutation by measuring the reduction of abnormal cells in participants' blood to a very low level after 96 weeks of treatment. === ASCEMBL Clinical Study === The efficacy of asciminib in the treatment of participants with Ph+ CML in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP), previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors was evaluated in the multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, and open-label study ASCEMBL (NCT 03106779). === ASC4FIRST Clinical Study === The efficacy of asciminib in the treatment of participants with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was evaluated in the multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, and open-label study ASC4FIRST (NCT04971226). A total of 405 participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either asciminib or investigator-selected tyrosine kinase inhibitors (IS-TKIs) (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or bosutinib). The main efficacy outcome measure was major molecular response rate at 48 weeks. The major molecular response rate at 48 weeks was 68% (95% CI: 61, 74) in the asciminib arm and 49% (95% CI: 42, 56) in the IS-TKIs arm (difference 19% [95% CI: 10, 28], p-value <0.001). Within the imatinib stratum, the major molecular response rate was 69% (95% CI: 59, 78) in the asciminib arm and 40% (95% CI: 31, 50) in the IS-TKIs arm (difference 30% [95% CI: 17, 42], p-value <0.001). == Society and culture == === Legal status === In June 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Scemblix, intended for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome‑positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase who have previously been treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The applicant for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Limited. Asciminib was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2022. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for asciminib priority review, fast track, orphan drug, and breakthrough therapy designations. In July 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted priority review designation to asciminib for the treatment of newly diagnosed adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase. The FDA granted accelerated approval to asciminib for adults with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP).

878,"('Metoprine', 'Bw 197u', 'Methodichlorophen', 'Metoprine [usan]', 'Sk 5265')",Medical,"Metoprine (2,4-diamino-5-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine) is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor initially developed for potential applications in cancer treatment. Although it never achieved widespread clinical adoption, its properties have made it an important research tool in oncology, neurobiology, and parasitology. Other synonyms for metoprine include BW-197U, DDMP, Methodichlorophen, NSC-19494, NSC7364, and TCMDC-123931. == History == Metoprine was developed in the 1970s as a lipid-soluble antifolate with improved cellular penetration compared to methotrexate (MTX), which requires carrier-mediated transport. Early studies demonstrated its efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth. However, its clinical use was limited due to its long half-life (~10 days in humans) and significant toxicity, including hematological, neurological, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal side effects. Beyond its anticancer potential, metoprine was later discovered to inhibit histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT), an enzyme involved in histamine degradation. This led to its use as a research tool for studying histamine's role in neurological and immune functions. Additionally, its ability to disrupt folate metabolism made it a candidate for treating parasitic infections. == Structure and reactivity == Metoprine belongs to the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine class and shares structural similarities with other antifolates. Its pyrimidine core, with amino groups at the 2 and 4 positions, is essential for DHFR inhibition. The benzyl group at the 6-position increases lipophilicity, aiding in membrane permeability. The molecule's basicity allows it to engage in hydrogen bonding interactions with DHFR, contributing to its biological activity. == Available forms == Metoprine is not a commercially available drug but is used in research settings. It is typically supplied as a powder for laboratory studies, with some solvent-based formulations also available for experimental applications. == Mechanism of action == Metoprine acts as a competitive inhibitor of DHFR by mimicking dihydrofolate (DHF) and thereby occupying the enzyme's active site. This prevents the conversion of DHF to tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is an essential cofactor for purine, thymidylate, and amino acid synthesis. Consequently, metoprine disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis, impairing cell proliferation. This mechanism underlies its potential use in chemotherapy. In addition to DHFR inhibition, metoprine blocks HNMT, leading to increased histamine levels in the brain. This enhances histaminergic neurotransmission, which has been implicated in cognitive function, wakefulness, and behavioral modulation. Metoprine is a potent HNMT inhibitor, with a Ki value of 100 nM. Studies in rodents have demonstrated that metoprine increases locomotor activity and induces transient stereotyped behaviors. == Biotransformation == While the pharmacodynamics of metoprine have been extensively studied, details on its metabolic pathways remain limited. Biotransformation and primary metabolites are not well-documented. Metoprine interacts with several genes, including HNMT, androgen receptor (AR), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1 (COX4I1), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and tumor protein p53 (TP53). === Absorption and distribution === Metoprine is well-absorbed and widely distributed across various tissues. Highest tissue-to-plasma ratios are obtained in the brain, lung, pancreas, and skin, attributed to its lipophilicity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. A 1981 study suggested complex pharmacokinetics, including non-linear elimination patterns and prolonged retention in tissues. Only 5-17% of an administered dose is excreted in the urine within a 120-hour period, indicating extensive metabolism or tissue accumulation. The exact elimination pathways—whether renal, biliary, or other routes—are not well-documented. == Indications == Metoprine has been explored for multiple therapeutic applications, including: Cancer treatment: As a DHFR inhibitor, metoprine showed promise in early trials for conditions such as central nervous system leukemia, malignant melanoma, and epidermoid carcinoma. However, its development was halted due to CNS and hematological toxicity. Neurological research: Due to its ability to elevate brain histamine levels, metoprine has been investigated for its effects on cognition and wakefulness. In narcoleptic mouse models, it prolonged wakefulness and suppressed cataplexy, suggesting potential in sleep disorder therapy. == Efficacy and side effects == Metoprine has been investigated for its antitumor effects in various cancers. Clinical trials assessed metoprine's efficacy in cancer treatment, with phase I studies administering doses between 20-65 mg/m² without leucovorin and 100-300 mg/m² with leucovorin rescue. Responses were observed in mycosis fungoides, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. However, no objective tumor regression was noted in colorectal carcinoma patients. Metoprine has also been linked to memory enhancement by inhibiting histamine breakdown. In a 2000 study, treatment with metoprine reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice via histaminergic mechanisms activating histamine H1 receptors. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. == Toxicity == Metoprine's clinical development was discontinued primarily due to CNS and hematological toxicity. In phase I trials, CNS toxicity manifested as seizures, drowsiness, and dizziness, which were significant at high doses (300 mg/m²). Hematologic toxicity, including thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, was dose-limiting at 65 mg/m² without leucovorin. In a phase II colorectal carcinoma trial, CNS toxicity occurred in 54% of patients, further discouraging continued development. == Effects in animals == Metoprine exhibits species-specific toxicity profiles. In rats, the intraperitoneal LD₅₀ is 7 mg/kg, whereas in mice, the subcutaneous LD₅₀ is 50 mg/kg. Behavioral studies in mice indicate that metoprine alters histaminergic and dopaminergic signaling, affecting locomotor activity and neurotransmitter turnover. It also modulates methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, suggesting potential interactions with stimulant drugs. == References ==",Methodichlorophen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.3308127820491791), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.02976345270872116), (' INDUSTR', -0.0007537625497207046), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.1347486972808838), ('ICAL', -8.22540732769994e-06), (',', -0.25197869539260864), ('ĠINDU', -0.05157380923628807), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032245328184217215)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0004306692280806601)])","('INFO; ([chemblink.com](https://www.chemblink.com/products/7761-45-7.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=6, title=""CAS # 7761-45-7, Methodichlorophen, Metoprine, 2,4-Diamino-5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine, 2,4-Diamino-5-(3',4'-dichlorophenyl)-6-methylpyrimidine - chemBlink"", type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemblink.com/products/7761-45-7.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

880,"('Dexamethasone phosphate disodium', 'Dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt', 'Dexamethasone phosphate', 'Dexamethasone 21-phosphate', 'Neodecadron')",Medical,"Dexamethasone is a fluorinated glucocorticoid medication used to treat rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, superior vena cava syndrome (a complication of some forms of cancer), and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it may be used in combination with a mineralocorticoid medication such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby. It may be given by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, as an injection into a vein, as a topical cream or ointment for the skin or as a topical ophthalmic solution to the eye. The effects of dexamethasone are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days. The long-term use of dexamethasone may result in thrush, bone loss, cataracts, easy bruising, or muscle weakness. It is in pregnancy category C in the United States, meaning that it should only be used when the benefits are predicted to be greater than the risks. In Australia, the oral use is category A, meaning it has been frequently used in pregnancy and not been found to cause problems to the baby. It should not be taken when breastfeeding. Dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. Dexamethasone was first synthesized in 1957 by Philip Showalter Hench and was approved for medical use in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 234th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, the combination of dexamethasone with neomycin and polymyxin B was the 274th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Anti-inflammatory === Dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40 mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids. It is also given in small amounts before and/or after some forms of dental surgery, such as the extraction of the wisdom teeth, an operation that often causes puffy, swollen cheeks. Dexamethasone is commonly given as a treatment for croup in children. A single dose can reduce the swelling of the airway to improve breathing and reduce discomfort. Dexamethasone is sometimes injected into the heel when treating plantar fasciitis or heel pain, sometimes in conjunction with triamcinolone acetonide. There is no evidence that this treatment helps in the long term, however, dexamethasone may provide short-term pain relief. It may be useful to counteract allergic anaphylactic shock, however this is not usually recommended by clinical guidelines. It is present in certain eye drops – particularly after eye surgery – and as a nasal spray, and certain ear drops (can be combined with an antibiotic and an antifungal). Dexamethasone intravitreal steroid implants have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ocular conditions such as diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. However, the evidence is poor quality relating to the treatment of uveitis, with the potential side effects (cataract progression and raised intraocular pressure) being significant, and the benefits not certainly greater than standard treatment. Dexamethasone has also been used with antibiotics to treat acute endophthalmitis. Dexamethasone is used in transvenous screw-in cardiac pacing leads to minimize the inflammatory response of the myocardium. The steroid is released into the myocardium as soon as the screw is extended and can play a significant role in minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. The typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0 mg. Dexamethasone may be administered before antibiotics in cases of bacterial meningitis. Gram-negative bacteria — to which the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, neisseria meningitidis, belongs — have highly immunogenic lipopolysaccharides as a component of their cell membrane and trigger a strong inflammatory response. Pre-administration of dexamethasone before the administration of antibiotics acts to reduce that response, thus reducing hearing loss and neurological damage. === Cancer === People with cancer undergoing chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain side effects of their antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, but it has been theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned. In brain tumors (primary or metastatic), dexamethasone is used to counteract the development of edema, which could eventually compress other brain structures. It is also given in cord compression, where a tumor is compressing the spinal cord. Evidence on the safety and efficacy of using dexamethasone to treat malignant brain tumors is not clear. Dexamethasone is also used as a direct chemotherapeutic agent in certain hematological malignancies, especially in the treatment of multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone. === COVID-19 === Dexamethasone is recommended by the National Health Service in the UK and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US for people with COVID-19 who need either mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (without ventilation). The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests the use of glucocorticoids for people with severe COVID-19, defined as people with SpO2 ≤94% on room air, and those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The IDSA recommends against the use of glucocorticoids for those with COVID-19 without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with COVID-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence). The Oxford University RECOVERY Trial issued a press release announcing preliminary results that the drug could reduce deaths by about a third in participants on ventilators and by about a fifth in participants on oxygen; it did not benefit people who did not require respiratory support. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 participants, each treated with one of three different corticosteroids found a statistically significant reduction in death. The largest reduction was obtained with dexamethasone (36% compared to placebo). In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents, from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), who require supplemental oxygen therapy. Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein. In November 2020, the Public Health Agency of Canada's Clinical Pharmacology Task Group recommended dexamethasone for hospitalized patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Although dexamethasone, and other glucocorticoids, reduce mortality in COVID-19 they have also been associated with an increased risk of secondary infections, secondary infections being a significant issue in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The mechanism of action of dexamethasone involves suppression of late-stage interferon type I programs in severe COVID-19 patients. === Surgery === Dexamethasone is used fairly regularly, often as a single intravenous dose, during surgery to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, manage pain, potentially reduce the amount of pain medication required, and help reduce post-surgery hospitalisation time. The adverse effects of taking steroids after surgery on wound healing, blood sugar levels, and in diabetics are not completely understood; however, dexamethasone likely does not increase the risk of postoperative infections. === Endocrine === Dexamethasone is the treatment for the very rare disorder of glucocorticoid resistance. In adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease, dexamethasone is prescribed when the patient does not respond well to prednisone or methylprednisolone. It can be used in congenital adrenal hyperplasia in older adolescents and adults to suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production. It is typically given at night. === Pregnancy === Dexamethasone may be given to women at risk of delivering prematurely to promote maturation of the fetus's lungs. This administration, given from one day to one week before delivery, has been associated with low birth weight, although not with increased rates of neonatal death. Dexamethasone has also been used during pregnancy as an off-label prenatal treatment for the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in female babies. CAH causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably ambiguous genitalia. Early prenatal CAH treatment has been shown to reduce some CAH symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. This use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the fetuses of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented. Experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for fetal CAH treatment was discontinued in Sweden when one in five cases had adverse events. A small clinical trial found long-term effects on verbal working memory among the small group of children treated prenatally, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive. === High-altitude illnesses === Dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). It is commonly carried on mountain-climbing expeditions to help climbers deal with complications of altitude sickness. === Nausea and vomiting === Intravenous dexamethasone is effective for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in people who had surgery and whose post-operative pain was treated with long-acting spinal or epidural spinal opioids. The combination of dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist such as ondansetron is more effective than a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alone in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. === Sore throat === A single dose of dexamethasone or another steroid speeds the improvement of a sore throat. == Contraindications == Contraindications of dexamethasone include, but are not limited to: Uncontrolled infections Known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone Cerebral malaria Systemic fungal infection Concurrent treatment with live virus vaccines (including smallpox vaccine) == Adverse effects == The exact incidence of the adverse effects of dexamethasone is not available, hence estimates have been made as to the incidence of the adverse effects below based on the adverse effects of related corticosteroids and on available documentation on dexamethasone. === Common === === Unknown frequency === === Withdrawal === Sudden withdrawal after long-term treatment with corticosteroids can lead to == Interactions == Known drug interactions include: Inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampicin can reduce the half-life of dexamethasone. Cotreatment with oral contraceptives can increase its volume of distribution. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone is an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It is highly selective for the GR over the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and in relation to this, has minimal mineralocorticoid activity. This is in contrast to endogenous corticosteroids like cortisol, which bind to and activate both the GR and the MR. Dexamethasone is 25 times more potent than hydrocortisone (cortisol) as a glucocorticoid. Its affinity (Ki) for the GR was about 1.2 nM in one study. The activation of the GR by dexamethasone results in dose-dependent suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and of production of endogenous corticosteroids by the adrenal glands, thereby reducing circulating endogenous concentrations of corticosteroids like cortisol and corticosterone. Dexamethasone poorly penetrates the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system due to binding to P-glycoprotein. However, higher doses of dexamethasone override the export capacity of P-glycoprotein and enter the brain to produce central activation of GRs. In conjunction with the suppression of endogenous corticosteroids by dexamethasone, this results in skewed ratios of activation of peripheral versus central GRs as well as skewed ratios of activation of GRs versus MRs when compared to non-synthetic corticosteroids. These differences can have significant clinical relevance. == Chemistry == Dexamethasone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. The molecular and crystal structure of dexamethasone has been determined by X-ray crystallography. It is a stereoisomer of betamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature). === Synthesis === To synthesize dexamethasone, 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is dehydrated to the 9,11-dehydro derivative. This is then reacted with a source of hypobromite, such as basic N-bromosuccinimide, to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. A ring-opening reaction with hydrogen fluoride in tetrahydrofuran gives dexamethasone. === Spectroscopy === In chemistry, spectroscopy is used to analyze products of reactions. To understand if dexamethasone is synthesized from a reaction, spectroscopy must be taken and compared to the literature spectrum. There are multiple spectroscopy analyses that can be taken including 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, Mass spectrometry, and UV/vis spectroscopy. Using IR spectroscopy, the peaks show the functional groups found in the molecule. You can see peaks at 3472, 1662, and 1618 representing alcohol, aldehyde, and alkene functional groups. UV-vis spectroscopy is another way to analyze a product to figure out what it is. Finally, mass spectroscopy showed peaks at: 393.1, 355.2 147.1 m/z. The peak at 393.1 m/z is the peak for dexamethasone as its molecular weight is 392.46 m/z. == History == Dexamethasone was first synthesized by Philip Showalter Hench in 1957. It was introduced for medical use in 1958. On 16 June 2020, the RECOVERY Trial announced preliminary results stating that dexamethasone improves survival rates of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. Benefits were only observed in patients requiring respiratory support; those who did not require breathing support saw a worse survival rate than the control group, although the difference may have been due to chance. A preprint containing the full dataset was published on 22 June 2020, and demand for dexamethasone surged after the publication of the preprint. The preliminary report was published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 18 July 2020. The final report was published in February 2021. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that dexamethasone should be reserved for seriously ill and critical patients receiving COVID-19 treatment in a hospital setting, and the WHO Director-General stated that ""WHO emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. There is no evidence this drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventative measure, and it could cause harm."" In July 2020, the WHO stated they were in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids. In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19. In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started reviewing results from the RECOVERY study arm that involved the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital to provide an opinion on the results and in particular the potential use of dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with COVID-19. In September 2020, the EMA received an application for marketing authorization of dexamethasone for COVID-19. == Society and culture == === Price === Dexamethasone is inexpensive. In the United States a month of medication is typically priced less than US$25. In India, a course of treatment for preterm labor is about US$0.50. The drug is available in most areas of the world. === Nonmedical use === Dexamethasone is given in legal Bangladesh brothels to prostitutes not yet of legal age, causing weight gain aimed at making them appear older and healthier to customers and police. Dexamethasone and most glucocorticoids are banned by sporting bodies including the World Anti-Doping Agency. == Veterinary use == Combined with marbofloxacin CAS number 115550-35-1and clotrimazole, dexamethasone is available under the name Aurizon, CAS number 50-02-2, and used to treat difficult ear infections, especially in dogs. It can also be combined with trichlormethiazide to treat horses with swelling of distal limbs and general bruising. Dexamethasone is also used for emergency patients with hypoadrenocorticism as the drug does not interfere with adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. == References == == External links == ""Dexamethasone Ophthalmic"".

With advancements in molecular diagnostics and the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the overall survival (OS) of AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations has been prolonged to some extent, but relapse and drug resistance are still substantial challenges. Ningetinib is a novel TKI against various kinases in relation to tumour pathogenesis and is undergoing clinical trials of lung cancer. In this study, we explored the antitumor activity of ningetinib against AML with FLT3 mutations both in vivo and in vitro. Cell proliferation assays were performed in AML cell lines and Ba/F3 cells expressing various FLT3 mutations to validate the antileukemic activity of ningetinib in vitro. Immunoblot assays were used to verify the effect of ningetinib on the FLT3 protein and downstream pathways. Molecular docking and CETSA were used to validate the interaction of ningetinib with target proteins. The survival benefit of ningetinib in vivo was assessed in Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD-, MOLM13, Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD-F691L-, MOLM13-FLT3-ITD-F691L-induced leukemia mouse models. We also used patient-derived primary cells to determine the efficacy of ningetinib. Ningetinib inhibited cell proliferation, blocked the cell cycle, induced apoptosis and bound FLT3 to inhibit its downstream signaling pathways, including the STAT5, AKT and ERK pathways, in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines. In the mouse models with FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD-F691L mutation, ningetinib showed superior anti-leukemia activity to existing clinical drugs gilteritinib and quizartinib, significantly prolongating the survival of mice. In addition, ningetinib exhibited activity against patient-derived primary cells harboring FLT3-ITD mutations. Overall, our study confirmed the therapeutic role of ningetinib in AML with FLT3-ITD mutations, providing a potential new option for clinically resistant patients. MET and AXL dysregulations are implicated in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC. But consensus on the optimal definition for MET/AXL dysregulations in EGFR-mutant NSCLC is lacking. Here, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of ningetinib (a MET/AXL inhibitor) plus gefitinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, and evaluated the clinical relevance of MET/AXL dysregulations by different definitions. Patients in this phase 1b dose-escalation/dose-expansion trial received ningetinib 30 mg/40 mg/60 mg plus gefitinib 250 mg once daily. Primary endpoints were tolerability (dose-escalation) and objective response rate (dose-expansion). MET/AXL status were analyzed using FISH and IHC. Between March 2017 and January 2021, 108 patients were enrolled. The proportion of MET focal amplification, MET polysomy, MET overexpression, AXL amplification and AXL overexpression is 18.1 %, 5.6 %, 55.8 %, 8.1 % and 45.3 %, respectively. 6.8 % patients have concurrent MET amplification and AXL overexpression. ORR is 30.8 % for tumors with MET amplification, 0 % for MET polysomy, 24.1 % for MET overexpression, 20 % for AXL amplification and 27.6 % for AXL overexpression. For patients with concurrent MET amplification and AXL overexpression, ningetinib plus gefitinib provides an ORR of 80 %, DCR of 100 % and median PFS of 4.7 months. Tumors with higher MET copy number and AXL expression tend to have higher likelihood of response. Biomarker analyses show that MET focal amplification and overexpression are complementary in predicting clinical benefit from MET inhibition, while AXL dysregulations defined by an arbitrary level may dilute the efficacy of AXL blockade. This study demonstrates that combined blockade of MET, AXL and EGFR is a feasible strategy for a subset of EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Chinadrugtrials.org.cn, CTR20160875. Ningetinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study aims to investigate the drug interaction of ningetinib and gefitinib and the mechanism of high plasma exposure of N-demethylated ningetinib (M1) in NSCLC patients. Patients with NSCLC were recruited. Metabolism and transport assays were performed using in vitro models. Deuterated M1 was used to study the effects of ningetinib and gefitinib on M1 efflux in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice. Upon co-administration of ningetinib with gefitinib, the plasma exposure of M1 was reduced by 80%, whereas that of ningetinib was not affected. In vitro experiments indicated that CYP1A1 was primarily responsible for M1 formation. Gefitinib was demonstrated to be a strong inhibitor of CYP1A1 with K The high plasma exposure of M1 in patients was attributed to the inhibition of M1 efflux by ningetinib and its low tissue affinity. When co-administered, gefitinib inhibited the formation of M1, but due to the low metabolic yield of M1 in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of ningetinib was not influenced. Inhibition of CYP1A1 may increase the concentration of ningetinib in target tissues, and the long-term safety and efficacy of ningetinib combined with gefitinib should be evaluated.",Ningetinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002584123576525599), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019444384379312396)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/4ac15c9ce7654e2fbce776d564b106da?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=114, start_index=6, title='Ningetinib Tosylate - Drug Targets, Indications, Patents - Synapse', type='url_citation', url='https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/4ac15c9ce7654e2fbce776d564b106da?utm_source=openai')])"
882,"('Nefazodone (hydrochloride)', 'Nefazodone', 'Nefazodonum [latin]', 'Nefazodona [spanish]', 'Nefazodona')",Medical,"Nefazodone, sold formerly under the brand names Serzone, Dutonin, and Nefadar among others, is an atypical antidepressant medication which is used in the treatment of depression and for other uses. Nefazodone is still available in the United States, but was withdrawn from other countries due to rare liver toxicity. The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of nefazodone include dry mouth, sleepiness, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, lightheadedness, confusion, and postural low blood pressure, among others. Rarely, nefazodone can cause serious liver damage, with an incidence of death or liver transplantation of about 1 in every 250,000 to 300,000 patient years. Nefazodone is a phenylpiperazine compound and is related to trazodone. It has been described as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) due to its combined actions as a potent antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and weak serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). Nefazodone was introduced for medical use in 1994. Generic versions were introduced in 2003. Serious liver toxicity was first reported with nefazodone in 1998, and it was withdrawn from most markets by 2004. However, as of 2023, it continues to be available in the United States in generic from one manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals and is manufactured in Israel. == Medical uses == Nefazodone is used to treat major depressive disorder, aggressive behavior, anxiety, and panic disorder. === Available forms === Nefazodone is available as 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 250 mg tablets for oral ingestion. == Contraindications == Contraindications include the coadministration of terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide, or carbamazepine. Nefazodone is contraindicated in patients who were withdrawn from nefazodone because of evident liver injury as well as those that have shown hypersensitivity to the drug, its inactive ingredients, or other phenylpiperazine antidepressants. Furthermore, the coadministration of triazolam and nefazodone should be avoided for all patients, including the elderly, since it causes a significant increase in the plasma level of triazolam and not all commercially available dosage forms of triazolam permit a sufficient dosage reduction. If coadministrated, a 75% reduction in the initial dosage of triazolam is recommended. == Side effects == Common and mild side effects of nefazodone reported in clinical trials more often than placebo include dry mouth (25%), sleepiness (25%), nausea (22%), dizziness (17%), blurred vision (16%), weakness (11%), lightheadedness (10%), confusion (7%), and orthostatic hypotension (5%). Rare and serious adverse reactions may include allergic reactions, fainting, painful/prolonged erection, and jaundice. Nefazodone is not especially associated with increased appetite and weight gain. It is also known for having low levels of sexual side effects in comparisons to SSRIs. Nefazodone can cause severe liver damage which may lead to the need for liver transplantation or to death. The incidence of severe liver damage is approximately 1 in every 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years. By the time it started to be withdrawn from the markets in 2003, nefazodone had been associated with at least 53 cases of liver injury (of which 11 led to death) in the United States, and 51 cases of liver toxicity (of which 2 led to transplantation) in Canada. In a 2002 Canadian study of 32 cases, it was noted that databases like those used in the study tended to include only a small proportion of suspected drug reactions. Treatment protocols suggest screening for pre-existing liver disease before initiating nefazodone, and those with known liver disease should not be prescribed nefazodone. If serum AST or serum ALT levels are more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), treatment should be permanently withdrawn. Enzyme labs should be done every six months, and nefazodone should not be a first-line treatment. == Interactions == Nefazodone is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and may interact adversely with many commonly used medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Nefazodone acts primarily as a potent antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and to a lesser extent of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. It also has high affinity for the α1-adrenergic receptor and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, and relatively lower affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor and dopamine D2 receptor. Nefazodone has low but significant affinity for the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters as well, and therefore acts as a weak serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It has low but potentially significant affinity for the histamine H1 receptor, where it is an antagonist, and hence may have some antihistamine activity. Nefazodone has negligible activity at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and accordingly, has no anticholinergic effects. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of nefazodone is low and variable, about 20%. Its plasma protein binding is approximately 99%, but it is bound loosely. Nefazodone is metabolized in the liver, with the main enzyme involved thought to be CYP3A4. The drug has at least four active metabolites, which include hydroxynefazodone, para-hydroxynefazodone, triazoledione, and meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP). Nefazodone has a short elimination half-life of about 2 to 4 hours. Its metabolite hydroxynefazodone similarly has an elimination half-life of about 1.5 to 4 hours, whereas the elimination half-lives of triazoledione and mCPP are longer at around 18 hours and 4 to 8 hours, respectively. Due to its long elimination half-life, triazoledione is the major metabolite and predominates in the circulation during nefazodone treatment, with plasma levels that are 4 to 10 times higher than those of nefazodone itself. Conversely, hydroxynefazodone levels are about 40% of those of nefazodone at steady state. Plasma levels of mCPP are very low at about 7% of those of nefazodone; hence, mCPP is only a minor metabolite. mCPP is thought to be formed from nefazodone specifically by CYP2D6. The ratios of brain-to-plasma concentrations of mCPP to nefazodone are 47:1 in mice and 10:1 in rats, suggesting that brain exposure to mCPP may be much higher than plasma exposure. Conversely, hydroxynefazodone levels in the brain are 10% of those in plasma in rats. As such, in spite of its relatively low plasma concentrations, brain exposure to mCPP may be substantial, whereas that of hydroxynefazodone may be minimal. == Chemistry == Nefazodone is a phenylpiperazine; it is an alpha-phenoxyl derivative of etoperidone which in turn was a derivative of trazodone. == History == Nefazodone was discovered by scientists at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) who were seeking to improve on trazodone by reducing its sedating qualities. BMS obtained marketing approvals for nefazodone worldwide, including in the United States and Europe, in 1994. It was marketed in the United States under the brand name Serzone and in Europe under the brand name Dutonin. The first reports of serious liver toxicity with nefazodone were published in 1998 and 1999. These instances were quickly followed by many additional cases. In 2002 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obligated BMS to add a black box warning about potential fatal liver toxicity to the drug label. Worldwide sales in 2002 were $409 million. In 2003 Public Citizen filed a citizen petition asking the FDA to withdraw the marketing authorization in the United States, and in early 2004 the organization sued the FDA to attempt to force withdrawal of the drug. The FDA issued a response to the petition in June 2004 and filed a motion to dismiss, and Public Citizen withdrew the suit. Sales of nefazodone were about $100 million in 2003. By that time, it was also being marketed under the additional brand names Serzonil, Nefadar, and Rulivan. Generic versions were introduced in the United States in 2003 and Health Canada withdrew the marketing authorization that same year. In April 2004, BMS announced that it was going to discontinue the sale of Serzone in the United States in June 2004 and said that this was due to declining sales and generic versions were available in the United States. By that time, BMS had already withdrawn the drug from the market in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In August 2020, Teva Pharmaceuticals placed nefazodone in shortage due to a shortage of a raw ingredient. On December 20, 2021, nefazodone was again made available in all strengths. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nefazodone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while néfazodone is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and nefazodone hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia. === Brand names === Nefazodone has been marketed under a number of brand names including Dutonin (ATTooltip Austria, ESTooltip Spain, IETooltip Ireland, UKTooltip United Kingdom), Menfazona (ESTooltip Spain), Nefadar (CHTooltip Switzerland, DETooltip Germany, NOTooltip Norway, SETooltip Sweden), Nefazodone BMS (ATTooltip Austria), Nefazodone Hydrochloride Teva (USTooltip United States), Reseril (ITTooltip Italy), Rulivan (ESTooltip Spain), and Serzone (AUTooltip Australia, CATooltip Canada, USTooltip United States). == Research == Nefazodone was under development for the treatment of panic disorder, and reached phase 3 clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued in 2004.

After completing Phase III clinical trials, on February 10, 2014, Gilead filed for U.S. approval of a ledipasvir/sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination tablet for genotype 1 hepatitis C. The ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination is a direct-acting antiviral agent that interferes with HCV replication and can be used to treat patients with genotypes 1a or 1b without PEG-interferon or ribavirin. Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a hepatitis C virus protein. Data presented at the 20th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in March 2013 showed that a triple regimen of the nucleotide analog inhibitor sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and ribavirin produced a 12-week post-treatment sustained virological response (SVR12) rate of 100% for both treatment-naive patients and prior non-responders with HCV genotype 1. The sofosbuvir/ledipasvir coformulation is being tested with and without ribavirin. In February 2014 Gilead filed for United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir oral treatment, without interferon and ribavirin. On 10 October 2014 the FDA approved the combination product ledipasvir/sofosbuvir called Harvoni. == Medical uses == Ledipasvir is most commonly used in combination with sofosbuvir for treatment in chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients. This drug has been tested and shown efficacy in treatment-naive and treatment experienced patients. == Adverse effects == According to clinical trials, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been very well tolerated with the most common side effects being fatigue and headache. == Interactions == Most drug-drug interactions with Harvoni involve Pgp-inducers such as St. John’s wort or rifampicin. Concomitant use will decrease the blood concentration of Harvoni and thus, have reduced therapeutic effects. == Mechanism of action == Ledipasvir inhibits an important viral phosphoprotein, NS5A, which is involved in viral replication, assembly, and secretion. Sofosbuvir, on the other hand, is metabolized to a uridine triphosphate mimic, which acts as a RNA chain terminator when incorporated into RNA by NS5B polymerase. == Cost == Similar to sofosbuvir, the cost of Harvoni has been a controversial topic. It costs $1,125 per pill in the US, translating to $63,000 for an 8-week treatment course, $94,500 for a 12-week treatment course, or $189,000 for a 24-week treatment course. Gilead justifies the cost by outweighing the benefit of curing hepatitis C over the cost of spending double on liver transplants or temporarily treating liver diseases. Gilead has provided a ledipasvir/sofosbuvir assistance program for eligible underserved or underinsured hepatitis C patients who cannot afford the costs of treatment. In July 2015 Gilead modified the eligibility criteria to receive Support Path benefits for HCV patients in the United States. == See also == Discovery and development of NS5A inhibitors == References ==",Ledipasvir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7762025890988298e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012909532233607024)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledipasvir?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Ledipasvir', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledipasvir?utm_source=openai')])"
884,"('Trifluridine', 'Trifluorothymidine', 'Viroptic', 'Trifluoromethyldeoxyuridine', 'Trifluridina')",Medical,"Trifluridine (also called trifluorothymidine; abbreviation TFT or FTD) is an anti-herpesvirus antiviral drug, used primarily as prescription eyedrops. It was sold under the trade name Viroptic by Glaxo Wellcome, now merged into GlaxoSmithKline. The brand is now wholly owned by King Pharmaceuticals. Trifluridine was approved for medical use in 1980. It is also a component of the anti-cancer drug trifluridine/tipiracil, which is taken by mouth. == Medical uses == Trifluridine eye drops are used for the treatment of keratitis and keratoconjunctivitis caused by the herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as for prevention and treatment of vaccinia virus infections of the eye. A Cochrane Systematic Review showed that trifluridine and aciclovir were a more effective treatment than idoxuridine or vidarabine, significantly increasing the relative number of successfully healed eyes in one to two weeks. == Adverse effects == Common side effects of trifluridine eye drops include transient burning, stinging, local irritation, and edema of the eyelids. Adverse effects of the anti-cancer formulation have only been evaluated for the combination trifluridine/tipiracil, not for the individual components. == Interactions == Only in vitro interaction studies are available. In these, trifluridine used the concentrative nucleoside transporter 1 (CNT1) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1 (ENT1) and 2 (ENT2). Drugs that interact with these transporters could influence blood plasma concentrations of trifluridine. Being a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, trifluridine could also interact with substrates of this enzyme such as zidovudine. For the eye drops, trifluridine absorption is negligible, rendering interactions basically irrelevant. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action (eye drops) === It is a nucleoside analogue, a modified form of deoxyuridine, similar enough to be incorporated into viral DNA replication, but the –CF3 group added to the uracil component blocks base pairing, thus interfering with viral DNA replication. === Pharmacokinetics (eye drops) === Trifluridine passes the cornea and is found in the aqueous humour. Systemic absorption is negligible. === Pharmacokinetics (oral) === Pharmacokinetic data of oral trifluridine have only been evaluated in combination with tipiracil, which significantly affects biotransformation of the former. At least 57% of trifluridine are absorbed from the gut, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after two hours in cancer patients. The substance has no tendency to accumulate in the body. Plasma protein binding is over 96%. Trifluridine is metabolised by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase to 5-trifluoromethyl-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (FTY), and also by glucuronidation. Elimination half-life is 1.4 hours on the first day and increases to 2.1 hours on the twelfth day. It is mainly excreted via the kidneys. Tipiracil causes Cmax (highest blood plasma concentrations) of trifluridine to increase 22-fold, and its area under the curve 37-fold, by inhibiting thymidine phosphorylase. == Chemistry == The substance is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in methanol and acetone; soluble in water, ethanol, 0.01 M hydrochloric acid, and 0.01 M sodium hydroxide; sparingly soluble in isopropyl alcohol and acetonitrile; slightly soluble in diethyl ether; and very slightly soluble in isopropyl ether. == References == == External links ==",Viroptic,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.266281055402942e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031865080818533897)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/viroptic.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=9, title='Viroptic: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/viroptic.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It was chemically derived via altering the chemical structure of the tetracyclic (atypical) antidepressant, mianserin. It was initially approved in the United States in 2009 and approved as a generic medication in 2020. == Medical uses == Asenapine has been approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of adults with schizophrenia and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features in adults. In Australia asenapine's approved (and also listed on the PBS) indications include the following: Schizophrenia Treatment, for up to 6 months, of an episode of acute mania or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder Maintenance treatment, as monotherapy, of bipolar I disorder In the European Union and the United Kingdom, asenapine is only licensed for use as a treatment for acute mania in bipolar I disorder. Asenapine is absorbed readily if administered sublingually, asenapine is poorly absorbed when swallowed. A transdermal formulation of asenapine was approved in the United States in October 2019 under the brand name Secuado. === Schizophrenia === A Cochrane systematic review found that while Asenapine has some preliminary evidence that it improves positive, negative, and depressive symptoms, it does not have enough research to merit a certain recommendation of asenapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. === Bipolar disorder === For the medium-term and long-term management and control of both depressive and manic features of bipolar disorder asenapine was found to be equally effective as olanzapine, but with a substantially superior side effect profile. In acute mania, asenapine was found to be significantly superior to placebo. As for its efficacy in the treatment of acute mania, a recent meta-analysis showed that it produces comparatively small improvements in manic symptoms in patients with acute mania and mixed episodes than most other antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone and olanzapine (with the exception of ziprasidone). Drop-out rates (in clinical trials) were also unusually high with asenapine. According to a post-hoc analysis of two 3-week clinical trials it may possess some antidepressant effects in patients with acute mania or mixed episodes. == Adverse effects == Adverse effect incidence Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Somnolence Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include: Weight gain† Increased appetite Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS; such as dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia, muscle rigidity, parkinsonism) Sedation Dizziness Dysgeusia (altered taste) Oral hypoaesthesia (numbness), only when taken sublingually. Transdermal asenapine was shown to eliminate this side effect. Increased alanine aminotransferase Dyspepsia, stomach discomfort, and/or vomiting Fatigue Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include: Hyperglycaemia — elevated blood glucose (sugar) Syncope Seizure Dysarthria sinus bradycardia Bundle branch block QTc interval prolongation (has a relatively low risk for causing QTc interval prolongation.) sinus tachycardia Orthostatic hypotension Hypotension Swollen tongue Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Glossodynia Oral paraesthesia Rare (0.01–0.1% incidence) adverse effects include: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (Combination of fever, muscle stiffness, faster breathing, sweating, reduced consciousness, and sudden change in blood pressure and heart rate) Tardive dyskinesia Speech disturbance Rhabdomyolysis Angioedema Blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis, leukopenia and neutropenia Accommodation disorder Pulmonary embolism Gynaecomastia Galactorrhoea Unknown incidence adverse effects Allergic reaction Restless legs syndrome Oral mucosal lesions (ulcerations, blistering and inflammation) Salivary hypersecretion Hyperprolactinaemia † Asenapine seems to have a relatively low weight gain liability for an atypical antipsychotic (which are notorious for their metabolic side effects) and a 2013 meta-analysis found significantly less weight gain (SMD [standard mean difference in weight gained in those on placebo vs. active drug]: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.07-0.39) than, paliperidone (SMD: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.27-0.48), risperidone (SMD: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.33-0.50), quetiapine (SMD: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.34-0.53), sertindole (SMD: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.38-0.68), chlorpromazine (SMD: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.76), iloperidone (SMD: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49-0.74), clozapine (SMD: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.31-0.99), zotepine (SMD: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.47-0.96) and olanzapine (SMD: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.67-0.81) and approximately (that is, no statistically significant difference at the p=0.05 level) as much as weight gain as aripiprazole (SMD: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.05-0.28), lurasidone (SMD: 0.10; 95% CI: –0.02-0.21), amisulpride (SMD: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.05-0.35), haloperidol (SMD: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.00-0.17) and ziprasidone (SMD: 0.10; 95% CI: –0.02-0.22). Its potential for elevating plasma prolactin levels seems relatively limited too according to this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis also found that asenapine has approximately the same odds ratio (3.28; 95% CI: 1.37-6.69) for causing sedation [compared to placebo-treated patients] as olanzapine (3.34; 95% CI: 2.46-4.50]) and haloperidol (2.76; 95% CI: 2.04-3.66) and a higher odds ratio (although not significantly) for sedation than aripiprazole (1.84; 95% CI: 1.05-3.05), paliperidone (1.40; 95% CI: 0.85-2.19) and amisulpride (1.42; 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.51) to name a few and is hence a mild-moderately sedating antipsychotic. The same meta-analysis suggested that asenapine had a relatively high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms compared to other atypical antipsychotics but a lower risk than first-generation or typical antipsychotics. === Discontinuation === For all antipsychotics, the British National Formulary recommends a gradual dose reduction when discontinuing to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis as a transient withdrawal symptom. It may also result in recurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Asenapine shows high affinity (pKi) for numerous receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1A (8.6), 5-HT1B (8.4), 5-HT2A (10.2), 5-HT2B (9.8), 5-HT2C (10.5), 5-HT5A (8.8), 5-HT6 (9.5), and 5-HT7 (9.9) receptors, the adrenergic α1 (8.9), α2A (8.9), α2B (9.5), and α2C (8.9) receptors, the dopamine D1 (8.9), D2 (8.9), D3 (9.4), and D4 (9.0) receptors, and the histamine H1 (9.0) and H2 (8.2) receptors. It has much lower affinity (pKi < 5) for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Asenapine behaves as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors. At all other targets asenapine is an antagonist. Even relative to other atypical antipsychotics, asenapine has unusually high affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, and very high affinity for the α2 and H1 receptors. == Notes == == References == == External links == ""Asenapine"".

It is a kinase inhibitor. The most common adverse reactions include rash, hair color changes, fatigue, viral infection, vomiting, headache, hemorrhage, pyrexia, dry skin, constipation, nausea, dermatitis acneiform, and upper respiratory tract infection. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities include decreased phosphate, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine phosphokinase, increased alanine aminotransferase, decreased albumin, decreased lymphocytes, decreased leukocytes, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased potassium, and decreased sodium.

888,"('Fulvestrant', 'Zd 9238', 'Zm 182780', 'Faslodex', 'Fulvestrant (faslodex)')",Medical,"Fulvestrant, sold under the brand name Faslodex among others, is an antiestrogenic medication used to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression as well as HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with abemaciclib or palbociclib in women with disease progression after endocrine therapy. It is given by injection into a muscle. Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and was first-in-class to be approved. It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and destabilizing it, causing the cell's normal protein degradation processes to destroy it. Fulvestrant was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. == Medical uses == === Breast cancer === Fulvestrant is used for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer or locally advanced unresectable disease in postmenopausal women; it is given by injection. A 2017 Cochrane review found it is as safe and effective as first line or second line endocrine therapy. It is also used to treat ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with abemaciclib or palbociclib in women with disease progression after first-line endocrine therapy. Due to the medication's having a chemical structure similar to that of estrogen, it can interact with immunoassays for blood estradiol concentrations and show falsely elevated results. This can improperly lead to discontinuing the treatment. === Early puberty === Fulvestrant has been used in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty in girls with McCune–Albright syndrome. === Available forms === Fulvestrant is provided in a castor oil solution also containing alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and benzyl benzoate. It is supplied at a concentration of 250 mg/5 mL. == Contraindications == Fulvestrant should not be used in women with kidney failure or who are pregnant. == Side effects == Very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include nausea, injection site reactions, weakness, and elevated transaminases. Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include urinary tract infections, hypersensitivity reactions, loss of appetite, headache, blood clots in veins, hot flushes, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin, rashes, and back pain. In a large clinical trial, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with fulvestrant was 0.9%. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Fulvestrant is an antiestrogen which acts as an antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) and additionally as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and making it more hydrophobic, which makes the receptor unstable and misfold, which in turn leads normal processes inside the cell to degrade it. In addition to its antiestrogenic activity, fulvestrant is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), albeit with relatively low affinity (10–100 nM, relative to 3–6 nM for estradiol). === Pharmacokinetics === Fulvestrant after an intramuscular injection is slowly absorbed and maximal levels (Cmax) are reached after 5 days on average with a range of 2 to 19 days. The elimination half-life of fulvestrant with intramuscular injection is 40 to 50 days. This is 40 times longer than the half-life of fulvestrant by intravenous injection, indicating that its long half-life with intramuscular injection is due to slow absorption from the injection site. Levels of fulvestrant with 500 mg/month by intramuscular injection (and a single additional 500 mg loading dose on day 15 of therapy) in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer were 25.1 ng/mL (25,100 pg/mL) at peak and 28.0 ng/mL (28,000 pg/mL) at trough with a single dose and 28.0 ng/mL (28,000 pg/mL) at peak and 12.2 ng/mL (12,200 pg/mL) at trough after multiple doses at steady state. Fulvestrant does not cross the blood–brain barrier in animals and may not in humans as well. Accordingly, no effects of fulvestrant on brain function have been observed in preclinical or clinical research. Fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins. It is bound to very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin. Fulvestrant appears to be metabolized along similar pathways as endogenous steroids; CYP3A4 may be involved, but non-cytochrome P450 routes appear to be more important. It does not inhibit any cytochrome P450 enzymes. Elimination is almost all via feces. Fulvestrant can form colloidal aggregates at certain concentration ranges and this can limit its activity as well as produce bell-shaped concentration–response curves. == Chemistry == Fulvestrant, also known as 7α-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estradiol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. An alkyl-sulfinyl moiety was added to the endogenous estrogen receptor ligand. It was discovered through rational drug design, but was selected for further development via phenotypic screening. == History == Fulvestrant was the first selective estrogen receptor degrader to be approved. It was approved in the United States in 2002 and in the European Union in 2004. == Society and culture == === NICE evaluation === The U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said in 2011 that it found no evidence Faslodex was significantly better than existing treatments, so its widespread use would not be a good use of resources for the country's National Health Service. The first month's treatment of Faslodex, which starts with a loading dose, costs £1,044.82 ($1,666), and subsequent treatments cost £522.41 a month. In the 12 months ending June 2015, the UK price (excluding VAT) of a month's supply of anastrozole (Arimidex), which is off patent, cost 89 pence/day, and letrozole (Femara) cost £1.40/day. === Patent extension === The original patent for Faslodex expired in October 2004. Drugs subject to pre-marketing regulatory review are eligible for patent extension, and for this reason AstraZeneca got an extension of the patent to December 2011. AstraZeneca has filed later patents. A generic version of Faslodex has been approved by the FDA. However, this does not mean that the product will necessarily be commercially available - possibly because of drug patents and/or drug exclusivity. A later patent for Faslodex expires in January 2021. Atossa Genetics has a patent for the administration of fulvestrant into the breast via a microcatheter invented by Susan Love. == Research == Fulvestrant was studied in endometrial cancer but results were not promising and as of 2016 development for this use was abandoned. Because fulvestrant cannot be given orally, efforts have been made to develop SERD drugs that can be taken by mouth, including brilanestrant and elacestrant. The clinical success of fulvestrant also led to efforts to discover and develop a parallel drug class of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs). ZB716, or fulvestrant-3-boronic acid, is an oral prodrug of fulvestrant which is under development. == References ==",Faslodex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3947389561508317e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004365683125797659)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/fulvestrant?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=106, start_index=9, title='Fulvestrant - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/fulvestrant?utm_source=openai')])"

It acts as a selective antagonist on D2 dopamine receptors. It has been used in trials studying Parkinson Disease. Its selectivity to the cerebral D2 receptors is characterized by its respective Ki-values, which are as follows: 1.8, 3.5, 2400 and 18000 nM for D2, D3, D4 and D1 receptors respectively. It can be radiolabelled with radioisotopes, e.g. 3H or 11C and used as a tracer for in vitro imaging (autoradiography) as well as in vivo imaging positron emission tomography (PET). Images obtained by cerebral PET scanning (e.g. PET/CT or PET/MRI) allow the non-invasive assessment of the binding capacity of the cerebral D2 dopamine receptor, which can be useful for the diagnosis of movement disorders. In particular, cerebral D2 receptor binding as measured by carbon-11-raclopride (11C-raclopride) has shown to reflect disease severity of Huntington's disease, a genetic disease characterized by selective degeneration of cerebral D2 receptors. Other studies have investigated the relationship of D2 receptor binding capacity and personality disorders. One study found decreased binding in the detachment personality trait.
