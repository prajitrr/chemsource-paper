4161,"('(s)-remoxipride hydrochloride', 'A 33547 hydrochloride', 'Fla 731', 'Fla 732', 'Remoxipride hydrochloride anhydrous')",Medical," The X-ray structures of two new 2,6-disubstituted benzamides, i.e., remoxipride hydrochloride monohydrate [-)-(S)-3-bromo-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-2,6-dimethoxybenza mide hydrochloride monohydrate) and FLA 797 [-)-(S)-3-bromo-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-6-methoxysalicylamide ), have been determined as well as the distribution coefficients. The difference in dopamine receptor blocking activity is discussed in terms of lipophilicity and solid state conformations of the two benzamides. The major difference between the solid state conformations lies in the orientation of the carboxamide moiety. In remoxipride the carbonyl group is oriented almost perpendicularly to the benzene ring, thus preventing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded pseudo-ring between the amide hydrogen and the methoxy group found in other types of o-methoxybenzamides. In FLA 797, however, this pseudo-ring is present in the planar conformation of the salicylamide moiety. This conformation is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the phenol group and the carbonyl oxygen. The side chain in remoxipride adopts an extended conformation in contrast to FLA 797, where the side chain has a folded conformation. The crystal structures are related to current topographic dopamine receptor models developed from more rigid antidopaminergic compounds. Based on these comparisons, it is suggested that benzamides having an N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl side chain interact with the receptor in the folded conformation. The binding affinity is thought to be further increased by the planar conformation of the salicylamide moiety present in FLA 797, which permits an efficient pi-pi stacking interaction.",(s)-remoxipride hydrochloride,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12692904472351074), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1019640639424324), ('ICAL', -4.0531076592742465e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16024857759475708)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01814994215965271), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4162,"('Demeclocycline hcl', 'Detravis', 'Declomycin', 'Clortetrin', 'Demethylchlortetracycline hydrochloride')",Medical,"Demeclocycline (INN, BAN, USAN, brand name Declomycin) is a tetracycline antibiotic which was derived from a mutant strain of Streptomyces aureofaciens. == Uses == Demeclocycline is officially indicated for the treatment of various types of bacterial infections. It is used as an antibiotic in the treatment of Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis. Resistance, though, is gradually becoming more common, and demeclocycline is now rarely used for treatment of infections. It is widely used (though off-label in many countries including the United States) in the treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium concentration) due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) when fluid restriction alone has been ineffective. Physiologically, this works by reducing the responsiveness of the collecting tubule cells to ADH. The use in SIADH actually relies on a side effect; demeclocycline induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to the inability to concentrate urine). The use of demeclocycline in SIADH was first reported in 1975, and, in 1978, a larger study found it to be more effective and better tolerated than lithium carbonate, the only available treatment at the time. Demeclocycline used to be the drug of choice for treating SIADH. Meanwhile, it might be superseded, now that vasopressin receptor antagonists, such as tolvaptan, became available. == Contraindications == Like other tetracyclines, demeclocycline is contraindicated in children and pregnant or nursing women. All members of this class interfere with bone development and may discolour teeth. == Side effects and interactions == The side effects are similar to those of other tetracyclines. Skin reactions with sunlight have been reported. Like only few other known tetracycline derivatives, demeclocycline causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Furthermore, demeclocycline might have psychotropic side effects similar to lithium. Tetracyclines bind to cations, such as calcium, iron (when given orally), and magnesium, rendering them insoluble and nonadsorbable for the gastrointestinal tract. Demeclocycline should not be taken with food (particularly milk and other dairy products) or antacids. == Mechanism of action == As with related tetracycline antibiotics, demeclocycline acts by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit to inhibit binding of aminoacyl tRNA which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria. It is bacteriostatic (it impairs bacterial growth, but does not kill bacteria directly). Demeclocycline inhibits the renal action of antidiuretic hormone by interfering with the intracellular second messenger cascade (specifically, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activation) after the hormone binds to vasopressin V2 receptors in the kidney. Exactly how demeclocycline does this has yet to be elucidated, however. == Brand names == Brand names include Declomycin, Declostatin, Ledermycin, Bioterciclin, Deganol, Deteclo, Detravis, Meciclin, Mexocine, and Clortetrin. == References ==",Clortetrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.015048432163894176), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029869364574551582)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/demeclociclina?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=118, start_index=9, title='Demeclociclina | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/demeclociclina?utm_source=openai')])"
4163,"('Diacetylmorphine', 'Diamorphine', 'Acetomorphine', ""O,o'-diacetylmorphine"", 'Morphacetin')",Medical,"Heroin, also known as diacetylmorphine and diamorphine among other names, is a morphinan opioid substance synthesized from the dried latex of the opium poppy; it is mainly used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Heroin is used medically in several countries to relieve pain, such as during childbirth or a heart attack, as well as in opioid replacement therapy. Medical-grade diamorphine is used as a pure hydrochloride salt. Various white and brown powders sold illegally around the world as heroin are routinely diluted with cutting agents. Black tar heroin is a variable admixture of morphine derivatives—predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is the result of crude acetylation during clandestine production of street heroin. Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein, but it can also be snorted, smoked, or inhaled. In a clinical context, the route of administration is most commonly intravenous injection; it may also be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, as well as orally in the form of tablets. The onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours. Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing), dry mouth, drowsiness, impaired mental function, constipation, and addiction. Use by injection can also result in abscesses, infected heart valves, blood-borne infections, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, opioid withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of the last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect of a similar dose of morphine. It typically appears in the form of a white or brown powder. Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications can include buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. As of 2015, an estimated 17 million people use opiates, of which heroin is the most common, and opioid use resulted in 122,000 deaths; also, as of 2015, the total number of heroin users worldwide is believed to have increased in Africa, the Americas, and Asia since 2000. In the United States, approximately 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid and often heroin. Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and it is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell without a license. About 448 tons of heroin were made in 2016. In 2015, Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Illegal heroin is often mixed with other substances such as sugar, starch, caffeine, quinine, or other opioids like fentanyl. == Uses == === Recreational === Bayer's original trade name of heroin is typically used in non-medical settings. It is used as a recreational drug for the euphoria it induces. Anthropologist Michael Agar once described heroin as ""the perfect whatever drug."" Tolerance develops quickly, and increased doses are needed in order to achieve the same effects. Its popularity with recreational drug users, compared to morphine, reportedly stems from its perceived different effects. Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and pethidine (meperidine), former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to misuse and causing dependence. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids. === Medical uses === In the United States, heroin is not accepted as medically useful. Under the generic name diamorphine, heroin is prescribed as a strong pain medication in the United Kingdom, where it is administered via oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intranasal or intravenous routes. It may be prescribed for the treatment of acute pain, such as in severe physical trauma, myocardial infarction, post-surgical pain and chronic pain, including end-stage terminal illnesses. In other countries it is more common to use morphine or other strong opioids in these situations. In 2004, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence produced guidance on the management of caesarean section, which recommended the use of intrathecal or epidural diamorphine for post-operative pain relief. For women who have had intrathecal opioids, there should be a minimum hourly observation of respiratory rate, sedation and pain scores for at least 12 hours for diamorphine and 24 hours for morphine. Women should be offered diamorphine (0.3–0.4 mg intrathecally) for intra- and postoperative analgesia because it reduces the need for supplemental analgesia after a caesarean section. Epidural diamorphine (2.5–5 mg) is a suitable alternative. Diamorphine continues to be widely used in palliative care in the UK, where it is commonly given by the subcutaneous route, often via a syringe driver if patients cannot easily swallow morphine solution. The advantage of diamorphine over morphine is that diamorphine is more fat soluble and therefore more potent by injection, so smaller doses of it are needed for the same effect on pain. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the subcutaneous route, which is often necessary for palliative care. It is also used in the palliative management of bone fractures and other trauma, especially in children. In the trauma context, it is primarily given by nose in hospital; although a prepared nasal spray is available. It has traditionally been made by the attending physician, generally from the same ""dry"" ampoules as used for injection. In children, Ayendi nasal spray is available at 720 micrograms and 1600 micrograms per 50 microlitres actuation of the spray, which may be preferable as a non-invasive alternative in pediatric care, avoiding the fear of injection in children. ==== Maintenance therapy ==== A number of European countries prescribe heroin for treatment of heroin addiction. The initial Swiss HAT (heroin-assisted treatment) trial (""PROVE"" study) was conducted as a prospective cohort study with some 1,000 participants in 18 treatment centers between 1994 and 1996, at the end of 2004, 1,200 patients were enrolled in HAT in 23 treatment centers across Switzerland. Diamorphine may be used as a maintenance drug to assist the treatment of opiate addiction, normally in long-term chronic intravenous (IV) heroin users. It is only prescribed following exhaustive efforts at treatment via other means. It is sometimes thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription, but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for diamorphine is issued. Though this is somewhat controversial among proponents of a zero-tolerance drug policy, it has proven superior to methadone in improving the social and health situations of addicts. The UK Department of Health's Rolleston Committee Report in 1926 established the British approach to diamorphine prescription to users, which was maintained for the next 40 years: dealers were prosecuted, but doctors could prescribe diamorphine to users when withdrawing. In 1964, the Brain Committee recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialized centres be allowed to prescribe diamorphine and cocaine to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of methadone; currently, only a small number of users in the UK are prescribed diamorphine. In 1994, Switzerland began a trial diamorphine maintenance program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs. The aim of this program was to maintain the health of the user by avoiding medical problems stemming from the illicit use of diamorphine. The first trial in 1994 involved 340 users, although enrollment was later expanded to 1000, based on the apparent success of the program. The trials proved diamorphine maintenance to be superior to other forms of treatment in improving the social and health situation for this group of patients. It has also been shown to save money, despite high treatment expenses, as it significantly reduces costs incurred by trials, incarceration, health interventions and delinquency. Patients appear twice daily at a treatment center, where they inject their dose of diamorphine under the supervision of medical staff. They are required to contribute about 450 Swiss francs per month to the treatment costs. A national referendum in November 2008 showed 68% of voters supported the plan, introducing diamorphine prescription into federal law. The previous trials were based on time-limited executive ordinances. The success of the Swiss trials led German, Dutch, and Canadian cities to try out their own diamorphine prescription programs. Some Australian cities (such as Sydney) have instituted legal diamorphine supervised injecting centers, in line with other wider harm minimization programs. Since January 2009, Denmark has prescribed diamorphine to a few addicts who have tried methadone and buprenorphine without success. Beginning in February 2010, addicts in Copenhagen and Odense became eligible to receive free diamorphine. Later in 2010, other cities including Århus and Esbjerg joined the scheme. It was estimated that around 230 addicts would be able to receive free diamorphine. However, Danish addicts would only be able to inject heroin according to the policy set by Danish National Board of Health. Of the estimated 1500 drug users who did not benefit from the then-current oral substitution treatment, approximately 900 would not be in the target group for treatment with injectable diamorphine, either because of ""massive multiple drug abuse of non-opioids"" or ""not wanting treatment with injectable diamorphine"". In July 2009, the German Bundestag passed a law allowing diamorphine prescription as a standard treatment for addicts; a large-scale trial of diamorphine prescription had been authorized in the country in 2002. On 26 August 2016, Health Canada issued regulations amending prior regulations it had issued under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; the ""New Classes of Practitioners Regulations"", the ""Narcotic Control Regulations"", and the ""Food and Drug Regulations"", to allow doctors to prescribe diamorphine to people who have a severe opioid addiction who have not responded to other treatments. The prescription heroin can be accessed by doctors through Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP) for ""emergency access to drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable."" == Routes of administration == The onset of heroin's effects depends upon the route of administration. Smoking is the fastest route of drug administration, although intravenous injection results in a quicker rise in blood concentration. These are followed by suppository (anal or vaginal insertion), insufflation (snorting), and ingestion (swallowing). A 2002 study suggests that a fast onset of action increases the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs. Ingestion does not produce a rush as a forerunner to the high experienced with the use of heroin, which is most pronounced with intravenous use. While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of heroin used and faster the route of administration used, the higher the potential risk for psychological dependence/addiction. Large doses of heroin can cause fatal respiratory depression, and the drug has been used for suicide or as a murder weapon. The serial killer Harold Shipman used diamorphine on his victims, and the subsequent Shipman Inquiry led to a tightening of the regulations surrounding the storage, prescribing and destruction of controlled drugs in the UK. Because significant tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly with continued use and is lost just as quickly during withdrawal, it is often difficult to determine whether a heroin lethal overdose was accidental, suicide or homicide. Examples include the overdose deaths of Sid Vicious, Janis Joplin, Tim Buckley, Hillel Slovak, Layne Staley, Bradley Nowell, Ted Binion, and River Phoenix. === By mouth === Use of heroin by mouth is less common than other methods of administration, mainly because there is little to no ""rush"", and the effects are less potent. Heroin is entirely converted to morphine by means of first-pass metabolism, resulting in deacetylation when ingested. Heroin's oral bioavailability is both dose-dependent (as is morphine's) and significantly higher than oral use of morphine itself, reaching up to 64.2% for high doses and 45.6% for low doses; opiate-naive users showed far less absorption of the drug at low doses, having bioavailabilities of only up to 22.9%. The maximum plasma concentration of morphine following oral administration of heroin was around twice as much as that of oral morphine. === Injection === Injection, also known as ""slamming"", ""banging"", ""shooting up"", ""digging"" or ""mainlining"", is a popular method which carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. Heroin base (commonly found in Europe), when prepared for injection, will only dissolve in water when mixed with an acid (most commonly citric acid powder or lemon juice) and heated. Heroin in the east-coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. Users tend to initially inject in the easily accessible arm veins, but as these veins collapse over time, users resort to more dangerous areas of the body, such as the femoral vein in the groin. Some medical professionals have expressed concern over this route of administration, as they suspect that it can lead to deep vein thrombosis. Intravenous users can use a variable single dose range using a hypodermic needle. The dose of heroin used for recreational purposes is dependent on the frequency and level of use. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users share a common needle without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, can be transmitted. The use of a common dispenser for water for the use in the preparation of the injection, as well as the sharing of spoons and filters can also cause the spread of blood-borne diseases. Many countries now supply small sterile spoons and filters for single use in order to prevent the spread of disease. === Smoking === Smoking heroin refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, rather than burning and inhaling the smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from glassblown Pyrex tubes and light bulbs. Heroin may be smoked from aluminium foil that is heated by a flame underneath it, with the resulting smoke inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil, a method also known as ""chasing the dragon"". === Insufflation === Another popular route to intake heroin is insufflation (snorting), where a user crushes the heroin into a fine powder and then gently inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled-up banknote, as with cocaine) into the nose, where heroin is absorbed through the soft tissue in the mucous membrane of the sinus cavity and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects first-pass metabolism, with a quicker onset and higher bioavailability than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer heroin for injection or smoking but still want to experience a fast onset. Snorting heroin becomes an often unwanted route, once a user begins to inject the drug. The user may still get high on the drug from snorting, and experience a nod, but will not get a rush. A ""rush"" is caused by a large amount of heroin entering the body at once. When the drug is taken in through the nose, the user does not get the rush because the drug is absorbed slowly rather than instantly. Heroin for pain has been mixed with sterile water on site by the attending physician, and administered using a syringe with a nebulizer tip. Heroin may be used for fractures, burns, finger-tip injuries, suturing, and wound re-dressing, but is inappropriate in head injuries. === Suppository === Little research has been focused on the suppository (anal insertion) or pessary (vaginal insertion) methods of administration, also known as ""plugging"". These methods of administration are commonly carried out using an oral syringe. Heroin can be dissolved and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. The rectum or the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining their walls. == Adverse effects == Heroin is classified as a hard drug in terms of drug harmfulness. Like most opioids, unadulterated heroin may lead to adverse effects. The purity of street heroin varies greatly, leading to overdoses when the purity is higher than expected. === Short-term effects === Users report an intense rush, an acute transcendent state of euphoria, which occurs while diamorphine is being metabolized into 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine in the brain. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids; one possible explanation is the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite unique to heroin – although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. While other opioids of recreational use produce only morphine, heroin also leaves 6-MAM, also a psycho-active metabolite. However, this perception is not supported by the results of clinical studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opioids; these subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness. The rush is usually accompanied by a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth, and a heavy feeling in the extremities. Nausea, vomiting, and severe itching may also occur. After the initial effects, users usually will be drowsy for several hours; mental function is clouded; heart function slows, and breathing is also severely slowed, sometimes enough to be life-threatening. Slowed breathing can also lead to coma and permanent brain damage. Heroin use has also been associated with myocardial infarction. === Long-term effects === Repeated heroin use changes the physical structure and physiology of the brain, creating long-term imbalances in neuronal and hormonal systems that are not easily reversed. Studies have shown some deterioration of the brain's white matter due to heroin use, which may affect decision-making abilities, the ability to regulate behavior, and responses to stressful situations. Heroin also produces profound degrees of tolerance and physical dependence. Tolerance occurs when more and more of the drug is required to achieve the same effects. With physical dependence, the body adapts to the presence of the drug, and withdrawal symptoms occur if use is reduced abruptly. === Injection === Intravenous use of heroin (and any other substance) with needles and syringes or other related equipment may lead to: Contracting blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis via the sharing of needles Contracting bacterial or fungal endocarditis and possibly venous sclerosis Abscesses Poisoning from contaminants added to ""cut"" or dilute heroin Decreased kidney function (nephropathy), although it is not currently known if this is because of adulterants or infectious diseases === Withdrawal === The withdrawal syndrome from heroin may begin within as little as two hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose, and more typically begins within 6–24 hours after cessation. Symptoms may include sweating, malaise, anxiety, depression, akathisia, priapism, extra sensitivity of the genitals in females, general feeling of heaviness, excessive yawning or sneezing, rhinorrhea, insomnia, cold sweats, chills, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, watery eyes, fever, cramp-like pains, and involuntary spasms in the limbs (thought to be an origin of the term ""kicking the habit""). == Overdose == Heroin overdose is usually treated with the opioid antagonist naloxone. This reverses the effects of heroin and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may result in withdrawal symptoms. The half-life of naloxone is shorter than some opioids, such that it may need to be given multiple times until the opioid has been metabolized by the body. Between 2012 and 2015, heroin was the leading cause of drug-related deaths in the United States. Since then, fentanyl has been a more common cause of drug-related deaths. Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours. Death usually occurs due to lack of oxygen resulting from the lack of breathing caused by the opioid. Heroin overdoses can occur because of an unexpected increase in the dose or purity or because of diminished opioid tolerance. However, many fatalities reported as overdoses are probably caused by interactions with other depressant drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. Since heroin can cause nausea and vomiting, a significant number of deaths attributed to heroin overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious person. Some sources quote the median lethal dose (for an average 75 kg opiate-naive individual) as being between 75 and 600 mg. Illicit heroin is of widely varying and unpredictable purity. This means that the user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended. Also, tolerance typically decreases after a period of abstinence. If this occurs and the user takes a dose comparable to their previous use, the user may experience drug effects that are much greater than expected, potentially resulting in an overdose. It has been speculated that an unknown portion of heroin-related deaths are the result of an overdose or allergic reaction to quinine, which may sometimes be used as a cutting agent. == Pharmacology == When taken orally, heroin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism via deacetylation, making it a prodrug for the systemic delivery of morphine. When the drug is injected, however, it avoids this first-pass effect, very rapidly crossing the blood–brain barrier because of the presence of the acetyl groups, which render it much more fat soluble than morphine itself. Once in the brain, it then is deacetylated variously into the inactive 3-monoacetylmorphine and the active 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), and then to morphine, which bind to μ-opioid receptors, resulting in the drug's euphoric, analgesic (pain relief), and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects; heroin itself exhibits relatively low affinity for the μ receptor. Analgesia follows from the activation of the μ receptor G-protein coupled receptor, which indirectly hyperpolarizes the neuron, reducing the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters, and hence, causes analgesia and increased pain tolerance. Unlike hydromorphone and oxymorphone, however, administered intravenously, heroin creates a larger histamine release, similar to morphine, resulting in the feeling of a greater subjective ""body high"" to some, but also instances of pruritus (itching) when they first start using. Normally, GABA, which is released from inhibitory neurones, inhibits the release of dopamine. Opiates, like heroin and morphine, decrease the inhibitory activity of such neurones. This causes increased release of dopamine in the brain which is the reason for euphoric and rewarding effects of heroin. Both morphine and 6-MAM are μ-opioid agonists that bind to receptors present throughout the brain, spinal cord, and gut of all mammals. The μ-opioid receptor also binds endogenous opioid peptides such as β-endorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin. Repeated use of heroin results in a number of physiological changes, including an increase in the production of μ-opioid receptors (upregulation). These physiological alterations lead to tolerance and dependence, so that stopping heroin use results in uncomfortable symptoms including pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and insomnia called the opioid withdrawal syndrome. Depending on usage it has an onset 4–24 hours after the last dose of heroin. Morphine also binds to δ- and κ-opioid receptors. There is also evidence that 6-MAM binds to a subtype of μ-opioid receptors that are also activated by the morphine metabolite morphine-6β-glucuronide but not morphine itself. The third subtype of third opioid type is the mu-3 receptor, which may be a commonality to other six-position monoesters of morphine. The contribution of these receptors to the overall pharmacology of heroin remains unknown. A subclass of morphine derivatives, namely the 3,6 esters of morphine, with similar effects and uses, includes the clinically used strong analgesics nicomorphine (Vilan), and dipropanoylmorphine; there is also the latter's dihydromorphine analogue, diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin). Two other 3,6 diesters of morphine invented in 1874–75 along with diamorphine, dibenzoylmorphine and acetylpropionylmorphine, were made as substitutes after it was outlawed in 1925 and, therefore, sold as the first ""designer drugs"" until they were outlawed by the League of Nations in 1930. == Chemistry == Diamorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources, generally using acetic anhydride. The major metabolites of diamorphine, 6-MAM, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide, and morphine-6-glucuronide, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Most commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with these metabolites, as well as with other biotransformation products likely to be present following usage of street-grade diamorphine such as 6-Monoacetylcodeine and codeine. However, chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the diamorphine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opiate-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of these metabolites in his system. Furthermore, some testing procedures employ a hydrolysis step before quantitation that converts many of the metabolic products to morphine, yielding a result that may be 2 times larger than with a method that examines each product individually. == History == The opium poppy was cultivated in lower Mesopotamia as long ago as 3400 BC. The chemical analysis of opium in the 19th century revealed that most of its activity could be ascribed to the alkaloids codeine and morphine. Diamorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by C. R. Alder Wright, an English chemist working at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London who had been experimenting combining morphine with various acids. He boiled anhydrous morphine alkaloid with acetic anhydride for several hours and produced a more potent, acetylated form of morphine which is now called diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate. He sent the compound to F. M. Pierce of Owens College in Manchester for analysis. Pierce told Wright: Doses… were subcutaneously injected into young dogs and rabbit… with the following general results… great prostration, fear, and sleepiness speedily following the administration, the eyes being sensitive, and pupils constrict, considerable salivation being produced in dogs, and a slight tendency to vomiting in some cases, but no actual emesis. Respiration was at first quickened, but subsequently reduced, and the heart's action was diminished and rendered irregular. Marked want of coordinating power over the muscular movements, and loss of power in the pelvis and hind limbs, together with a diminution of temperature in the rectum of about 4°. Wright's invention did not lead to any further developments, and diamorphine became popular only after it was independently re-synthesized 23 years later by chemist Felix Hoffmann. Hoffmann was working at Bayer pharmaceutical company in Elberfeld, Germany, and his supervisor Heinrich Dreser instructed him to acetylate morphine with the objective of producing codeine, a constituent of the opium poppy that is pharmacologically similar to morphine but less potent and less addictive. Instead, the experiment produced an acetylated form of morphine one and a half to two times more potent than morphine itself. Hoffmann synthesized heroin on August 21, 1897, just eleven days after he had synthesized aspirin. The head of Bayer's research department reputedly coined the drug's new name of ""heroin"", based on the German heroisch which means ""heroic, strong"" (from the ancient Greek word ""heros, ήρως""). Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led the commercialization of heroin. Bayer marketed diacetylmorphine as an over-the-counter drug under the trademark name Heroin. It was developed chiefly as a morphine substitute for cough suppressants that did not have morphine's addictive side-effects. Morphine at the time was a popular recreational drug, and Bayer wished to find a similar but non-addictive substitute to market. However, contrary to Bayer's advertising as a ""non-addictive morphine substitute"", heroin would soon have one of the highest rates of addiction among its users. From 1898 through to 1910, diamorphine was marketed under the trademark name Heroin as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough suppressant. In the 11th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (1910), the article on morphine states: ""In the cough of phthisis minute doses [of morphine] are of service, but in this particular disease morphine is frequently better replaced by codeine or by heroin, which checks irritable coughs without the narcotism following upon the administration of morphine."" In the US, the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act was passed in 1914 to control the sale and distribution of diacetylmorphine and other opioids, which allowed the drug to be prescribed and sold for medical purposes. In 1924, the United States Congress banned its sale, importation, or manufacture. It is now a Schedule I substance, which makes it illegal for non-medical use in signatory nations of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty, including the United States. The Health Committee of the League of Nations banned diacetylmorphine in 1925, although it took more than three years for this to be implemented. In the meantime, the first designer drugs, viz. 3,6 diesters and 6 monoesters of morphine and acetylated analogues of closely related drugs like hydromorphone and dihydromorphine, were produced in massive quantities to fill the worldwide demand for diacetylmorphine—this continued until 1930 when the Committee banned diacetylmorphine analogues with no therapeutic advantage over drugs already in use, the first major legislation of this type. Bayer lost some of its trademark rights to heroin (as well as aspirin) under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles following the German defeat in World War I. Use of heroin by jazz musicians in particular was prevalent in the mid-twentieth century, including Billie Holiday, saxophonists Charlie Parker and Art Pepper, trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker, guitarist Joe Pass and piano player/singer Ray Charles; a ""staggering number of jazz musicians were addicts"". It was also a problem with many rock musicians, particularly from the late 1960s through the 1990s. Pete Doherty is also a self-confessed user of heroin. Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain's heroin addiction was well documented. Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo turned to heroin while touring during the 1990s to cope with his back pain. James Taylor, Taylor Hawkins, Jimmy Page, John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Johnny Winter, Keith Richards, Shaun Ryder, Shane MacGowan and Janis Joplin also used heroin. Many musicians have made songs referencing their heroin usage. == Society and culture == === Names === ""Diamorphine"" is the Recommended International Nonproprietary Name and British Approved Name. Other synonyms for heroin include: diacetylmorphine, and morphine diacetate. Heroin is also known by many street names including dope, H, smack, junk, horse, skag, brown, and unga, among others. === Legal status === ==== Asia ==== In Hong Kong, diamorphine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It is available by prescription. Anyone supplying diamorphine without a valid prescription can be fined $5,000,000 (HKD) and imprisoned for life. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing diamorphine is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of diamorphine without a license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and 7 years of jail time. ==== Europe ==== In the Netherlands, diamorphine is a List I drug of the Opium Law. It is available for prescription under tight regulation exclusively to long-term addicts for whom methadone maintenance treatment has failed. It cannot be used to treat severe pain or other illnesses. In the United Kingdom, diamorphine is available by prescription, though it is a restricted Class A drug. According to the 50th edition of the British National Formulary (BNF), diamorphine hydrochloride may be used in the treatment of acute pain, myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary oedema, and chronic pain. The treatment of chronic non-malignant pain must be supervised by a specialist. The BNF notes that all opioid analgesics cause dependence and tolerance but that this is ""no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness"". When used in the palliative care of cancer patients, diamorphine is often injected using a syringe driver. In Switzerland, heroin is produced in injectable or tablet form under the name Diaphin by a private company under contract to the Swiss government. Swiss-produced heroin has been imported into Canada with government approval. ==== Australia ==== In Australia, diamorphine is listed as a schedule 9 prohibited substance under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). The state of Western Australia, in its Poisons Act 1964 (Reprint 6: amendments as at 10 Sep 2004), described a schedule 9 drug as: ""Poisons that are drugs of abuse, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except for amounts which may be necessary for educational, experimental or research purposes conducted with the approval of the Governor."" ==== North America ==== In Canada, diamorphine is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Any person seeking or obtaining diamorphine without disclosing authorization 30 days before obtaining another prescription from a practitioner is guilty of an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. Possession of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense and subject to imprisonment for life. In the United States, diamorphine is a Schedule I drug according to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, making it illegal to possess without a DEA license. Possession of more than 100 grams of diamorphine or a mixture containing diamorphine is punishable with a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years of imprisonment in a federal prison. In 2021, the US state of Oregon became the first state to decriminalize the use of heroin after voters passed Ballot Measure 110 in 2020. This measure will allow people with small amounts to avoid arrest. ==== Turkey ==== Turkey maintains strict laws against the use, possession or trafficking of illegal drugs. If convicted under these offences, one could receive a heavy fine or a prison sentence of 4 to 24 years. ==== Misuse of prescription medication ==== Misused prescription medicine, such as opioids, can lead to heroin use and dependence. The number of death from illegal opioid overdose follows the increasing number of death caused by prescription opioid overdoses. Prescription opioids are relatively easy to obtain. This may ultimately lead to heroin injection because heroin is cheaper than prescribed pills. === Economics === ==== Production ==== Diamorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources. One such method of heroin production involves isolation of the water-soluble components of raw opium, including morphine, in a strongly basic aqueous solution, followed by recrystallization of the morphine base by addition of ammonium chloride. The solid morphine base is then filtered out. The morphine base is then reacted with acetic anhydride, which forms heroin. This highly impure brown heroin base may then undergo further purification steps, which produces a white-colored product; the final products have a different appearance depending on purity and have different names. Heroin purity has been classified into four grades. No.4 is the purest form – white powder (salt) to be easily dissolved and injected. No.3 is ""brown sugar"" for smoking (base). No.1 and No.2 are unprocessed raw heroin (salt or base). ==== Trafficking ==== Traffic is heavy worldwide, with the biggest producer being Afghanistan. According to a U.N. sponsored survey, in 2004, Afghanistan accounted for production of 87 percent of the world's diamorphine. Afghan opium kills around 100,000 people annually. In 2003 The Independent reported: The cultivation of opium [in Afghanistan] reached its peak in 1999, when 350 square miles (910 km2) of poppies were sown ... The following year the Taliban banned poppy cultivation, ... a move which cut production by 94 percent ... By 2001 only 30 square miles (78 km2) of land were in use for growing opium poppies. A year later, after American and British troops had removed the Taliban and installed the interim government, the land under cultivation leapt back to 285 square miles (740 km2), with Afghanistan supplanting Burma to become the world's largest opium producer once more. Opium production in that country has increased rapidly since, reaching an all-time high in 2006. War in Afghanistan once again appeared as a facilitator of the trade. Some 3.3 million Afghans are involved in producing opium. At present, opium poppies are mostly grown in Afghanistan (224,000 hectares (550,000 acres)), and in Southeast Asia, especially in the region known as the Golden Triangle straddling Burma (57,600 hectares (142,000 acres)), Thailand, Vietnam, Laos (6,200 hectares (15,000 acres)) and Yunnan province in China. There is also cultivation of opium poppies in Pakistan (493 hectares (1,220 acres)), Mexico (12,000 hectares (30,000 acres)) and in Colombia (378 hectares (930 acres)). According to the DEA, the majority of the heroin consumed in the United States comes from Mexico (50%) and Colombia (43–45%) via Mexican criminal cartels such as Sinaloa Cartel. However, these statistics may be significantly unreliable, the DEA's 50/50 split between Colombia and Mexico is contradicted by the amount of hectares cultivated in each country and in 2014, the DEA claimed most of the heroin in the US came from Colombia. As of 2015, the Sinaloa Cartel is the most active drug cartel involved in smuggling illicit drugs such as heroin into the United States and trafficking them throughout the United States. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 90% of the heroin seized in Canada (where the origin was known) came from Afghanistan. Pakistan is the destination and transit point for 40 percent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan, other destinations of Afghan opiates are Russia, Europe and Iran. A conviction for trafficking heroin carries the death penalty in most Southeast Asian, some East Asian and Middle Eastern countries (see Use of death penalty worldwide for details), among which Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are the strictest. The penalty applies even to citizens of countries where the penalty is not in place, sometimes causing controversy when foreign visitors are arrested for trafficking, for example, the arrest of nine Australians in Bali, the death sentence given to Nola Blake in Thailand in 1987, or the hanging of an Australian citizen Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore. ==== Trafficking history ==== The origins of the present international illegal heroin trade can be traced back to laws passed in many countries in the early 1900s that closely regulated the production and sale of opium and its derivatives including heroin. At first, heroin flowed from countries where it was still legal into countries where it was no longer legal. By the mid-1920s, heroin production had been made illegal in many parts of the world. An illegal trade developed at that time between heroin labs in China (mostly in Shanghai and Tianjin) and other nations. The weakness of the government in China and conditions of civil war enabled heroin production to take root there. Chinese triad gangs eventually came to play a major role in the illicit heroin trade. The French Connection route started in the 1930s. Heroin trafficking was virtually eliminated in the US during World War II because of temporary trade disruptions caused by the war. Japan's war with China had cut the normal distribution routes for heroin and the war had generally disrupted the movement of opium. After World War II, the Mafia took advantage of the weakness of the postwar Italian government and set up heroin labs in Sicily which was located along the historic route opium took westward into Europe and the United States. Large-scale international heroin production effectively ended in China with the victory of the communists in the civil war in the late 1940s. The elimination of Chinese production happened at the same time that Sicily's role in the trade developed. Although it remained legal in some countries until after World War II, health risks, addiction, and widespread recreational use led most western countries to declare heroin a controlled substance by the latter half of the 20th century. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the CIA supported anti-Communist Chinese Nationalists settled near the Sino-Burmese border and Hmong tribesmen in Laos. This helped the development of the Golden Triangle opium production region, which supplied about one-third of heroin consumed in the US after the 1973 American withdrawal from Vietnam. In 1999, Burma, the heartland of the Golden Triangle, was the second-largest producer of heroin, after Afghanistan. The Soviet-Afghan war led to increased production in the Pakistani-Afghan border regions, as US-backed mujaheddin militants raised money for arms from selling opium, contributing heavily to the modern Golden Crescent creation. By 1980, 60 percent of the heroin sold in the US originated in Afghanistan. It increased international production of heroin at lower prices in the 1980s. The trade shifted away from Sicily in the late 1970s as various criminal organizations violently fought with each other over the trade. The fighting also led to a stepped-up government law enforcement presence in Sicily. Following the discovery at a Jordanian airport of a toner cartridge that had been modified into an improvised explosive device, the resultant increased level of airfreight scrutiny led to a major shortage (drought) of heroin from October 2010 until April 2011. This was reported in most of mainland Europe and the UK which led to a price increase of approximately 30 percent in the cost of street heroin and increased demand for diverted methadone. The number of addicts seeking treatment also increased significantly during this period. Other heroin droughts (shortages) have been attributed to cartels restricting supply in order to force a price increase and also to a fungus that attacked the opium crop of 2009. Many people thought that the American government had introduced pathogens into the Afghanistan atmosphere in order to destroy the opium crop and thus starve insurgents of income. On 13 March 2012, Haji Bagcho, with ties to the Taliban, was convicted by a US District Court of conspiracy, distribution of heroin for importation into the United States and narco-terrorism. Based on heroin production statistics compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2006, Bagcho's activities accounted for approximately 20 percent of the world's total production for that year. ==== Street price ==== The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports that the retail price of brown heroin varies from €14.5 per gram in Turkey to €110 per gram in Sweden, with most European countries reporting typical prices of €35–40 per gram. The price of white heroin is reported only by a few European countries and ranged between €27 and €110 per gram. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime claims in its 2008 World Drug Report that typical US retail prices are US$172 per gram. == Research == Researchers are attempting to reproduce the biosynthetic pathway that produces morphine in genetically engineered yeast. In June 2015 the S-reticuline could be produced from sugar and R-reticuline could be converted to morphine, but the intermediate reaction could not be performed. == See also == == References == == External links == NIDA InfoFacts on Heroin ONDCP Drug Facts Archived 8 February 2011 at the Wayback Machine U.S. National Library of Medicine: Drug Information Portal – Heroin BBC Article entitled 'When Heroin Was Legal'.

The cells were treated for 4 days with glafenine hydrochloride (10 microM, 50 microM, 100 microM). Half of the treated groups were incubated again with glafenine hydrochloride, the other half received medium free of glafenine hydrochloride every 4 days until day 20. The growth kinetics and clonogenic activity were assessed. Cell cycle distribution was investigated by FACS, migratory ability was evaluated, and effects on extracellular matrix synthesis were assessed by immunofluorescence. Glafenine hydrochloride inhibited the proliferation and clonogenic activity of haSMCs and ECs in a dose-dependent manner. A block in the G2/M phase and a reduction in the G1 phase occurred. The migratory ability of haSMCs was impaired in a dose-dependent manner and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin was reduced.

The intestinal epithelial membrane transport of the flavonoids were examined using the monolayer of the human Caco-2 cell line grown in Transwells, a common model of intestinal absorption. The flavonoids were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with UV detector. The efflux of morin, IRR and DXG, across Caco-2 cell monolayers was examined over the concentration range from 2 to 200 microM and showed a saturable process. The depletion of the cellular ATP stores with 5 mM iodoacetamide led to a significant inhibition of the efflux. Fifty micromolar verapamil, a chemical inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, had no effect on the transport of the three flavonoids, while the presence of 50 microM MK-571 and 1 mM probenecid, MRP inhibitors, resulted in an obvious reduction in the efflux. Moreover, inhibition of morin transport by MK-571 demonstrated concentration dependence. The transportation of the three flavonoids was compared with apigenin.

4166,"('Doxylamine succinate', 'Decapryn', 'Doxylamine (succinate)', 'Doxylamine succinate salt', 'Gittalun')",Medical,"Doxylamine is an antihistamine medication used to treat insomnia and allergies, and—in combination with pyridoxine (vitamin B6)—to treat morning sickness in pregnant women. It is available over-the-counter and is typically sold under such brand names as Equate or Unisom, among others; and it is used in nighttime cold medicines (e.g., NyQuil) and pain medications containing acetaminophen and/or codeine to help with sleep. The medication is delivered chemically by the salt doxylamine succinate and is taken by mouth. Doxylamine and other first-generation antihistamines are the most widely used sleep medications in the world. Typical side effects of doxylamine (at recommended doses) include dizziness, drowsiness, grogginess, and dry mouth, among others. As an antihistamine, doxylamine is an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. As a first-generation antihistamine, it typically crosses the blood–brain barrier into the brain, thereby producing a suite of sedative and hypnotic effects that are mediated by the central nervous system. (N.b.: An agonist is a molecule that activates certain receptors (i.e., specific cellular proteins) in a cell to produce a specific pharmacological response, causing the cell to modify its activity—while an inverse agonist targets the same receptors as those of a given agonist, but causes a response opposite to that caused by the agonist. An antagonist blocks the action of a given agonist.) Doxylamine is also a potent anticholinergic, meaning that it causes delirum at high doses—i.e., at much higher doses than recommended. (Specifically it is an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 through M5.) These sedative and deliriant effects have in some cases led to using the drug recreationally. Doxylamine was first described in 1948 or 1949. == Medical uses == Doxylamine is an antihistamine used to treat sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, hives, skin rash, itching, and other cold or allergy symptoms. It is also used as a short-term treatment for insomnia. === Insomnia === The first-generation sedating antihistamines diphenhydramine, doxepin, doxylamine, and pyrilamine are the most widely used medications in the world for preventing and treating insomnia. As of 2004, doxylamine and diphenhydramine, which are both over-the-counter medications, were the agents most commonly used to treat short-term insomnia. As of 2008 and 2017, over-the-counter antihistamines were not recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for treatment of chronic insomnia ""due to the relative lack of efficacy and safety data"". Neither version of their guidelines explicitly included or mentioned doxylamine, although diphenhydramine was discussed. A 2015 systematic review of over-the-counter sleep aids including doxylamine found little evidence to inform the use of doxylamine for treatment of insomnia. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found that doxylamine had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.47 (95% CITooltip confidence interval 0.06 to 0.89). The certainty of evidence was rated as moderate. No data were available for doxylamine in terms of longer-term treatment (3 months). For comparison, the other sedating medicines assessed, doxepin and trimipramine (both of which are tricyclic antidepressants) had effect sizes (SMD) at 4 weeks of 0.30 (95% CI –0.05 to 0.64) (very low certainty evidence) and 0.55 (95% CI –0.11 to 1.21) (very low certainty evidence), respectively. Doses of doxylamine that have been used for sleep range from 5 to 50 mg, with 25 mg being the typical dose. === Morning sickness === Doxylamine is used in the combination drug pyridoxine/doxylamine to treat morning sickness (nausea and vomiting of pregnancy). It is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of morning sickness. === Available forms === Doxylamine is used medically as doxylamine succinate, the succinate salt of doxylamine, and is available both alone (brand names Decapryn, Doxy-Sleep-Aid, Unisom) and in combination with pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) (brand names Bendectin, Bonjesta, Diclegis). Doxylamine is available alone as immediate-release oral tablets containing 25 mg doxylamine succinate. Oral tablets containing 12.5 mg doxylamine succinate as well as oral capsules containing 25 mg doxylamine succinate were also previously available but were discontinued. The combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is available in the form of extended- and delayed-release oral tablets containing 10 to 20 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 to 20 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride. Doxylamine alone is available over-the-counter, whereas doxylamine in combination with pyridoxine is a prescription-only medication. Doxylamine is also available in over-the-counter nighttime cold medicine products such as NyQuil Cold & Flu (contains acetaminophen, doxylamine succinate 6.25 to 12.5 mg, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide), where it serves as the sedating component. == Contraindications == The fetal safety rating of doxylamine is ""A"" (no evidence of risk). == Side effects == Side effects of doxylamine include dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth, among others. Doxylamine is a potent anticholinergic and has a side-effect profile common to such drugs, including blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, muscle incoordination, urinary retention, mental confusion, and delirium. Because of its relatively long elimination half-life (10–12 hours), doxylamine is associated with next-day effects including sedation, drowsiness, grogginess, dry mouth, and tiredness when used as a hypnotic. This may be described as a ""hangover effect"". The shorter elimination half-life of diphenhydramine (4–8 hours) compared to doxylamine may give it an advantage over doxylamine as a sleep aid in this regard. Antihistamines like doxylamine are sedating initially but tolerance occurs with repeated use and can result in rebound insomnia upon discontinuation. Occasional case reports of coma and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with doxylamine. This is in contrast to diphenhydramine. Studies of doxylamine's carcinogenicity in mice and rats have produced positive results for both liver and thyroid cancer, especially in the mouse. The carcinogenicity of the drug in humans is not well-studied, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer lists the drug as ""not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"". Continuous and/or cumulative use of anticholinergic medications, including first-generation antihistamines, is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people. == Overdose == Doxylamine is generally safe for administration to healthy adults. Doses of doxylamine of up to 1,600 mg/day for 6 months have been given to adults with schizophrenia, with little toxicity encountered. The median lethal dose (LD50) is estimated to be 50–500 mg/kg in humans. Symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth, dilated pupils, insomnia, night terrors, euphoria, hallucinations, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and death. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose. These have been characterized by coma, tonic-clonic (or grand mal) seizures and cardiopulmonary arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiopulmonary arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3-year-old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. Rarely, an overdose results in rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Doxylamine acts primarily as an antagonist or inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative properties. To a lesser extent, doxylamine acts as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, an action responsible for its anticholinergic and (at high doses) deliriant effects. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of doxylamine is 24.7% for oral administration and 70.8% for intranasal administration. The Tmax of doxylamine is 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Its elimination half-life is 10 to 12 hours (range 7 to 15 hours). Doxylamine is metabolized in the liver primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9. The main metabolites are N-desmethyldoxylamine, N,N-didesmethyldoxylamine, and doxylamine N-oxide. Doxylamine is eliminated 60% in the urine and 40% in feces. == Chemistry == Doxylamine is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistamines. Other antihistamines from this group include bromodiphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, orphenadrine, and phenyltoloxamine. == History == Doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine and was discovered by Nathan Sperber and colleagues and was first reported in 1948 or 1949. It has been the antihistamine component of NyQuil since 1966. Bendectin, a combination of doxylamine, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and dicyclomine (an anticholinergic antispasmodic agent), was marketed for treatment of morning sickness in 1956. This product was reformulated in 1976 to remove dicyclomine. The reformulated product was voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer in the United States in 1983 due to concerns about an alleged association with congenital limb defects. However, these concerns have not been supported by studies. In 2013, doxylamine/pyridoxine was reintroduced in the United States under the brand name Diclegis. The combination was not removed from the market in Canada, where it had been marketed since 1979. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Doxylamine is primarily used as the succinic acid salt, doxylamine succinate. It is the sedating ingredient of NyQuil (generally in combination with dextromethorphan and acetaminophen). In Commonwealth countries, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, doxylamine is available prepared with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and codeine under the brand name Dolased, Propain Plus, Syndol, or Mersyndol, as treatment for tension headache and other types of pain. Doxylamine succinate is used in general over-the-counter sleep-aids branded as Somnil (South Africa), Dozile, Donormyl, Lidène (France, Russian Federation), Dormidina (Spain, Portugal), Restavit, Unisom-2, Sominar (Thailand), Sleep Aid (generic, Australia) and Dorminox (Poland).

Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) are the ingredients of Diclegis, approved by the FDA in April 2013 becoming the only drug approved for morning sickness with a class A safety rating for pregnancy (no evidence of risk). In Canada: Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) are the ingredients of Diclectin, which is used to prevent morning sickness. It is also available in combination with vitamin B6 and folic acid under the brand name Evanorm (marketed by Ion Healthcare). In India Doxylamine preparations are available typically in combination with pyridoxine which may also contain folic acid. Doxylamine usage is thus restricted for pregnant women. == References ==",Doxylamine succinate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.775113539944869e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00117649941239506)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxylamine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Doxylamine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxylamine?utm_source=openai')])"
4167,"('Desipramine hydrochloride', 'Norpramin', 'Desipramine hcl', 'Pertofrane', 'Pertofran')",Medical,"Desipramine, sold under the brand name Norpramin among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used in the treatment of depression. It acts as a relatively selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, though it does also have other activities such as weak serotonin reuptake inhibitory, α1-blocking, antihistamine, and anticholinergic effects. The drug is not considered a first-line treatment for depression since the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, which have fewer side effects and are safer in overdose. == Medical uses == Desipramine is primarily used for the treatment of depression. It may also be useful to treat symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence of benefit is only in the short term, and with concerns of side effects its overall usefulness is not clear. Desipramine at very low doses is also used to help reduce the pain associated with functional dyspepsia. It has also been tried, albeit with little evidence of effectiveness, in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Evidence for usefulness in neuropathic pain is also poor. == Side effects == Desipramine tends to be less sedating than other TCAs and tends to produce fewer anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive or memory impairments. == Overdose == Desipramine is particularly toxic in cases of overdose, compared to other antidepressants. Any overdose or suspected overdose of desipramine is considered to be a medical emergency and can result in death without prompt medical intervention. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Desipramine is a very potent and relatively selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), which is thought to enhance noradrenergic neurotransmission. Based on one study, it has the highest affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) of any other TCA, and is said to be the most noradrenergic and the most selective for the NET of the TCAs. The observed effectiveness of desipramine in the treatment of ADHD was the basis for the development of the selective NRI atomoxetine and its use in ADHD. Desipramine has the weakest antihistamine and anticholinergic effects of the TCAs. It tends to be slightly activating/stimulating rather than sedating, unlike most others TCAs. Whereas other TCAs are useful for treating insomnia, desipramine can cause insomnia as a side effect due to its activating properties. The drug is also not associated with weight gain, in contrast to many other TCAs. Secondary amine TCAs like desipramine and nortriptyline have a lower risk of orthostatic hypotension than other TCAs, although desipramine can still cause moderate orthostatic hypotension. === Pharmacokinetics === Desipramine is the major metabolite of imipramine and lofepramine. == Chemistry == Desipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine (N-methyldesipramine), clomipramine, trimipramine, and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Desipramine is a secondary amine TCA, with its N-methylated parent imipramine being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine TCAs include nortriptyline and protriptyline. The chemical name of desipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C18H22N2 with a molecular weight of 266.381 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the dibudinate salt is or has been used for intramuscular injection in Argentina (brand name Nebril) and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-47-5, of the hydrochloride is 58-28-6, and of the dibudinate is 62265-06-9. == History == Desipramine was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1959 and was patented in 1962. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963 or 1964. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Desipramine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while desipramine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in French and its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française are désipramine, in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are desipramina, in German is desipramin, and in Latin is desipraminum. === Brand names === Desipramine is or has been marketed throughout the world under a variety of brand names, including Irene, Nebril, Norpramin, Pertofran, Pertofrane, Pertrofran, and Petylyl among others. == References == == External links == Desipramine - MedlinePlus",Pertofran,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0042783161625266075), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011671826243400574)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -3.7697225252486533e-06)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/pertofrane?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=114, start_index=9, title='Pertofrane | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/pertofrane?utm_source=openai')])"

The method utilizes an ion-pairing agent and a simple two-step gradient for the separation of ramipril and ten related substances from each other in a 40-min run time. Four of the related substances are ramipril diastereomers. To the best of our knowledge, no method described previously in the literature has demonstrated resolution of ramipril from this set of related substances. No method for the determination of the related substances of ramipril is currently described in the United States Pharmacopoeia or the European Pharmacopoeia. The proposed method was validated with respect to accuracy, precision, linearity, and specificity. Also, the method was determined to be robust with regards to the following parameters: mobile phase apparent pH: mobile phase organic content: mobile phase perchlorate concentration; detection wavelength and time dependence of sample and standard stability. A postmarketing surveillance study was undertaken to confirm the efficacy and safety of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril and to extend the findings of controlled clinical trials into real-world conditions. A total of 11,100 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension treated by primary care physicians were enrolled in this 8-week, open-label study. Ramipril was usually initiated at a dosage of 2.5 mg once daily and titrated to achieve target blood pressure. Efficacy was assessed in 8261 patients for whom blood pressure data were recorded after the start of treatment: safety was assessed in all patients. Of patients with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension, 86.0% achieved a final diastolic blood pressure of < or = 90 mm Hg or a > or = 10 mm Hg decrease from baseline; the highest response was seen in elderly patients (87.2%), and the lowest response was seen in black patients (81.2%).

It is also used to prevent cytomegalovirus following a kidney transplant in high risk cases. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache and vomiting. Severe side effects may include kidney problems. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is a prodrug, which works after being converted to aciclovir in a person's body. Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 113th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valaciclovir is used for the treatment of HSV and VZV infections, including: Oral and genital herpes simplex (treatment and prevention) Reduction of HSV transmission from people with recurrent infection to uninfected individuals Herpes zoster (shingles): the typical dosage for treatment of herpes is 1,000 mg orally three times a day for seven consecutive days. Prevention of cytomegalovirus following organ transplantation Prevention of herpesviruses in immunocompromised people (such as those undergoing cancer chemotherapy) Chickenpox in children (ages 2–18) It has shown promise as a treatment for infectious mononucleosis and is preventively administered in suspected cases of herpes B virus exposure. Bell's palsy does not seem to benefit from using valaciclovir as its only treatment. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) associated with valaciclovir are the same as for aciclovir, its active metabolite. They include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include: agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, edema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, weakness and/or renal impairment. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include: coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, tremor, ataxia, encephalopathy, psychotic symptoms, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or anaphylaxis. == Pharmacology == Valaciclovir is a prodrug, an esterified version of aciclovir that has greater oral bioavailability (about 55%) than aciclovir. It is converted by esterases to the active drug, aciclovir, and the amino acid valine via hepatic first-pass metabolism. Aciclovir is selectively converted into a monophosphate form by viral thymidine kinase, which is more effective (3000 times) in phosphorylation of aciclovir than cellular thymidine kinase. Subsequently, the monophosphate form is further phosphorylated into a disphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and then into the active triphosphate form, aciclo-GTP, by cellular kinases. === Mechanism of action === Aciclo-GTP, the active triphosphate metabolite of aciclovir, is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA replication. Aciclo-GTP competitively inhibits and inactivates the viral DNA polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. It has also been shown that the viral enzymes cannot remove aciclo-GMP from the chain, which results in inhibition of further activity of DNA polymerase. Aciclo-GTP is fairly rapidly metabolized within the cell, possibly by cellular phosphatases. Aciclovir is active against most species in the herpesvirus family. In descending order of activity: Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) Varicella zoster virus (VZV) Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) The drug is predominantly active against HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. It is only of limited efficacy against EBV and CMV. However, valaciclovir has been shown to lower or eliminate the presence of the Epstein–Barr virus in subjects afflicted with acute mononucleosis, leading to a significant decrease in the severity of symptoms. Valaciclovir and acyclovir act by inhibiting viral DNA replication, but as of 2016 there was little evidence that they are effective against Epstein–Barr virus. Acyclovir therapy does prevent viral latency, but has not proven effective at eradicating latent viruses in nerve ganglia. As of 2005, resistance to valaciclovir has not been significant. Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase and mutations to viral thymidine kinase and/or DNA polymerase that alter substrate sensitivity. It also is used for herpes B virus postexposure prophylaxis. == Chemistry == Details of the synthesis of valaciclovir were first published by scientists from the Wellcome Foundation. Aciclovir was esterified with a carboxybenzyl protected valine, using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as the dehydrating agent.

Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic which works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Water is lost as a result of more sodium reaching the collecting ducts. Bendroflumethiazide has a role in the treatment of mild heart failure although loop diuretics are better for reducing overload. The main use of bendroflumethiazide currently is in hypertension (part of the effect is due to vasodilation).

It is advised that those using this diuretic should abstain from alcohol consumption during use, as it is possible to experience a sudden drop in blood pressure, especially if standing up (an effect known as orthostatic hypotension). === Other considerations === Bendroflumethiazide should not be used by pregnant women, or women who have just given birth. Due to the nature of the medication, it is possible for it to pass into the breast milk and consequently to the child. It is also known that bendroflumethiazide suppresses the production of breast milk. Pregnant or lactating women with hypertension may need to discuss with their prescriber as to which alternative treatment may be more suitable.

4174,"('Neoprofen', 'Ibuprofen lysinate', 'Solufenum', 'Soluphene', 'Saren')",Medical," Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) affects approximately 31% of infants whose birth weight is between 501 and 1500 g. The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that allows blood to bypass the pulmonary vasculature in utero. Oxygen delivery and elimination of prostaglandins are essential for the closure of the ductus after birth. For years, indomethacin has been the drug of choice for the treatment of PDA in the USA. Undesirable adverse effects prompted researchers to seek alternative agents. In April 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ibuprofen lysine (NeoProfen) for closure of clinically significant PDA in premature neonates. Ibuprofen's mechanism of action for closure of PDA is believed to be through the inhibition of prostaglandins. Clinical studies have shown ibuprofen to be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects. NeoProfen or sterile ibuprofen L-lysine at 10 mg/mL ibuprofen, in 2 mL single-use Type I glass vials is often a first choice medication used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in neonatal patients from 500 to 1500 g body weight. Visible particulate matter was found in vials that were placed on a commercial stability program prior to the approved expiration date of 2 years. A combination of instrumental techniques including inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, and Raman and Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy was used to evaluate stability, pilot batch and packaging samples in a root cause investigation. The particulate matter was shown to consist largely of ibuprofen aluminum salts of various stoichiometries. It developed over time by a substitution mechanism, in which the ibuprofen anion in solution reacts with the aluminum oxide network of the borosilicate glass giving the ibuprofen aluminum salt with =Al-OH remaining in the network. For corrective action an alternate Type I borosilicate glass vial with interior coating, not found in the original vial, was chosen for the product to prevent this occurrence. NeoProfen (sterile preservative-free ibuprofin L-lysine at 17 mg/mL in a single-use glass vial) is used to close a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants no more than 32 weeks gestational age. The neonatal population is especially sensitive to outside chemical, physical and environmental conditions because of incompletely developed organ systems, low birth weight and other underlying conditions. Two batches of this product were voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer, Lundbeck, and investigated for the source of particulate matter observed during a commercial stability testing program. This was found to result from an interaction between the product and the Type I borosilicate glass vial where ibuprofen substitutes for the aluminum oxide network in the glass, forming an ibuprofen aluminum hydroxide salt as particulate. In order to prevent this salt formation an alternate glass vial was chosen which had interiors treated using a chemical vapor deposition technique. These vials were found to preserve NeoProfen quality properties during short term stress and medium term stability studies. 3,3-Dimethylcyclopentanes (neopentylenes) are ubiquitous in Nature but largely absent from synthetic pharmaceutical libraries.

After a four-week placebo run-in period, 235 patients received either cilazapril or placebo for four weeks. At the end of the treatment period, significant decreases from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure were seen in all four groups (mean decreases of 3.3 mm Hg with placebo and 6.4, 9.2 and 8.3 mm Hg with 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg cilazapril, respectively). The cilazapril groups had significantly greater blood pressure reductions than did the placebo group (p less than or equal to 0.02). The 5.0 mg cilazapril dose was significantly more effective than the 2.5 mg dose (p less than 0.03). The response rate was notably greater in the cilazapril treatment groups than in the placebo group (placebo, 27.5%; 2.5 mg cilazapril, 42.9%; 5.0 mg cilazapril 62.5%; 10.0 mg cilazapril, 50.0%).

4178,"('Everolimus (rad001)',)",Medical," Everolimus (RAD001), a mTOR inhibitor, was initially used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplant patients; however, it also has significant antineoplastic properties. In patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex who are not candidates for surgery, single-agent everolimus has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce SEGA volume with good tolerability. In the Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, everolimus was associated with a SEGA response rate of 35% compared with 0% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in clinical trials were stomatitis/mouth ulceration and upper respiratory tract infections, and most adverse events were grade 1 or 2; grade 4 events were rare. Historically, there have been few treatment options for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) besides immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon (IFN)-alpha. Targeted therapies have improved clinical outcomes over the past several years. These include the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib, which inhibit angiogenic signaling in endothelial cells and vascular pericytes predominantly through VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta. Also included is the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab used in combination with IFN-alpha. These agents mediate their antitumor effects by interfering with the VEGF signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis and causing tumor shrinkage. However, ultimately, most patients develop resistance and experience disease progression during VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapy, and until the recent approval of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus (RAD001), there were no agents available with proven activity in this setting. This review describes the clinical development of everolimus in advanced RCC and the rationale for the use of mTOR inhibitors after failure of VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors. The recent introduction of drugs that inhibit angiogenesis or the mTOR has provided new options for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a disease which often has a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy and cytokine therapy are largely ineffective. The 5-year survival rate is under 10%. Everolimus, an immunosuppressive drug widely used for the prevention of allograft rejection and an mTOR inhibitor, is one of the latest drugs undergoing clinical trials in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

4179,"('Levamisole hydrochloride', 'Levamisole hcl', 'Ergamisol', '(s)-6-phenyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydroimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole hydrochloride', 'Tetramisole hydrochloride')",Medical,"Levamisole, sold under the brand name Ergamisol among others, is a medication used to treat parasitic worm infections, specifically ascariasis and hookworm infections. It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding or the third trimester of pregnancy. Serious side effects may include an increased risk of infection. It belongs to the anthelmintic class of medications. Levamisole was invented in 1966 in Belgium by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Levamisole is also used as a dewormer for cattle. == Medical uses == === Worms === Levamisole was originally used as an anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis. Levamisole has gained prominence among aquarists as an effective treatment for Camallanus roundworm infestations in freshwater tropical fish. Levamisole has been used to treat small ruminant animals since the late 1960s. Levamisole-resistant parasitic worms are common in sheep farms in New Zealand, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil. === Other === Levamisole has been used to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions, including skin infections, leprosy, warts, lichen planus, and aphthous ulcers. An interesting side effect these reviewers reported in passing was ""neurologic excitement"". Later papers, from the Janssen group and others, indicate levamisole and its enantiomer, dexamisole, have some mood-elevating or antidepressant properties, although this was never a marketed use of the drug. == Adverse effects == One of the more serious side effects of levamisole is agranulocytosis, or the depletion of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08–5% of the studied populations. It has been used as an adulterant in cocaine, resulting in serious side effects that present as levamisole induced necrosis syndrome, in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin. == Metabolism == Levamisole is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Its time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5–2 hours. The plasma elimination half-life is fairly quick at 3–4 hours which can contribute to not detecting levamisole intoxication. The metabolite half-life is 16 hours. Levamisole's excretion is primarily through the kidneys, with about 70% being excreted over 3 days. Only about 5% is excreted as unchanged levamisole. Drug testing of racehorse urine has led to the revelation that among levamisole equine metabolites are both pemoline and aminorex, stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities. Further testing confirmed aminorex in human and canine urine, meaning that both humans and dogs also metabolize levamisole into aminorex, though it is unclear whether plasma aminorex is present at any appreciable level. Blood samples following oral administration of levamisole out to 172 hr post-dose did not demonstrate any plasma aminorex levels above that of the limit of quantification (LoQ). Additionally, in cocaine-positive plasma samples, of which 42% contained levamisole, aminorex was never reported at concentrations higher than LoQ. == Detection in body fluids == Levamisole may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths involving adulterated street drugs. About 3% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans. A post mortem blood levamisole concentration of 2.2 mg/L was present in a woman who died of a cocaine overdose. == Adulterant in illegal drugs == Levamisole has increasingly been used as a cutting agent in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the United States. In 2008–2009, levamisole was found in 69% of cocaine samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). By April 2011, the DEA reported the adulterant was found in 82% of seizures. Levamisole adds bulk and weight to powdered cocaine (whereas other adulterants produce smaller ""rocks"" of cocaine) and makes the drug appear purer. In a series of investigative articles for The Stranger, Brendan Kiley details other rationales for levamisole's rise as an adulterant: possible stimulant effects, a similar appearance to cocaine, and an ability to pass street purity tests. Levamisole suppresses the production of white blood cells, resulting in neutropenia and agranulocytosis. With the increasing use of levamisole as an adulterant, a number of these complications have been reported among cocaine users. Levamisole has also been linked to a risk of vasculitis, and two cases of vasculitic skin necrosis have been reported in users of cocaine adulterated with levamisole. Levamisole-tainted cocaine has caused three deaths and sickened over 100 in US and Canada, as of 2009. == Chemistry == The original synthesis at Janssen Pharmaceutica resulted in the preparation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, whose hydrochloride salt was reported to have a melting point of 264–265 °C; the free base of the racemate has a melting point of 87–89 °C. The racemic mixture is referred to as ""tetramisole"" - levamisole refers only to the levorotatory enantiomer of tetramisole. == Toxicity == The LD50 (intravenous, mouse) is 22 mg/kg. == Laboratory use == Levamisole reversibly and uncompetitively inhibits most isoforms of alkaline phosphatase (e.g., human liver, bone, kidney, and spleen) except the intestinal and placental isoform. It is thus used as an inhibitor along with substrate to reduce background alkaline phosphatase activity in biomedical assays involving detection signal amplification by intestinal alkaline phosphatase, for example in in situ hybridization or Western blot protocols. It is used to immobilize the nematode C. elegans on glass slides for imaging and dissection. In a C. elegans behavioral assay, analyzing the time course of paralysis provides information about the neuromuscular junction. Levamisole acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist, which leads to muscle contraction. Continuing activation leads to paralysis. The time course of paralysis provides information about the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. For example, mutants with fewer acetylcholine receptors may paralyze slower than wild type. == Research == It has been studied as a method to stimulate the immune system as part of the treatment of cancer. It has also shown some efficacy in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children. After being pulled from the market in the US and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, levamisole has been tested in combination with fluorouracil to treat colon cancer. Evidence from clinical trials support its addition to fluorouracil therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect. == Veterinary uses == The combination doramectin/levamisole, sold under the brand name Valcor, is indicated for the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, grubs, sucking lice, and mange mites in cattle.

4181,"('Ifosfamide', 'Isophosphamide', 'Iphosphamide', 'Isofosfamide', 'Ifosfamid')",Medical,"Ifosfamide, sold under the brand name Ifex among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes testicular cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, bladder cancer, small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer. It is administered by injection into a vein. Common side effects include hair loss, vomiting, blood in the urine, infections, and kidney problems. Other severe side effects include bone marrow suppression and decreased level of consciousness. Use during pregnancy will likely result in harm to the baby. Ifosfamide is in the alkylating agent and nitrogen mustard family of medications. It works by disrupting the duplication of DNA and the creation of RNA. Ifosfamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == It is given as a treatment for a variety of cancers, including: Testicular cancer Breast cancer Lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) Soft tissue sarcoma Osteosarcoma or bone tumor Lung cancer Cervical cancer Ovarian cancer === Administration === It is a white powder which, when prepared for use in chemotherapy, becomes a clear, colorless fluid. The delivery is intravenous. Ifosfamide is often used in conjunction with mesna to avoid internal bleeding in the patient, in particular hemorrhagic cystitis. Ifosfamide is given quickly, and in some cases can be given as quickly as an hour. == Mechanism of action == Ifosfamide is a DNA-damaging alkylating agent, belonging to the same class of chemotherapy drugs as cyclophosphamide. It is a prodrug, meaning that It has to be converted by CYP450 into its main active metabolites-(Iso)phosphoramide mustards. These metabolites form DNA cross links mainly at Guanine N-7 positions. == Side effects == Hemorrhagic cystitis is rare when ifosfamide is given with mesna. A common and dose-limiting side effect is encephalopathy (brain dysfunction). It occurs in some form in up to 50% of people receiving the agent. The reaction is probably mediated by chloroacetaldehyde, one of the breakdown products of the ifosfamide molecule, which has chemical properties similar to acetaldehyde and chloral hydrate. The symptoms of ifosfamide encephalopathy can range from mild (difficulty concentrating, fatigue), to moderate (delirium, psychosis), to severe (nonconvulsive status epilepticus or coma). In children, this can interfere with neurological development. Apart from the brain, ifosfamide can also affect peripheral nerves. The severity of the reaction can be classified according to either the National Cancer Institute or the Meanwell criteria (grade I–IV). Previous brain problems and low levels of albumin in the blood increase the likelihood of ifosfamide encephalopathy. In most cases, the reaction resolves spontaneously within 72 hours. If it develops during an infusion of the drug, discontinuing the infusion is advised. The most effective treatment for severe (grade III–IV) encephalopathy is an intravenous solution of methylene blue, which appears to shorten the duration of encephalopathy; the exact mechanism of action of methylene blue is unclear. In some cases, methylene blue may be used as a prophylaxis before further doses of ifosfamide are administered. Other treatments include albumin and thiamine, and dialysis as a rescue modality.

4182,"('Naftopidil (hydrochloride)', 'Opera_id_518')",Medical," Lower urinary tract symptoms in men, over age of 50 years is suggestive of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). Different alpha-blockers have been evaluated for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia for over last 30 years. This study was conducted in a tertiary care institution during the period of year between June 2011 and August 2013 to compare the effect of naftopidil and tamsulosin in reducing the obstructive and irritable symptoms of BPE. A prospective randomized comparative study was carried on 60 patients of BPE by assigning half of them to treatment with tamsulosin and rest with naftopidil. Pre- and post-treatment uroflowmetry (UFM), post-void residue (PVR), International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS), were obtained at 15 and 30 days after starting treatment. The age of patients ranged from 51 to 78. At base line there was no statistical difference between UFM parameter, PVR and IPSS in the two groups. UFM and PVR showed significantly better response at both intervals with naftopidil. Comparison of IPSS showed better improvement in Group A both at 15 and 30 days. It was seen that the obstructive symptoms showed a significantly better response with tamsulosin and symptoms of irritability was seen better response with naftopidil. It was seen that during the period of follow-up of 30 days naftopidil had a better effect on UFM, PVR, IPSS compared with tamsulosin. In general, obstructive symptoms showed better improvement in tamsulosin and irritative symptoms showed better improvement in naftopidil. To compare the efficacy of two alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor-selective tamsulosin hydrochloride and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor-selective naftopidil, in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Thirty-four patients (mean age 72.4 years, sd 4.3, range 66-79) with LUTS (International Prostate Symptom Score, IPSS >8) secondary to BPH were enrolled in a randomized crossover study. Seventeen patients were initially prescribed naftopidil 50 mg for 4 weeks, followed by tamsulosin 0.2 mg for 4 weeks (group A); another 17 were initially prescribed tamsulosin 0.2 mg, followed by naftopidil 50 mg (group B). Patients changed to the alternative treatment after a 1-week washout period. Efficacy criteria were improvement in LUTS (IPSS), quality of life (QoL), uroflowmetry, and pressure-flow study (PFS) values based on the treatment with each agent. At baseline there were no significant differences between the groups in IPSS, QoL, uroflowmetry values or PFS values, except for the volume at maximum desire to void. After treatment with each agent, the IPSS and QoL were significantly improved and the reduction in bladder outlet obstruction confirmed by PFS. Naftopidil was significantly more effective than tamsulosin in relieving nocturia. The increases from baseline (before treatment) to the endpoint (after treatment with each agent) in the volume at first desire and maximum desire to void were significantly higher with naftopidil than with tamsulosin. Involuntary contractions disappeared in two patients with relief of nocturia with naftopidil, but not with tamsulosin. The decrease in other symptoms of the IPSS, QoL, increase in uroflowmetry values and changes in other PFS values were similar for both agents. The two agents provided similar efficacy in the treatment of LUTS with BPH. However, naftopidil was better than tamsulosin for nocturia. The disappearance of involuntary contraction and the greater increase in first-desire volume with naftopidil may be associated with the relief of nocturia. The alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist is effective in alleviating both voiding and storage symptoms. The alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist may be more effective than the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist in LUTS with BPH.

A total of 66 men, including 20 in group N, 23 in group P and 23 in group NP, were treated and 58 (87.9%) completed the 4 weeks of treatment. IPSS improved significantly in groups N and NP. Urinary frequency improved significantly in groups P and NP. Postvoid residual urine volume increased significantly in groups P and NP. Significant improvements in urgency episodes were noted in each group. One patient in group P required catheterization owing to acute urinary retention and another stopped medication because of difficulty in voiding. These results suggest that each treatment showed effectiveness for male LUTS with OAB.

The method was carried out on a Shimpak C8 column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-triethylamine (pH adjusted to 3.5 using orthophosphoric acid; 0.5%), (35:65, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml min(-1). Detection was carried out at 210 nm. Diphenhydramine was used as internal standard. The validation of the method was also carried out. Two methods are described for the simultaneous determination of theophylline and guaiphenesin in combined pharmaceutical dosage forms. The first method depends on third-derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry, with the zero crossing technique of measurement. Third-derivative amplitudes at 222 and 278 nm were selected for the assay of guaiphenesin and theophylline, respectively. The second method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column using a mobile phase of 0.01 mol dm-3 sodium dihydrogen phosphate-methanol-acetonitrile (8 + 2 + 1) (pH 5.5) with detection at 245 nm. Both methods showed good linearity, precision and reproducibility. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the determination of these drugs in laboratory-prepared mixtures and in capsules or elixir. Pharmacokinetics and some pharmacological effects of anaesthesia induced by a combination of detomidine, ketamine and guaiphenesin were investigated in eight ponies. Cardiopulmonary function was studied and plasma met-enkephalin, dynorphin, beta-endorphin, arginine vasopressin, adrenocorticotrophin, cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol and catecholamine concentrations were measured. The combination produced slight cardiorespiratory depression, hyperglycaemia and a reduction in haematocrit. There were no changes in plasma opioids, pituitary peptides or catecholamines. Plasma cortisol concentration decreased and plasma 11-deoxycortisol increased indicating a suppression of steroidogenesis. Steady state ketamine and guaiphenesin concentrations were attained during the infusion period, and ketamine concentrations likely to provide adequate analgesia for surgical operations were achieved (more than 2.2 micrograms ml-1).

4185,"('Diltiazem hydrochloride', 'Diltiazem hcl', 'Dilzem', 'Cis-diltiazem hydrochloride', 'Dilzene')",Medical,"Diltiazem, sold under the brand name Cardizem among others, is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart arrhythmias. It may also be used in hyperthyroidism if beta blockers cannot be used. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. When given by injection, effects typically begin within a few minutes and last a few hours. Common side effects include swelling, dizziness, headaches, and low blood pressure. Other severe side effects include an overly slow heart beat, heart failure, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. It is unclear if use when breastfeeding is safe. Diltiazem works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of arteries, resulting in them opening and allowing blood to flow more easily. Additionally, it acts on the heart to prolong the period until it can beat again. It does this by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. It is a class IV antiarrhythmic. Diltiazem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 100th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. An extended release formulation is also available. == Medical uses == Diltiazem is indicated for: Stable angina (exercise-induced) – diltiazem increases coronary blood flow and decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, secondary to decreased peripheral resistance, heart rate, and contractility. Variant angina – it is effective owing to its direct effects on coronary dilation. Unstable angina (preinfarction, crescendo) – diltiazem may be particularly effective if the underlying mechanism is vasospasm. Myocardial bridge For supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), diltiazem appears to be as effective as verapamil in treating re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is another indication. The initial bolus should be 0.25 mg/kg, intravenous (IV). Because of its vasodilatory effects, diltiazem is useful for treating hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are well tolerated, and especially effective in treating low-renin hypertension. It is also used as topical application for anal fissures because it promotes healing due to its vasodilatory property. == Contraindications and precautions == In congestive heart failure, patients with reduced ventricular function may not be able to counteract the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of diltiazem, the result being an even higher compromise of function. With SA node or AV conduction disturbances, the use of diltiazem should be avoided in patients with SA or AV nodal abnormalities, because of its negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects. Low blood pressure patients, with systolic blood pressures below 90 mm Hg, should not be treated with diltiazem. Diltiazem may paradoxically increase ventricular rate in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because of accessory conduction pathways. Diltiazem is relatively contraindicated in the presence of sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular node conduction disturbances, bradycardia, impaired left ventricle function, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. == Side effects == A reflex sympathetic response, caused by the peripheral dilation of vessels and the resulting drop in blood pressure, works to counteract the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of diltiazem. Undesirable effects include hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, headaches and edema. Rare side effects are congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hepatotoxicity. == Drug interactions == Because of its inhibition of hepatic cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, there are a number of drug interactions. Some of the more important interactions are listed below. === Beta-blockers === Intravenous diltiazem should be used with caution with beta-blockers because, while the combination is most potent at reducing heart rate, there are rare instances of dysrhythmia and AV node block. === Quinidine === Quinidine should not be used concurrently with calcium channel blockers because of reduced clearance of both drugs and potential pharmacodynamic effects at the SA and AV nodes. === Fentanyl === Concurrent use of fentanyl with diltiazem, or any other CYP3A4 inhibitors, as these medications decrease the breakdown of fentanyl and thus increase its effects. == Mechanism of action == Diltiazem, also known as (2S,3S)-3-acetoxy-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepin-4(5H)-one hydrochlorid has a vasodilating activity attributed to the (2S,3S)-isomer. Diltiazem is a potent vasodilator, increasing blood flow and variably decreasing the heart rate via strong depression of A-V node conduction. It binds to the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels in a fashion somewhat similar to verapamil, another nondihydropyridine (non-DHP) calcium channel blocker. Chemically, it is based upon a 1,4-thiazepine ring, making it a benzothiazepine-type calcium channel blocker. It is a potent and mild vasodilator of coronary and peripheral vessels, respectively, which reduces peripheral resistance and afterload, though not as potent as the dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers. This results in minimal reflexive sympathetic changes. Diltiazem has negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects. This means diltiazem causes a decrease in heart muscle contractility – how strong the beat is, lowering of heart rate – due to slowing of the sinoatrial node, and a slowing of conduction through the atrioventricular node – increasing the time needed for each beat. Each of these effects results in reduced oxygen consumption by the heart, reducing angina, typically unstable angina, symptoms. These effects also reduce blood pressure by causing less blood to be pumped out. == Research == Diltiazem is prescribed off-label by doctors in the US for prophylaxis of cluster headaches. Some research on diltiazem and other calcium channel antagonists in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine is ongoing. Recent research has shown diltiazem may reduce cocaine cravings in drug-addicted rats. This is believed to be due to the effects of calcium blockers on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling in the brain. Diltiazem also enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in animal tests, without increasing respiratory depression, and reduces the development of tolerance. Diltiazem is also being used in the treatment of anal fissures. It can be taken orally or applied topically with increased effectiveness. When applied topically, it is made into a cream form using either petrolatum or Phlojel. Phlojel absorbs the diltiazem into the problem area better than the petrolatum base. It has good short-term success rates. == References ==",Dilzem,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.764281842042692e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004385939973872155)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.10020667314529419), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mims.com](https://www.mims.com/Philippines/drug/info/Dilzem/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Dilzem Dosage & Drug Information | MIMS Philippines', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mims.com/Philippines/drug/info/Dilzem/?utm_source=openai')])"

Sonata is a vague term, with varying meanings depending on the context and time period. By the early 19th century it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded—alongside the fugue—as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas maintain the overarching structure. The term sonatina, pl. sonatine, the diminutive form of sonata, is often used for a short or technically easy sonata. == Instrumentation == In the Baroque period, a sonata was for one or more instruments, almost always with continuo. After the Baroque period most works designated as sonatas specifically are performed by a solo instrument, most often a keyboard instrument, or by a solo instrument accompanied by a keyboard instrument. Sonatas for a solo instrument other than keyboard have been composed, as have sonatas for other combinations of instruments. == History == === Baroque === In the works of Arcangelo Corelli and his contemporaries, two broad classes of sonata were established, and were first described by Sébastien de Brossard in his Dictionaire de musique (third edition, Amsterdam, ca. 1710): the sonata da chiesa (that is, suitable for use in church), which was the type ""rightly known as Sonatas"", and the sonata da camera (proper for use at court), which consists of a prelude followed by a succession of dances, all in the same key.: 21, 40 Although the four, five, or six movements of the sonata da chiesa are also most often in one key, one or two of the internal movements are sometimes in a contrasting tonality. The sonata da chiesa, generally for one or two violins and basso continuo, consisted normally of a slow introduction, a loosely fugued allegro, a cantabile slow movement, and a lively finale in some binary form suggesting affinity with the dance-tunes of the suite. This scheme, however, was not very clearly defined, until the works of Arcangelo Corelli when it became the essential sonata and persisted as a tradition of Italian violin music. The sonata da camera consisted almost entirely of idealized dance-tunes. On the other hand, the features of sonata da chiesa and sonata da camera then tended to be freely intermixed. Although nearly half of Johann Sebastian Bach's 1,100 surviving compositions, arrangements, and transcriptions are instrumental works, only about 4% are sonatas. The term sonata is also applied to the series of over 500 works for harpsichord solo, or sometimes for other keyboard instruments, by Domenico Scarlatti, originally published under the name Essercizi per il gravicembalo (Exercises for the Harpsichord). Most of these pieces are in one binary-form movement only, with two parts that are in the same tempo and use the same thematic material, though occasionally there will be changes in tempo within the sections. They are frequently virtuosic, and use more distant harmonic transitions and modulations than were common for other works of the time. They were admired for their great variety and invention. Both the solo and trio sonatas of Vivaldi show parallels with the concerti he was writing at the same time. He composed over 70 sonatas, the great majority of which are of the solo type; most of the rest are trio sonatas, and a very small number are of the multivoice type. The sonatas of Domenico Paradies are mild and elongated works with a graceful and melodious little second movement included. === Classical period === The practice of the Classical period would become decisive for the sonata; the term moved from being one of many terms indicating genres or forms, to designating the fundamental form of organization for large-scale works. This evolution stretched over fifty years. The term came to apply both to the structure of individual movements (see Sonata form and History of sonata form) and to the layout of the movements in a multi-movement work. In the transition to the Classical period there were several names given to multimovement works, including divertimento, serenade, and partita, many of which are now regarded effectively as sonatas. The usage of sonata as the standard term for such works began somewhere in the 1770s. Haydn labels his first piano sonata as such in 1771, after which the term divertimento is used sparingly in his output. The term sonata was increasingly applied to either a work for keyboard alone (see piano sonata), or for keyboard and one other instrument, often the violin or cello. It was less and less frequently applied to works with more than two instrumentalists; for example, piano trios were not often labelled sonata for piano, violin, and cello. Initially the most common layout of movements was: Allegro, which at the time was understood to mean not only a tempo, but also some degree of ""working out"", or development, of the theme. A middle movement, most frequently a slow movement: an Andante, an Adagio or a Largo; or less frequently a Minuet or Theme and Variations form. A closing movement was generally an Allegro or a Presto, often labeled Finale. The form was often a Rondo or Minuet. However, two-movement layouts also occur, a practice Haydn uses as late as the 1790s. There was also in the early Classical period the possibility of using four movements, with a dance movement inserted before the slow movement, as in Haydn's piano sonatas No. 6 and No. 8. Mozart's sonatas were also primarily in three movements. Of the works that Haydn labelled piano sonata, divertimento, or partita in Hob XIV, seven are in two movements, thirty-five are in three, and three are in four; and there are several in three or four movements whose authenticity is listed as ""doubtful."" Composers such as Boccherini would publish sonatas for piano and obbligato instrument with an optional third movement—–in Boccherini's case, 28 cello sonatas. But increasingly instrumental works were laid out in four, not three movements, a practice seen first in string quartets and symphonies, and reaching the sonata proper in the early sonatas of Beethoven. But two- and three-movement sonatas continued to be written throughout the Classical period: Beethoven's opus 102 pair has a two-movement C major sonata and a three-movement D major sonata. Nevertheless, works with fewer or more than four movements were increasingly felt to be exceptions; they were labelled as having movements ""omitted,"" or as having ""extra"" movements. The four-movement layout was by this point standard for the string quartet, and overwhelmingly the most common for the symphony. The usual order of the four movements was: An allegro, which by this point was in what is called sonata form, complete with exposition, development, and recapitulation. A slow movement: an andante, an adagio, or a largo. A dance movement, frequently minuet and trio or—especially later in the classical period—a scherzo and trio. A finale in faster tempo, often in a sonata–rondo form. When movements appeared out of this order they would be described as ""reversed"", such as the scherzo coming before the slow movement in Beethoven's 9th Symphony. This usage would be noted by critics in the early 19th century, and it was codified into teaching soon thereafter. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Beethoven's output of sonatas: 32 piano sonatas, plus sonatas for cello and piano or violin and piano, forming a large body of music that would over time increasingly be thought essential for any serious instrumentalist to master. === Romantic period === In the early 19th century, the current usage of the term sonata was established, both as regards form per se, and in the sense that a fully elaborated sonata serves as a norm for concert music in general, which other forms are seen in relation to. From this point forward, the word sonata in music theory labels as much the abstract musical form as particular works. Hence there are references to a symphony as a sonata for orchestra. This is referred to by William Newman as the sonata idea. Among works expressly labeled sonata for the piano, there are the three of Frédéric Chopin, those of Felix Mendelssohn, the three of Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt's Sonata in B minor, and later the sonatas of Johannes Brahms and Sergei Rachmaninoff. In the early 19th century, the sonata form was defined, from a combination of previous practice and the works of important Classical composers, particularly Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, but composers such as Clementi also. It is during this period that the differences between the three- and the four-movement layouts became a subject of commentary, with emphasis on the concerto being laid out in three movements, and the symphony in four. Ernest Newman wrote in the essay ""Brahms and the Serpent"": That, perhaps, will be the ideal of the instrumental music of the future; the way to it, indeed, seems at last to be opening out before modern composers in proportion as they discard the last tiresome vestiges of sonata form. This, from being what it was originally, the natural mode of expression of a certain eighteenth century way of thinking in music, became in the nineteenth century a drag upon both individual thinking and the free unfolding of the inner vital force of an idea, and is now simply a shop device by which a bad composer may persuade himself and the innocent reader of textbooks that he is a good one. === After the Romantic period === The role of the sonata as an extremely important form of extended musical argument would inspire composers such as Hindemith, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Tailleferre, Ustvolskaya, and Williams to compose in sonata form, and works with traditional sonata structures continue to be composed and performed. == Scholarship and musicology == === Sonata idea or principle === Research into the practice and meaning of sonata form, style, and structure has been the motivation for important theoretical works by Heinrich Schenker, Arnold Schoenberg, and Charles Rosen among others; and the pedagogy of music continued to rest on an understanding and application of the rules of sonata form as almost two centuries of development in practice and theory had codified it. The development of the classical style and its norms of composition formed the basis for much of the music theory of the 19th and 20th centuries. As an overarching formal principle, sonata was accorded the same central status as Baroque fugue; generations of composers, instrumentalists, and audiences were guided by this understanding of sonata as an enduring and dominant principle in Western music. The sonata idea begins before the term had taken on its present importance, along with the evolution of the Classical period's changing norms. The reasons for these changes, and how they relate to the evolving sense of a new formal order in music, is a matter to which research is devoted. Some common factors which were pointed to include: the shift of focus from vocal music to instrumental music; changes in performance practice, including the loss of the continuo. Crucial to most interpretations of the sonata form is the idea of a tonal center; and, as the Grove Concise Dictionary of Music puts it: ""The main form of the group embodying the 'sonata principle', the most important principle of musical structure from the Classical period to the 20th century: that material first stated in a complementary key be restated in the home key"".( The sonata idea has been thoroughly explored by William Newman in his monumental three-volume work Sonata in the Classic Era (A History of the Sonata Idea), begun in the 1950s and published in what has become the standard edition of all three volumes in 1972. === 20th-century theory === Heinrich Schenker argued that there was an Urlinie or basic tonal melody, and a basic bass figuration. He held that when these two were present, there was basic structure, and that the sonata represented this basic structure in a whole work with a process known as interruption. As a practical matter Schenker applied his ideas to the editing of the piano sonatas of Beethoven, using original manuscripts and his own theories to ""correct"" the available sources. The basic procedure was the use of tonal theory to infer meaning from available sources as part of the critical process, even to the extent of completing works left unfinished by their composers. While many of these changes were and are controversial, that procedure has a central role today in music theory, and is an essential part of the theory of sonata structure as taught in most music schools. == Notable sonatas == === Baroque (c. 1600 – c. 1760) === Johann Sebastian Bach Sonatas for solo violin (BWV 1001, 1003 and 1005) Sonatas for violin and continuo (BWV 1021, 1023), and the doubtful 1024 Sonatas for flute and continuo (BWV 1034, 1035) Trio sonatas: for organ (BWV 525–530); for violin and harpsichord (BWV 1014–1019); for viola da gamba and harpsichord (BWV 1027–1029); for flute and harpsichord (BWV 1030, 1032); for flute, violin and continuo (Sonata sopr'il Soggetto Reale included in The Musical Offering) Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber Rosary Sonatas George Frideric Handel Sonata for Violin and Continuo in D major (HWV 371) Giuseppe Tartini Devil's Trill Sonata Domenico Scarlatti 555 sonatas for harpsichord solo === Classical (c. 1760 – c. 1830) === Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Piano Sonata No. 8 in A minor (K. 310) Piano Sonata No. 11 in A major (K. 331/300i) Piano Sonata No. 12 in F major (K. 332) Piano Sonata No. 13 in B-flat major (K. 333) Piano Sonata No. 14 in C minor (K. 457) Piano Sonata No. 15 in F major (K. 533/494) Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major (K. 545) Sonata in A for Violin and Keyboard (K. 526) Franz Joseph Haydn Sonata No. 1 in C major, Hob.

4191,"('Isoetharine mesylate salt', 'Isotharine mesylate', 'Isoetarine mesilate', 'Isoetharine (mesylate)', 'Isoetarine mesilate; isoetharine mesylate')",Medical," Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Glivec [Novartis, Basel, Switzerland], formerly referred to as STI571 or CGP57148B) represents the paradigm of a new class of anticancer agents, so-called small molecules. They have a high selectivity against a specific molecular target known to be the cause for the establishment and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Imatinib is a rationally designed oral signal transduction inhibitor that specifically targets several protein tyrosine kinases, Abl, Arg (Abl-related gene), the stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), and their oncogenic forms, most notably BCR-ABL. Imatinib has been shown to have remarkable clinical activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and malignant gastrointestinal stroma tumors (GIST) leading to its approval for treatment of these diseases. Treatment with imatinib is generally well tolerated with a low incidence of severe side effects. The most common adverse events include mild to moderate edema, muscle cramps, diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes, and myelosuppression. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. Clonal evolution, amplification, or overexpression of BCR-ABL as well as mutations in the catalytic domain, P-loop, and other mutations have been demonstrated to play a role in primary and secondary resistance to imatinib, respectively. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has led to the development of new second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see chapters on dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib).",Isotharine mesylate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005929154809564352), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0963558778166771), ('ICAL', -8.940656698541716e-06), (',', -0.4808991849422455), ('ĠINDU', -0.3132301867008209), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0718824714422226)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D04626?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=72, start_index=9, title='KEGG DRUG: Isoetharine mesylate', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D04626?utm_source=openai')])"

4193,"('Trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride', 'Benzhexol hydrochloride', 'Artane', 'Trihexyphenidyl hcl', 'Benzhexol hcl')",Medical,"Trihexyphenidyl (THP, benzhexol, trihex, marketed as Artane and others) is an antispasmodic drug used to treat stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. It is an agent of the antimuscarinic class and is often used in management of Parkinson's disease. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's in the US in 2003. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Trihexyphenidyl is used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease in mono and combination therapy. It is active in postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic forms. The drug is also commonly used to treat extrapyramidal side effects occurring during antipsychotic treatment. It reduces the frequency and duration of oculogyric crises as well as of dyskinetic movements and spastic contractions. Trihexyphenidyl may improve psychotic depression and mental inertia frequently associated with Parkinson's disease and symptomatic problems caused by antipsychotic treatment. The drug cannot cure Parkinson's disease, but may provide substantial alleviation of symptoms. An estimated 50–75% of people with Parkinson's disease will react positively and experience a 20–30% symptomatic improvement. To increase therapeutic activity, trihexyphenidyl is often given concomitantly with levodopa or other antimuscarinic or antihistaminic (e.g. diphenhydramine) agents. Combination therapy with dopamine agonists such as cabergoline is also possible. This is often termed a 'multidimensional approach'. Trihexyphenidyl has also been prescribed for essential tremor and akathisia. In pediatrics, it has been used for children with dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and to control drooling. In organophosphate poisoning, trihexyphenidyl is a more effective antidote than atropine to counteract the cholinergic crisis, seizures, and neuropathology. Equivocal preliminary results from small studies exist for other dyskinesias, Huntington's chorea, Spasmodic torticollis. == Contraindications == Contraindications include according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration Australia from 2022: Hypersensitivity to trihexyphenidyl Narrow angle glaucoma Ileus (disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine) Caution: People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous tachycardia People under 18 years of age should not be treated due to a lack of clinical experience. People should allow a period to adjust to the dose when first starting trihexyphenidyl and when the dose has been increased or added to a regimen with other drugs because acute somnolence and accumulated fatigue can make it particularly dangerous to operate an automobile, heavy machinery etc. == Adverse effects == Dose-dependent side effects are frequent, but typically lessen over time as the body adapts to the medication. All of the following symptoms considered, Artane has been shown to dramatically and consistently improve neurologic defects in people aged 16–86 over the course of five years. People who are older or who have psychiatric conditions may become confused or develop delirium. Side effects include but are not limited to: Central nervous system: drowsiness, vertigo, headache, and dizziness are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, anxiety, delirium, and confusion are noted. Trihexyphenidyl may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoric effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered (REM sleep depression). Trihexyphenidyl may lower the seizure-threshold. Peripheral side effects: dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and constipation are frequent. Tachycardia or heart palpitations (fast heart rate) may be noted. Allergic reactions are rare, but may occur. Many of these peripheral symptoms, especially considering an acute increase in anxiety with various physical complaints, as well as evidence of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are indicative of withdrawal, especially in people with psychiatric conditions Eyes: trihexyphenidyl causes mydriasis with or without photophobia. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma or cause blurred vision. Tolerance may develop during therapy which requires dose adjustments. Striated musculature and weight gain. Trihexyphenidyl is a pregnancy category C drug. It is advised to only use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. == Overdose == Trihexyphenidyl and other antiparkinsonian drugs are known to be substances of abuse. This is true both in abusers of other substances and in chronic schizophrenics, the latter being infrequent abusers of other drugs. Overdose mimics an atropine intoxication with dryness of mucous membranes, red face, bowel and bladder paralysis, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central nervous system consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is physostigmine, which combines a peripheral and a central action. Carbachol can be used to treat atonic bowel and bladder. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets. A case report of 24 hour long arrhythmia was treated with verapamil. Excessive myoclonus can be complicated by rhabdomyolysis; in one case risk was increased due to concomitant use of risperidone. == Interactions == Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, antihistamines, TCAs) : Side effects of trihexyphenidyl may be increased. Quinidine : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction). Antipsychotics : Long term use of trihexyphenidyl may mask or increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Pethidine (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased. Metoclopramide : Action of metoclopramide is decreased. Alcohol : Risk of serious intoxication. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic. It is specifically an antimuscarinic and acts as a non-selective antagonist of all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. However, its antagonistic activity is much stronger at the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M4 receptors, and it can be described as selective for these receptors. The exact mechanism of action in parkinsonian syndromes is not precisely understood, but it is known that trihexyphenidyl blocks efferent impulses in parasympathetically innervated structures like smooth muscles (spasmolytic activity), salivary glands, and eyes (mydriasis). In higher doses direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may contribute. In very high doses central toxicity as seen in atropine overdose is noted. It possibly also binds to dopamine receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Trihexyphenidyl is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of action is within 1 hour after oral dosing. The peak activity is noted after 2 to 3 hours. The duration of action of one single dose is 6 to 12 hours in a dose dependent manner. It is excreted in the urine, probably as unchanged drug. More precise data in animals and humans have so far not been determined. == History == Trihexyphenidyl has been clinically relevant in trials pertaining to Parkinson's disease since 1949. In the US, the FDA approved Artane, or its generic form Trihexyphenidyl HCL, only on June 25, 2003 for the clinical use of all types of parkinsonism. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === The neurologist Oliver Sacks reported using the drug recreationally in the 1960s. He recalled taking ""a large dose"" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's. More recounts of Dr. Sacks' experiences — including experimentation with mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and probably DMT — have been compared in his book Hallucinations. During the 1970s, trihexyphenidyl (trade name Parkan) was the most popular recreationally used prescription drug in Hungary. In a 2008 news report, trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, among other prescription drugs. The report states that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress reaction. Although that may be the case for some, others used Artane as a substitute or more intense version of LSD. This was especially prevalent in the 1960s, according to a report in ""The New Yorker"". Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence. It is still diverted from its primary use, in combination with other drugs, on the Réunion island (France). == Chemistry == Trihexyphenidyl can be synthesized in two ways, one linear and one convergent synthesis. In the first way, the initial 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is synthesized in turn by the aminomethylation of acetophenone using paraformaldehyde and piperidine in a Mannich reaction. In the second step the 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is reacted with cyclohexylmagnesium bromide in a Grignard reaction. === Stereochemistry === Trihexyphenidyl has a chiral center and two enantiomers.

4194,"('Pioglitazone hydrochloride', 'Pioglitazone hcl', 'Piomed', 'Pioglitazone (hydrochloride)', 'Ad 4833')",Medical,"Pioglitazone, sold under the brand name Actos among others, is an anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It may be used with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or insulin. Use is recommended together with exercise and diet. It is not recommended in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, muscle pains, inflammation of the throat, and swelling. Serious side effects may include bladder cancer, low blood sugar, heart failure, and osteoporosis. Use is not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class and works by improving sensitivity of tissues to insulin. Pioglitazone was patented in 1985, and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 120th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. It was withdrawn in France and Germany in 2011. == Medical uses == Pioglitazone is used to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes either alone or in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin. The effects of pioglitazone have been compared in a Cochrane systematic review to that of other blood sugar lowering-medicine, including metformin, acarbose, and repaglinide, as well as with appropriate diet and exercise, not showing any benefit in reducing the chance of developing type 2 diabetes in people at risk. It did, however, show reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to a placebo or to no treatment. These results should be interpreted considering that most of the data of the studies included in this review were of low or very-low certainty. While pioglitazone does decrease blood sugar levels, the main study that looked at the medication found no difference in the main cardiovascular outcomes that were looked at. The secondary outcome of death from all causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke were lower. Pioglitazone has been found to reduce all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients compared to other therapies, with a 60% reduction in mortality in those exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed. Another study found an all-cause mortality hazard ratio of 0.33 for pioglitazone after adjusting for >40 covariates, compared to insulin. Due to insufficient data on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke, this was not possible to compare in a more recent review. == Contraindications == Pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, other thiazolidinediones or any of components of its pharmaceutical forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in diabetes mellitus type 1 and diabetic ketoacidosis. Its safety in pregnancy, lactation (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established. Given previous experiences with the related drug troglitazone, acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a contraindication for pioglitazone. == Side effects == A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, the developer of pioglitazone (sold as Actos in many markets) admitted that it has similar implications for female patients. The risk of hypoglycemia is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose. Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. As a result, it may precipitate congestive heart failure (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause anemia. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems. Chronic administration of the drug has led to occasional instances of cholestatic hepatitis, reversible upon drug discontinuation. On 30 July 2007, an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of ""myocardial ischemic events"" when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A meta-analysis released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased CHF. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review assessed occurrence of adverse effects with use of pioglitazone, but was not able to reach any conclusions due to insufficient data on included studies. === Bladder cancer === On 9 June 2011, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products decided to withdraw pioglitazone due to high risk of bladder cancer. This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications. On 10 June 2011, Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted. On 15 June 2011, the U.S. FDA announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and two months later the label was updated with an additional warning about this risk. A 2017 meta-analysis found no difference in the rates of bladder cancer attributed to pioglitazone. == Drug interactions == Combination with sulfonylureas or insulin reciprocally exponentiate risk of hypoglycemia. Therapy with pioglitazone increase the chance of pregnancy in individuals taking oral contraception. == Mechanism of action == Pioglitazone selectively stimulates the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and to a lesser extent PPAR-α. It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. As a result, pioglitazone reduces insulin resistance in the liver and peripheral tissues, decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reduces quantity of glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the bloodstream. Since 2004, pioglitazone and other active TZDs have been shown to bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET with affinity comparable to that of pioglitazone for PPARγ. Leriglitazone is a metabolite. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2008, it generated the tenth-highest amount of money for a medication in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion. To 2020, no study has examined the socioeconomic effects of utilization of pioglitazone. === Brand names === Pioglitazone is marketed as Actos in the United States, Canada, the UK and Germany, Glustin in the European Union, Glizone and Pioz in India by Zydus Cadila and USV Limited, respectively and Zactos in Mexico by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. On 17 August 2012, the US FDA announced its approval of the first generic version of Actos. == Research == === Psychiatry === ==== Bipolar disorder ==== Pioglitazone has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. However, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of pioglitazone in the treatment of bipolar depression. ==== Major depression ==== There is research that suggests that pioglitazone may be useful for treating major depression. === Other illnesses === Pioglitazone has been found to exert anti-ageing effects in Drosophila. Pioglitazone has been tried for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, showing promising results according to several meta-analyses. Because it is thought to reduce inflammatory activity in neuroglia, it was studied in a small clinical trial involving children with autism, under the autoimmune/inflammatory hypotheses of the causes of autism. Pioglitazone may improve symptoms of psoriasis. Pioglitazone is also being researched as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in preclinical studies, however testing for the efficacy of Pioglitazone has been fraught with failure and confusing results from clinical trials. Pioglitazone has been shown in animal models to be a possible treatment for Opioid use disorder. == References ==",Pioglitazone hydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.887569048150908e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00020644917094614357)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699016.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Pioglitazone: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699016.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4195,"('Difenossilato [dcit]', 'Difenoxilato', 'Diphenoxylatum', 'Lomotil', 'Difenoxilato [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Diphenoxylate/atropine, also known as co-phenotrope and sold under the brand name Lomotil among others, is used to treat diarrhea. It is a fixed-dose combination of the medications diphenoxylate, as the hydrochloride, an antidiarrheal; and atropine, as the sulfate, an anticholinergic. It is taken by mouth. Onset is typically within an hour. Side effects may include abdominal pain, angioedema, glaucoma, heart problems, feeling tired, dry mouth, and trouble seeing. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe and use when breastfeeding may result in side effects in the baby. It works by decreasing contractions of the bowel. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 284th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. The combination is in Schedule V in the United States. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: People under six years of age People with an allergy to diphenoxylate or atropine People with diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis (Clostridioides difficile), diarrhea caused by antibiotic treatment People with obstructive jaundice == Side effects == The combination is generally safe for short-term use and with recommended dosage. In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, diphenoxylate has not produced addiction. It may cause several side-effects, such as dry mouth, headache, constipation and blurred vision. It is not recommended for children under six years of age. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs: Antidepressants (e.g. Elavil, Prozac) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. Nardil, Parnate) Opioid analgesics Sedatives (e.g. Ambien, Sonata) Diarrhea that is caused by some antibiotics such as cefaclor, erythromycin or tetracycline can worsen. == Toxicity == It may cause serious health problems when overdosed. Signs and symptoms of adverse effects may include any or several of the following: convulsions, respiratory depression (slow or stopped breathing), dilated eye pupils, nystagmus (rapid side-to-side eye movements), erythema (flushed skin), gastrointestinal constipation, nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, tachycardia (rapid pulse), drowsiness and hallucinations. Symptoms of toxicity may take up to 12 hours to appear. Treatment of overdose must be initiated immediately after diagnosis and may include the following: ingestion of activated charcoal, laxative and a counteracting medication (narcotic antagonist). == Mechanism of action == Diphenoxylate is anti-diarrheal and atropine is anticholinergic. A subtherapeutic amount of atropine sulfate is present to discourage deliberate overdosage. Atropine has no anti-diarrheal properties, but will cause tachycardia when overused. The medication diphenoxylate works by slowing down the movement of the intestines. In some cases it has been shown to ease symptoms of opiate withdrawal. == History == Diphenoxylate was developed in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In the United States, it is classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal law, and is available only for a medical purpose. === Names === The UK British Approved Name (BAN) name for diphenoxylate and atropine is co-phenotrope. As of 2018, the combination is marketed in the US and some other countries under the brands Atridol, Atrolate, Atrotil, Co-Phenotrope, Dhamotil, Dimotil, Intard, Logen, Lomanate, Lomotil, Lonox, and Reasec. == References ==",Lomotil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.894321920000948e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005608416395261884)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/mtm/lomotil.html ', [])"

Diphenoxylate is an opioid and acts by slowing intestinal contractions; the atropine is present to prevent drug abuse and overdose. It should not be given to children due to the risk that they will stop breathing and should not be used in people with Clostridioides difficile infection. == Medical use == Diphenoxylate is used to treat diarrhea in adults; it is only available as a combination drug with a subtherapeutic dose of atropine to prevent abuse. It should not be used in children due to the risk of respiratory depression. It does not appear harmful to a fetus but the risks have not been fully explored. It should not be taken with other central depressants like alcohol, as they can increase its risks. It should not be used for people with diarrhea caused by an infection, for example with Clostridioides difficile infection, since the slowing of peristalsis can prevent clearing of the infectious organism. == Adverse effects == The drug label (in some jurisdictions) has warnings with regard to the risk of respiratory depression, anticholinergic toxicity and opioid overdose, the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that people with severe diarrhea always run, and toxic megacolon in people with ulcerative colitis. Other adverse effects include numbness in the hands and feet, euphoria, depression, lethargy, confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, restlessness, headache, hallucinations, edema, hives, swollen gums, itchiness, vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and stomach pain. == Pharmacology == Diphenoxylate is rapidly metabolized to difenoxin; it is eliminated mostly in feces but also in urine. Like other opioids, diphenoxylate acts by slowing intestinal contractions, allowing the body to consolidate intestinal contents and prolong transit time, thus allowing the intestines to draw moisture out of them at a normal or higher rate and therefore stop the formation of loose and liquid stools; the atropine is an anticholinergic and is present to prevent drug abuse and overdose. == History and chemistry == Diphenoxylate was first synthesized by Paul Janssen at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956 as part of a medicinal chemistry investigation of opioids. Diphenoxylate is made by combining a precursor of normethadone with norpethidine. Loperamide (Imodium) and bezitramide are analogs. Like loperamide, it has a methadone-like structure and a piperidine moiety. == Society and culture == === Pricing === In 2017 Hikma Pharmaceuticals raised the price of its liquid formulation of generic diphenoxylate-atropine in the US by 430%, from $16 to $84.00. === Regulation === In the United States, drugs containing diphenoxylate combined with atropine salts are classified as Schedule V controlled substances. (Diphenoxlate by itself is a Schedule II controlled substance.) It is on Schedule III of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, only in forms that contain, according to the Yellow List: ""not more than 2.5 milligrams of diphenoxylate calculated as base and a quantity of atropine sulfate equivalent to at least 1 per cent of the dose of diphenoxylate"". == Research == Diphenoxylate and atropine have been studied in small trials as a treatment for fecal incontinence; it appears to be less efficacious and have more adverse effects when compared with loperamide or codeine. == References ==",Diphenoxylate hydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.4437606043647975e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007194076315499842)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601045.html ', [])"

4198,"('(e)-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarboxamide', 'Cocoa nibs', 'Inositol nf powder')",Medical," Cocoa beans contain a variety of nutritional compounds and are rich in biologically active substances. The aim of this study was to utilize cocoa nibs (roasted and unroasted) as the main ingredient in the development of an attractive and convenient product. The produced nibs were analyzed for total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity using DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP methods. The primary phenolic compounds and methylxanthines were analyzed by LC/MS. Subsequently, cereal bars were developed, including a control sample (without nibs) and five formulations containing 41% nibs, using various proportions of roasted and unroasted nibs. The influence of the origin of the beans on the product characteristics was also evaluated. The results showed that the roasting process led to a reduction in epicatechin, caffeine, and caffeic acid. Furthermore, the reduction in total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity after roasting was more pronounced in beans from Bahia compared to those from Espírito Santo. Regarding the cereal bars, the results demonstrated that using cocoa from Bahia, the formulation with a higher proportion of unroasted nibs (F80) significantly increased the total phenolic content (1968.85 mg of gallic acid/100 g) and total flavonoids (39.26 mg of quercetin/100 g). This initial study suggests that the use of cocoa nibs as a functional ingredient in cereal bars may be a viable and advantageous option for creating a product with greater antioxidant potential. Sequential application of solvent extraction, gel permeation chromatography, and RP-HPLC in combination with taste dilution analyses, followed by LC-MS and 1D/2D-NMR experiments and thiolytic degradation, revealed that, besides theobromine and caffeine, the flavan-3-ols epicatechin, catechin, procyanidin B-2, procyanidin B-5, procyanidin C-1, [epicatechin-(4beta-->8)](3)-epicatechin, and [epicatechin-(4beta-->8)](4)-epicatechin were among the key compounds contributing to the bitter taste as well as the astringent mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a series of quercetin, naringenin, luteolin, and apigenin glycopyranosides as well as a family of not previously identified amino acid amides, namely, (+)-N-[4'-hydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-aspartic acid, (+)-N-[3',4'-dihydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-aspartic acid, (-)-N-[3',4'-dihydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-glutamic acid, (-)-N-[4'-hydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-glutamic acid, (-)-N-[4'-hydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine, (+)-N-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-aspartic acid, and (+)-N-(E)-cinnamoyl-L-aspartic acid, have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. Furthermore, (-)-N-[3',4'-dihydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-3-hydroxy-l-tyrosine (clovamide), (-)-N-[4'-hydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-tyrosine (deoxyclovamide), and (-)-N-[3',4'-dihydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-tyrosine, reported previously as antioxidants, have been found as contributors of cocoa's astringent taste. By means of the half-tongue test, the taste thresholds of flavan-3-ols and glycosides have been determined. The aroma properties of cocoa nibs obtained by applying a novel postharvest treatment were investigated using methods of the molecular sensory science approach, i.e., solvent extraction and solvent-assisted flavor evaporation, aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), stable isotope dilution analysis, calculation of odor activity values (OAVs), and orthonasal sensory evaluation; those properties were then compared to the unfermented and dried raw material and a traditionally fermented sample of the same harvest. For the treatment, unfermented and dried cocoa nibs were, first, rehydrated with lactic acid and ethanol solution to adjust the pH value to 5.1 and, second, incubated under aerobic conditions for 72 h at 45 °C and subsequently dried. This treatment was used to induce enzymatic reactions within the cotyledon matrix, which also occur inside the bean during microbial fermentation of the surrounding fruit pulp. The results of the AEDA showed that many of the key aroma compounds found in fermented and dried cocoa increased during the incubation treatment. Especially some ""fruity"" esters were found with an equal or even higher flavor dilution (FD) factor in the incubated sample compared to the fermented sample, whereas the fermented sample showed high FD factors for ""pungent, sour"" and ""sweaty"" acids, such as acetic acid and 2- and 3-methylbutanoic acids. The quantitative data and calculated OAVs for the samples supported the findings of the AEDA, underlining the potential of this approach as a controllable and reproducible alternative postharvest treatment.",Cocoa nibs,PUBMED,"('FOOD', [('FO', -5.88418151892256e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.005298974458128214), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02329145185649395)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_butter?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=6, title='Cocoa butter', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_butter?utm_source=openai')])"

The American College of Rheumatology recommends colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids in the treatment of gout. Other uses for colchicine include the management of pericarditis. Colchicine is taken by mouth. The injectable route of administration for colchicine can be toxic. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration removed all injectable colchicine from the US market. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, so overdosing is a significant risk. Common side effects of colchicine include gastrointestinal upset, particularly at high doses. Severe side effects may include pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) and rhabdomyolysis (damage to skeletal muscle), and the medication can be deadly in overdose. Whether colchicine is safe for use during pregnancy is unclear, but its use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Colchicine works by decreasing inflammation via multiple mechanisms. Colchicine, in the form of the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was used as early as 1500 BC to treat joint swelling. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 197th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Colchicine is used in plant breeding to induce polyploidy, in which the number of chromosomes in plant cells are doubled. This helps produce larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general, more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. == Medical uses == === Gout === Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when treating gout. Low doses (1.2 mg in one hour, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later) appear to be well tolerated and may reduce gout symptoms and pain, perhaps as effectively as NSAIDs. At higher doses, side effects (primarily diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) limit its use. For treating gout symptoms, colchicine is taken orally, with or without food, as symptoms first appear. Subsequent doses may be needed if symptoms worsen. There is preliminary evidence that daily colchicine may be effective as a long-term prophylaxis when used with allopurinol to reduce the risk of increased uric acid levels and acute gout flares; adverse gastrointestinal effects may occur, though overall the risk of serious side effects is low. === Risk of cardiovascular disorders === In June 2023, the US FDA approved a low-dose regimen of colchicine (brand name Lodoco) to reduce the risk of further disorders in adults with existing cardiovascular diseases. As an anti-inflammatory drug, Lodoco in a dose of 0.5 mg per day reduced the rate of cardiovascular events by 31% in people with established atherosclerosis and by 23% in people with recent myocardial infarction. Colchicine was most effective in combination therapy with lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications. The mechanism for this effect of colchicine is unknown. === Other conditions === Colchicine is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for long-term treatment of Behçet's disease. It appears to have limited effect in relapsing polychondritis, as it may only be useful for the treatment of chondritis and mild skin symptoms. It is a component of therapy for several other conditions, including pericarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, biliary cirrhosis, various vasculitides, pseudogout, spondyloarthropathy, calcinosis, scleroderma, and amyloidosis. Research regarding the efficacy of colchicine in many of these diseases has not been performed. It is also used in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, in which it reduces attacks and the long-term risk of amyloidosis. Colchicine is effective for prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. In people with recent myocardial infarction (recent heart attack), it has been found to reduce risk of future cardiovascular events. Its clinical use may grow to include this indication. == Contraindications == Long-term (prophylactic) regimens of oral colchicine are absolutely contraindicated in people with advanced kidney failure (including those on dialysis). About 10–20% of a colchicine dose is excreted unchanged by the kidneys; it is not removed by hemodialysis. Cumulative toxicity is a high probability in this clinical setting, and a severe neuromyopathy may result. The presentation includes a progressive onset of proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Colchicine toxicity can be potentiated by the concomitant use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. == Adverse effects == Deaths – both accidental and intentional – have resulted from overdose of colchicine. Typical side effects of moderate doses may include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and neutropenia. High doses can also damage bone marrow, lead to anemia, and cause hair loss. All of these side effects can result from inhibition of mitosis, which may include neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis. == Toxicity == According to one review, colchicine poisoning by overdose (range of acute doses of 7 to 26 mg) begins with a gastrointestinal phase occurring 10–24 hours after ingestion, followed by multiple organ dysfunction occurring 24 hours to 7 days after ingestion, after which the affected person either declines into multiple organ failure or recovers over several weeks. Colchicine can be toxic when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed in the eyes. It can cause a temporary clouding of the cornea and be absorbed into the body, causing systemic toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine overdose start 2 to 24 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested, and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This can cause hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the gastrointestinal tract, which can be fatal. If the affected persons survive the gastrointestinal phase of toxicity, they may experience multiple organ failure and critical illness. This includes kidney damage, which causes low urine output and bloody urine; low white blood cell counts that can last for several days; anemia; muscular weakness; liver failure; hepatomegaly; bone marrow suppression; thrombocytopenia; and ascending paralysis leading to potentially fatal respiratory failure. Neurologic symptoms are also evident, including seizures, confusion, and delirium; children may experience hallucinations. Recovery may begin within six to eight days and begins with rebound leukocytosis and alopecia as organ functions return to normal. Long-term exposure to colchicine can lead to toxicity, particularly of the bone marrow, kidney, and nerves. Effects of long-term colchicine toxicity include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low white blood cell counts, aplastic anemia, alopecia, rash, purpura, vesicular dermatitis, kidney damage, anuria, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy. No specific antidote for colchicine is known, but supportive care is used in cases of overdose. In the immediate period after an overdose, monitoring for gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysrhythmias, and respiratory depression is appropriate, and may require gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal or gastric lavage. Because colchicine is so toxic, chemists are continuing to try to synthesize derivatives of the molecule that decrease the toxicity. The most important aspect of these derivatives is that they keep the tropolone ring (the ring with the methoxy group and the carbonyl) intact to retain the mechanistic properties of the molecule. === Mechanism of toxicity === With overdoses, colchicine becomes toxic as an extension of its cellular mechanism of action via binding to tubulin. Cells so affected undergo impaired protein assembly with reduced endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular motility, and interrupted function of heart cells, culminating in multiple organ failure. === Epidemiology === In the United States, several hundred cases of colchicine toxicity are reported annually, about 10% of which end with serious morbidity or mortality. Many of these cases are intentional overdoses, but others were accidental; for example, if the drug were not dosed appropriately for kidney function. Most cases of colchicine toxicity occur in adults. Many of these adverse events resulted from the use of intravenous colchicine. == Drug interactions == Colchicine interacts with the P-glycoprotein transporter, and the CYP3A4 enzyme involved in drug and toxin metabolism. Fatal drug interactions have occurred when colchicine was taken with other drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as erythromycin or clarithromycin. People taking macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, or cyclosporine, or those who have liver or kidney disease, should not take colchicine, as these drugs and conditions may interfere with colchicine metabolism and raise its blood levels, potentially increasing its toxicity abruptly. Symptoms of toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, muscle pain, low blood cell counts, and organ failure. People with HIV/AIDS taking atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir may experience colchicine toxicity. Grapefruit juice and statins can also increase colchicine concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === In gout, inflammation in joints results from the precipitation of uric acid as needle-like crystals of monosodium urate in and around synovial fluid and soft tissues of joints. These crystal deposits cause inflammatory arthritis, which is initiated and sustained by mechanisms involving various proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. Colchicine accumulates in white blood cells and affects them in a variety of ways - decreasing motility, mobilization (especially chemotaxis), and adhesion. Under preliminary research are various mechanisms by which colchicine may interfere with gout inflammation: Inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to its constitutive protein, tubulin As availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, colchicine may inhibit mitosis Inhibits activation and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation Interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate interleukin-1β activation, a component of inflammation Inhibits superoxide anion production in response to urate crystals Interrupts mast cell and lysosome degranulation Inhibits release of glycoproteins that promote chemotaxis from synovial cells and neutrophils Generally, colchicine appears to inhibit multiple proinflammatory mechanisms, while enabling increased levels of anti-inflammatory mediators. Apart from inhibiting mitosis, colchicine inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect, which has efficacy for inhibiting or preventing gout inflammation. === Pharmacokinetics === Colchicine appears to be a peripherally selective drug with limited brain uptake due to binding to P-glycoprotein. == History == The plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described for treatment of rheumatism and swelling in the Ebers Papyrus (circa 1500 BC), an Egyptian medical text. It is a toxic alkaloid and secondary metabolite. Colchicum extract was first described as a treatment for gout in De Materia Medica by Pedanius Dioscorides, in the first century AD. Use of the bulb-like corms of Colchicum to treat gout probably dates to around 550 AD, as the ""hermodactyl"" recommended by Alexander of Tralles. Colchicum corms were used by the Persian physician Avicenna, and were recommended by Ambroise Paré in the 16th century, and appeared in the London Pharmacopoeia of 1618. Colchicum use waned over time, likely due to the severe gastrointestinal side effects preparations caused. In 1763, Colchicum was recorded as a remedy for dropsy (now called edema) among other illnesses. Colchicum plants were brought to North America by Benjamin Franklin, who had gout himself and had written humorous doggerel about the disease during his stint as United States Ambassador to France. Colchicine was first isolated in 1820 by French chemists P. S. Pelletier and J. B. Caventou. In 1833, P. L. Geiger purified an active ingredient, which he named colchicine. It quickly became a popular remedy for gout. The determination of colchicine's structure required decades, although in 1945, Michael Dewar made an important contribution when he suggested that, among the molecule's three rings, two were seven-member rings. Its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects for gout were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin. The full synthesis of colchicine was achieved by the Swiss organic chemist Albert Eschenmoser in 1959. === United States === ==== Colcrys, the Unapproved Drugs Initiative, and controversy ==== In 2006, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety program called the Unapproved Drugs Initiative—through which the FDA sought more rigorous testing of efficacy and safety of colchicine and other unapproved drugs. This program was in response to multiple deaths caused by ""unapproved products."". After the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was signed into law in June 24, 1938, the FDA had the regulatory authority to mandate drugs be reviewed for safety prior to approval. Drugs approved before June 24, 1938, were grandfathered, as long as their manufacturing, ingredients, and labeling remained unchanged. In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&C Act gave the FDA the authority to also require efficacy as a condition for drug approval. Drugs approved after June 24, 1938, but before 1962 had a limited time to be reviewed for efficacy to remain on the market. This was known as the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). As of today there are only a handful of drugs still on the DESI list and in 2006, the FDA stated it was not aware of any grandfathered drugs. By 2006, URL Pharma decided to research colchicine to see if this unapproved product could gain legal FDA approval. Colchicine was a narrow therapeutic index drug that was implicated in numerous death leading to the FDA forcefully removing injectable colchicine from the US Market. At this time oral colchicine was being used to treat gout attacks. The only placebo control trial conducted using colchicine for acute gout attacks instructed physicians to give colchicine until pain relief or toxicity. All patients on the colchicine arm had adverse events. Despite its toxicity, unapproved oral colchicine was still prescribed using this dosing regimen. In addition, at this time, oral colchicine was also used to treat the often fatal disease Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). In July 2009, the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares). This resulted in a 3-year regulatory market exclusivity in the acute and chronic gout indications and a 7-year exclusivity on the FMF indication. In addition, there are 17 patents on colchicine, listed in the FDA Orange Book which may confer additional exclusivity. At the time of approval, there were no FDA-approved single-agent colchicine products (brand or generic) in the United States. The unapproved, illegally marketed colchicine products were forcibly removed by the FDA in October 2010. ===== Controversy ===== The events that led to the approval of Colcrys, the clearance of the illegally sold non-FDA approved colchicine products, Colcrys pricing, and the sale of URL Pharma still are controversial today. Before the Colcrys approval, unapproved colchicine products were being illegally sold in the United States for under 10 cents a pill. These products were also labeled in an unsafe manner and not manufactured under FDA inspection. URL conducted one Phase 3 clinical trial and at least 12 other trials to gain the approval of Colcrys. URL Pharma priced Colcrys at $4.85 a pill drawing the ire of many groups. In 2012, Asia's biggest drugmaker, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., acquired URL Pharma for $800 million including the rights to Colcrys. == Sources and uses == === Physical properties === Colchicine has a melting point of 142-150 °C. It has a molecular weight of 399.4 grams per mole. === Structure === Colchicine has one stereocenter located at carbon 7. The natural configuration of this stereocenter is S. The molecule also contains one chiral axis - the single bond between rings A and C. The natural configuration of this axis is aS. Although colchicine has four stereoisomers, the only one found in nature is the aS,7s configuration. === Light sensitivity === Colchicine is a light-sensitive compound, so needs to be stored in a dark bottle. Upon exposure to light, colchicine undergoes photoisomerization and transforms into structural isomers, called lumicolchicine. After this transformation, colchicine is no longer effective in its mechanistic binding to tubulin, so is not effective as a drug. === Regulation === It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002) and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. === Formulations and dosing === Trade names for colchicine are Colcrys or Mitigare, which are manufactured as a dark– and light-blue capsule having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is also prepared as a white, yellow, or purple pill (tablet) having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is typically prescribed to mitigate or prevent the onset of gout, or its continuing symptoms and pain, using a low-dose prescription of 0.6 to 1.2 mg per day, or a high-dose amount of up to 4.8 mg in the first 6 hours of a gout episode. With an oral dose of 0.6 mg, peak blood levels occur within one to two hours. For treating gout, the initial effects of colchicine occur in a window of 12 to 24 hours, with a peak within 48 to 72 hours. It has a narrow therapeutic window, requiring monitoring of the subject for potential toxicity. Colchicine is not a general pain-relief drug, and is not used to treat pain in other disorders. === Biosynthesis === According to laboratory research, the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Giving radioactive phenylalanine-2-14C to C. byzantinum, another plant of the family Colchicaceae, resulted in its incorporation into colchicine. However, the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted from the expansion of the tyrosine ring. Radioactive feeding experiments of C. autumnale revealed that colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from (S)-autumnaline. That biosynthetic pathway occurs primarily through a phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes O-methylation directed by S-adenosylmethionine. Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring lead to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by N-formyldemecolcine. N-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule demecolcine, which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after the addition of acetyl-coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine. === Purification === Colchicine may be purified from Colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus) or Gloriosa superba (glory lily). Concentrations of colchicine in C. autumnale peak in the summer, and range from 0.1% in the flower to 0.8% in the bulb and seeds. === Botanical use and seedless fruit === Colchicine is used in plant breeding by inducing polyploidy in plant cells to produce new or improved varieties, strains, and cultivars. When used to induce polyploidy in plants, colchicine cream is usually applied to a growth point of the plant, such as an apical tip, shoot, or sucker. Seeds can be presoaked in a colchicine solution before planting. Since chromosome segregation is driven by microtubules, colchicine alters cellular division by inhibiting chromosome segregation during mitosis; half the resulting daughter cells, therefore, contain no chromosomes, while the other half contains double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid), and lead to cell nuclei with double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid). While this would be fatal in most higher animal cells, in plant cells, it is not only usually well-tolerated, but also frequently results in larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. For this reason, this type of genetic manipulation is frequently used in breeding plants commercially. When such a tetraploid plant is crossed with a diploid plant, the triploid offspring are usually sterile (unable to produce fertile seeds or spores), although many triploids can be propagated vegetatively. Growers of annual triploid plants not readily propagated vegetatively cannot produce a second-generation crop from the seeds (if any) of the triploid crop and need to buy triploid seed from a supplier each year. Many sterile triploid plants, including some trees and shrubs, are becoming increasingly valued in horticulture and landscaping because they do not become invasive species and do not drop undesirable fruit and seed litter. In certain species, colchicine-induced triploidy has been used to create ""seedless"" fruit, such as seedless watermelons (Citrullus lanatus). Since most triploids do not produce pollen themselves, such plants usually require cross-pollination with a diploid parent to induce seedless fruit production. The ability of colchicine to induce polyploidy can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, for example in breeding triticale (× Triticosecale) from wheat (Triticum spp.) and rye (Secale cereale). Wheat is typically tetraploid and rye diploid, with their triploid hybrid infertile; treatment of triploid triticale with colchicine gives fertile hexaploid triticale. == References == == External links == ""Colchicine : Biotoxin"".

4200,"('Dorzolamide hcl', 'Trusopt', 'Dorzolomide hydrochloride', 'Cosopt', 'Dorzolamide (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Dorzolamide/timolol, sold under the brand name Cosopt among others, is a medication used to treat high pressure inside the eye including glaucoma. It is a combination of dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate. It may be used when a beta blocker, like timolol, is not sufficient alone. It is used as an eye drop. Common side effects include eye discomfort, eye redness, taste changes, and blurry vision. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions and heart failure. Use is not recommended in those with asthma, a sulfonamide allergy, or a slow heart rate. Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and timolol is a beta blocker. Both work by decreasing the amount of aqueous humor made by the eye. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 225th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Adverse effects == Common adverse effects include temporarily blurred vision, cloudy vision, double vision, temporary burning/stinging/itching of the eye, watery eyes, feeling as if something is in the eye, drooping eyelid, sensitivity to light, cough, flu symptoms, nausea, and stomach pain. More serious adverse effects include dizziness, slow or irregular heartbeat, muscle weakness, mental/mood changes, and coldness/numbness/pain in the hands or feet. == Pharmacology == Dorzolamide is a human carboanhydrase II inhibitor. Inhibition of carboanhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion supposedly by decreasing the formation rate of bicarbonate ions. This results in reduction in both sodium and fluid transport. Timolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. == Comparison to other products == Despite each of the active ingredients being availed in their own respective formulations, combination formulations are typically more convenient for the patient without sacrificing any quality in therapy. In the case of Cosopt, the combination formulation dosed twice daily provides equivalent treatment to both dorzolamide 2% dosed two times daily and timolol 0.5% dosed three times daily. Specifically, the mean reduction in intraocular pressure was 27.4% for the combination product, 15.5% for dorzolamide 2%, and 22.2% for timolol 0.5%. Compared to other products such as latanoprost, both are equally efficacious with regard to lowering intraocular pressure and getting patients to reach their target intraocular pressure. Cosopt, though, is typically less well tolerated than other treatments due to a well documented feeling of ocular burning upon administration. == History == Cosopt gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in April 1998 and was supplied initially by Merck. In 2016, Merck & Co. had $95.3 billion in total assets, $40.3 billion in total equity, $24.3 billion in long term debt, and $13.4 billion in working capital. This same year Merck & Co spent $20 billion total split virtually evenly between research and development (R&D) and marketing efforts. Cosopt had annual sales of $342 million during the 12 months before June 2008. In September 2013, Merck & Co. sold the U.S. rights to their ophthalmic product line (including Cosopt) to Akorn Inc. for $52.8 million cash. Upon the original patent expiration, Hi-Tech Pharma was the first of many generic competitors to submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate eye drops. Hi-Tech Pharma's ANDA was approved on 28 October 2008. At the time, controversy surrounded the approval of this first ANDA. Hi-Tech sued the FDA for their right to 180 market exclusivity as laid out in the Hatch-Waxman Act. Apotex, another firm seeking an ANDA approval for generic Cosopt, argued that Hi-Tech ""forfeited its rights to market exclusivity because it has failed to market the drug within 30 months of its ANDA submission or within 75 days after Merck withdrew its patent information."" The FDA upheld their previous exclusivity decisions on acarbose and granisetron, allowing both Hi-Tech and Apotex to make a generic version of Cosopt. Soon after, ANDAs from Sandoz, Bausch & Laumb, Teva and others were also approved. Just over a year before Merck sold their ophthalmic line to Akorn, Akorn developed a new formulation of dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate called Cosopt PF, which is simply a preservative free formulation of Cosopt. == References ==",Cosopt,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.52720492426306e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021181246847845614)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/cosopt.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/cosopt.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorzolamide/timolol ', [])"
4201,"('Dimethyl sulfoxide', 'Methyl sulfoxide', 'Methylsulfinylmethane', 'Dimethylsulfoxide', 'Dimethyl sulphoxide')","Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2S=O. This colorless liquid is the sulfoxide most widely used commercially. It is an important polar aprotic solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds and is miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. It has a relatively high boiling point. DMSO is metabolised to compounds that leave a garlic-like taste in the mouth after DMSO is absorbed by skin. In terms of chemical structure, the molecule has idealized Cs symmetry. It has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry consistent with other three-coordinate S(IV) compounds, with a nonbonded electron pair on the approximately tetrahedral sulfur atom. == Synthesis and production == Dimethyl sulfoxide was first synthesized in 1866 by the Russian scientist Alexander Zaytsev, who reported his findings in 1867. Its modern use as an industrial solvent began through popularization by Thor Smedslund at the Stepan Chemical Company. Dimethyl sulfoxide is produced industrially from dimethyl sulfide, a by-product of the Kraft process, by oxidation with oxygen or nitrogen dioxide. == Reactions == === Reactions with electrophiles === The sulfur center in DMSO is nucleophilic toward soft electrophiles and the oxygen is nucleophilic toward hard electrophiles. With methyl iodide it forms trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, [(CH3)3SO]+I−: (CH3)2SO + CH3I → [(CH3)3SO]I This salt can be deprotonated with sodium hydride to form the sulfur ylide: [(CH3)3SO]I + NaH → (CH3)2S(CH2)O + NaI + H2 === Acidity === The methyl groups of DMSO are only weakly acidic, with a pKa = 35. For this reason, the basicities of many weakly basic organic compounds have been examined in this solvent. Deprotonation of DMSO requires strong bases like lithium diisopropylamide and sodium hydride. Stabilization of the resultant carbanion is provided by the S(O)R group. The sodium derivative of DMSO formed in this way is referred to as dimsyl sodium. It is a base, e.g., for the deprotonation of ketones to form sodium enolates, phosphonium salts to form Wittig reagents, and formamidinium salts to form diaminocarbenes. The dimsyl anion is a potent nucleophile. === Oxidant === In organic synthesis, DMSO is used as a mild oxidant. It forms the basis of several selective sulfonium-based oxidation reactions including the Pfitzner–Moffatt oxidation, Corey–Kim oxidation and the Swern oxidation. The Kornblum oxidation is conceptually similar. These methods all involve formation of an intermediate sulfonium species (R2S+OX) where X is a heteroatom attached to oxygen). === Ligand and Lewis base === Related to its ability to dissolve many salts, DMSO is a common ligand in coordination chemistry. Illustrative is the complex dichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium(II) (RuCl2(dmso)4). In this complex, three DMSO ligands are bonded to ruthenium through sulfur. The fourth DMSO is bonded through oxygen. In general, the oxygen-bonded mode is more common. In carbon tetrachloride solutions DMSO functions as a Lewis base with a variety of Lewis acids such as I2, phenols, trimethyltin chloride, metalloporphyrins, and the dimer Rh2Cl2(CO)4. The donor properties are discussed in the ECW model. The relative donor strength of DMSO toward a series of acids, versus other Lewis bases, can be illustrated by C-B plots. == Applications == === Solvent === DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent and is less toxic than other members of this class, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). DMSO is frequently used as a solvent for chemical reactions involving salts, most notably Finkelstein reactions and other nucleophilic substitutions. It is also extensively used as an extractant in biochemistry and cell biology. Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of carbanions. A set of non-aqueous pKa values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution. Because of its high boiling point, 189 °C (372 °F), DMSO evaporates slowly at normal atmospheric pressure. Samples dissolved in DMSO cannot as easily be recovered compared to other solvents, as it is very difficult to remove all traces of DMSO by conventional rotary evaporation. One technique to fully recover samples is removal of the organic solvent by evaporation followed by addition of water (to dissolve DMSO) and cryodesiccation to remove both DMSO and water. Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, 18.5 °C (65.3 °F), means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid. In its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), it is a useful solvent for NMR spectroscopy, again due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of analytes, the simplicity of its own spectrum, and its suitability for high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies. Disadvantages to the use of DMSO-d6 are its high viscosity, which broadens signals, and its hygroscopicity, which leads to an overwhelming H2O resonance in the 1H-NMR spectrum. It can be mixed with CDCl3 or CD2Cl2 for lower viscosity and melting points. DMSO is used to dissolve test compounds in in vitro drug discovery and drug design screening programs, including high-throughput screening programs. This is because it is able to dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds, can be used to maintain stock solutions of test compounds (important when working with a large chemical library), is readily miscible with water and cell culture media, and has a high boiling point (this improves the accuracy of test compound concentrations by reducing room temperature evaporation). One limitation with DMSO is that it can affect cell line growth and viability, with low DMSO concentrations sometimes stimulating cell growth, and high DMSO concentrations sometimes inhibiting or killing cells. DMSO is used as a vehicle in in vivo studies of test compounds. It has, for example, been employed as a co-solvent to assist absorption of the flavonol glycoside Icariin in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. As with its use in in vitro studies, DMSO has some limitations in animal models. Pleiotropic effects can occur and, if DMSO control groups are not carefully planned, then solvent effects can falsely be attributed to the prospective drug. For example, even a very low dose of DMSO has a powerful protective effect against paracetamol (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice. DMSO finds some use in manufacturing processes to produce microelectronic devices. It is widely used to strip photoresist in TFT-LCD 'flat panel' displays and advanced packaging applications (such as wafer-level packaging / solder bump patterning). === Biology === DMSO is used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to inhibit secondary structures in the DNA template or the DNA primers. It is added to the PCR mix before reacting, where it interferes with the self-complementarity of the DNA, minimizing interfering reactions. DMSO in a PCR is applicable for supercoiled plasmids (to relax before amplification) or DNA templates with high GC-content (to decrease thermostability). For example, 10% final concentration of DMSO in the PCR mixture with Phusion decreases primer annealing temperature (i.e. primer melting temperature) by 5.5–6.0 °C (9.9–10.8 °F). It is well known as a reversible cell cycle arrester at phase G1 of human lymphoid cells. DMSO may also be used as a cryoprotectant, added to cell media to reduce ice formation and thereby prevent cell death during the freezing process. Approximately 10% may be used with a slow-freeze method, and the cells may be frozen at −80 °C (−112 °F) or stored in liquid nitrogen safely. In cell culture, DMSO is used to induce differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells into cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells. === Medicine === Use of DMSO in medicine dates from around 1963, when an Oregon Health & Science University Medical School team, headed by Stanley Jacob, discovered it could penetrate the skin and other membranes without damaging them and could carry other compounds into a biological system. In medicine, DMSO is predominantly used as a topical analgesic, a vehicle for topical application of pharmaceuticals, as an anti-inflammatory, and an antioxidant. Because DMSO increases the rate of absorption of some compounds through biological tissues, including skin, it is used in some transdermal drug delivery systems. Its effect may be enhanced with the addition of EDTA. It is frequently compounded with antifungal medications, enabling them to penetrate not just skin but also toenails and fingernails. DMSO has been examined for the treatment of numerous conditions and ailments, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use only for the symptomatic relief of patients with interstitial cystitis. A 1978 study concluded that DMSO brought significant relief to the majority of the 213 patients with inflammatory genitourinary disorders that were studied. In interventional radiology, DMSO is used as a solvent for ethylene vinyl alcohol in the Onyx liquid embolic agent, which is used in embolization, the therapeutic occlusion of blood vessels. In cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. Without it, up to 90% of frozen cells will become inactive. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO, a freezing medium, and 30% fetal bovine serum. In the cryogenic freezing of heteroploid cell lines (MDCK, VERO, etc.) a mixture of 10% DMSO with 90% EMEM (70% EMEM + 30% fetal bovine serum + antibiotic mixture) is used. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells. DMSO is metabolized by disproportionation to dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl sulfone. It is subject to renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood dimethyl sulfide, which may cause a blood borne halitosis symptom. === Alternative medicine === DMSO's popularity as an alternative medicine is stated to stem from a March 1980 60 Minutes documentary ""The Riddle of DMSO"" and April 1980 Time magazine article covering the treatments of ardent DMSO advocate Dr. Stanley Jacob beginning in the 1960s. The use of DMSO as an alternative treatment for cancer is of particular concern, as it has been shown to interfere with a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that DMSO has any effect, and most sources agree that its history of side effects when tested warrants caution when using it as a dietary supplement, for which it is marketed heavily with the usual disclaimer. DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures and the FDA has had a running battle with distributors. One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO for a variety of disorders and was consequently convicted of Medicare fraud. === Veterinary medicine === DMSO is commonly used in veterinary medicine as a liniment for horses, alone or in combination with other ingredients. In the latter case, often, the intended function of the DMSO is as a solvent, to carry the other ingredients across the skin. Also in horses, DMSO is used intravenously, again alone or in combination with other drugs. It is used alone for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure and/or cerebral edema in horses. === Taste === The perceived garlic taste upon skin contact with DMSO may be due to nonolfactory activation of TRPA1 receptors in trigeminal ganglia. Unlike dimethyl and diallyl disulfides (which have odors resembling garlic), mono- and tri- sulfides (which typically have foul odors), and similar odiferous sulfur compounds, the pure chemical DMSO is odorless. == Safety == === Toxicity === DMSO is a non-toxic solvent with a median lethal dose higher than ethanol (DMSO: LD50, oral, rat, 14,500 mg/kg; ethanol: LD50, oral, rat, 7,060 mg/kg). DMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous. Because DMSO easily penetrates the skin, substances dissolved in DMSO may quickly be absorbed. Glove selection is important when working with DMSO. Butyl rubber, fluoroelastomer, neoprene, or thick (15 mil / 0.4 mm) latex gloves are recommended. Nitrile gloves, which are very commonly used in chemical laboratories, may protect from brief contact but have been found to degrade rapidly with exposure to DMSO. === Regulation === In Australia, it is listed as a Schedule 4 (S4) Drug, and a company has been prosecuted for adding it to products as a preservative. === Clinical safety === Early clinical trials with DMSO were stopped because of questions about its safety, especially its ability to harm the eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported. On September 9, 1965, The Wall Street Journal reported that a manufacturer of the chemical warned that the death of an Irish woman after undergoing DMSO treatment for a sprained wrist may have been due to the treatment, although no autopsy was done, nor was a causal relationship established. Clinical research using DMSO was halted and did not begin again until the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published findings in favor of DMSO in 1972. In 1978, the US FDA approved DMSO for treating interstitial cystitis. In 1980, the US Congress held hearings on claims that the FDA was slow in approving DMSO for other medical uses. In 2007, the US FDA granted ""fast track"" designation on clinical studies of DMSO's use in reducing brain tissue swelling following traumatic brain injury. DMSO exposure to developing mouse brains can produce brain degeneration. This neurotoxicity could be detected at doses as low as 0.3 mL/kg, a level exceeded in children exposed to DMSO during bone marrow transplant. === Odor problem === DMSO disposed into sewers can cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under hypoxic (anoxic) conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage. However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless because of the lack of C-S-C (sulfide) and C-S-H (mercaptan) linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains. === Explosion hazard === Dimethyl sulfoxide can produce an explosive reaction when exposed to acyl chlorides; at a low temperature, this reaction produces the oxidant for Swern oxidation. DMSO can decompose at the boiling temperature of 189 °C at normal pressure, possibly leading to an explosion. The decomposition is catalyzed by acids and bases and therefore can be relevant at even lower temperatures. A strong to explosive reaction also takes place in combination with halogen compounds, metal nitrides, metal perchlorates, sodium hydride, periodic acid and fluorinating agents. == See also == Varying oxidation of sulfur Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the corresponding sulfide, also produced by marine phytoplankton and emitted to the oceanic atmosphere where it is oxidized to DMSO, SO2 and sulfate Dimethyl sulfone, commonly known as methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), a related chemical often marketed as a dietary supplement Related compounds with methyl on oxygen Dimethyl sulfite, the corresponding sulfite Dimethyl sulfate (also DMS), the corresponding sulfate: a mutagenic alkylating compound Methyl methanesulfonate, another methylating agent Death of Gloria Ramirez, where DMSO taken by a terminally ill patient caused medical staff to fall ill == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0459 Dimethyl Sulfoxide Information Center",Dimethyl sulphoxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IND', -0.5760260820388794), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -1.700132997939363e-05), (' MED', -0.008465406484901905), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.06218428909778595), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0005911033367738128), ('ĠMED', -0.0008126770262606442), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2520212233066559)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.12692810595035553), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' INDUSTR', -2.7610454708337784e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL; ([healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-dmso?utm_source=openai), [webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/dmso-uses-and-risks?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=292, start_index=21, title='DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide): Uses, Benefits, Risks, and More', type='url_citation', url='https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-dmso?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=292, start_index=21, title='DMSO: Uses and Risks', type='url_citation', url='https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/dmso-uses-and-risks?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=292, start_index=21, title='Dimethyl sulfoxide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide?utm_source=openai')])"
4202,"('Phenformin hcl', 'Meltrol', 'Phenethylbiguanide hydrochloride', 'Dipar', 'Phenformin.hcl')",Medical,"Phenformin is an antidiabetic drug from the biguanide class. It was marketed as DBI by Ciba-Geigy, but was withdrawn from most markets in the late 1970s due to a high risk of lactic acidosis, which was fatal in 50% of cases. Phenformin was developed in 1957 by Ungar, Freedman and Seymour Shapiro, working for the U.S. Vitamin Corporation. Clinical trials begun in 1958 showed it to be effective, but with gastrointestinal side effects. == Toxicity == Phenformin sales began to decline in the U.S. from 1973 due to negative trial studies and reports of lactic acidosis. By October 1976, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Endocrinology and Metabolism Advisory Committee recommended phenformin be removed from the market. The FDA began formal proceedings in May 1977, leading to Phenformin's eventual withdrawal on November 15, 1978. In 1977, 385,000 patients with early-stage diabetes were taking phenformin in the U.S.. Ralph Nader's Health Research Group put the U.S. government under pressure to ban the drug. Ciba-Geigy Corp resisted, claiming there was no satisfactory alternative for many patients. But in July the FDA declared the drug an ""imminent hazard to the public health"" and gave doctors 90 days to switch to an alternative treatment (such as insulin, dietary restrictions or other drugs). As of 2008, phenformin was still legally available in Italy, Brazil, Uruguay, China, Poland, Greece and Portugal and cases of phenformin-induced lactic acidosis continued to be reported worldwide. In Hong Kong, where phenformin is banned, cases of phenformin-induced lactic acidosis occurred after taking Chinese proprietary medicines, claiming to be herbal, which were adulterated with phenformin. In the U.S., in 2001 the FDA recalled Chinese ""herbal products"" containing phenformin. The related drug metformin is considerably safer than phenformin, with three cases of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient-years compared to 64 cases per 100,000 patient-years, and those are mostly confined to patients with impaired renal function. == Chemistry and pharmacokinetics == Phenformin hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder, with a melting point of 175–178 °C; it is soluble at 1 in 8 parts of water and 1 in 15 of ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Phenformin is less polar and more lipid soluble and exhibits a higher affinity for mitochondrial membranes than metformin. Its dissociation constant (pKa) is 2.7, 11.8 (at 32 °C), and log P = –0.8. Phenformin is well absorbed after oral administration. The major metabolic reaction is aromatic hydroxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenformin, which is then conjugated with glucuronic acid. Up to about 50% of a dose is excreted in the urine in 24 h, about two–thirds in the form of unchanged drug and one–third as the hydroxy metabolite. Following a single oral dose of 50 mg to eight subjects, peak plasma concentrations of 0.08–0.18 mg/L (mean 0.13) were attained in about 3 h; plasma concentrations were higher in four subjects who were poor metabolisers of debrisoquine in comparison with the four extensive metabolisers. Following daily oral doses of 50 mg three times a day to eight subjects, plasma concentrations of 0.10–0.24 mg/L (mean 0.18) were reported 2 h after a dose. Plasma half-life of phenformin is 10–15 h. Phenformin protein binding in plasma is about 12–20%. == Research == Vladimir Dilman first proposed in 1971 that biguanides like metformin and phenformin may have potential to treat cancer, prevent cancer, and to extend life, an idea that was subsequently supported by in vitro and animal studies, as well as an apparent reduction in the incidence of cancer in people taking metformin for diabetes. Laboratory studies attribute these apparent effects to inhibition of mTOR, inhibition of complex I, with phenformin being a more potent inhibitor than metformin, It appears that inhibition of complex I may cause diminished TCA cycle intermediate production and decreased mitochondrial ATP production thus resulting in AMPK activation and lower mTOR activity. == See also == Buformin == References ==",Dipar,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.10491856187582016), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.3871331512928009), (' INDUSTR', -0.018287600949406624), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3153412938117981), ('ICAL', -6.794906312279636e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25201845169067383)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4204,"('Norethynodrel', 'Noretynodrel', 'Norethinodrel', 'Lynestrol', 'Enidrel')",Medical,"Oxazepam is a short-to-intermediate-acting benzodiazepine. Oxazepam is used for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and to control symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It is a metabolite of diazepam, prazepam, and temazepam, and has moderate amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties compared to other benzodiazepines. It was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. == Medical uses == Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine with a slow onset of action, so it is usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Oxazepam is sometimes prescribed off-label to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions. == Side effects == The side effects of oxazepam are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, and may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, memory impairment, paradoxical excitement, and anterograde amnesia, but does not affect transient global amnesia. Withdrawal effects due to rapid decreases in dosage or abrupt discontinuation of oxazepam may include abdominal and muscle cramps, seizures, depression, insomnia, sweating, tremors, or nausea and vomiting. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal === Oxazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from oxazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur, though, at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. == Contraindications == Oxazepam is contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and limited pulmonary reserve, as well as severe hepatic disease. == Special precautions == Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines including oxazepam are lipophilic drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in floppy infant syndrome. === Pregnancy === Oxazepam, when taken during the third trimester, causes a definite risk to the neonate, including a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including hypotonia, reluctance to suck, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. == Interactions == As oxazepam is an active metabolite of diazepam, an overlap in possible interactions is likely with other drugs or food, with exception of the pharmacokinetic CYP450 interactions (e.g. with cimetidine). Precautions and following the prescription are required when taking oxazepam (or other benzodiazepines) in combinations with antidepressants or opioids. Concurrent use of these medications can interact in a way that is difficult to predict. Drinking alcohol when taking oxazepam is not recommended. Concomitant use of oxazepam and alcohol can lead to increased sedation, memory impairment, ataxia, decreased muscle tone, and, in severe cases or in predisposed patients, respiratory depression and coma. == Overdose == Oxazepam is generally less toxic in overdose than other benzodiazepines. Important factors which affect the severity of a benzodiazepine overdose include the dose ingested, the age of the patient, and health status prior to overdose. Benzodiazepine overdoses can be much more dangerous if a coingestion of other CNS depressants such as opiates or alcohol has occurred. Symptoms of an oxazepam overdose include: Respiratory depression Excessive somnolence Altered consciousness Central nervous system depression Occasionally cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity Rarely, deep coma == Pharmacology == Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine of the 3-hydroxy family; it acts on benzodiazepine receptors, resulting in increased effect of GABA to the GABAA receptor which results in inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. The half-life of oxazepam is between 6 and 9 hours. It has been shown to suppress cortisol levels. Oxazepam is the most slowly absorbed and has the slowest onset of action of all the common benzodiazepines according to one British study. Oxazepam is an active metabolite formed during the breakdown of diazepam, nordazepam, and certain similar drugs. It may be safer than many other benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function because it does not require hepatic oxidation, but rather, it is simply metabolized by glucuronidation, so oxazepam is less likely to accumulate and cause adverse reactions in the elderly or people with liver disease. Oxazepam is similar to lorazepam in this respect. Preferential storage of oxazepam occurs in some organs, including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate, and withdrawal of oxazepam during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as oxazepam is excreted in breast milk. Two milligrams of oxazepam equates to 1 mg of diazepam according to the benzodiazepine equivalency converter, therefore 20 mg of oxazepam according to BZD equivalency equates to 10 mg of diazepam and 15 mg oxazepam to 7.5 mg diazepam (rounded up to 8 mg of diazepam). Some BZD equivalency converters use 3 to 1 (oxazepam to diazepam), 1 to 3 (diazepam to oxazepam) as the ratio (3:1 and 1:3), so 15 mg of oxazepam would equate to 5 mg of diazepam. == Chemistry == Oxazepam exists as a racemic mixture. Early attempts to isolate enantiomers were unsuccessful; the corresponding acetate has been isolated as a single enantiomer. Given the different rates of epimerization that occur at different pH levels, it was determined that there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the racemic mixture. == Frequency of use == Oxazepam, along with diazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam, were the four benzodiazepines listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and represented 82% of the benzodiazepine prescriptions in Australia in 1990–1991. It is in several countries the benzodiazepine of choice for novice users, due to a low chance of accumulation and a relatively slow absorption speed. == Society and culture == === Misuse === Oxazepam has the potential for misuse, defined as taking the drug to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse. However, due to its slow rate of absorption and its slow onset of action, oxazepam has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or triazolam. This is similar to the varied potential for abuse between different drugs of the barbiturate class. === Legal status === Oxazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. === Brand names === Oxazepam is marketed under many brand names worldwide, including: Alepam, Alepan, Anoxa, Anxiolit, Comedormir, durazepam, Murelax, Nozepam, Oksazepam, Opamox, Ox-Pam, Oxa-CT, Oxabenz, Oxamin, Oxapam, Oxapax, Oxascand, Oxaze, Oxazepam, Oxazépam, Oxazin, Oxepam, Praxiten, Purata, Selars, Serax, Serepax, Seresta, Séresta, Serpax, Sobril, Tazepam, Vaben, and Youfei. It is also marketed in combination with hyoscine as Novalona and in combination with alanine as Pausafrent T. === In popular culture === In Scrabble, ""Oxazepam"" is considered the third-highest scoring word, scoring 392 points when played in the ideal spot. == Environmental concerns == In 2013, a laboratory study which exposed European perch to oxazepam concentrations equivalent to those present in European rivers (1.8 μg/L) found that they exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. In 2016, a follow-up study which exposed salmon smolt to oxazepam for seven days before letting them migrate observed increased intensity of migratory behaviour compared to controls. A 2019 study associated this faster, bolder behaviour in exposed smolt to increased mortality due to a higher likelihood of being predated on. On the other hand, a 2018 study from the same authors, which kept 480 European perch and 12 northern pikes in 12 ponds over 70 days, half of them control and half spiked with oxazepam, found no significant difference in either perch growth or mortality. However, it suggested that the latter could be explained by the exposed perch and pike being equally hampered by oxazepam, rather than the lack of an overall effect. Lastly, a 2021 study built on these results by comparing two whole lakes filled with perch and pikes - one control while the other was exposed to oxazepam 11 days into experiment, at concentrations between 11 and 24 μg/L, which is 200 times greater than the reported concentrations in the European rivers. Even so, there were no measurable effects on pike behaviour after the addition of oxazepam, while the effects on perch behaviour were found to be negligible. The authors concluded that the effects previously attributed to oxazepam were instead likely caused by a combination of fish being stressed by human handling and small aquaria, followed by being exposed to a novel environment. == References == == External links == Inchem - Oxazepam",Enidrel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.698698704596609e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.08056386560201645), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011289878748357296)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([precision.fda.gov](https://precision.fda.gov/uniisearch/srs/unii/88181ACA0M?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=106, start_index=9, title='UNII - 88181ACA0M', type='url_citation', url='https://precision.fda.gov/uniisearch/srs/unii/88181ACA0M?utm_source=openai')])"

It is an analogue of fentanyl with around one-fourth to one-tenth the potency, one-third the duration of action, and an onset of action four times faster than that of fentanyl. Alfentanil has a pKa of approximately 6.5, which leads to a very high proportion of the drug being uncharged at physiologic pH, a characteristic responsible for its rapid-onset. It is an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor. While alfentanil tends to cause fewer cardiovascular complications than other similar drugs such as fentanyl and remifentanil, it tends to give stronger respiratory depression and so requires careful monitoring of breathing and vital signs. Almost exclusively used by anesthesia providers during portions of a case where quick, fast-acting (though not long-lasting) pain control is needed (as, for example, during nerve blocks), alfentanil is administered by the parenteral (injected) route for fast-onset and precise control of dosage. Discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1976, alfentanil is classified as a Schedule II drug in the United States. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself and include itching, nausea and potentially life-threatening respiratory depression.

4206,"('Sodium fusidate', 'Fusidic acid sodium')",Medical,"Fusidic acid, sold under the brand name Fucidin among others, is a steroid antibiotic that is often used topically in creams or ointments and eyedrops but may also be given systemically as tablets or injections. As of October 2008, the global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in its use. == Medical uses == Fusidic acid is active in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, most coagulase-positive staphylococci, Beta-hemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium species, and most clostridium species. Fusidic acid has no known useful activity against enterococci or most Gram-negative bacteria (except Neisseria, Moraxella, Legionella pneumophila, and Bacteroides fragilis). Fusidic acid is active in vitro and clinically against Mycobacterium leprae but has only marginal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One use of fusidic acid is its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to fusidic acid, there is a low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation is all that is required), fusidic acid should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere. However, resistance selection is low when pathogens are challenged at high drug exposure. Topical fusidic acid is occasionally used as a treatment for acne vulgaris. As a treatment for acne, fusidic acid is often partially effective at improving acne symptoms. However, research studies have indicated that fusidic acid is not as highly active against Cutibacterium acnes as many other antibiotics that are commonly used as acne treatments. Fusidic acid is also found in several additional topical skin and eye preparations (e.g., Fucibet), although its use for these purposes is controversial. == Side effects == Fucidin tablets and suspension, whose active ingredient is sodium fusidate, occasionally cause liver damage, which can produce jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes). This condition will almost always get better after the patient finishes taking Fucidin tablets or suspension. Other related side-effects include dark urine and lighter-than-usual feces. These, too, should normalize when the course of treatment is completed. == Pharmacology == Fusidic acid acts as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by preventing the turnover of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. Fusidic acid is effective primarily on Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species. Fusidic acid is a tetracyclic, naturally occurring steroid derived from the fungus Fusidium coccineum. It was first isolated in 1960 and developed by Leo Pharma in Ballerup, Denmark, being used clinically from 1962 onwards. It has also been isolated from Mucor ramannianus, an Acremonium species, and Isaria kogana. The drug is licensed for use as its sodium salt sodium fusidate, and it is approved for use under prescription in Australia, Canada, Colombia, the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. == Mechanism of action == Fusidic acid binds to EF-G after translocation and GTP (guanosine-5'-triphosphate) hydrolysis. This interaction prevents the necessary conformational changes for EF-G release from the ribosome, effectively blocking the protein synthesis process. Fusidic acid can only bind to EF-G in the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. Since translocation is a part of elongation and ribosome recycling, fusidic acid can block either or both steps of protein synthesis. == Dose == Fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat S. aureus infections when used at low drug dosages. However, it may be possible to use fusidic acid as monotherapy when used at higher doses. The use of topical preparations (skin creams and eye ointments) containing fusidic acid is strongly associated with the development of resistance, and there are voices advocating against the continued use of fusidic acid monotherapy in the community. Topical preparations used in Europe often contain fusidic acid and gentamicin in combination, which helps to prevent the development of resistance. === Cautions === There is inadequate evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Animal studies and many years of clinical experience suggest that fusidic acid is devoid of teratogenic effects (birth defects), but fusidic acid can cross the placental barrier. == Resistance == In vitro susceptibility studies of US strains of several bacterial species such as S. aureus, including MRSA and coagulase negative Staphylococcus, indicate potent activity against these pathogens. Mechanisms of resistance have been extensively studied only in Staphylococcus aureus. The most studied mechanism is the development of point mutations in fusA, the chromosomal gene that codes for EF-G. The mutation alters EF-G so that fusidic acid is no longer able to bind to it. Resistance is readily acquired when fusidic acid is used alone and commonly develops during the course of treatment. As with most other antibiotics, resistance to fusidic acid arises less frequently when used in combination with other drugs. For this reason, fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat serious Staph. aureus infections. However, at least in Canadian hospitals, data collected between 1999 and 2005 showed rather low rate of resistance of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant to fusidic acid, and mupirocin was found to be the more problematic topical antibiotic for the aforementioned conditions. Some bacteria also display 'FusB-type' resistance, which has been found to be the most prevalent in Staphylococcus spp. in many clinical isolates. This resistance mechanism is mediated by fusB, fusC, and fusD genes found primarily on plasmids, but have also been found in chromosomal DNA. The product of fusB-type resistance genes is a 213-residue cytoplasmic protein which interacts in a 1:1 ratio with EF-G. FusB-type proteins bind in a region distinct from fusidic acid to induce a conformational change which results in liberation of EF-G from the ribosome, allowing the elongation factor to participate in another round of ribosome translocation. == Interactions == Fusidic acid should not be used with quinolone antibiotics, with which it is antagonistic. Although clinical practice over the past decade has supported the combination of fusidic acid and rifampicin, a recent clinical trial showed that there is an antagonistic interaction when both antibiotics are combined.

They were then characterized for their probiotic potential. Among 900 bacterial isolates, 47 LAB exhibiting anti-P. expansum activity were identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as Levilactobacillus brevis (25), Lactococcus lactis (3), Enterococcus faecium (12), Enterococcus faecalis (4), Enterococcus casseliflavus (1), and Enterococcus mundtii (2). Sixty-two percent of the strains were tolerant to 100 mg/L of lysozyme. Seventy two percent of the isolates were able to survive at pH 3 and most of them tolerate 2.5% bile salt concentration. Moreover, 23% of the strains displayed bile salt hydrolase activity. Interestingly, all strains were biofilm strong producers. However, their auto- and co-aggregation properties were time and pH dependent with high aggregative potentiality at pH 4.5 after 24 h. Remarkably, 48.94% of the strains showed high affinity to chloroform. The safety assessment revealed that the 47 LAB had no hemolytic activity and 64% of them lacked mucin degradation activity. All isolated strains were susceptible to gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Overall, 43 LAB strains showed inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and yeast. Our findings suggest that L. brevis (EVM12 and EVM14) and Ent. faecium HAS34 strains could be potential candidates for probiotics with interesting antibacterial and anti-P. expansum activities. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) raises questions on qualified presumptive safety status and poses challenge of AMR transmission in food milieu. This study focuses on isolation, identification and characterization of AMR in LAB prevalent in traditional fermented Indian food products. The analysis of 16SrRNA based phylogenetic tree showed placements of isolates among four different genera  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10068-023-01305-1. We attempted to isolate lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the marine oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and selected several environmental stress-resistant isolates for the development of a future probiotic adjuvant for marine aquaculture. Twenty-six presumptive LAB isolates were extracted from oysters and screened (by an agar diffusion assay) for antimicrobial activity toward various pathogens: Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Streptococcus iniae, and Edwardsiella tarda. Eight isolates had an antibacterial activity toward V. parahaemolyticus; in particular, 6 isolates showed a growth-inhibitory activity, with inhibition zone diameters > 15 mm. Of these, 5 isolates (JL17, JL18, JL28, HL7, and HL32) were also active against S. iniae and E. tarda. Enterococcus faecium HL7 was selected as the isolate most resistant to environmental stressors: the minimum NaCl, ethanol, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations at which HL7 cells lost their viability were 1.9 M, 11%, and 0.013%, respectively. When an antibiotic sensitivity test was performed on E. faecium HL7, this isolate was found to be resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cephalothin, ampicillin, rifampin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, cefepime, cefotetan, nalidixic acid, and kanamycin.

Low bioavailability of α-TOS is the major problem encountered with formulation development. In our study, α-TOS nanoemulsion (α-TOS-NE) was demonstrated as a new drug delivery system of α-TOS to increase the bioavailability. MTT-based cytotoxicity assay and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔY) were performed on human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and human oral epithelial cancer cell lines KB to evaluate in vitro anticancer efficacy of α-TOS-NE. In comparison with free α-TOS, α-TOS-NE exhibited a stronger cytotoxicity and decreased ΔΨ. Pharmacokinetic profiles of I.V. α-TOS-NE group, I.P. α-TOS-NE group, and I.P. free α-TOS group (7% DMSO/93% PEG) were drawn. First of all, nanoemultion (NE) enables the I.V. injection of α-TOS, make it possible to be an I.V. preparation. Second, compare to the I.P. free α-TOS group, I.P. α-TOS-NE group had a higher bioavailability. Thus, NE improved the strong anti-cancer efficacy of α-TOS while increasing its in vivo bioavailability in rats. In conclusion, our laboratory-made NE was a safe drug delivery system for clinical trials and could be a promising formulation for α-TOS by I.V administration. The management of retinoblastoma (RB) involves the use of invasive treatment regimens. Paclitaxel (PTX), an effective antineoplastic compound used in the treatment of a wide range of malignant tumors, poses treatment challenges due to systemic toxicity, rapid elimination, and development of resistance. The goal of this work was to develop PTX-loaded, α-tocopherol succinate (αTS)-based, nanostructured lipid carrier (NLCs; αTS-PTX-NLC) and PEGylated αTS-PTX-NLC (αTS-PTX-PEG-NLC) to improve ocular bioavailability. The hot homogenization method was used to prepare the NLCs, and repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used for formulation optimization. αTS-PTX-NLC and αTS-PTX-PEG-NLC had a mean particle size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of 186.2 ± 3.9 nm, 0.17 ± 0.03, −33.2 ± 1.3 mV and 96.2 ± 3.9 nm, 0.27 ± 0.03, −39.15 ± 3.2 mV, respectively. The assay and entrapment efficiency of both formulations was >95.0%. The NLC exhibited a spherical shape, as seen from TEM images. Sterilized (autoclaved) formulations were stable for up to 60 days (last time point checked) under refrigerated conditions. PTX-NLC formulations exhibited an initial burst release and 40% drug release, overall, in 48 h. The formulations exhibited desirable physicochemical properties and could lead to an effective therapeutic option in the management of RB. Targeted drugs have been used to treat mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer; however, targeting and penetrating intracellular organelles remains a challenge. Dominant targeting approaches for therapeutic delivery are detailed in many nanoemulsion studies and show the tremendous potential of targeted delivery to inhibit cancer cell growth. Dequalinium (DQA) and α-tocopherol succinate (α-TOS) are good agents for targeting mitochondria. In this study, we aimed to develop a mitochondria-targeting emulsion, using DQA and α-TOS (DTOS), for cancer treatment. DTOS emulsions of 150-170 nm in diameter were formulated using homogenization. DQA and α-TOS were used as bifunctional agents (surfactants) to stabilize the nanoemulsion and anticancer drugs. Various molar ratios of DQA and α-TOS were tested to determine the optimal condition, and DTOS 5-5 was selected for further study. The DTOS emulsion showed improved stability, as evidenced by its ability to remain stable for three years at room temperature. This stability, combined with its effective targeting of mitochondria, led to inhibition of 71.5% of HeLa cells after 24 h. The DTOS emulsion effectively inhibited spheroid growth in the 3D model, as well as prevented the growth of HeLa cells grafted onto zebrafish larvae. These results highlight the DTOS emulsion's promising potential for mitochondria-targeting and cancer treatment.",Alpha-tocopherol succinate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002627662615850568), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.03964194655418396), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.12695954740047455), ('ĠFOOD', -0.14113499224185944), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03809477761387825)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.1968661993741989), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.306760805164231e-05), (' FOOD', -0.16053219139575958)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24364743/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31619606/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11895920/ ', [])"
4209,"('Prazosin hydrochloride', 'Prazosin hcl', 'Minipress', 'Vasoflex', 'Peripress')",Medical,"Prazosin, sold under the brand name Minipress among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, symptoms of an enlarged prostate, and nightmares related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is an α1 blocker. It is a less preferred treatment of high blood pressure. Other uses may include heart failure and Raynaud syndrome. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and heart palpitations. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure with standing and depression. Prazosin is a non-selective inverse agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptors. It works to decrease blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and helps with an enlarged prostate by relaxing the outflow of the bladder. How it works in PTSD is not entirely clear. Prazosin was patented in 1965 and came into medical use in 1974. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 183rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Prazosin is active after taken by mouth and has a minimal effect on cardiac function due to its α1-adrenergic receptor selectivity. When prazosin is started, however, heart rate and contractility can increase in order to maintain the pre-treatment blood pressures because the body has reached homeostasis at its abnormally high blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect becomes apparent when prazosin is taken for longer periods of time. The heart rate and contractility go back down over time and blood pressure decreases. The antihypertensive characteristics of prazosin make it a second-line choice for the treatment of high blood pressure. Prazosin is also useful in treating urinary hesitancy associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, blocking α1-adrenergic receptors, which control constriction of both the prostate and urethra. Although not a first-line choice for either hypertension or benign prostatic hyperplasia, it is a choice for people who present with both problems concomitantly. During its use for urinary hesitancy in military veterans in the 1990s, Murray A. Raskind and colleagues discovered that prazosin appeared to be effective in reducing nightmares. Subsequent reviews indicate prazosin is effective in improving sleep quality and treating nightmares related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prazosin is used off-label in the treatment of insomnia for its sedative effects. Prazosin is an inverse agonist at α1-adrenergic receptors; these receptors are expressed on dendrites that noradrenergic neurons synapse onto in the brain. Some of the noradrenergic pathways in the central nervous system form part of the ascending reticular activating system, which promotes arousal when stimulated. Prazosin inhibits the output neurons of the noradrenergic pathways in that system, in turn causing sedation. The drug is usually recommended for severe stings from the Indian red scorpion. == Adverse effects == Common (4–10% frequency) side effects of prazosin include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fatigue, weakness, palpitations, and nausea. Less frequent (1–4%) side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, syncope, vertigo, depression, anxiety, nasal congestion, and rash. A very rare side effect of prazosin is priapism. One phenomenon associated with prazosin is known as the ""first-dose response"", in which the side effects of the drug — specifically orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and drowsiness — are especially pronounced in the first dose. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope are associated with the body's poor ability to control blood pressure without active α-adrenergic receptors. The nasal congestion is exacerbated by changing body positions, because α1-adrenergic receptors also control nasal vascular blood flow and alpha blockers inhibit this, in the same way that alpha-adrenergic agonists have the opposite effect of being a decongestant. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Prazosin is an α1-blocker that acts as a non-selective inverse agonist at α1-adrenergic receptors, including of the α1A-, α1B-, and α1D-adrenergic receptor subtypes. It binds to these receptors with affinity (Ki) values of 0.13 to 1.0 nM for the α1Α-adrenergic receptor, 0.06 to 0.62 nM for the α1B-adrenergic receptor, and 0.06 to 0.38 nM for the α1D-adrenergic receptor. It has much lower affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 210–5,012 nM for the α2A-adrenergic receptor, 13–398 nM for the α2B-adrenergic receptor, and 10–200 nM for the α2C-adrenergic receptor). The α1-adrenergic receptors are found in vascular smooth muscle, where they are responsible for the vasoconstrictive action of norepinephrine. They are also found throughout the central nervous system. α1-Adrenergic receptors have additionally been found on immune cells, where catecholamine binding can stimulate and enhance cytokine production. === Pharmacokinetics === Prazosin has an onset of action of 30 to 90 minutes, the elimination half-life of prazosin is 2 to 3 hours, and its duration of action is 10 to 24 hours. == Research == Prazosin has been said to be the only selective α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist which has been used in the treatment of insomnia to any significant degree. It is used at doses of 1 to 12 mg for this purpose. The combination of prazosin and the beta blocker timolol may produce greater sedative effects than either of them alone. Prazosin has been shown to prevent death in animal models of cytokine storm. As a repurposed drug, prazosin is being investigated for the prevention of cytokine storm syndrome and complications of COVID-19 where it is thought to decrease cytokine dysregulation. == References ==",Vasoflex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002542241709306836), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024920618161559105)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It was withdrawn from market worldwide in 1988 because it caused QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, greatly increasing the risk of sudden death. The cardiac side effects were not detected during clinical development, only becoming apparent after the drug was in wide use. == Mechanism of action == Prenylamine has two primary molecular targets in humans: calmodulin and myosin light-chain kinase 2, found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Pharmacologically, it decreases sympathetic stimulation on cardiac muscle, predominantly through partial depletion of catecholamines via competitive inhibition of reuptake by storage granules, leading to further depletion due to spontaneous leakage as a result of disturbance of equilibrium. This depletion mechanism is similar to that of reserpine because both agents target the same site on the storage granule; however, prenylamine shows a high affinity for cardiac tissue, while reserpine is more selective toward brain tissue. Prenylamine slows cardiac metabolism via calcium transport delay by blockade of magnesium-dependent calcium transport ATPase. It demonstrates beta blocker–like activity that results in reduction of heart rate but shows an opposing effect on tracheal tissue response. == References ==",Corontin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01606358028948307), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011623162776231766), ('ICAL', -1.0609570381348021e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062069348990917206)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/corontin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=112, start_index=9, title='Corontin | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/corontin?utm_source=openai')])"

Conivaptan inhibits two of the three subtypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2). Effectively, it causes iatrogenic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Conivaptan has not been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. However, in theory, vasopressin receptor antagonism would be particularly useful in this setting, and an initial study shows that it has some promise.

In the United States hyponatremia affects about four percent of hospitalized patients. Although many patients do not show symptoms, extreme cases may result in brain swelling, respiratory arrest and even death. Hypervolemic hyponatremia specifically is when the body’s serum sodium levels fall below the total body water increase, which results in edema. This is associated with congestive heart failure, liver disease and kidney failure. == Pharmacology == Conivaptan hydrochloride is an arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonist with affinity for human V1A and V2 receptors in the nanomolar range in vitro. AVP levels in blood are crucial for water and electrolyte regulation and balance. V2 receptors maintain plasma osmolality and are coupled to aquaporin channels in the collecting ducts of kidneys where they regulate AVP levels. Conivaptan hydrochloride functions by antagonizing V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts and thus causing aquaresis or water secretion. Typical pharmacodynamic effects of the drug are an increase in net fluid loss, increase in urine output, and decrease in the osmolality of urine. Conivaptan inhibits its own metabolism in the body, displaying non-linear pharmacokinetics. About 99% of conivaptan found is bound to human plasma proteins over the range of 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL. The mean half-life of the drug is 5 hours and mean clearance is 15.2 L/hr. == Adverse effects == Most adverse reactions to conivaptan are found at the site of infusion. Other complications include blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders as well as vascular disorders. There is risk of too rapid correction of hyponatremia causing fatal osmotic demyelination syndrome. == Chemistry == Conivaptan hydrochloride is an off-white or a pale yellow power with a solubility of 0.25 mg/mL in water at 23 °C. The injectable formulation consists of 20 mg conivaptan hydrochloride, 0.4 g ethanol, 1.2 g propylene glycol and water. == Development and commercialization == Conivaptan hydrochloride was discovered by Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals and marketed by Astellas. Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals filed a new drug application to the FDA for conivaptan hydrochloride to treat hyponatremia on 2 February 2004. On 1 December, Yamanouchi received approval for investigational hyponatremia treatment using conivaptan hydrochloride. Yamanouchi pharmaceuticals and Fujisawa Pharmaceuticlas merged and were renamed as Astellas’ in 2005. Astellas gained FDA approval for Conivaptan hydrochloride on 29 December 2005, and marked the drug under the brand name of Vaprisol in 2006. On 2 March 2007, vaprisol also gained FDA approval for the treatment of hypervolemia hyponatremia. On 22 October 2008, Vaprisol further gained approval as a 5% Dextrose premixed formulation for the treatment of hyponatremia. In 2014 Cumberland pharmaceuticals bought Vaprisol from Astellas and took full responsibility of all development and marketing of the drug. Cumberland Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company based in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to Vaprisol, Cumberland produces Acetadote, Caldolor, Kristalose, Omeclamox, and Ethyol. Hepatoren, Boxban, Vasculan, and currently in phase II clinical trials. Protaban, Methotrexate, and Totect are waiting for pre-approval. == References == == External links == ""Conivaptan"".

A neuroprotective and antioxidant flavonoid, rutin hydrate (RH), was evaluated for the anti-neuroinflammatory activity mediated by copper sulfate (CuSO Castanopsis tribuloides belongs to the oak species (Fagaceae) and it is commonly distributed in evergreen forests of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, China, and Thailand. Our present study aimed at uncovering the antipyretic potential of methanol extract of C. tribuloides bark (CTB) in the mice models. Baker's yeast pyrexia model was employed to determine the antipyretic potentials of the extract. Besides, molecular docking and dynamics simulation of CTB phenolic compounds were explored to validate the experimental results and gain insight into the possible antipyretic mechanism of action that can lead to the design and discovery of novel drugs against mPGES-1. The results revealed that CTB (400 mg/kg) significantly inhibited (P < 0.001) the elevated body temperature of mice since 0.5 h, which is more prominent than the standard. At dose 200 mg/kg, the bark extract also produced significant (P < 0.05) antipyretic activity since 2 h. HPLC-DAD analysis identified and quantified nine polyphenolic compounds from the extract, including rutin hydrate, (-) epicatechin, caffeic acid, catechin hydrate, catechol, trans-ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, and rosmarinic acid. Molecular docking study suggested probable competition of these phenolic compounds with glutathione, an essential cofactor for microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) activity. Additionally, RMSF, RMSD, Rg, and hydrogen bonds performed during MD simulations revealed that rutin hydrate (rich in CTB) bound to the mPGES-1 active site in a stable manner and thus inactivating mPGES-1. Therefore, it can be concluded that rutin hydrate reduces pyrexia in mice via downregulating PGE2 synthesis by inhibiting mPGES-1 activity. The aim of the presented study was to examine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of rutin hydrate (RH) alone and in combination with amikacin against 12 reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity assay was evaluated in the concentration range of 2-2048 µg/mL. A serial microdilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined compound against reference strains. RH showed varying potential against the tested strains with MICs ranging from 128 to 1024 µg/mL. In order to examine the combinatory profile of RH and amikacin, the fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) were determined. The RH-amikacin combination was more active against Gram-negative bacteria where four synergism and two additive interactions were noted. For four out of six Gram-positive isolates, an indifferent effect of RH and amikacin was demonstrated, and for two strains, the tested combination had an additive effect. The results of this study showed that RH possesses antimicrobial potential in vitro towards the tested reference isolates.

4217,"('Vitamin p', 'Quercetin-3-o-rutinose', 'Osyritin', 'Rutin', 'Sophorin')","Food, Medical","Rutin (rutoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside or sophorin) is the glycoside combining the flavonol quercetin and the disaccharide rutinose (α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranose). It is a flavonoid glycoside found in a wide variety of plants, including citrus. == Occurrences == Rutin is one of the phenolic compounds found in the plant species Carpobrotus edulis. Its name comes from the name of Ruta graveolens, a plant that also contains rutin. Various citrus fruit peels contain 32 to 49 mg/g of flavonoids expressed as rutin equivalents. Citrus leaves contain rutin at concentrations of 11 and 7 g/kg in orange and lime trees, respectively. In 2021, Samoan researchers identified rutin in the native plant matalafi (Psychotria insularum). == Metabolism == The enzyme quercitrinase found in Aspergillus flavus is in the rutin catabolic pathway. == In food == Rutin is a citrus flavonoid glycoside found in many plants, including buckwheat, the leaves and petioles of Rheum species, and asparagus. Tartary buckwheat seeds have been found to contain more rutin (about 0.8–1.7% dry weight) than common buckwheat seeds (0.01% dry weight). Rutin is one of the primary flavonols found in 'clingstone' peaches. It is also found in green tea infusions. Approximate rutin content of selected foods, in milligrams per 100 milliliters: == Research == Rutin (rutoside or rutinoside) and other dietary flavonols are under preliminary clinical research for their potential biological effects, such as in reducing post-thrombotic syndrome, venous insufficiency, or endothelial dysfunction, but there was no high-quality evidence for their safe and effective uses as of 2018. A 2020 review indicated that oral rutosides may reduce leg edema in people with post-thrombotic syndrome, but the risk of adverse effects was higher. As a flavonol among similar flavonoids, rutin has low bioavailability due to poor absorption, high metabolism, and rapid excretion that collectively make its potential for use as a therapeutic agent limited. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis pathway of rutin in mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaves begins with phenylalanine, which produces cinnamic acid under the action of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Cinnamic acid is catalyzed by cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) to form p-coumaroyl-CoA. Subsequently, chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the condensation of p-coumaroyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to produce naringenin chalcone, which is eventually converted into naringenin flavanone with the participation of chalcone isomerase (CHI). With the action of flavanone 3-hydroxylas (F3H), dihydrokaempferol (DHK) is generated. DHK can be further hydroxylated by flavonoid 3´-hydroxylase (F3'H) to produce dihydroquercetin (DHQ), which is then catalyzed by flavonol synthase (FLS) to form quercetin. After quercetin is catalyzed by UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) to form isoquercitrin, finally, the formation of rutin from isoquercitrin is catalyzed by flavonoid 3-O-glucoside L-rhamnosyltransferase. == References == == External links == Media related to Rutin at Wikimedia Commons",Sophorin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.00015097891446202993), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.0332908071577549), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.1603281944990158), ('ĠEND', -0.9660435914993286), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47419124841690063)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.invivochem.com/cytisine.html,https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB8495448.htm,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31215388/,https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/sophorin,https://www.invivochem.com/sophoricoside.html,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18975176/,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/W5S1M800J7 ', [])"

The medication available in low-dose and high-dose formulations and is used alone or in combination with an estrogen. It is ingested orally. Side effects of NETA include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and others. NETA is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. NETA was patented in 1957 and was introduced for medical use in 1964. It is sometimes referred to as a ""first-generation"" progestin. NETA is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == NETA is used as a hormonal contraceptive in combination with estrogen, in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as abnormal uterine bleeding, and as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. === Available forms === NETA is available in the form of tablets for use by mouth both alone and in combination with estrogens including estradiol, estradiol valerate, and ethinylestradiol. Transdermal patches providing a combination of 50 μg/day estradiol and 0.14 or 0.25 mg/day NETA are available under the brand names CombiPatch and Estalis. NETA was previously available for use by intramuscular injection in the form of ampoules containing 20 mg NETA, 5 mg estradiol benzoate, 8 mg estradiol valerate, and 180 mg testosterone enanthate in oil solution under the brand name Ablacton to suppress lactation in postpartum women. == Contraindications == == Side effects == Side effects of NETA include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and others. == Overdose == == Interactions == == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === NETA is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. Upon oral ingestion, it is rapidly converted into norethisterone by esterases during intestinal and first-pass hepatic metabolism. Hence, as a prodrug of norethisterone, NETA has essentially the same effects, acting as a potent progestogen with additional weak androgenic and estrogenic activity (the latter via its metabolite ethinylestradiol). ==== Progestogenic effects ==== In terms of dosage equivalence, norethisterone and NETA are typically used at respective dosages of 0.35 mg/day and 0.6 mg/day as progestogen-only contraceptives, and at respective dosages of 0.5–1 mg/day and 1–1.5 mg/day in combination with ethinylestradiol in combined oral contraceptives. Conversely, the two drugs have been used at about the same dosages in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. NETA is of about 12% higher molecular weight than norethisterone due to the presence of its C17β acetate ester. Micronization of NETA has been found to increase its potency by several-fold in animals and women. The endometrial transformation dosage of micronized NETA per cycle is 12 to 14 mg, whereas that for non-micronized NETA is 30 to 60 mg. ==== Estrogenic effects ==== NETA metabolizes into ethinylestradiol at a rate of 0.20 to 0.33% across a dose range of 10 to 40 mg. Peak levels of ethinylestradiol with a 10, 20, or 40 mg dose of NETA were 58, 178, and 231 pg/mL, respectively. For comparison, a 30 to 40 μg dose of oral ethinylestradiol typically results in a peak ethinylestradiol level of 100 to 135 pg/mL. As such, in terms of ethinylestradiol exposure, 10 to 20 mg NETA may be equivalent to 20 to 30 μg ethinylestradiol and 40 mg NETA may be similar to 50 μg ethinylestradiol. In another study however, 5 mg NETA produced an equivalent of 28 μg ethinylestradiol (0.7% conversion rate) and 10 mg NETA produced an equivalent of 62 μg ethinylestradiol (1.0% conversion rate). Due to its estrogenic activity via ethinylestradiol, high doses of NETA have been proposed for add-back in the treatment of endometriosis without estrogen supplementation. Generation of ethinylestradiol with high doses of NETA may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism but may also decrease menstrual bleeding relative to progestogen exposure alone. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== NETA has antigonadotropic effects via its progestogenic activity and can dose-dependently suppress gonadotropin and sex hormone levels in women and men. The ovulation-inhibiting dose of NETA is about 0.5 mg/day in women. In healthy young men, NETA alone at a dose of 5 to 10 mg/day orally for 2 weeks suppressed testosterone levels from ~527 ng/dL to ~231 ng/dL (–56%). == Chemistry == NETA, also known as norethinyltestosterone acetate, as well as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-acetate or 17α-ethynylestra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one 17β-acetate, is a progestin, or synthetic progestogen, of the 19-nortestosterone group, and a synthetic estrane steroid. It is the C17β acetate ester of norethisterone. NETA is a derivative of testosterone with an ethynyl group at the C17α position, the methyl group at the C19 position removed, and an acetate ester attached at the C17β position. In addition to testosterone, it is a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone). === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of NETA have been published. == History == Schering AG filed for a patent for NETA in June 1957, and the patent was issued in December 1960. The drug was first marketed, by Parke-Davis as Norlestrin in the United States, in March 1964. This was a combination formulation of 2.5 mg NETA and 50 μg ethinylestradiol and was indicated as an oral contraceptive. Other early brand names of NETA used in oral contraceptives included Minovlar and Anovlar. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Norethisterone acetate is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of NETA while norethindrone acetate is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia. === Brand names === NETA is marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world including Primolut-Nor (major), Aygestin (USTooltip United States), Gestakadin, Milligynon, Monogest, Norlutate (USTooltip United States, CATooltip Canada), Primolut N, SH-420 (UKTooltip United Kingdom), Sovel, and Styptin among others. === Availability === ==== United States ==== NETA is marketed in high-dose 5 mg oral tablets in the United States under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate for the treatment of gynecological disorders. In addition, it is available under a large number of brand names at much lower dosages (0.1 to 1 mg) in combination with estrogens such as ethinylestradiol and estradiol as a combined oral contraceptive and for use in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. == Research == NETA has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with testosterone in men. == See also == Ethinylestradiol/norethisterone acetate Norethisterone enanthate == References ==",Norethindrone acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7881233361549675e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019358720164746046)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a604034.html?utm_source=openai), [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/norethindrone-oral-route/description/drg-20137986?utm_source=openai), [my.clevelandclinic.org](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20808-norethindrone-acetate-tablets-hormone-replacement-therapy?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=383, start_index=9, title='Norethindrone: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a604034.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=383, start_index=9, title='Norethindrone (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/norethindrone-oral-route/description/drg-20137986?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=383, start_index=9, title='Norethindrone Acetate: Uses & Side Effects', type='url_citation', url='https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20808-norethindrone-acetate-tablets-hormone-replacement-therapy?utm_source=openai')])"

Here, using drug repositioning, we discovered that primaquine diphosphate (PD), previously known as an antimalarial drug, was a potential blocker of vascular leakage. PD inhibited the linear pattern of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)-induced disruption at the cell boundaries, blocked the formation of VEGF-induced actin stress fibers, and stabilized the cortactin actin rings in endothelial cells. PD significantly reduced leakage in the Miles assay and mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy. Targeted prediction programs and deubiquitinating enzyme activity assays identified a potential mechanism of action for PD and demonstrated that this operates via ubiquitin specific protease 1 (USP1).

4220,"('Guanfacine hydrochloride', 'Tenex', 'Intuniv', 'Guanfacine (hydrochloride)', 'Estulic')",Medical,"Guanfacine, sold under the brand name Tenex (immediate-release) and Intuniv (extended-release) among others, is an oral alpha-2a agonist medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and high blood pressure. Common side effects include sleepiness, constipation, and dry mouth. Other side effects may include low blood pressure and urinary problems. It appears to work by activating α2A-adrenergic receptors in the brain, thereby decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity. Guanfacine was first described by 1974 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 275th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. Guanfacine is approved by the US FDA for monotherapy treatment of ADHD, as well as being used for augmentation of stimulant medications. Guanfacine is also used off-label to treat tic disorders, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). == Medical uses == Guanfacine (as brand name Intuniv) is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications. Guanfacine (as brand name Tenex) is indicated in the management of hypertension. Unlike stimulant medications, guanfacine is regarded as having no abuse potential, and may even be used to reduce abuse of drugs including nicotine and cocaine. It is also FDA approved to treat high blood pressure. Guanfacine can offer a synergistic enhancement of stimulants such as amphetamines and methylphenidate for treating ADHD, and in many cases can also help control the side effect profile of stimulant medications. For ADHD, it is claimed that guanfacine helps individuals better control behavior, inhibit inappropriate distractions and impulses, and inhibit inappropriate aggressive impulses. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found guanfacine to be effective in the treatment of ADHD in both children and adults, with a moderate effect size found in adults (Hedges' g = -0.66). A systematic review and meta-analysis also found that guanfacine reduced oppositional behavior in children and adolescents with ADHD who also had or did not also have oppositional defiant disorder, with a small-to-moderate effect size. In any case, guanfacine and other α2-adrenergic receptor agonists are considered to be less effective than stimulants in the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine is also used off-label to treat tic disorders, anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD. Guanfacine and other α2A-adrenergic receptor agonists have anxiolytic-like action, thereby reducing the emotional responses of the amygdala, and strengthening prefrontal cortical regulation of emotion, action, and thought. These actions arise from both inhibition of stress-induced catecholamine release, and from prominent, post-synaptic actions in the prefrontal cortex. Due to its prolonged elimination half-life, it also has been seen to improve sleep interrupted by nightmares in PTSD patients. All of these actions likely contribute to the relief of the hyperarousal, re-experiencing of memory, and impulsivity associated with PTSD. Guanfacine appears to be especially helpful in treating children who have been traumatized or abused. == Adverse effects == Side effects of guanfacine are dose-dependent. Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include sleepiness, tiredness, headache, and stomach ache. Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include decreased appetite, nausea, dry mouth, urinary incontinence, and rashes. Guanfacine has been reported to cause high rates of somnolence in children with ADHD, for instance 73% with guanfacine versus 6% with placebo in one trial. Guanfacine may worsen sleep in children with ADHD, including reduced total sleep time. A 2020 systematic review found side effects of guanfacine including abdominal pain, sedation, and QT prolongation. == Interactions == Guanfacine availability is significantly affected by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes. Medications that inhibit or induce those enzymes change the amount of guanfacine in circulation and thus its efficacy and rate of adverse effects. Because of its impact on the heart, it should be used with caution with other cardioactive drugs. A similar concern is appropriate when it is used with sedating medications. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Guanfacine is a highly selective agonist of the α2A-adrenergic receptor, with low affinity for other receptors. However, it is also a serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonist. Guanfacine works by activating α2A-adrenoceptors within the central nervous system. This leads to reduced peripheral sympathetic outflow and thus a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone, which lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In ADHD, guanfacine is thought to work by strengthening the regulation of attention and behavior by the prefrontal cortex. These enhancing effects on prefrontal cortical functions are believed to be due to drug stimulation of post-synaptic α2A-adrenoceptors on dendritic spines, and are not dependent on activation of pre-synaptic α2A-adrenoceptors. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated opening of HCN and KCNQ channels is inhibited, which enhances prefrontal cortical synaptic connectivity and neuronal firing. In monkeys, guanfacine improves working memory, attention regulation, and behavioral inhibition, and these actions are independent of its sedative effects. The use of guanfacine for treating prefrontal disorders was developed by the Arnsten Lab at Yale University. Guanfacine is much more selective for α2A-adrenergic receptors than clonidine, which binds to and activates not only the α2A-adrenergic receptor but also α2B- and α2C-adrenergic receptors and the imidazoline receptor. It is weaker than clonidine in producing hypotension and sedation, has weaker pre-synaptic actions on the α2A-adrenergic receptor than clonidine (10-fold less effective in decreasing locus coeruleus activity and norepinephrine release), and may have greater efficacy in activating post-synaptic α2A-adrenergic receptors (as suggested by guanfacine being more potent than clonidine in enhancing prefrontal cortex-related working memory in aged monkeys). Activation of the 5-HT2B receptor is a well-known antitarget and is associated with cardiac valvulopathy. However, not all 5-HT2B receptor agonists, for instance ropinirole, have this effect. Guanfacine has not been associated with cardiac valvulopathy despite a long history of use, perhaps due to modest potency as a 5-HT2B receptor agonist. In in vitro studies, guanfacine showed 100-fold lower affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor than for the α2A-adrenergic receptor, 30-fold lower affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor than serotonin, and 1,000-fold lower potency in activating the 5-HT2B receptor compared to serotonin. It was concluded that at clinically relevant concentrations, guanfacine would not be expected to show significant binding to or activation of 5-HT2B receptors, and that it is unlikely that guanfacine is a cardiac valvulopathogen in humans. In any case, different studies have reported different potencies of guanfacine as a 5-HT2B receptor agonist, and as of 2018, no clinical data on the risk of cardiac valvulopathy with guanfacine were available. As such, while the likelihood is thought to be low, guanfacine might still have a risk of cardiac valvulopathy. Guanfacine has been found to act as a full agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) with an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration and EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 20 nM and ≥85% respectively. === Pharmacokinetics === Guanfacine has an oral bioavailability of 80%. There is no clear evidence of any first-pass metabolism. Its elimination half-life is 17 hours with the major elimination route being renal. The principal metabolite is the 3-hydroxylated derivative, with evidence of moderate biotransformation, and the key intermediate is an epoxide. Elimination is not impacted by impaired renal function. As such, metabolism by the liver is the assumption for those with impaired renal function, as supported by the increased frequency of known side effects of orthostatic hypotension and sedation. == Preparation == Guanfacine can be prepared from equal parts methyl 2,6-dichlorophenylacetate and guanidine: == History == Guanfacine was first described in the literature by 1974. In 1986, guanfacine was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypertension under the brand name Tenex. In 2010, guanfacine was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for people 6 to 17 years old. It was approved for ADHD by the European Medicines Agency under the name Intuniv in 2015. It was added to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the treatment of ADHD in 2018. In February 2025, the first generic drug of guanfacine extended-release in China was approved for marketing, and the trade name is Le'erjing(乐儿静).。 == Society and culture == === Legal status === In December 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Paxneury, intended for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children. The applicant for this medicinal product is Neuraxpharm Pharmaceuticals S.L. Paxneury is a generic of Intuniv, which has been authorized in the EU since September 2015. It is also a hybrid medicine1 of Intuniv. It contains the same active substance as Intuniv, but is available at higher strengths. Paxneury was authorized for medical use in the European Union in February 2025. === Brand names === Brand names include Tenex, Afken, Estulic, and Intuniv (an extended release formulation). == Research == Guanfacine has been studied as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Evidence of efficacy in adults is limited, but one study found positive results in children with comorbid ADHD. It may be also useful in adult PTSD patients who do not respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Results of studies using guanfacine to treat Tourette's syndrome have been mixed. Guanfacine does not appear to be effective for improving sleep in children with ADHD and behavioral insomnia. Instead, guanfacine worsened certain sleep parameters, for instance total sleep time, in one clinical trial. Guanfacine has been investigated for treatment of withdrawal for opioids, ethanol, and nicotine. Guanfacine has been shown to help reduce stress-induced craving of nicotine in smokers trying to quit, which may involve strengthening of prefrontal cortex-mediated self-control. Guanfacine has been researched for treatment of a variety of conditions impacting prefrontal cortex function, including cognitive and attentional problems in people with traumatic brain injury, stroke, schizophreniform disorders, and the elderly. Guanfacine is being studied for the possible treatment of long COVID. == References ==",Estulic,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.630610641877865e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.4785116910934448), ('ICAL', -3.2186455882765586e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10085924714803696)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759400129318237)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4222,"('Nitrite', 'Nitrite ion', 'Nitrous acid, ion(1-)', 'Nitrite(1-)', 'Nitrites')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","The nitrite ion has the chemical formula NO−2. Nitrite (mostly sodium nitrite) is widely used throughout chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The nitrite anion is a pervasive intermediate in the nitrogen cycle in nature. The name nitrite also refers to organic compounds having the –ONO group, which are esters of nitrous acid. == Production == Sodium nitrite is made industrially by passing a mixture of nitrogen oxides into aqueous sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solution: NO + NO2 + 2 NaOH → 2 NaNO2 + H2O NO + NO2 + Na2CO3 → 2 NaNO2 + CO2 The product is purified by recrystallization. Alkali metal nitrites are thermally stable up to and beyond their melting point (441 °C for KNO2). Ammonium nitrite can be made from dinitrogen trioxide, N2O3, which is formally the anhydride of nitrous acid: 2 NH3 + H2O + N2O3 → 2 NH4NO2 == Structure == The nitrite ion has a symmetrical structure (C2v symmetry), with both N–O bonds having equal length and a bond angle of about 115°. In valence bond theory, it is described as a resonance hybrid with equal contributions from two canonical forms that are mirror images of each other. In molecular orbital theory, there is a sigma bond between each oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom, and a delocalized pi bond made from the p orbitals on nitrogen and oxygen atoms which is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. The negative charge of the ion is equally distributed on the two oxygen atoms. Both nitrogen and oxygen atoms carry a lone pair of electrons. Therefore, the nitrite ion is a Lewis base. In the gas phase it exists predominantly as a trans-planar molecule. == Reactions == === Acid-base properties === Nitrite is the conjugate base of the weak acid nitrous acid: HNO2 ⇌ H+ + NO−2; pKa ≈ 3.3 at 18 °C Nitrous acid is also highly unstable, tending to disproportionate: 3 HNO2 (aq) ⇌ H3O+ + NO−3 + 2 NO This reaction is slow at 0 °C. Addition of acid to a solution of a nitrite in the presence of a reducing agent, such as iron(II), is a way to make nitric oxide (NO) in the laboratory. === Oxidation and reduction === The formal oxidation state of the nitrogen atom in nitrite is +3. This means that it can be either oxidized to oxidation states +4 and +5, or reduced to oxidation states as low as −3. Standard reduction potentials for reactions directly involving nitrous acid are shown in the table below: The data can be extended to include products in lower oxidation states. For example: H2N2O2 + 2 H+ + 2 e− ⇌ N2 + 2 H2O; E0 = +2.65 V Oxidation reactions usually result in the formation of the nitrate ion, with nitrogen in oxidation state +5. For example, oxidation with permanganate ion can be used for quantitative analysis of nitrite (by titration): 5 NO−2 + 2 MnO−4 + 6 H+ → 5 NO−3 + 2 Mn2+ + 3 H2O The product of reduction reactions with nitrite ion are varied, depending on the reducing agent used and its strength. With sulfur dioxide, the products are NO and N2O; with tin(II) (Sn2+) the product is hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2); reduction all the way to ammonia (NH3) occurs with hydrogen sulfide. With the hydrazinium cation (N2H+5) the product of nitrite reduction is hydrazoic acid (HN3), an unstable and explosive compound: HNO2 + N2H+5 → HN3 + H2O + H3O+ which can also further react with nitrite: HNO2 + HN3 → N2O + N2 + H2O This reaction is unusual in that it involves compounds with nitrogen in four different oxidation states. === Analysis of nitrite === Nitrite is detected and analyzed by the Griess Reaction, involving the formation of a deep red-colored azo dye upon treatment of a NO−2-containing sample with sulfanilic acid and naphthyl-1-amine in the presence of acid. === Coordination complexes === Nitrite is an ambidentate ligand and can form a wide variety of coordination complexes by binding to metal ions in several ways. Two examples are the red nitrito complex [Co(NH3)5(ONO)]2+ is metastable, isomerizing to the yellow nitro complex [Co(NH3)5(NO2)]2+. Nitrite is processed by several enzymes, all of which utilize coordination complexes. == Biochemistry == In nitrification, ammonium is converted to nitrite. Important species include Nitrosomonas. Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate. Nitrite can be reduced to nitric oxide or ammonia by many species of bacteria. Under hypoxic conditions, nitrite may release nitric oxide, which causes potent vasodilation. Several mechanisms for nitrite conversion to NO have been described, including enzymatic reduction by xanthine oxidoreductase, nitrite reductase, and NO synthase (NOS), as well as nonenzymatic acidic disproportionation reactions. == Uses == === Chemical precursor === Azo dyes and other colorants are prepared by the process called diazotization, which requires nitrite. === Nitrite in food preservation and biochemistry === The addition of nitrites and nitrates to processed meats such as ham, bacon, and sausages speeds up the curing of meat and also impart an attractive colour. The academic and industrial consensus is that nitrites also reduces growth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum. On the other hand, a 2018 study (full text not available) by the British Meat Producers Association determined that legally permitted levels of nitrite do not affect the growth of C. botulinum. In the U.S., meat cannot be labeled as ""cured"" without the addition of nitrite. In some countries, cured-meat products are manufactured without nitrate or nitrite, and without nitrite from vegetable sources. Parma ham, produced without nitrite since 1993, was reported in 2018 to have caused no cases of botulism. This is because the interior of the muscle is sterile and the surface is exposed to oxygen. Other manufacture processes do not assure these conditions, and reduction of nitrite results in toxin production. In mice, food rich in nitrites together with unsaturated fats can prevent hypertension by forming nitro fatty acids that inhibit soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is one explanation for the apparent health effect of the Mediterranean diet. Adding nitrites to meat has been shown to generate known carcinogens; the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that eating 50 g (1.8 oz) of nitrite processed meat a day would raise the risk of getting bowel cancer by 18% over a lifetime. The recommended maximum limits by the World Health Organization in drinking water are 3 mg L−1 and 50 mg L−1 for nitrite and nitrate ions, respectively. Ingesting too much nitrite and/or nitrate through well water is suspected to cause methemoglobinemia. 95% of the nitrite ingested in modern diets comes from bacterial conversion of nitrates naturally found in vegetables. However, potentially cancer-causing nitroso compounds are not made in the pH-neutral colon. They are mostly made in the acidic stomach. ==== Curing of meat ==== Nitrite reacts with the meat's myoglobin by attaching to the heme iron atom, forming reddish-brown nitrosomyoglobin and the characteristic pink ""fresh"" color of nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme upon cooking. In the US, nitrite has been formally used since 1925. According to scientists working for the industry group American Meat Institute, this use of nitrite started in the Middle Ages. Historians and epidemiologists argue that the widespread use of nitrite in meat-curing is closely linked to the development of industrial meat-processing. French investigative journalist Guillaume Coudray asserts that the meat industry chooses to cure its meats with nitrite even though it is established that this chemical gives rise to cancer-causing nitroso-compounds. Some traditional and artisanal producers avoid nitrites. Addition of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, or one of their salts enhance the binding of nitrite to the iron atom in myoglobin. These chemicals also reduce the formation of nitrosamine in the stomach, but only when the fat content of a meal is less than 10%, beyond which they instead increase the formation of nitrosamine. === Antidote for cyanide poisoning === Nitrites in the form of sodium nitrite and amyl nitrite are components of many cyanide antidote kits. Both of these compounds bind to hemoglobin and oxidize the Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions forming methemoglobin. Methemoglobin, in turn, binds to cyanide (CN), creating cyanmethemoglobin, effectively removing cyanide from the complex IV of the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria, which is the primary site of disruption caused by cyanide. Another mechanism by which nitrites help treat cyanide toxicity is the generation of nitric oxide (NO). NO displaces the CN from the cytochrome c oxidase (ETC complex IV), making it available for methemoglobin to bind. == Organic nitrites == In organic chemistry, alkyl nitrites are esters of nitrous acid and contain the nitrosoxy functional group. Nitro compounds contain the C–NO2 group. Nitrites have the general formula RONO, where R is an aryl or alkyl group. Amyl nitrite and other alkyl nitrites have a vasodilating action and must be handled in the laboratory with caution. They are sometimes used in medicine for the treatment of heart diseases. A classic named reaction for the synthesis of alkyl nitrites is the Meyer synthesis in which alkyl halides react with metallic nitrites to a mixture to nitroalkanes and nitrites. == Safety == Nitrite salts can react with secondary amines to produce N-nitrosamines, which are suspected of causing stomach cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that each 50 g (1.8 oz) of processed meat eaten a day would raise the risk of getting bowel cancer by 18% over a lifetime; processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed through fermentation, nitrite curing, salting, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation. The World Health Organization's review of more than 400 studies concluded in 2015 that there was sufficient evidence that processed meats caused cancer, particularly colon cancer; the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified processed meats as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). Nitrite (ingested) under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation, specifically the production of nitrosamine, has been classified as Probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) by the IARC. == See also == Curing (food preservation) Alkyl nitrites == References == == External links == Material Safety Data Sheet, sodium nitrite (archive) ATSDR – Case Studies in Environmental Medicine – Nitrate/Nitrite Toxicity (archive) – US Department of Health and Human Services (public domain) Article about Toxicity of Nitrite",Nitrites,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.465375155210495), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.576524555683136), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.1782583391759545e-05), (' INDUSTR', -5.049755782238208e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.5343193411827087), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.8636207793606445e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.2522730231285095), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.014169913716614246), ('ĠMED', -0.001503290724940598), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10023699700832367)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.06404710561037064), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.1002274826169014), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0380525141954422), (' MED', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=102, start_index=18, title='Sodium nitrite', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite?utm_source=openai')])"

It was withdrawn from the US market, according to the FDA Orange Book. It was available in oral tablets or as an injection and was typically used as the hydrochloride salt. The drug acts as a selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. == Medical uses == Ridodrine is used to treat preterm labor. == Contraindications == Possible contraindications of ritodrine include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and migraines. == Side effects == Most side effects of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists result from their concurrent β1-adrenergic receptor agonistic activity, and include increase in heart rate, rise in systolic blood pressure, decrease in diastolic blood pressure, chest pain secondary to myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. β-Adrenergic receptor agonists may also cause fluid retention secondary to decrease in water clearance, which when added to the tachycardia and increased myocardial work, may result in heart failure. In addition, they increase gluconeogenesis in the liver and muscle resulting in hyperglycemia, which increases insulin requirements in diabetic patients. The passage of β-adrenergic receptor agonists through the placenta does occur and may be responsible for fetal tachycardia, as well as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia at birth. It has also been associated with postpartum bleeding. Ritodrine has been reported rarely to cause serious side effects including rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, leukopenia, pulmonary edema, and psychiatric symptoms, among others. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ritodrine is a short-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist – a class of medication used for smooth muscle relaxation (other similar drugs are used in asthma or other pulmonary diseases such as salbutamol [albuterol]). Since ritodrine has a bulky N-substituent, it has high β2-adrenergic receptor selectivity. Also, the 4-hydroxy group on the benzene ring is important for activity as it is needed to form hydrogen bonds. Since the drug is β2-selective, it is used for premature labor. === Pharmacokinetics === The 4-hydroxy group of ritodrine makes it susceptible to metabolism by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). == Chemistry == Ritodrine, also known as 4-hydroxy-β-hydroxy-N-(4-hydroxyphenylethyl)amphetamine or as N-(4-hydroxyphenylethyl)-4-hydroxynorephedrine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative.

However, its potential use for oral treatments and impact on host microbiota remain underexplored. Here, we assessed the influences of topical oral applications of a repurposed FDA-approved drug, thonzonium bromide, on gastrointestinal microbiomes and host tissues in a rat model of dental caries designed to reduce cross-contamination associated with coprophagy. Using this model, we recapitulated the body site microbiota that mirrored the human microbiome profile. Oral microbiota was perturbed by the treatments with specific disruption of Rothia and Veillonella without affecting the global composition of the fecal microbiome. However, disturbances in the oral-gut microbial interactions were identified using nestedness and machine learning, showing increased sharing of oral taxon Sutterella in the gut microbiota. Host-tissue analyses revealed caries reduction on teeth by thonzonium bromide without cytotoxic effects, indicating bioactivity and biocompatibility when used orally. Altogether, we demonstrate how an oral treatment using a repurposed drug causes localized microbial disturbances and therapeutic effects while promoting turnover of specific oral species in the lower gut in vivo. Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis. Current therapies are unsatisfactory and novel cures are urgently needed. In a previous drug screening, we identified thonzonium bromide (TB) as one of the most active compounds against MPM cells. Since the biological effects of TB are poorly known, in this work we departed from some hints of previous studies and investigated several hypotheses. Moreover, we evaluated the efficacy of TB in an in vivo xenograft rodent model. In vitro assessment was made on five MPM (Mero-14, Mero-25, Ren, NCI-H28, MSTO-211H) and one SV40-immortalized mesothelial cell line (MeT-5A). We evaluated TB ability to affect proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial functions and metabolism, and the mevalonate pathway. In vivo assay was carried out on MPM-xenograft NOD-SCID mice (4 mg/kg delivered intraperitoneally, twice a week for 4 weeks) and the overall survival was analysed with Kaplan-Meier curves. After TB treatment, we observed the suppression of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, the increase of BAX expression and p38 phosphorylation.

As a long-acting ACE inhibitor, perindopril works by inhibiting production of the vasoconstriction hormone, angiotensin, thereby relaxing blood vessels, increasing urine output, and decreasing blood volume, leading to a reduction of blood pressure. It also increases blood renin activity and decreases aldosterone secretion, causing increased urine production and excretion of sodium. As a prodrug, perindopril is hydrolyzed in the liver to its active metabolite, perindoprilat. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1988. Perindopril is taken in the form of perindopril arginine/amlodipine or perindopril erbumine. Both forms are therapeutically equivalent and interchangeable, but the dose prescribed to achieve the same effect may differ between the two forms. Perindopril should not be used during pregnancy, as it may harm the fetus. Some people may have allergic reactions to perindopril, while common side-effects may include cough, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, or upset stomach. In Australia during 2023-24, it was the fourth-most prescribed drug. == Medical uses == Perindopril shares the indications of ACE inhibitors as a class, including essential hypertension, stable coronary artery disease (reduction of risk of cardiac events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or revascularization), treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease or heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. === Combination therapy === ==== With indapamide ==== In combination with indapamide, perindopril has been shown to significantly reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease and renal complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) found that whilst perindopril monotherapy demonstrated no significant benefit in reducing recurrent strokes when compared to placebo, the addition of low dose indapamide to perindopril therapy was associated with larger reductions in both blood pressure lowering and recurrent stroke risk in patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, irrespective of their blood pressure. There is evidence to support the use of perindopril and indapamide combination over perindopril monotherapy to prevent strokes and improve mortality in patients with a history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack or other cardiovascular disease. ==== With amlodipine ==== The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BLA) was a 2005 landmark trial that compared the effects of the established therapy of the combination of atenolol and bendroflumethiazide to the new drug combination of amlodipine and perindopril (trade names Viacoram, AceryCal). The study of more than 19,000 patients worldwide was terminated earlier than anticipated because it clearly demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with the newer treatment. The combination of amlodipine and perindopril remains in the current treatment guidelines for hypertension. == Warning and adverse effects == Perindopril may cause death or birth defects of a fetus if taken by the mother during pregnancy. It is poisonous in children and is not prescribed for them. It may cause allergic reactions, and may have adverse effects in people with heart, liver or kidney problems. == Precautions == Assess kidney function before and during treatment where appropriate. Renovascular hypertension Surgery/anesthesia An analysis on the PROGRESS trial showed that perindopril has key benefits in reducing cardiovascular events by 30% in patients with chronic kidney disease defined as a CrCl <60ml/min. A 2016 and 2017 meta-analysis review looking at ACE inhibitors demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events but also slowed the decline of renal failure by 39% when compared to placebo. These studies included patients with moderate to severe kidney disease and those on dialysis. Its renoprotective benefits of decreasing blood pressure and removing filtration pressure is highlighted in a 2016 review. ACE inhibitor can result in an initial increase of serum creatinine, but mostly returns to baseline in a few weeks in majority of patients. It has been suggested that increased monitoring, especially in advanced kidney failure, will minimise any related risk and improve long-term benefits. Use cautiously in patients with sodium or volume depletion due to potential excessive hypotensive effects of renin-angiotensin blockade causing symptomatic hypotension. Careful monitoring or short-term dose reduction of diuretics prior to commencing perindopril is recommended to prevent this potential effect. A diuretic may later be given in combination if necessary; potassium-sparing diuretics are not recommended in combination with perindopril due to the risk of hyperkalaemia. Combination with neuroleptics or imipramine-type drugs may increase the blood pressure lowering effect. Serum lithium concentrations may rise during lithium therapy. == Side effects == Usually mild at the start of treatment, side effects may include cough, fatigue, headache, nausea, or upset stomach, among other minor effects. == Composition == Each tablet contains 2, 4, or 8 mg of the tert-butylamine salt of perindopril. Perindopril is also available under the trade name Coversyl Plus, containing 4 mg of perindopril combined with 1.25 mg indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic. In Australia, each tablet contains 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of perindopril arginine. Perindopril is also available under the trade name Coversyl Plus, containing 5 mg of perindopril arginine combined with 1.25 mg indapamide and Coversyl Plus LD, containing 2.5 mg of perindopril arginine combined with 0.625 mg indapamide. The efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of 4 mg perindopril and 5 mg amlodipine, a calcium channel antagonist, is used. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Perindopril is available under the following brand names among others: === Marketing === In July 2014, the European Commission imposed fines of €427,700,000 on Laboratoires Servier and five companies which produce generics due to Servier's abuse of their dominant market position, in breach of European Union Competition law. Servier's strategy included acquiring the principal source of generic production of perindopril and entering into several pay-for-delay agreements with potential generic competitors. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Perindopril at Wikimedia Commons",Perindopril tert-butylamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017951308109331876), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015093612018972635)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4226,"('Tetrazepam', 'Myolastan', 'Musaril', 'Clinoxan', 'Ro 06-6657')",Medical,"Tetrazepam (is marketed under the following brand names, Clinoxan, Epsipam, Myolastan, Musaril, Relaxam and Spasmorelax) is a benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and slightly hypnotic properties. It was formerly used mainly in Austria, France, Belgium, Germany and Spain to treat muscle spasm, anxiety disorders such as panic attacks, or more rarely to treat depression, premenstrual syndrome or agoraphobia. Tetrazepam has relatively little sedative effect at low doses while still producing useful muscle relaxation and anxiety relief. The Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures-Human (CMD(h)) endorsed the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommendation to suspend the marketing authorisations of tetrazepam-containing medicines across the European Union (EU) in April 2013. The European Commission has confirmed the suspension of the marketing authorisations for Tetrazepam in Europe because of cutaneous toxicity, effective from the 1 August 2013. Delayed type 4 allergic hypersensitivity reactions including maculopapular exanthema, erythematous rash, urticarial eruption, erythema multiforme, photodermatitis, eczema and Stevens–Johnson syndrome can occasionally occur as a result of tetrazepam exposure. These hypersensitivity reactions to tetrazepam share no cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines. == Indications == Tetrazepam is used therapeutically as a muscle relaxant. == Availability == The indicated adult dose for muscle spasm is 25 mg to 150 mg per day, increased if necessary to a maximum of 300 mg per day, in divided doses. Tetrazepam is not generally recommended for use in children, except on the advice of a specialist. Tetrazepam is only available in one strength and formulation, 50 mg tablets. The benzodiazepine equivalent of tetrazepam is approximately 100 mg of tetrazepam = 10 mg of diazepam. == Adverse effects == Allergic reactions to tetrazepam occasionally occur involving the skin. Allergic reactions can develop to tetrazepam and it is considered to be a potential allergen. Drug rash and drug-induced eosinophilia with systemic symptoms is a known complication of tetrazepam exposure. These hypersensitive allergic reactions can be of the delayed type. Toxic epidermal necrolysis has occurred from the use of tetrazepam including at least one reported death. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme has been reported from use of tetrazepam. Cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines does not typically occur in such patients. Exanthema and eczema may occur. The lack of cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines is believed to be due to the molecular structure of tetrazepam. Photodermatitis and phototoxicity have also been reported. Occupational contact allergy can also develop from regularly handling tetrazepam. Airborne contact dermatitis can also occur as an allergy which can develop from occupational exposure. Patch testing has been used successfully to demonstrate tetrazepam allergy. Oral testing can also be used. Skin prick tests are not always accurate and may produce false negatives. Drowsiness is a common side effect of tetrazepam. A reduction in muscle force can occur. Myasthenia gravis, a condition characterised by severe muscle weakness is another potential adverse effect from tetrazepam. Cardiovascular and respiratory adverse effects can occur with tetrazepam similar to other benzodiazepines. === Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal === Prolonged use, as with all benzodiazepines, should be avoided, as tolerance occurs and there is a risk of benzodiazepine dependence and a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome after stopping or reducing dosage. == Overdose == Tetrazepam, like other benzodiazepines is a drug which is very frequently present in cases of overdose. These overdoses are often mixed overdoses, i.e. a mixture of other benzodiazepines or other drug classes with tetrazepam. == Contraindications and special caution == Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. == Pharmacology == Tetrazepam is an unusual benzodiazepine in its molecular structure as it has cyclohexenyl group which has substituted the typical 5-phenyl moiety seen in other benzodiazepines. Tetrazepam, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, within 45 mins and reaches peak plasma levels in less than 2 hours. It is classed as an intermediate acting benzodiazepine with an elimination half-life of approximately 15 hours. It is primarily metabolised to the inactive metabolites 3-hydroxy-tetrazepam and nortetrazepam. The pharmacological effects of tetrazepam are significantly less potent when compared against diazepam, in animal studies. Tetrazepam is a benzodiazepine site agonist and binds unselectively to type 1 and type 2 benzodiazepine site types as well as to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The muscle relaxant properties of tetrazepam are most likely due to a reduction of calcium influx. Small amounts of diazepam as well as the active metabolites of diazepam are produced from metabolism of tetrazepam. The metabolism of tetrazepam has led to false accusations of prisoners prescribed tetrazepam of taking illicit diazepam; this can lead to increased prison sentences for prisoners. == Abuse == Tetrazepam as with other benzodiazepines is sometimes abused. It is sometimes abused to incapacitate a victim in order to carry out a drug-facilitated crime. or abused in order to achieve a state of intoxication. Tetrazepam's abuse for to carry out drug facilitated crimes may be less however, than other benzodiazepines due to its reduced hypnotic properties. == See also == Benzodiazepine Long-term effects of benzodiazepines == References ==",Myolastan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.048772674053907394), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001081169830285944), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0052384971641004086)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrazepam?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Tetrazepam', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrazepam?utm_source=openai')])"

The precise mechanism of localization has not been determined, but is believed to result from nonspecific receptor binding. Brain uptake peaks at 30 minutes postinjection and remains relatively constant through 60 minutes. The drug is metabolized and excreted in the urine, with negligible activity remaining at 48 hours. When compared with CT in stroke patients, visualization may be performed sooner after symptom onset and a larger zone of involvement may be evident with iofetamine. Localization of seizure foci and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease may also be possible.

4229,"('Phenol', 'Carbolic acid', 'Hydroxybenzene', 'Phenic acid', 'Oxybenzene')","Food, Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Phenol (also known as carbolic acid, phenolic acid, or benzenol) is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula C6H5OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile. The molecule consists of a phenyl group (−C6H5) bonded to a hydroxy group (−OH). Mildly acidic, it requires careful handling because it can cause chemical burns. Phenol was first extracted from coal tar, but today is produced on a large scale (about 7 million tonnes a year) from petroleum-derived feedstocks. It is an important industrial commodity as a precursor to many materials and useful compounds. It is primarily used to synthesize plastics and related materials. Phenol and its chemical derivatives are essential for production of polycarbonates, epoxies, explosives such as picric acid, Bakelite, nylon, detergents, herbicides such as phenoxy herbicides, and numerous pharmaceutical drugs. == Properties == Phenol is an organic compound appreciably soluble in water, with about 84.2 g dissolving in 1000 ml (0.895 M). Homogeneous mixtures of phenol and water at phenol to water mass ratios of ~2.6 and higher are possible. The sodium salt of phenol, sodium phenoxide, is far more water-soluble. It is a combustible solid (NFPA rating = 2). When heated, phenol produces flammable vapors that are explosive at concentrations of 3 to 10% in air. Carbon dioxide or dry chemical extinguishers should be used to fight phenol fires. === Acidity === Phenol is a weak acid. In aqueous solution in the pH range ca. 8 - 12 it is in equilibrium with the phenolate anion C6H5O− (also called phenoxide or carbolate): C6H5OH ⇌ C6H5O− + H+ Phenol is more acidic than aliphatic alcohols. Its enhanced acidity is attributed to resonance stabilization of phenolate anion. In this way, the negative charge on oxygen is delocalized on to the ortho and para carbon atoms through the pi system. An alternative explanation involves the sigma framework, postulating that the dominant effect is the induction from the more electronegative sp2 hybridised carbons; the comparatively more powerful inductive withdrawal of electron density that is provided by the sp2 system compared to an sp3 system allows for great stabilization of the oxyanion. In support of the second explanation, the pKa of the enol of acetone in water is 10.9, making it only slightly less acidic than phenol (pKa 10.0). Thus, the greater number of resonance structures available to phenoxide compared to acetone enolate seems to contribute little to its stabilization. However, the situation changes when solvation effects are excluded. ==== Hydrogen bonding ==== In carbon tetrachloride and in alkane solvents, phenol hydrogen bonds with a wide range of Lewis bases such as pyridine, diethyl ether, and diethyl sulfide. The enthalpies of adduct formation and the −OH IR frequency shifts accompanying adduct formation have been compiled. Phenol is classified as a hard acid. ==== Tautomerism ==== Phenol exhibits keto-enol tautomerism with its unstable keto tautomer cyclohexadienone, but the effect is nearly negligible. The equilibrium constant for enolisation is approximately 10−13, which means only one in every ten trillion molecules is in the keto form at any moment. The small amount of stabilisation gained by exchanging a C=C bond for a C=O bond is more than offset by the large destabilisation resulting from the loss of aromaticity. Phenol therefore exists essentially entirely in the enol form. 4,4' Substituted cyclohexadienone can undergo a dienone–phenol rearrangement in acid conditions and form stable 3,4‐disubstituted phenol. For substituted phenols, several factors can favor the keto tautomer: (a) additional hydroxy groups (see resorcinol) (b) annulation as in the formation of naphthols, and (c) deprotonation to give the phenolate. Phenoxides are enolates stabilised by aromaticity. Under normal circumstances, phenoxide is more reactive at the oxygen position, but the oxygen position is a ""hard"" nucleophile whereas the alpha-carbon positions tend to be ""soft"". === Reactions === Phenol is highly reactive toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. The enhanced nucleophilicity is attributed to donation pi electron density from O into the ring. Many groups can be attached to the ring, via halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and related processes. Phenol is so strongly activated that bromination and chlorination lead readily to polysubstitution. The reaction affords 2- and 4-substituted derivatives. The regiochemistry of halogenation changes in strongly acidic solutions where PhOH2]+ predominates. Phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol while with concentrated nitric acid, additional nitro groups are introduced, e.g. to give 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Friedel Crafts alkylations of phenol and its derivatives often proceed without catalysts. Alkylating agents include alkyl halides, alkenes, and ketones. Thus, adamantyl-1-bromide, dicyclopentadiene), and cyclohexanones give respectively 4-adamantylphenol, a bis(2-hydroxyphenyl) derivative, and a 4-cyclohexylphenols. Alcohols and hydroperoxides alkylate phenols in the presence of solid acid catalysts (e.g. certain zeolite). Cresols and cumyl phenols can be produced in that way. Aqueous solutions of phenol are weakly acidic and turn blue litmus slightly to red. Phenol is neutralized by sodium hydroxide forming sodium phenate or phenolate, but being weaker than carbonic acid, it cannot be neutralized by sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate to liberate carbon dioxide. C6H5OH + NaOH → C6H5ONa + H2O When a mixture of phenol and benzoyl chloride are shaken in presence of dilute sodium hydroxide solution, phenyl benzoate is formed. This is an example of the Schotten–Baumann reaction: C6H5COCl + HOC6H5 → C6H5CO2C6H5 + HCl Phenol is reduced to benzene when it is distilled with zinc dust or when its vapour is passed over granules of zinc at 400 °C: C6H5OH + Zn → C6H6 + ZnO When phenol is treated with diazomethane in the presence of boron trifluoride (BF3), anisole is obtained as the main product and nitrogen gas as a byproduct. C6H5OH + CH2N2 → C6H5OCH3 + N2 Phenol and its derivatives react with iron(III) chloride to give intensely colored solutions containing phenoxide complexes. == Production == Because of phenol's commercial importance, many methods have been developed for its production, but the cumene process is the dominant technology. === Cumene process === Accounting for 95% of production (2003) is the cumene process, also called Hock process. It involves the partial oxidation of cumene (isopropylbenzene) via the Hock rearrangement: Compared to most other processes, the cumene process uses mild conditions and inexpensive raw materials. For the process to be economical, both phenol and the acetone by-product must be in demand. In 2010, worldwide demand for acetone was approximately 6.7 million tonnes, 83 percent of which was satisfied with acetone produced by the cumene process. A route analogous to the cumene process begins with cyclohexylbenzene. It is oxidized to a hydroperoxide, akin to the production of cumene hydroperoxide. Via the Hock rearrangement, cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide cleaves to give phenol and cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone is an important precursor to some nylons. === Oxidation of benzene, toluene, cyclohexylbenzene === The direct oxidation of benzene (C6H6) to phenol is possible, but it has not been commercialized: C6H6 + O → C6H5OH Nitrous oxide is a potentially ""green"" oxidant that is a more potent oxidant than O2. Routes for the generation of nitrous oxide however remain uncompetitive. An electrosynthesis employing alternating current gives phenol from benzene. The oxidation of toluene, as developed by Dow Chemical, involves copper-catalyzed reaction of molten sodium benzoate with air: C6H5CH3 + 2 O2 → C6H5OH + CO2 + H2O The reaction is proposed to proceed via formation of benzyoylsalicylate. Autoxidation of cyclohexylbenzene gives the hydroperoxide. Decomposition of this hydroperoxide affords cyclohexanone and phenol. === Older methods === Early methods relied on extraction of phenol from coal derivatives or the hydrolysis of benzene derivatives. ==== Hydrolysis of benzenesulfonic acid ==== The original commercial route was developed by Bayer and Monsanto in the early 1900s, based on discoveries by Wurtz and Kekulé. The method involves the reaction of a strong base with benzenesulfonic acid, proceeded by the reaction of hydroxide with sodium benzenesulfonate to give sodium phenoxide. Acidification of the latter gives phenol. The net conversion is: C6H5SO3H + 2 NaOH → C6H5OH + Na2SO3 + H2O ==== Hydrolysis of chlorobenzene ==== Chlorobenzene can be hydrolyzed to phenol using a base (Dow process) or steam (Raschig–Hooker process): C6H5Cl + NaOH → C6H5OH + NaCl C6H5Cl + H2O → C6H5OH + HCl These methods suffer from the cost of the chlorobenzene and the need to dispose of the chloride byproduct. ==== Coal pyrolysis ==== Phenol is also a recoverable byproduct of coal pyrolysis. In the Lummus process, the oxidation of toluene to benzoic acid is conducted separately. === Miscellaneous methods === Phenyldiazonium salts hydrolyze to phenol. The method is of no commercial interest since the precursor is expensive. C6H5NH2 + HCl + NaNO2 → C6H5OH + N2 + H2O + NaCl Salicylic acid decarboxylates to phenol. == Uses == === Chemicals === The major uses of phenol, consuming two thirds of its production, involve its conversion to precursors for plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a key precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins. Condensation of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives phenolic resins, an example of which is Bakelite. Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives cyclohexanone, a precursor to nylon. Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation. Phenol is also a versatile precursor to a large collection of drugs, most notably aspirin but also many herbicides and pharmaceutical drugs. Phenol is a component in liquid–liquid phenol–chloroform extraction technique used in molecular biology for obtaining nucleic acids from tissues or cell culture samples. Depending on the pH of the solution either DNA or RNA can be extracted. Phenol is so inexpensive that it also attracts many small-scale uses. It is a component of industrial paint strippers used in the aviation industry for the removal of epoxy, polyurethane and other chemically resistant coatings. Safety concerns have caused it to be banned from use in cosmetic products in the European Union and Canada. === Topical anesthetic === Concentrated liquid phenol can be used topically as a local anesthetic for otology procedures, such as myringotomy and tympanotomy tube placement, as an alternative to general anesthesia or other local anesthetics. Phenol spray, with phenol as the active ingredient, is used medically to treat sore throat. It is the active ingredient in some oral analgesics. Concentrated phenol liquids are used for permanent treatment of ingrown toe and finger nails, a procedure known as a chemical matrixectomy. The procedure was first described by Otto Boll in 1945. Since then, phenol has become the agent of choice for chemical matrixectomies performed by podiatrists. === Nerve block === Phenol is used as a chemical denervation agent in analgesia treatment, such as for spasticity, arthritis, or cancer pain. Its effect on the nerve is to denature protein, diminish nerve fat and myelin content, and interrupt sensory transmission to the brain. If successful, pain relief may last for weeks to two years. Complications may include pain on injection, bleeding, or infection. Clinical studies from 2023-25 reported that local injection of phenol (1.5–3 ml of 6% phenol in sterile water) at three to five sensory knee nerves was effective as a neurolytic treatment to relieve pain associated with chronic osteoarthritis. The phenol method may be used for people who did not experience pain relief from radiofrequency ablation of knee nerves. == History == Phenol was discovered in 1834 by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who extracted it (in impure form) from coal tar. Runge called phenol ""Karbolsäure"" (coal-oil-acid, carbolic acid). Coal tar remained the primary source until the development of the petrochemical industry. French chemist Auguste Laurent extracted phenol in its pure form, as a derivative of benzene, in 1841. In 1836, Auguste Laurent coined the name ""phène"" for benzene; this is the root of the word ""phenol"" and ""phenyl"". In 1843, French chemist Charles Gerhardt coined the name ""phénol"". The antiseptic properties of phenol were used by Sir Joseph Lister in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds with a piece of rag or lint covered in phenol. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (germ-free) techniques in surgery. Lister's work was inspired by the works and experiments of his contemporary Louis Pasteur in sterilizing various biological media. He theorized that if germs could be killed or prevented, no infection would occur. Lister reasoned that a chemical could be used to destroy the micro-organisms that cause infection. Meanwhile, in Carlisle, England, officials were experimenting with sewage treatment using carbolic acid to reduce the smell of sewage cesspools. Having heard of these developments, and having previously experimented with other chemicals for antiseptic purposes without much success, Lister decided to try carbolic acid as a wound antiseptic. He had his first chance on August 12, 1865, when he received a patient: an eleven-year-old boy with a tibia bone fracture which pierced the skin of his lower leg. Ordinarily, amputation would be the only solution. However, Lister decided to try carbolic acid. After setting the bone and supporting the leg with splints, he soaked clean cotton towels in undiluted carbolic acid and applied them to the wound, covered with a layer of tin foil, leaving them for four days. When he checked the wound, Lister was pleasantly surprised to find no signs of infection, just redness near the edges of the wound from mild burning by the carbolic acid. Reapplying fresh bandages with diluted carbolic acid, the boy was able to walk home after about six weeks of treatment. By 16 March 1867, when the first results of Lister's work were published in the Lancet, he had treated a total of eleven patients using his new antiseptic method. Of those, only one had died, and that was through a complication that was nothing to do with Lister's wound-dressing technique. Now, for the first time, patients with compound fractures were likely to leave the hospital with all their limbs intact — Richard Hollingham, Blood and Guts: A History of Surgery, p. 62 Before antiseptic operations were introduced at the hospital, there were sixteen deaths in thirty-five surgical cases. Almost one in every two patients died. After antiseptic surgery was introduced in the summer of 1865, there were only six deaths in forty cases. The mortality rate had dropped from almost 50 per cent to around 15 per cent. It was a remarkable achievement — Richard Hollingham, Blood and Guts: A History of Surgery, p. 63 Phenol was the main ingredient of the ""carbolic smoke ball,"" an ineffective device marketed in London in the 19th century as protection against influenza and other ailments, and the subject of the famous law case Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. In the tort law case of Roe v Minister of Health, phenol was used to sterilize anaesthetic packed in ampoules, in which it contaminated the anaesthetic through invisible micro-cracks and caused paraplegia to the plaintiffs. === Second World War === The toxic effect of phenol on the central nervous system causes sudden collapse and loss of consciousness in both humans and animals; a state of cramping precedes these symptoms because of the motor activity controlled by the central nervous system. Injections of phenol were used as a means of individual execution by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It was originally used by the Nazis in 1939 as part of the mass-murder of disabled people under Aktion T4. The Germans learned that extermination of smaller groups was more economical by injection of each victim with phenol. Phenol injections were given to thousands of people. Maximilian Kolbe was also murdered with a phenol injection after surviving two weeks of dehydration and starvation in Auschwitz when he volunteered to die in place of a stranger. Approximately one gram is sufficient to cause death. == Occurrences == Phenol is a normal metabolic product, excreted in quantities up to 40 mg/L in human urine. The temporal gland secretion of male elephants showed the presence of phenol and 4-methylphenol during musth. It is also one of the chemical compounds found in castoreum. This compound is ingested from the plants the beaver eats. Phenol is a measurable component in the aroma and taste of the distinctive Islay scotch whisky, generally ~30 ppm, but it can be over 160 ppm in the malted barley used to produce whisky. This amount is different from and presumably higher than the amount in the distillate. == Biodegradation == Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus is a bacterium species that produces benzoate from phenol via 4-hydroxybenzoate. Rhodococcus phenolicus is a bacterium species able to degrade phenol as sole carbon source. == Safety and handling == Phenol and its vapors are corrosive to the eyes, the skin, and the respiratory tract. Its corrosive effect on skin and mucous membranes is due to a protein-degenerating effect. Repeated or prolonged skin contact with phenol may cause dermatitis, or even second and third-degree burns. Inhalation of phenol vapor may cause lung edema. The substance may cause harmful effects on the central nervous system and heart, resulting in dysrhythmia, seizures, and coma. The kidneys may be affected as well. Long-term or repeated exposure of the substance may have harmful effects on the liver and kidneys. There is no evidence that phenol causes cancer in humans. Besides its hydrophobic effects, another mechanism for the toxicity of phenol may be the formation of phenoxyl radicals. Since phenol is absorbed through the skin relatively quickly, systemic poisoning can occur in addition to the local caustic burns. Resorptive poisoning by a large quantity of phenol can occur even with only a small area of skin, rapidly leading to paralysis of the central nervous system and a severe drop in body temperature. The LD50 for oral toxicity is less than 500 mg/kg for dogs, rabbits, or mice; the minimum lethal human dose was cited as 140 mg/kg. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states the fatal dose for ingestion of phenol is from 1 to 32 g. Chemical burns from skin exposures can be decontaminated by washing with polyethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, or perhaps even copious amounts of water. Removal of contaminated clothing is required, as well as immediate hospital treatment for large splashes. This is particularly important if the phenol is mixed with chloroform (a commonly used mixture in molecular biology for DNA and RNA purification). Phenol is also a reproductive toxin causing increased risk of miscarriage and low birth weight indicating retarded development in utero. === Shipping === Phenol, which is produced and hence transported in large volumes, is shipped in a molten state below 70 °C (158 °F). The melting point is lowered and corrosive nature enhanced in the presence of small amounts of water. Typically stainless steel containers and nitrogen-blanketing are required to prevent discoloration. == Phenols == The word phenol is also used to refer to any compound that contains a six-membered aromatic ring, bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (-OH).

4230,"('Seloken', 'Selopral', 'Prelis', 'Beloc', 'Metoprolol hemitartrate')",Medical,"Metoprolol, sold under the brand name Lopressor among others, is a medication used to treat angina, high blood pressure and a number of conditions involving an abnormally fast heart rate. It is also used to prevent further heart problems after myocardial infarction and to prevent headaches in those with migraines. It is a beta blocker, specifically a selective β1 receptor blocker, and is taken by mouth or is given intravenously. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, feeling faint, and abdominal discomfort. Large doses may cause serious toxicity. Risk in pregnancy has not been ruled out. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. The metabolism of metoprolol can vary widely among patients, often as a result of hepatic impairment or CYP2D6 polymorphism. Metoprolol was first made in 1969, patented in 1970, and approved for medical use in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the sixth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 65 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Metoprolol is used for a number of conditions, including angina, acute myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and prevention of migraine headaches. It is an adjunct in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Both oral and intravenous forms of metoprolol are available for administration. The different salt versions of metoprolol – metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate – are approved for different conditions and are not interchangeable. Off-label uses include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects, especially with higher doses, include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea, unusual dreams, trouble sleeping, depression, and vision problems such as blurred vision or dry eyes. β-blockers, including metoprolol, reduce salivary flow via inhibition of the direct sympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. Metoprolol may also cause the hands and feet to feel cold. Due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia, vivid dreams and nightmares. Patients should be cautious while driving or operating machinery due to its potential to cause decreased alertness. There may also be an impact on blood sugar levels, and it can potentially mask signs of low blood sugar. The safety of metoprolol during pregnancy is not fully established. === Precautions === Metoprolol reduces long-term mortality and hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. A meta-analysis further supports reduced incidence of heart failure worsening in patients treated with beta-blockers compared to placebo. However, in some circumstances, particularly when initiating metoprolol in patients with more symptomatic disease, an increased prevalence of hospitalisation and mortality has been reported within the first two months of starting. Patients should monitor for swelling of extremities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A Cochrane Review concluded that although metoprolol reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence, it is unclear whether the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. This medicine may cause changes in blood sugar levels or cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. It also may cause some people to become less alert than they are normally, making it dangerous for them to drive or use machines. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Risk for the fetus has not been ruled out, per being rated pregnancy category C in Australia, meaning that it may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus (but no malformations). It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. == Overdose == Excessive doses of metoprolol can cause bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest. Blood or plasma concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of overdose or poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 200 μg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 1–20 mg/L in overdose victims. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Metoprolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Metoprolol exerts its effects by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters, specifically adrenaline and noradrenaline. It does this by selectively binding to and antagonizing β1 adrenergic receptors in the body. When adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are released from nerve endings or secreted by the adrenal glands, they bind to β1 adrenergic receptors found primarily in cardiac tissues such as the heart. This binding activates these receptors, leading to various physiological responses, including an increase in heart rate, force of contraction (inotropic effect), conduction speed through electrical pathways in the heart, and release of renin from the kidneys. Metoprolol competes with adrenaline and noradrenaline for binding sites on these β1 receptors. By occupying these receptor sites without activating them, metoprolol blocks or inhibits their activation by endogenous catecholamines like adrenaline or noradrenaline. Metoprolol blocks β1-adrenergic receptors in heart muscle cells, thereby decreasing the slope of phase 4 in the nodal action potential (reducing Na+ uptake) and prolonging repolarization of phase 3 (slowing down K+ release). It also suppresses the norepinephrine-induced increase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and the spontaneous SR Ca2+ release, which are the major triggers for atrial fibrillation. Through this mechanism of selective blockade at β1 receptors, metoprolol exerts the following effects: Heart rate reduction, i.e., decrease of the resting heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reduction of excessive elevations resulting from exercise or stress. Reduction of the force of contraction, i.e., decrease in contractility (negative inotropic effect), which lessens how hard each heartbeat contracts. Decrease in cardiac output, i.e., decrease in both heart rate and contractility within myocardium cells, where β1 is predominantly located, overall blood output per minute lowers called cardiac output/dysfunction, allowing decreased demands placed onto impaired hearts, reducing oxygen demand-supply mismatch. Lowering of blood pressure. Antiarrhythmic effects, such as supraventricular tachycardia prevention. Metoprolol also prevents electrical wave propagation. === Pharmacokinetics === Metoprolol is mostly absorbed from the intestine with an absorption fraction of 0.95. The systemic bioavailability after oral administration is approximately 50%. Less than 5% of an orally administered dose of metoprolol is excreted unchanged in urine; most of it is eliminated in metabolized form through feces via bile secretion into the intestines. Metoprolol undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, mainly α-hydroxylation and O-demethylation through various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 (primary), CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. The primary metabolites formed are α-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol. Metoprolol is classified as a moderately lipophilic beta blocker. More lipophilic beta blockers tend to cross the blood–brain barrier more readily, with greater potential for effects in the central nervous system as well as associated neuropsychiatric side effects. Metoprolol binds mainly to human serum albumin with an unbound fraction of 0.88. It has a large volume of distribution at steady state (3.2 L/kg), indicating extensive distribution throughout the body. == Chemistry == Metoprolol was synthesized and its activity discovered in 1969. The specific agent in on-market formulations of metoprolol is either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, where tartrate is an immediate-release formulation and the succinate is an extended-release formulation (with 100 mg metoprolol tartrate corresponding to 95 mg metoprolol succinate). === Stereochemistry === Metoprolol contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, i.e. a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and the (S)-form: == Society and culture == === Legal status === Metoprolol was approved for medical use in the United States in August 1978. === Economics === In the 2000s, a lawsuit was brought against the manufacturers of Toprol XL (a time-release formula version of metoprolol) and its generic equivalent (metoprolol succinate) claiming that to increase profits, lower cost generic versions of Toprol XL were intentionally kept off the market. It alleged that the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca LP, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and Aktiebolaget Hassle violated antitrust and consumer protection law. In a settlement by the companies in 2012, without admission to the claims, they agreed to a settlement pay-out of US$ 11 million. === Sport === Because beta blockers can be used to reduce heart rate and minimize tremors, which can enhance performance in sports such as archery, metoprolol is banned by the world anti-doping agency in some sports. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017).

4232,"('Bunolol hydrochloride', 'Ent-levobunolol, hydrochloride', '(+) -levobunolol hydrochloride', 'Ent-levobunolol hydrochloride (r-bunolol hydrochloride)', 'Dextrobunolol hydrochloride')",Medical," To investigate whether carteolol hydrochloride has protective effects against ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced damage in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Cultured HCECs were exposed to a single dose of UVB 300 mJ/cm, and the cell viability was measured 12 hours after the UVB irradiation using a cell-counting kit. Test samples at 0.01-1.0 mmol/L (carteolol hydrochloride, timolol maleate, betaxolol hydrochloride, levobunolol hydrochloride, or nipradilol) were added to the HCECs before, during, or after UVB irradiation. UV absorption spectra for each drug sample were determined using a spectrophotometer. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and carteolol hydrochloride were simultaneously added to the HCECs for 10 minutes, and the cell viability was measured 12 hours later. The ability of carteolol hydrochloride to scavenge superoxide anion (O2) and singlet oxygen (O2) was investigated using the MCLA chemiluminescence method. UVB irradiation decreased the number of viable HCECs in a dose-dependent manner. Carteolol hydrochloride at 1 mmol/L attenuated the UVB-induced cell damage when added before, during, or after UVB irradiation (P<0.01). Levobunolol hydrochloride at 1 mmol/L (P<0.01) added during or after irradiation and timolol maleate at 0.1 mmol/L or higher (P<0.05) added during irradiation attenuated the UVB-induced cell damage. Betaxolol hydrochloride and nipradilol had no effect. The UV absorption spectra of timolol maleate and levobunolol hydrochloride overlapped with the UVB wavelength spectrum, while carteolol hydrochloride, betaxolol hydrochloride, and nipradilol showed a partial overlap. Carteolol hydrochloride at 1 mmol/L (P<0.05) significantly inhibited H2O2-induced cell damage and was able to scavenge O2 (EC50 value: 48 mmol/L). These data strongly suggest that carteolol hydrochloride has a protective action against UVB-induced HCEC damage, and its radical scavenging ability may be an important basis for this effect. We investigated whether carteolol hydrochloride, which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines using mouse macrophages (MPs) and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). MPs and PBMCs were collected from BALB/C strain mice, treated simultaneously with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and test agents (carteolol hydrochloride, timolol maleate, betaxolol hydrochloride, levobunolol hydrochloride, or nipradilol) in medium, and incubated in a CO2 incubator. TNF-alpha and IL-6 in medium were measured by ELISA. Carteolol hydrochloride significantly inhibited the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by MPs at 10(-5) M and higher (p < 0.01) or PBMCs at 10(-6) M and higher (p < 0.01) compared to the controls, while the other test agents had no inhibitory effect. Carteolol hydrochloride inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines by inflammatory cells, raising the possibility that this intraocular hypotensive drug may be expected to have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with increased intraocular tension and postoperative inflammation. The short-term additive effect and side effects of adding 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride to nonselective beta-blockers were investigated in 21 patients with ocular hypertension or early primary open-angle glaucoma. After a unilateral single dose application of topical 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride, intraocular pressure (IOP), heart rate, and interpalpebral distance were measured. The mean IOP of treated eyes showed a decline from a baseline of 20.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg to 18.1 +/- 3.2 mmHg at 1 hour (P less than 0.005), 16.5 +/- 2.6 mmHg at 2 hours (P less than 0.001), 15.2 +/- 2.5 mmHg at 3 hours (P less than 0.001), 18.5 +/- 3.0 mmHg at 12 hours (P = 0.02), and 19.2 +/- 2.9 mmHg at 24 hours (P = 0.2). No statistically significant change in the heart rate was seen. The interpalpebral distance of the treated eyes showed a significant increase (P less than 0.05) at all time intervals except 24 hours (P = 0.17). The authors conclude that 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride provides an additive pressure-lowering effect to nonselective beta-blockers for at least 12 hours after a single application, and shows promise as a useful adjunctive agent for short-term use in glaucoma therapy.",Bunolol hydrochloride,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03804252669215202), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.576226532459259), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014615730382502079)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4233,"('Levobunolol hydrochloride', 'Betagan', 'Levobunolol (hydrochloride)', 'Levobunolol hcl', 'Levobunolol.hcl')",Medical,"Levobunolol (trade names AKBeta, Betagan, Vistagan, among others) is a non-selective beta blocker. It is used topically in the form of eye drops to manage ocular hypertension (high pressure in the eye) and open-angle glaucoma. == Contraindications == Like other non-selective beta blockers, levobunolol is contraindicated in patients with airway diseases such as asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as heart problems such as sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, and cardiogenic shock. Combination with MAO-A inhibitors is also contraindicated because it could cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Levobunolol is not useful for the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. == Side effects == The most common side effect is eye irritation felt as stinging or burning, which occurs in up to a third of patients. Blepharoconjunctivitis occurs in up to 5% of patients. Rarer adverse effects include keratitis, edema and increased lacrimation. Allergies are rare, but seem to be more common than under the related drug timolol. If the substance reaches the nasal mucosa via the tear duct, it can be absorbed into the bloodstream and cause systemic side effects. These include orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) and other effects on the heart and circulatory system, breathing problems in people with asthma, and skin symptoms such as itching and aggravation of psoriasis. == Interactions == Even in the form of eye drops, levebunolol may cause hypotension when combined with alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs that lower blood pressure. It can also cause severe hypertension (high blood pressure) when combined with sympathomimetic drugs or MAO-A inhibitors, bradycardia (low heart rate) when combined with antiarrhythmics or mefloquine, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when combined with antidiabetic drugs such as insulin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Levobunolol is a non-cardioselective beta blocker, that is, it blocks beta-1 receptors as well as beta-2 receptors. The latter type dominates in the ciliary body, where it controls aqueous humour production. Blocking this type of receptor reduces aqueous humour production, lowering intraocular pressure. The substance has no relevant membrane stabilizing effect or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Like other beta blockers, and unlike the anti-glaucoma medication pilocarpine, levobunolol has no effect on accommodation and pupil size. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance quickly penetrates the cornea and reaches the aqueous humour. It is reduced to dihydrolevobunolol, which is equally active, in the eye's tissues. The drug starts to lower intraocular pressure within an hour, reaches its maximum effect after two to six hours, and remains effective for up to 16 hours. It has an elimination half-life of six hours and is mainly excreted via the kidney. == Chemistry == Levobunolol is the pure L-enantiomer of bunolol and has more than 60 times the pharmacological activity of D-bunolol. It is used as the hydrochloride, which melts at 209 to 211 °C (408 to 412 °F) and is soluble in water and methanol and slightly soluble in ethanol. == References == Ishibashi T, Yokoi N, Kinoshita S (2003).

However, the mechanism by which Dex exhibits anti-inflammation effects on LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia cells remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of Dex in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. The BV2 cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). BV2 cells were infected with short-hairpin RNAs targeting NF-κB (NF-κB-shRNAs) and NF-κB overexpression lentivirus, respectively. In addition, miR-340 mimics or miR-340 inhibitor was transfected into BV2 cells, respectively. Meanwhile, the dual-luciferase reporter system assay was used to explore the interaction of miR-340 and NF-κB in BV2 cells. CCK-8 was used to detect the viability of BV2 cells. In addition, Western blotting was used to detect the level of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12, IL-10 and MCP-1 in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells were measured with ELISA. The level of miR-340 was significantly upregulated in Dex-treated BV2 cells. Meanwhile, the level of NF-κB was significantly increased in BV2 cells following infection with lenti-NF-κB, which was markedly reversed by Dex. LPS markedly increased the expression of NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells, which were reversed in the presence of Dex. Moreover, miR-340 mimics enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects of Dex in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via inhibiting NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, Dex obviously inhibited LPS-induced phagocytosis in BV2 cells. Taken together, our results suggested that Dex might exert anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells via upregulation of miR-340. Therefore, Dex might serve as a potential agent for the treatment of neuroinflammation.

The canine lung carcinoma stage classification system was used to determine clinical stage for dogs with pulmonary carcinoma. Pulmonary carcinoma was the most frequently encountered tumor type (296/340 [87.1%]), followed by sarcoma (26 [7.6%]), adenoma (11 [3.2%]), and pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor (5 [1.5%]); there was also 1 plasmacytoma and 1 carcinosarcoma. Twenty (5.9%) sarcomas were classified as primary pulmonary histiocytic sarcoma. There was a significant difference in median survival time between dogs with pulmonary carcinomas (399 days), dogs with histiocytic sarcomas (300 days), and dogs with neuroendocrine tumors (498 days). When dogs with pulmonary carcinomas were grouped on the basis of clinical stage, there were no significant differences in median survival time between dogs that did and did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Results indicated that pulmonary carcinoma is the most common cause of primary pulmonary neoplasia in dogs; however, nonepithelial tumors can occur. Survival times were significantly different between dogs with pulmonary carcinoma, histiocytic sarcoma, and neuroendocrine tumor, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the relative incidence of these various histologic diagnoses.

This includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and wide complex tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin. Common side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the fetus or the infant. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again. Amiodarone was first made in 1961 and came into medical use in 1962 for chest pain believed to be related to the heart. It was pulled from the market in 1967 due to side effects. In 1974 it was found to be useful for arrhythmias and reintroduced. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the long-term suppression of arrhythmias. Amiodarone is commonly used to treat different types of abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial arrhythmias (supraventricular arrhythmias) and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias are terms often used interchangeably to refer to abnormal heart rhythms originating from the upper chambers of the heart, known as the atria. These types of arrhythmias include conditions such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. They are collectively referred to as supraventricular or atrial arrhythmias because they occur above (supra) the ventricles in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Ventricular arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart. These arrhythmias can be potentially life-threatening and may disrupt the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Amiodarone can be effective in treating conditions like ventricular fibrillation (a rapid and irregular heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat originating from the lower chambers), and cardiac arrest due to shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. In cases where a patient is experiencing shock-resistant ventricular arrhythmias including stable ventricular tachycardia or unstable ventricular fibrillation, amiodarone may be used. A recent study suggested that another antiarrhythmic, procainamide, may be more effective in stopping ventricular tachycardia – with less side effects and a higher survival rate in patients requiring multiple shocks. However, due to a small sample size and lack of statistical significance, more evidence is required, and amiodarone remains the drug of choice in ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone is also commonly used as the first-line therapy for patients who receive shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators caused by ventricular arrhythmias. Combining amiodarone with beta-blockers has been shown to reduce the likelihood of experiencing inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators. === Cardiac arrest === Defibrillation is the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. While amiodarone has been used in shock-refractory cases, evidence of benefit is poor. Although amiodarone does not appear to improve survival in those who had a cardiac arrest in-hospital, some studies suggested that early administration of amiodarone was associated with better survival and positive outcomes for people who had a cardiac arrest out-of-hospital. === Ventricular tachycardia === Amiodarone may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in certain instances. Individuals with hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia should not initially receive amiodarone. These individuals should be cardioverted. Amiodarone can be used in individuals with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia. In these cases, amiodarone can be used regardless of the individual's underlying heart function and the type of ventricular tachycardia; it can be used in individuals with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, but is contraindicated in individuals with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as it is associated with a prolonged QT interval which will be made worse with anti-arrhythmic drugs. === Atrial fibrillation === Individuals who have undergone open heart surgery are at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (or AF) in the first few days post-procedure. In the ARCH trial, intravenous amiodarone (2 g administered over 2 d) has been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery when compared to placebo. However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy and have shown potentially fatal side effects such as pulmonary toxicities. While amiodarone is not approved for AF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is a commonly prescribed off-label treatment due to the lack of equally effective treatment alternatives. So-called 'acute onset atrial fibrillation', defined by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2003, responds well to short-duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low. Amiodarone is an effective, antiarrhythmic-of-choice in achieving cardioversion to sinus rhythm in critical care populations with new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). However, other anti-arrhythmic agents may exert superior rhythm control, rate control and lower mortality rate which may be more favourable than amiodarone in specific cases. == Contraindications == Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are strongly advised not to take amiodarone. Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking the drug are advised to stop nursing. It is contraindicated in individuals with sinus nodal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and second or third-degree heart block who do not have an artificial pacemaker. Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated. Formulations of amiodarone that contain benzyl alcohol should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol may cause the potentially fatal ""gasping syndrome"". Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by digitalis toxicity. Contraindications of amiodarone also include: hypersensitivity to amiodarone or any of its components; severe hepatic impairment; sinus node dysfunction, including severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, since amiodarone can cause significant bradycardia and sinus nodal arrest; second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, due to its negative chronotropic (affecting the heart rate) and dromotropic (affecting the conductivity) effects on the AV conduction system, unless a pacemaker is implanted; thyrotoxicosis that cannot be controlled by conventional means, such as Graves' disease. There are no specific guidelines for endurance or high-intensity exercise while taking amiodarone. However, since amiodarone may cause bradycardia and QTc prolongation which can affect exercise capacity and increase the risk of arrhythmias during intense exercise, it would generally be advisable for patients taking this medication to consult their healthcare provider before engaging in high-intensity physical activities such as strenuous endurance exercises. == Side effects == At oral doses of 400 mg per day or higher, amiodarone can have serious, varied side effects, including toxicity to the thyroid gland, liver, lung, and retinal functions, requiring clinical surveillance and regular laboratory testing. Allergic reactions to amiodarone may occur. Most individuals administered amiodarone on a chronic basis will experience at least one side effect. In some people, daily use of amiodarone at 100 mg oral doses can be effective for arrhythmia control with no or minimal side effects. Some common side effects include: nausea and vomiting; taste disturbances (changes in taste perception, often described as a metallic or bitter taste in the mouth); photosensitivity of the skin, also known as photodermatitis, where exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation may lead to skin reactions such as rashes or sunburn-like symptoms; corneal microdeposits (deposits may accumulate on the cornea over time, resulting in blurred vision or visual halos—bright circles or rings around a light source, such as headlights; still, these corneal deposits typically do not affect vision significantly); thyroid dysfunction (in approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; the drug can lead to both hypo- and hyperthyroidism); pulmonary toxicity (lung problems such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease may occur rarely but have the potential for serious consequences if left untreated); liver abnormalities (liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and hepatotoxicity, although severe cases are rare); bradycardia and heart block (since it slows down heart rate by affecting the sinus node function and AV conduction system, it can increase the risk of heart block); QT Interval prolongation. Amiodarone can potentially cause renal toxicity, but solid studies on whether amiodarone may be toxic to the kidneys are lacking. === Lung === Side effects of oral amiodarone at doses of 400 mg or higher include various pulmonary effects. The most serious reaction is interstitial lung disease. Risk factors include high cumulative dose, more than 400 milligrams per day, duration over two months, increased age, and preexisting pulmonary disease. Some individuals were noted to develop pulmonary fibrosis after a week of treatment, while others did not develop it after years of continuous use. Common practice is to avoid the agent if possible in individuals with decreased lung function. The most specific test of pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone is a dramatically decreased DLCO noted on pulmonary function testing. === Thyroid === Induced abnormalities in thyroid function are common. In approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur. Amiodarone is structurally similar to thyroxine and also contains iodine. Both of these factors contribute to the effects of amiodarone on thyroid function. Amiodarone also causes an anti-thyroid action, via Plummer and Wolff–Chaikoff effects, due its large amount of iodine in its molecule, which causes a particular ""cardiac hypothyroidism"" with bradycardia and arrhythmia. Thyroid function should be checked at least every six months. Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which compared amiodarone with other medications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5–10 mU/L) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or sotalol). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/L) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within the first six months of amiodarone treatment. Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), can be caused due to the high iodine content in the drug via the Jod-Basedow effect. This is known as Type 1 AIT, and usually occurs in patients with an underlying predisposition to hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, within weeks to months after starting amiodarone. Type 1 AIT is usually treated with anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy. Type 2 AIT is caused by a destructive thyroiditis due to a direct toxic effect of amiodarone on thyroid follicular epithelial cells. Type 2 AIT can occur even years after starting amiodarone, is usually self-limited and responds to anti-inflammatory treatment such as corticosteroids. In practice, often the type of AIT is undetermined or presumed as mixed with both treatments combined. Thyroid uptake measurements (I-123 or I-131), which are used to differentiate causes of hyperthyroidism, are generally unreliable in patients who have been taking amiodarone. Because of the high iodine content of amiodarone, the thyroid gland is effectively saturated, thus preventing further uptake of isotopes of iodine. However, positive radioactive iodine can be used to rule in type 1AIT . === Eye === Corneal micro-deposits (cornea verticillata, also called vortex or whorl keratopathy) are almost universally present (over 90%) in individuals taking amiodarone longer than 6 months, especially doses greater than 400 mg/day. These deposits typically do not cause any symptoms. About 1 in 10 individuals may complain of a bluish halo. Anterior subcapsular lens deposits are relatively common (50%) in higher doses (greater than 600 mg/day) after 6 months of treatment. Optic neuropathy, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION), occurs in 1–2% of people and is not dosage dependent. Bilateral optic disc swelling and mild and reversible visual field defects can also occur. Loss of eyelashes has been linked to amiodarone use. === Liver === Abnormal liver enzyme results are common in people taking amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). In clinical observations, it has been noted that the administration of amiodarone, even at lower therapeutic doses, has been associated with the development of a condition mimicking alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition, often referred to as pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis, presents with similar histopathological features to those observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, this extreme adverse event manifestation—pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis caused by low dose amiodarone—is very rare. === Skin === Long-term administration of amiodarone (usually more than eighteen months) is associated with a light-sensitive blue-grey discoloration of the skin, sometimes called ceruloderma; such patients should avoid exposure to the sun and use sunscreen that protects against ultraviolet-A and -B. The discoloration will slowly improve upon cessation of the medication, however, the skin color may not return completely. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use during pregnancy may result in a number of problems in the infant including thyroid problems, heart problems, neurological problems, and preterm birth. Use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended though one dose may be okay. === Other === Long-term use of amiodarone has been associated with peripheral neuropathies. Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for epididymitis. Amiodarone accumulates in the head of the organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped. Some cases of gynecomastia have been reported in men on amiodarone. A retrospective cohort study found an increased risk of digestive, liver, head and neck and liver cancers amongst male patients exposed to amiodarone versus female participants in the same study and the general population. This study also identified that the Standardized Incidence Ratio of cancer occurrence increased significantly in males aged 20-59 and >80 years old who were exposed to a higher dose of Amiodarone in comparison to those exposed to a lower dose. This suggests that there is a dose-effect relationship. These results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the study design and care should be taken prior to altering current clinical and prescribing practices. Amiodarone and its effect on cancer is still a topic that requires more robust research. == Drug-drug interactions == The pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs, including many that are commonly administered to individuals with heart disease, are affected by amiodarone. Amiodarone has particularly important interactions with the following drugs: class I antiarrhythmics (amiodarone should not be combined with other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, etc., due to an increased risk of QTc prolongation and potential arrhythmias); beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (combining amiodarone with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, such as sotalol, can further slow down heart rate and cause bradycardia or heart block); digoxin (amiodarone inhibits a protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which transports digoxin out of cells in the gut, liver, and kidneys, therefore, concurrent use of these medications increases digoxin levels in the body, potentially leading to digoxin toxicity); statins (amiodarone can inhibit enzymes in the liver responsible for metabolizing certain statins, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, etc., therefore interaction elevates plasma concentrations of these statins, increasing the risk of myopathy, that is muscle damage, or rhabdomyolysis, that is severe muscle breakdown); warfarin (since the anticoagulation effects of warfarin depend on metabolism of warfarin by both cytochromes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, coadministation leads to rise in international normalized ratio (INR)—the amount of time taken for the blood to form a clot—placing patient at higher bleeding risks); Amiodarone potentiates the action of warfarin by inhibiting the clearance of both (S) and (R) warfarin. Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin doses adjusted based on their dosing of amiodarone and have their anticoagulation status (measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) measured more frequently. Dose reduction of warfarin is as follows: 40% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 400 mg daily, 35% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 300 mg daily, 30% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 200 mg daily, and 25% reduction if amiodarone dose is 100 mg daily. The effect of amiodarone on the warfarin concentrations can be as early as a few days after initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks; anti-HIV medications (several HIV medications, such as ritonavir, indinavir, etc., interact with amiodarone by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzyme hence leading to decreased clearance of amiodarone, i.e., increasing the concentration of amiodarone in the organism). Amiodarone inhibits the action of the cytochrome P450 isozyme family; such inhibition reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following: ciclosporin, digoxin, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, sildenafil, simvastatin, theophylline, warfarin. In 2015, Gilead Sciences warned healthcare providers about people who began taking the hepatitis C drugs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir along with amiodarone, who developed abnormally slow heartbeats or died of cardiac arrest. == Metabolism == Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, therefore, amiodarone and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs that depend on cytochrome P450, such as digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, etc. The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic properties. The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by grapefruit, leading to elevated serum levels of amiodarone. On 8 August 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure or death, when simvastatin is used with amiodarone. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg. This drug combination, especially with higher doses of simvastatin, should be avoided. Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway of amiodarone is by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. The metabolism of amiodaron can be characterized by two phases: phase I metabolism, when amiodarone undergoes oxidative processes mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8; these reactions result in the formation of several active metabolites, including desethylamiodarone (DEA) and di-desethylamiodarone (DDEA); DEA is the most abundant metabolite and exhibits similar pharmacological effects as amiodarone; phase II metabolism, when both amiodarone and its major metabolite DEA can undergo conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid; this process increases water solubility of these compounds for their efficient elimination from the body. Amiodarone has an exceptionally long half-life due to a combination of several factors: high lipid solubility, given that amiodarone has high lipid solubility, which allows it to distribute throughout various tissues in the body rapidly; the extensive tissue distribution of amiodarone contributes to a large volume of distribution that leads to slow clearance from plasma compartments; extensive tissue binding, so that amiodarone extensively binds to different tissues, including fat deposits, muscles, heart tissue, and other organs; this binding creates reservoirs where drug release can occur slowly over time, resulting in an extended duration of action even after stopping the therapy; enterohepatic recycling, meaning that amiodarone undergoes enterohepatic recycling, where it is reabsorbed from the intestines after being excreted into bile, which contributes to its prolonged presence. === Excretion === Excretion is primarily via the liver and the bile duct with almost no elimination via the kidney and it is not dialyzable. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25 to 100 days [Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st edition]) for amiodarone and 36 days for the active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA). There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as a presence in breast milk. Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i.e. liver, lungs), therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months. Whereas amiodarone is primarily eliminated from the body through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, a very small portion of amiodarone and its metabolites are excreted unchanged in urine or feces. The liver plays a significant role in the elimination of amiodarone. After being extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, amiodarone is transported into bile via multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) transporter. Bile containing amiodarone and its metabolites is then released into the gastrointestinal tract. Some of these compounds can be reabsorbed back into systemic circulation through enterohepatic recirculation, where they may undergo additional rounds of metabolism before eventually being excreted again into bile. Because renal excretion contributes only minimally to the elimination of amiodarone, dose adjustment based on kidney function is generally not necessary. This is because most patients with normal renal function can adequately clear the drug through hepatic metabolism and biliary elimination pathways. == Pharmacology == Amiodarone is categorized as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability. It has numerous other effects, however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Amiodarone is a blocker of voltage gated potassium (KCNH2) and voltage gated calcium channels (CACNA2D2). Amiodarone slows the conduction rate and prolongs the refractory period of the SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibers without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. Amiodarone has been shown to prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive β-adrenergic inhibitor. It also shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, via sodium-channel effects. It is suggested that amiodarone may also exacerbate the phenotype associated with Long QT-3 syndrome causing mutations such as ∆KPQ. This effect is due to a combination of blocking the peak sodium current, but also contributing to an increased persistent sodium current. Amiodarone chemically resembles thyroxine (thyroid hormone), and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions. The mechanisms of action of amiodarone include blocking potassium ion channels (prolonging repolarization), blocking sodium ion channels, and antagonizing alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The action of amiodarone can be characterized by the following effects: potassium channel blockade, since amiodarone blocks potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization during phase 3 of the action potential, so that this blockade prolongs the duration of cardiac action potentials, resulting in an increased refractory period and decreased excitability; sodium channel blockade, characterized by inhibiting sodium ion influx through voltage-gated sodium channels, so that amiodarone reduces the conduction velocity of electrical impulses in cardiac tissue that leads to a slowed heart rate and improved rhythm control; calcium channel blockade, by inhibiting L-type calcium channels in myocardial cells, decreasing intracellular calcium concentration during ventricular contraction; noncompetitive adrenergic receptor antagonism, meaning that amiodarone has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonistic effects, which help reduce sympathetic stimulation on the heart. == History == The original observation that amiodarone's progenitor molecule, khellin, had cardioactive properties, was made by the Russian physiologist Gleb von Anrep while working in Cairo in 1946. Khellin is obtained from a plant extract of Khella or Ammi visnaga, a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments. This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound. Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, Belgium, by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for angina pectoris. As a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and sotalol had antiarrhythmic properties and belonged to a new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular functions with K+ channels. Based on Singh's work, the Argentinian physician Mauricio Rosenbaum began using amiodarone to treat his patients who have supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results. Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh's theories, physicians in the United States began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was reluctant to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown an increased incidence of serious pulmonary side effects of the drug. In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians if it was not approved. In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias. === Name === Amiodarone may be an acronym for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-[4-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-3,5-diiodophenyl]methanone, where ar is a placeholder for phenyl. This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone, where the arylmethanone is conserved. == Dosing == Amiodarone is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Orally, it is available under the brand names Pacerone (produced by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.) and Cordarone (produced by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). It is also available under the brand name Aratac (produced by Alphapharm Pty Ltd) in Australia and New Zealand, and further in Australia under the brands Cardinorm and Rithmik as well as a number of generic brands. Also Arycor in South Africa (Produced by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals.). In South America, it is known as Atlansil and is produced by Roemmers. In India, amiodarone is marketed (produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) under the brand name Tachyra. It is also available in intravenous ampules and vials. The dose of amiodarone administered is tailored to the individual and the dysrhythmia that is being treated. When administered orally, the bioavailability of amiodarone is quite variable. Absorption ranges from 22 to 95%, with better absorption when it is given with food. == References ==",Nexterone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02492597885429859), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0071037812158465385)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/history/nexterone.html,https://www.drugs.com/nexterone.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/nexterone.html ', [])"

It was originally made from nitrogen mustard. == Medical uses == Chlorambucil's current use is mainly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as it is well tolerated by most patients, though chlorambucil has been largely replaced by fludarabine as first-line treatment in younger patients. It can be used for treating some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, polycythemia vera, trophoblastic neoplasms, and ovarian carcinoma. Moreover, it also has been used as an immunosuppressive drug for various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, such as nephrotic syndrome. == Side effects == Bone marrow suppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is the most commonly occurring side effect of chlorambucil. Withdrawn from the drug, this side effect is typically reversible. Like many alkylating agents, chlorambucil has been associated with the development of other forms of cancer. Less commonly occurring side effects include: Gastrointestinal Distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and oral ulcerations). Central Nervous System: Seizures, tremors, muscular twitching, confusion, agitation, ataxia, and hallucinations. Skin reactions Hepatotoxicity Infertility Hair Loss == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Chlorambucil produces its anti-cancer effects by interfering with DNA replication and damaging the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage induces cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis via the accumulation of cytosolic p53 and subsequent activation of Bcl-2-associated X protein, an apoptosis promoter. Chlorambucil alkylates and cross-links DNA during all phases of the cell cycle, inducing DNA damage via three different methods of covalent adduct generation with double-helical DNA: Attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA. DNA damage via the formation of cross-links which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription. Induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations. The precise mechanisms by which chlorambucil acts to kill tumor cells are not yet completely understood. === Limitations to bioavailability === A recent study has shown Chlorambucil to be detoxified by human glutathione transferase Pi (GST P1-1), an enzyme that is often found over-expressed in cancer tissues. This is important since Chlorambucil, as an electrophile, is made less reactive by conjugation with glutathione, thereby making the drug less toxic to the cell. Shown above, Chlorambucil reacts with glutathione as catalyzed by hGSTA 1-1 leading to the formation of the monoglutathionyl derivative of Chlorambucil. == Chemistry == Chlorambucil is a white to pale beige crystalline or granular powder with a slight odor. When heated to decomposition it emits very toxic fumes of hydrogen chloride and nitrogen oxides == History == Nitrogen mustards arose from the derivatization of sulphur mustard gas after military personnel exposed to it during World War I were observed to have decreased white blood cell counts. Since the sulphur mustard gas was too toxic to be used in humans, Gilman hypothesized that by reducing the electrophilicity of the agent, which made it highly chemically reactive towards electron-rich groups, then less toxic drugs could be obtained. To this end, he made analogues that were less electrophilic by exchanging the sulphur with a nitrogen, leading to the nitrogen mustards. With an acceptable therapeutic index in humans, nitrogen mustards were first introduced in the clinic in 1946. Aliphatic mustards were developed first, such as mechlorethamine hydrochloride (mustine hydrochloride), which is still used in the clinic today. In the 1950s, aromatic mustards like chlorambucil were introduced as less toxic alkylating agents than the aliphatic nitrogen mustards, proving to be less electrophilic and react with DNA more slowly. Additionally, these agent can be administered orally, a significant advantage. Chlorambucil was first synthesized by Everett et al. == References == == External links == Leukeran (manufacturer's website) ""Chlorambucil"". Drug Information Portal.

4241,"('Cillin', 'Benzopenicillin', 'Dropcillin', 'Gelacillin', 'Liquacillin')",Medical,"Benzylpenicillin, also known as penicillin G (PenG) or BENPEN, is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. This includes pneumonia, strep throat, syphilis, necrotizing enterocolitis, diphtheria, gas gangrene, leptospirosis, cellulitis, and tetanus. It is not a first-line agent for pneumococcal meningitis. Due to benzylpenicillin's limited bioavailability for oral medications, it is generally taken as an injection in the form of a sodium, potassium, benzathine, or procaine salt. Benzylpenicillin is given by injection into a vein or muscle. Two long-acting forms benzathine benzylpenicillin and procaine benzylpenicillin are available for use by injection into a muscle only. Side effects include diarrhea, seizures, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. When used to treat syphilis or Lyme disease a reaction known as Jarisch–Herxheimer may occur. It is not recommended in those with a history of penicillin allergy. Use during pregnancy is generally safe in the penicillin and β-lactam class of medications. Benzylpenicillin is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Antimicrobial potency === As an antibiotic, benzylpenicillin is noted to possess effectiveness mainly against gram-positive organisms. Some gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Leptospira weilii are also reported to be susceptible to benzylpenicillin. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects can include hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, fever, joint pains, rashes, angioedema, anaphylaxis, serum sickness-like reaction. Rarely central nervous system toxicity including convulsions (especially with high doses or in severe renal impairment), interstitial nephritis, haemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders. Also reported diarrhoea (including antibiotic-associated colitis). Benzylpenicillin has relatively low toxicity, except for in the nervous system, in which it is one of the most active drugs among β-lactam agents. In addition, benzylpenicillin is a potential skin irritant and may cause breathing difficulties if inhaled. Benzylpenicillin serum concentrations can be monitored either by traditional microbiological assay or by more modern chromatographic techniques. Such measurements can be useful to avoid central nervous system toxicity in any person receiving large doses of the drug on a chronic basis, but they are especially relevant to patients with kidney failure, who may accumulate the drug due to reduced urinary excretion rates. == Manufacture == Benzylpenicillin is produced by fermentation of Penicillium chrysogenum. The production of benzylpenicillin involves fermentation, recovery and purification of the penicillin. The fermentation process of the production of benzylpenicillin creates the product. The presence of the product in solution inhibits the reaction and reduces the product rate and yield. Thus, in order to obtain the most product and increase the rate of reaction, it is continuously extracted. This is done by mixing the mold with either glucose, sucrose, lactose, starch, or dextrin, nitrate, ammonium salt, corn steep liquor, peptone, meat or yeast extract, and small amounts of inorganic salts. The recovery of the benzylpenicillin is the most important part of the production process because it affects the later purification steps if done incorrectly. There are several techniques used to recover benzylpenicillin: aqueous two-phase extraction, liquid membrane extraction, microfiltration, and solvent extraction. In the purification step, the benzylpenicillin is separated from the extraction solution. This is normally done by using a separation column. == Synonyms == Penicillin II (old UK nomenclature for naming penicillins) Wonder drug == References ==",Liquacillin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02405354008078575), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014267577789723873)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4243,"('Cyproheptadine hydrochloride', 'Cyproheptadine hcl', 'Periactin hydrochloride', 'Anarexol', 'Cipractin')",Medical,"Cyproheptadine, sold under the brand name Periactin among others, is a first-generation antihistamine with additional anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, and local anesthetic properties. It was patented in 1959 and came into medical use in 1961. In 2022, it was the 293rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Cyproheptadine is used to treat allergic reactions (specifically hay fever). There is evidence supporting its use for allergies, but second generation antihistamines such as ketotifen and loratadine have shown equal results with fewer side effects. It is also used as a preventive treatment against migraine. In a 2013 study the frequency of migraine was dramatically reduced in patients within 7 to 10 days after starting treatment. The average frequency of migraine attacks in these patients before administration was 8.7 times per month, this was decreased to 3.1 times per month at 3 months after the start of treatment. This use is on the label in the UK and some other countries. It is also used off-label in the treatment of cyclical vomiting syndrome in infants; the only evidence for this use comes from retrospective studies. Cyproheptadine is sometimes used off-label to improve akathisia in people on antipsychotic medications. It is used off-label to treat various dermatological conditions, including psychogenic itch, drug-induced hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and prevention of blister formation for some people with epidermolysis bullosa simplex. One of the effects of the drug is increased appetite and weight gain, which has led to its use (off-label in the USA) for this purpose in children who are wasting as well as people with cystic fibrosis. It is also used off-label in the management of moderate to severe cases of serotonin syndrome, a complex of symptoms associated with the use of serotonergic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (and monoamine oxidase inhibitors), and in cases of high levels of serotonin in the blood resulting from a serotonin-producing carcinoid tumor. Cyproheptadine has sedative effects and can be used to treat insomnia similarly to other centrally-acting antihistamines. The recommended dose for this use is 4 to 8 mg. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects include: === Overdose === Gastric decontamination measures such as activated charcoal are sometimes recommended in cases of overdose. The symptoms are usually indicative of CNS depression (or conversely CNS stimulation in some) and excess anticholinergic side effects. The LD50 in mice is 123 mg/kg and 295 mg/kg in rats. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cyproheptadine is a very potent antihistamine or inverse agonist of the H1 receptor. At higher concentrations, it also has anticholinergic, antiserotonergic, and antidopaminergic activities. Of the serotonin receptors, it is an especially potent antagonist of the 5-HT2 receptors. This is thought to underlie its effectiveness in the treatment of serotonin syndrome. However, it is possible that blockade of 5-HT1 receptors may also contribute to its effectiveness in serotonin syndrome. Cyproheptadine has been reported to block 85% of 5-HT2 receptors in the human brain at a dose of 4 mg three times per day (12 mg/day total) and to block 95% of 5-HT2 receptors in the human brain at a dose of 6 mg three times per day (18 mg/day total) as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). The dose of cyproheptadine recommended to ensure blockade of the 5-HT2 receptors for serotonin syndrome is 20 to 30 mg. Besides its activity at neurotransmitter targets, cyproheptadine has been reported to possess weak antiandrogenic activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Cyproheptadine is well-absorbed following oral ingestion, with peak plasma levels occurring after 1 to 3 hours. Its terminal half-life when taken orally is approximately 8 hours. == Chemistry == Cyproheptadine is a tricyclic benzocycloheptene and is closely related to pizotifen and ketotifen as well as to tricyclic antidepressants. == Research == Cyproheptadine was studied in one small trial as an adjunct in people with schizophrenia whose condition was stable and were on other medication; while attention and verbal fluency appeared to be improved, the study was too small to draw generalizations from. It has also been studied as an adjuvant in two other trials in people with schizophrenia, around fifty people overall, and did not appear to have an effect. There have been some trials to see if cyproheptadine could reduce sexual dysfunction caused by SSRI and antipsychotic medications. Cyproheptadine has been studied for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. == Veterinary use == Cyproheptadine is used in cats as an appetite stimulant: 1371 and as an adjunct in the treatment of asthma. Possible adverse effects include excitement and aggressive behavior. The elimination half-life of cyproheptadine in cats is 12 hours.

Blood, liver, kidney, gall bladder bile, and urine were obtained and investigated for metabolites. Chromatographic procedures followed by enzymatic or solvolytic cleavage of conjugates and subsequent crystallization with appropriate carrier steroids revealed the pattern of metabolites formed. Injected estrone sulfate was partially hydrolyzed and reconjugated, resulting in the production of estrone and estradiol glucuronides. The main metabolites, however, were monosulfates of 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, 16-keto-17beta-estradiol, and estriol as well as disulfates of 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, estriol, and 16beta-hydroxyestrone. Particularly high amounts of these were found in urine. By far the main metabolites of injected estrone were glucuronides of estrone and estradiol, although the pattern of mono- and disulfated steroids was qualitatively similar to that found after estrone sulfate injection. It is concluded that the guinea pigs employed in the study hydroxylated estrogen in the 16alpha- and 16beta-configurations and that this activity was much more pronounced after injection of estrone sulfate than after estrone. Efflux transport of estrogens such as estrone-3-sulfate (E1S), and estrone (E1) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated using the Brain Efflux Index (BEI) method. The apparent BBB efflux rate constant (Keff) of [3H]E1S, and [3H]E1 was 6.63 x 10(-2) +/- 0.77 x 10(-2) min(-1), and 6.91 x 10(-2) +/- 1.23 x 10(-2) min(-1), respectively. The efflux transport of [3H]E1S from brain across the BBB was a saturable process with Michaelis constant (Km) of 96.0 +/- 34.4 microM and 93.4 +/- 22.0 microM estimated by two different methods. By determining [3H]E1S metabolites using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after intracerebral injection, significant amounts of [3H]E1S were found in the jugular venous plasma, providing direct evidence that most of [3H]E1S is transported from brain across the BBB in intact form. To compare the apparent efflux clearance across the BBB of E1S with that of E1, the brain distribution volume of E1S and E1 was estimated using the brain slice uptake method. The apparent efflux clearance of [3H]E1S was determined to be 74.9 +/- 3.8 microl/(min x g brain) due to the distribution volume of 1.13 +/- 0.06 ml/g brain. By contrast, the apparent efflux clearance of E1 was more than 227 +/- 3 microl/(min x g brain), since the distribution volume of [3H]E1 at 60 min was 3.28 +/- 0.13 ml/g. The E1S efflux transport process was inhibited by more than 40% by coadministration of bile acids (taurocholate, and cholate), and organic anions (sulfobromophthalein, and probenecid), whereas other organic anions did not affect the E1S efflux transport. The [3H]E1S efflux was significantly reduced by 48.6% after preadministration of 5 mM dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. These results suggest that E1S is transported from brain to the circulating blood across the BBB via a carrier-mediated efflux transport system. Although circulating estrone-3-sulfate is a major precursor of biologically active estrogen, permeation across the plasma membrane is unlikely to occur by diffusion because of the high hydrophilicity of the molecule. The object of this study was to clarify the involvement of specific transporter(s) in the supply of estrone-3-sulfate to human breast cancer-derived T-47D cells, which grow in an estrogen-dependent manner. The proliferation of T-47D cells was increased by the addition of estrone-3-sulfate, or estradiol, to the cultivation medium. The initial uptake rate of estrone-3-sulfate kinetically exhibited a single saturable component, with Km and Vmax values of 7.6 microM and 172 pmol/mg of protein/min, respectively. The replacement of extracellular Na+ with Li+, K+, or N-methylglucamine+ had no effect on the uptake of [3H]estrone-3-sulfate. The uptake was strongly inhibited by sulfate conjugates of steroid hormones, but not by estradiol-17beta-glucuronide. Taurocholate and sulfobromophthalein inhibited the uptake, whereas other tested anionic and cationic compounds did not. The expression of organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP-D and OATP-E, which are candidate transporters of estrone-3-sulfate, was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, although their actual involvement in the uptake of estrogen remains to be clarified. In conclusion, the uptake of estrone-3-sulfate by T-47D cells was mediated by a carrier-mediated transport mechanism, suggesting that the estrogen precursor is actively imported by estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.",[3h]estrone 3-sulfate,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.1614588350057602)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.8909614086151123), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.0251946150674485e-05), ('OUS', -2.3841830625315197e-06), (',', -0.1271851658821106), ('ĠMED', -0.026065519079566002), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023270953446626663)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -6.869017852295656e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.048587486147880554), (' MED', -0.0007099286303855479), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone_sulfate,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone_sulfate_%28medication%29 ', [])"

Synthesized in plants and some micro-organisms, it is the pigment that gives paprika (made from bell peppers), corn, saffron, goji (wolfberries), and many other plants and microbes their characteristic color. The name (pronounced zee-uh-zan'-thin) is derived from Zea mays (common yellow maize corn, in which zeaxanthin provides the primary yellow pigment), plus xanthos, the Greek word for ""yellow"" (see xanthophyll). Xanthophylls such as zeaxanthin are found in highest quantity in the leaves of most green plants, where they act to modulate light energy and perhaps serve as a non-photochemical quenching agent to deal with triplet chlorophyll (an excited form of chlorophyll) which is overproduced at high light levels during photosynthesis. Zeaxanthin in guard cells acts as a blue light photoreceptor which mediates the stomatal opening. Animals derive zeaxanthin from a plant diet. Zeaxanthin is one of the two primary xanthophyll carotenoids contained within the retina of the eye. Zeaxanthin supplements are typically taken on the supposition of supporting eye health. Although there are no reported side effects from taking zeaxanthin supplements, the actual health effects of zeaxanthin and lutein are not proven, and, as of 2018, there is no regulatory approval in the European Union or the United States for health claims about products that contain zeaxanthin. As a food additive, zeaxanthin is a food dye with E number E161h. == Isomers and macular uptake == Lutein and zeaxanthin have identical chemical formulas and are isomers, but they are not stereoisomers. The only difference between them is in the location of the double bond in one of the end rings. This difference gives lutein three chiral centers whereas zeaxanthin has two. Because of symmetry, the (3R,3′S) and (3S,3′R) stereoisomers of zeaxanthin are identical. Therefore, zeaxanthin has only three stereoisomeric forms. The (3R,3′S) stereoisomer is called meso-zeaxanthin. The principal natural form of zeaxanthin is (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin. The macula mainly contains the (3R,3′R)- and meso-zeaxanthin forms, but it also contains much smaller amounts of the third (3S,3′S) form. Evidence exists that a specific zeaxanthin-binding protein recruits circulating zeaxanthin and lutein for uptake within the macula. Due to the commercial value of carotenoids, their biosynthesis has been studied extensively in both natural products and non-natural (heterologous) systems such as the bacteria Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Zeaxanthin biosynthesis proceeds from beta-carotene via the action of a single protein, known as a beta-carotene hydroxylase, that is able to add a hydroxyl group (-OH) to carbon 3 and 3′ of the beta-carotene molecule. Zeaxanthin biosynthesis therefore proceeds from beta-carotene to zeaxanthin (a di-hydroxylated product) via beta-cryptoxanthin (the mono hydroxylated intermediate). Although functionally identical, several distinct beta-carotene hydroxylase proteins are known. Due to the nature of zeaxanthin, relative to astaxanthin (a carotenoid of significant commercial value) beta-carotene hydroxylase proteins have been studied extensively. == Relationship with diseases of the eye == Several observational studies have provided preliminary evidence for high dietary intake of foods including lutein and zeaxanthin with lower incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), most notably the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2). Because foods high in one of these carotenoids tend to be high in the other, research does not separate effects of one from the other. Three subsequent meta-analyses of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin concluded that these carotenoids lower the risk of progression from early stage AMD to late stage AMD. A 2023 (updated) Cochrane review of 26 studies from several countries, however, concluded that dietary supplements containing zeaxanthin and lutein have little to no influence on the progression of AMD. In general, there remains insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of dietary or supplemental zeaxanthin or lutein in treatment or prevention of early AMD. As for cataracts, two meta-analyses confirm a correlation between high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and a decrease in the risk of nuclear cataract, but not cortical or subcapsular cataract. The reports did not separate a zeaxanthin effect from a lutein effect. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) did not reduce the need for cataract surgery. Any benefit is more likely to be apparent in subpopulations of individuals exposed to high oxidative stress, such as heavy smokers, alcoholics or those with low dietary intake of carotenoid-rich foods. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration rejected a Qualified Health Claims application by Xangold, citing insufficient evidence supporting the use of a lutein- and zeaxanthin-containing supplement in prevention of AMD. Dietary supplement companies in the U.S. are allowed to sell lutein and lutein plus zeaxanthin products using dietary supplement, such as ""Helps maintain eye health"", as long as the FDA disclaimer statement (""These statements have not been evaluated..."") is on the label. In Europe, as recently as 2014, the European Food Safety Authority reviewed and rejected claims that lutein or lutein plus zeaxanthin improved vision. == Natural occurrence == Zeaxanthin is the pigment that gives paprika, corn, saffron, wolfberries (goji), and many other plants their characteristic colors of red, orange or yellow. Spirulina is also a rich source and can serve as a dietary supplement. Zeaxanthin breaks down to form picrocrocin and safranal, which are responsible for the taste and aroma of saffron. Dark green leaf vegetables, such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, collard greens, romaine lettuce, watercress, Swiss chard and mustard greens are rich in lutein but contain little to no zeaxanthin, with the exception of scallions cooked in oil. Orange bell peppers (but not green, red, or yellow) are rich in zeaxanthin. == Safety == An acceptable daily intake level for zeaxanthin was proposed as 0.75 mg/kg of body weight/day, or 53 mg/day for a 70 kg adult. In humans, an intake of 20 mg/day for up to six months had no adverse effects. As of 2016, neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Food Safety Authority had set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for lutein or zeaxanthin. == References ==",Zeaxanthin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0008285674848593771), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.12694038450717926), (' PERSONAL', -0.0012917857384309173), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.0021929519716650248), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.018183324486017227), ('ĠEND', -0.8110821843147278), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133706748485565)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zeaxanthin,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeaxanthin ', [])"
4247,"('Sertaconazole nitrate', 'Dermofix', 'Ertaczo', 'Zalain', 'Ginedermofix')",Medical,"Sertaconazole, sold under the brand name Ertaczo among others, is an antifungal medication of the Benzothiophene class. It is available as a cream to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot. It is also available in a vaginal tablet form. The most popular of these is Gyno-Dermofix. == Medical uses == In randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials of 3 to 6 weeks' duration (n=127-383), a significantly greater number of patients with tinea of the glabrous skin and tinea pedis receiving a topical 2% sertaconazole cream once or twice daily achieved a successful mycological cure compared with recipients of a placebo cream. == Side effects == Side effects were rarely reported with sertaconazole therapy, but may include contact dermatitis, burning on application site and skin dryness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sertaconazole has several known mechanisms of action. It is considered fungistatic, fungicidal, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antitrichomonal, and antipruritic. Like other imidazole antifungals, sertaconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting the 14α-demethylase enzyme. Ergosterol is a critical component of the fungal cell membrane. Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis prevents fungal cells from multiplying and impairs hyphae growth. Chemically, sertaconazole contains a benzothiophene ring which makes it unique from other imidazole antifungals. A benzothiophene ring is a sulfur analogue of the indole ring found in the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is found in the fungal membrane in addition to lipids such as ergosterol. The benzothiophene ring in sertaconazole mimics tryptophan and increases the drugs ability to form pores in the fungal cell membrane. If the cell membrane is made sufficiently leaky by these pores the fungal cell will die from loss of ATP and other effects which can include calcium disregulation. These pores are believed to open at about 10 minutes following topical application of sertaconazole. One hour following topical application, approximately 90% of fungal cells die from lack of energy (due to ATP loss) and general loss of homeostasis. Sertaconazole is thought to be the only benzothiophene antifungal with this mechanism of action. Sertaconazole has also antiinflammatory and antipruritic action. It inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines from activated immune cells. It has been shown that sertaconazole activates the p38/COX2/PGE2 pathway. PGE2 can have a variety of important effects in the body including activation of the body's fever response. Sertaconazole also has antibacterial action. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of action again involves sertaconazole's ability to form pores by mimicking tryptophan. It has also been shown that sertaconazole can kill Trichomonas vaginalis in vitro. The exact mechanism of action is as yet unknown. Sertaconazole also appears to inhibit the dimorphic transformation of Candida albicans into pathogenic fungi. The following fungal organisms, among others, are known to be susceptible to sertaconazole: Candida albicans Epidermophyton floccosum Trichophyton mentagrophytes Trichophyton rubrum == Chemistry == Sertaconazole contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers.

4250,"('Penciclovir', 'Denavir', 'Penciclovirum', 'Vectavir', 'Penciclovirum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Penciclovir is a guanosine analogue antiviral drug used for the treatment of various herpesvirus infections. It is a nucleoside analogue which exhibits low toxicity and good selectivity. Because penciclovir is absorbed poorly when given orally (by mouth) it is more often used as a topical treatment. It is the active ingredient in the cold sore medications Denavir (NDC 0135-0315-52), Vectavir and Fenivir. Famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability. Penciclovir was approved for medical use in 1996. == Medical use == In herpes labialis, the duration of healing, pain and detectable virus is reduced by up to one day, compared with the total duration of 2–3 weeks of disease presentation. == Mechanism of action == Penciclovir is inactive in its initial form. Within a virally infected cell a viral thymidine kinase adds a phosphate group to the penciclovir molecule; this is the rate-limiting step in the activation of penciclovir. Cellular (human) kinases then add two more phosphate groups, producing the active penciclovir triphosphate. This activated form inhibits viral DNA polymerase, thus impairing the ability of the virus to replicate within the cell. The selectivity of penciclovir may be attributed to two factors. First, cellular thymidine kinases phosphorylate the parent form significantly less rapidly than does the viral thymidine kinase, so the active triphosphate is present at much higher concentrations in virally infected cells than in uninfected cells. Second, the activated drug binds to viral DNA polymerase with a much higher affinity than to human DNA polymerases. As a result, penciclovir exhibits negligible cytotoxicity to healthy cells. The structure and mode of action of penciclovir are very similar to that of other nucleoside analogues, such as the more widely used aciclovir. A difference between aciclovir and penciclovir is that the active triphosphate form of penciclovir persists within the cell for a much longer time than the activated form of aciclovir, so the concentration within the cell of penciclovir will be higher given equivalent cellular doses. == See also == Nucleoside analogue Famciclovir == References ==",Vectavir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.331102824537084e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004105592146515846)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/vectavir?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='VECTAVIR - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/vectavir?utm_source=openai')])"

4253,"('Triazolam', 'Halcion', 'Songar', 'Triazolamum [inn-latin]', 'U 33030')",Medical,"Triazolam, sold under the brand name Halcion among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant tranquilizer of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepine (BZD) derivatives. It possesses pharmacological properties similar to those of other benzodiazepines, but it is generally only used as a sedative to treat severe insomnia. In addition to the hypnotic properties, triazolam's amnesic, anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties are pronounced as well. Triazolam was initially patented in 1970 and went on sale in the United States in 1982. In 2017, it was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Triazolam is usually used for short-term treatment of acute insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag. It is an ideal benzodiazepine for this use because of its fast onset of action and short half-life. It puts a person to sleep for about 1.5 hours, allowing its user to avoid morning drowsiness. Triazolam is also sometimes used as an adjuvant in medical procedures requiring anesthesia or to reduce anxiety during brief events, such as MRI scans and nonsurgical dental procedures. Triazolam is ineffective in maintaining sleep due to its short half-life, with quazepam showing superiority. Triazolam is frequently prescribed as a sleep aid for passengers travelling on short- to medium-duration flights. If this use is contemplated, the user avoiding the consumption of alcohol is especially important, as is trying a ground-based ""rehearsal"" of the medication to ensure that the side effects and potency of this medication are understood by the user prior to using it in a relatively more public environment (as disinhibition can be a common side effect, with potentially severe consequences). Triazolam causes anterograde amnesia, which is why so many dentists administer it to patients undergoing even minor dental procedures. This practice is known as sedation dentistry. == Side effects == Adverse drug reactions associated with the use of triazolam include: Relatively common (>1% of patients): somnolence, dizziness, lightheadedness, coordination problems Less common (0.9% to 0.5% of patients): euphoria, tachycardia, fatigue, delirium, memory impairment, cramps/pain, depression, visual disturbances Rare (<0.5% of patients): constipation, taste alteration, diarrhea, dry mouth, dermatitis/allergy, abnormal dreams or nightmares, insomnia (paradoxical), paresthesia, tinnitus, dysesthesia, weakness, nasal/sinus congestion Triazolam, although a short-acting benzodiazepine, may cause residual impairment into the next day, especially the next morning. A meta-analysis demonstrated that residual ""hangover"" effects after nighttime administration of triazolam such as sleepiness, psychomotor impairment, and diminished cognitive functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Confusion and amnesia have been reported. In September 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal === A review of the literature found that long-term use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia, and CNS-related adverse effects. Benzodiazepine hypnotics should be used at their lowest possible dose and for a short period of time. Nonpharmacological treatment options were found to yield sustained improvements in sleep quality. A worsening of insomnia (rebound insomnia) compared to baseline may occur after discontinuation of triazolam, even following short-term, single-dose therapy. Other withdrawal symptoms can range from mild unpleasant feelings to a major withdrawal syndrome, including stomach cramps, vomiting, muscle cramps, sweating, tremor, and in rare cases, convulsions. === Contraindications === Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcoholics, or in other drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Triazolam belongs to the Pregnancy Category X of the FDA. It is known to have the potential to cause birth defects. === Elderly === Triazolam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Daytime withdrawal effects can occur. An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of nondrug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underused. Compared with the benzodiazepines including triazolam, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. One study found no evidence of sustained hypnotic efficacy throughout the 9 weeks of treatment for triazolam. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia. == Interactions == Ketoconazole and itraconazole have a profound effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia, and kidney failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, nefazodone, rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Atripla). == Overdose == Symptoms of an overdose include: Coma Hypoventilation (respiratory depression) Somnolence (drowsiness) Slurred speech Seizures Death can occur from triazolam overdose, but is more likely to occur in combination with other depressant drugs such as opioids, alcohol, or tricyclic antidepressants. == Pharmacology == Like other benzodiazepines, triazolam enhances the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA by binding to the allosteric benzodiazepine receptor on GABAA receptor complexes. Triazolam is short-acting, is lipophilic, and is metabolized hepatically via oxidative pathways. Triazolam produces one short-acting active metabolite, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, which is suspected to be of minor clinical significance. The half-life of triazolam is only 2 hours making it a very short acting benzodiazepine drug. It has anticonvulsant effects on brain function. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Triazolam, like other benzodiazepines, is susceptible to misuse and abuse. Its rapid onset of action and short half life contribute to its abuse potential, but its relative obscurity compared to other fast-acting benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam or lorazepam) prevent its abuse from becoming particularly commonplace. Likewise, because it is not prescribed as often or as readily as alprazolam or lorazepam, there is less triazolam available to be diverted for recreational use. === Legal status === Its use at low doses has been deemed acceptable by the US FDA and in several other countries. Triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the US Controlled Substances Act. === Brand names === The drug is marketed in English-speaking countries under the brand names Apo-Triazo, Halcion, Hypam, and Trilam. Other names include 2'-chloroxanax, chloroxanax, triclazolam, and chlorotriazolam. == References ==",Halcion,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3351351299206726e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013267113536130637)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/halcion.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Halcion Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/halcion.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It blocks the release of noradrenaline from nerve terminals. In effect, it decreases output from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. It also acts by blocking K+ channels and is considered a class III antiarrhythmic. The dose is 5–10 mg/kg and side effects are high blood pressure followed by low blood pressure and ventricular ectopy. Originally introduced in 1959 for the treatment of hypertension. Its use as an antiarrhythmic for ventricular fibrillation was discovered and patented by Marvin Bacaner in 1969 at the University of Minnesota. The American Heart Association removed bretylium from their 2000 ECC/ACC guidelines due to its unproven efficacy and ongoing supply problems. Many have cited these supply problems as an issue of raw materials needed in the production of Bretylium. By the release of the AHA 2005 ECC/ACC guidelines there is no mention of Bretylium and it is virtually unavailable throughout most of the world. On June 8, 2011 bretylium tosylate was announced as unavailable in the US after request of Hospira Inc. to withdraw its NDA from the market. Bretylium will remain on the FDA's discontinued drug list since its withdrawal was not the result of a safety or effectiveness concern. In mid 2019, it was reintroduced. == Uses == The drug was used in emergency medicine, cardiology, and other specialties throughout the 1980s-1990s for the acute management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation refractory to other first line treatments such as defibrillation or lidocaine. It is contraindicated in patients with AV (atrioventricular) heart block or digoxin toxicity. Bretylium should be used only in an ICU or emergency department setting and should not be used elsewhere due to its dramatic actions and its predominant side effect of hypotension. == Experimental uses == It is used in physiological and pharmacological research as an inhibitor of sympathetic transmission. Its mechanism of action is the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerve terminals, both by the inhibition of action potentials in the nerve terminals and by other mechanisms. Its specificity for sympathetic nerves is achieved because it is a substrate for the noradrenaline transporter; hence, it accumulates inside nerve terminals which have this transporter. == References ==",Darenthin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.009763529524207115), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0016012478154152632), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011115296743810177)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4255,"('Euphorbia factor l3', 'Diacetyl benzoyl lathyrol;5,15-diacetyl-3-benzoyllathyrol')",Medical," Euphorbia factor L3 (EFL3) is extracted from  In this article, we have focused on the structure identification of Euphorbia factor L3 belonging to the lathyrane diterpenoids isolated from Caper Euphorbia Seed. Its anticancer activity in vitro against lung cancer A549 cells was also investigated and the IC(50) values were 34.04 ± 3.99 μM. Furthermore, Euphorbia factor L3 could induce apoptosis in A549 cells via the mitochondrial pathway including loss of mitochondrial potential and release of cytochrome c. Five series of 37 new acylate and epoxide derivatives (3-39) of Euphorbia factor L3, a lathyrol diterpene isolated from Euphorbia lathyris, were designed by modifying the hydroxyl moiety of C-3, C-5, or C-15. Chemoreversal effects of the acylates on multidrug resistance (MDR) were evaluated in breast cancer multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Eight derivatives exhibited greater chemoreversal ability than verapamil (VRP) against adriamycin (ADR) resistance. Compounds 19 and 25 exhibited 4.8 and 4.0 times, respectively, more effective reversal ability than VRP against ADR resistance. To determine the key characteristics of Euphorbia factor L3 derivatives that contribute to MDR reversal, we conducted a structure-activity relationship study of these compounds.

4256,"('Varenicline tartrate', 'Champix', 'Chantix', 'Varenicline (tartrate)', 'Champix tartrate')",Medical,"Varenicline, sold under the brand names Chantix and Champix among others, is a medication used for smoking cessation and for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. It is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist. When activated, this receptor leads to the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, the brain's reward center, thereby reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms with smoking cessation, although less pronounced than a full agonist (e.g. nicotine). Common side effects include nausea, insomnia, abnormal dreams, headache, and nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat). Despite these potential adverse effects, varenicline has proven efficacy in helping individuals quit smoking. It is estimated that approximately one in eleven smokers who use varenicline successfully remain abstinent from tobacco at six months. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The medication is available as a generic medication. In the United States, varenicline was prescribed over 1 million times in 2020, ranking as the 275th most commonly prescribed medication. == Medical uses == Varenicline is indicated for use as an aid to smoking cessation treatment and for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. Varenicline is used to help people stop smoking tobacco (smoking cessation). A meta-analysis found that 20% of people treated with varenicline remain abstinent from smoking at one year. In a 2009 meta-analysis, varenicline was found to be more effective than bupropion (odds ratio 1.40) and nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) (odds ratio 1.56). A 2013 Cochrane overview and network meta-analysis concluded that varenicline is the most effective medication for tobacco cessation and that smokers were nearly three times more likely to quit tobacco use while on varenicline than with placebo treatment. Varenicline was more efficacious than bupropion or NRT and as effective as combination NRT for cessation of tobacco smoking. == Side effects == Mild nausea is the most common side effect and is seen in approximately 30% of people taking varenicline, though this rarely (<3%) results in discontinuation of the medication. Other less common side effects include headache, difficulty sleeping, and vivid dreams. Rare side effects reported by people taking varenicline compared to placebo include change in taste, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, and constipation. It has been estimated that for every five subjects taking varenicline at maintenance doses, there will be one event of nausea; and for every 24 of 35 treated subjects, there will be an event of constipation or flatulence. Gastrointestinal side-effects lead to discontinuation of the drug in 2% to 8% of people using varenicline. Incidence of nausea is dose-dependent: incidence of nausea was higher in people taking a larger dose (30%) versus placebo (10%) as compared to people taking a smaller dose (16%) versus placebo (11%). === Depression and suicide === In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it had received post-marketing reports of thoughts of suicide and occasional suicidal behavior, erratic behavior, and drowsiness among people using varenicline for smoking cessation. In 2009, the FDA required varenicline to carry a boxed warning that the medication should be stopped if any of these symptoms are experienced. A 2014 systematic review (literature research) did not find evidence of an increased suicide risk. Other analyses have reached the same conclusion and found no increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects with varenicline. No evidence for increased risks of cardiovascular events, depression, or self-harm with varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy was found in one post-marketing surveillance study. In 2016, the FDA removed the black box warning. People are still advised to stop the medication if they ""notice any side effects on mood, behavior, or thinking."" === Cardiovascular disease === In June 2011, the US FDA issued a safety announcement that varenicline may be associated with ""a small, increased risk of certain cardiovascular adverse events in people who have cardiovascular disease."" A prior 2011 review had found increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo. Expert commentary in the same journal raised doubts about the methodology of the review, concerns which were echoed by the European Medicines Agency and subsequent reviews. Of specific concern were ""the low number of events seen, the types of events counted, the higher drop-out rate in people receiving placebo, the lack of information on the timing of events, and the exclusion of studies in which no-one had an event."" In contrast, multiple recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found no increase in overall or serious adverse cardiovascular events (including for individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular disease) associated with varenicline use. == Mechanism of action == Varenicline displays full agonism on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is a partial agonist on the α4β2, α3β4, and α6β2 subtypes. Varenicline's partial agonism on the α4β2 receptors rather than nicotine's full agonism produces less effect of dopamine release than nicotine's. This α4β2 competitive binding reduces the ability of nicotine to bind and stimulate the mesolimbic dopamine system—similar to the method of action of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid addiction. However, it is the α7-pentamer that mediates clinical efficacy at remaining abstinent from nicotine. == Pharmacokinetics == Most of the active compound is excreted by the kidneys (92–93%) via the organic cation transporter OCT2 (SCL22A2) and may inhibit it at high concentrations. A small proportion is glucuronidated, oxidised, N-formylated or conjugated to a hexose. == History == Use of Cytisus plants as a smoking substitute during World War II led to use as a cessation aid in eastern Europe and extraction of cytisine. Cytisine analogs led to varenicline at Pfizer. Varenicline received a priority review by the US FDA in February 2006, shortening the usual ten-month review period to six months because of its demonstrated effectiveness in clinical trials and perceived lack of safety issues. The agency's approval of the drug came in May 2006. In September 2006, it was approved for sale in the European Union. In September 2021, Pfizer announced a recall of ""all lots of its anti-smoking treatment, Chantix [varenicline], due to high levels of cancer-causing agents called nitrosamines in the pills"". This followed a July 2021 announcement by the FDA that it was ""alerting patients and health care professionals to Pfizer's voluntary recall of nine lots of the smoking cessation drug"" and further recalls by Pfizer on 19 July and 8 August. In June 2021, Pfizer paused distribution of Chantix worldwide; ""the distribution halt was out of an abundance of caution, pending further testing"", the company said in an email. According to the Pfizer Inc. 2020 Form 10-K Annual Report, high-revenue products by the company include[d] Chantix/Champix (varenicline) to treat nicotine addiction, which recorded direct product revenues of more than $1 billion in 2019, $919 million in 2020, and $398 million in 2021 (the lower 2021 revenue was due, in part, to the basic product patent expiration for Chantix in the US in November 2020 and in Europe in September 2021, and the aforementioned Pfizer voluntary recall across multiple markets and a global pause in shipments of Chantix.) In October 2021, the US FDA approved Oyster Point Pharma to market Tyrvaya as a new route of varenicline administration through nasal spray for the treatment of dry eye disease. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT03636061 for ""Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of OC-01 Nasal Spray on Signs and Symptoms of Dry Eye Disease (The ONSET-1 Study)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT04036292 for ""Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of OC-01 (Varenicline) Nasal Spray on Dry Eye Disease"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Chantix,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.9682672902708873e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003582789213396609)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/chantix.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Chantix: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/chantix.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4257,"('Dobutamine hydrochloride', 'Dobutamine hcl', 'Dobutrex', 'Inotrex', 'Dobutamine (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Dobutamine is a medication used in the treatment of cardiogenic shock (as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion) and severe heart failure. It may also be used in certain types of cardiac stress tests. It is given by IV only, as an injection into a vein or intraosseous as a continuous infusion. The amount of medication needs to be adjusted to the desired effect. Onset of effects is generally seen within 2 minutes. It has a half-life of two minutes. This drug is generally only administered short term, although it may be used for longer periods to relieve symptoms of heart failure in patients awaiting heart transplantation. Common side effects include a fast heart rate, an irregular heart beat, and inflammation at the site of injection. Use is not recommended in those with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. It primarily works by direct stimulation of β1 receptors, which increases the strength of the heart's contractions, leading to a positive inotropic effect. Generally it has little effect on a person's heart rate. Dobutamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. It was initially made from isoproterenol. == Medical uses == Dobutamine is used to treat acute but potentially reversible heart failure, such as which occurs during cardiac surgery or in cases of septic or cardiogenic shock, on the basis of its positive inotropic action. Dobutamine can be used in cases of congestive heart failure to increase cardiac output. It is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility, which could be the result of either organic heart disease or cardiac surgical procedures. Higher doses are not useful with history of recent ischemic heart disease because it increases heart rate and thus increases myocardial oxygen demand. The drug is also commonly used in the hospital setting as a pharmacologic stress testing agent to identify coronary artery disease. == Adverse effects == Primary side effects include those commonly seen for β1 active sympathomimetics, such as hypertension, angina, arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Used with caution in atrial fibrillation as it has the effect of increasing the atrioventricular (AV) conduction. The most dangerous side effect of dobutamine is increased risk of arrhythmia, including fatal arrhythmias. Overall, dobutamine tends to produce less tachycardia and peripheral vascular effects than agents such as epinephrine and isoproterenol. == Pharmacology == Dobutamine is a direct-acting agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the β1-adrenoceptors of the heart, increasing contractility and cardiac output. Since it does not act on dopamine receptors to inhibit the release of norepinephrine (another α1 agonist), dobutamine is less prone to induce hypertension than is dopamine. Dobutamine is predominantly a β1-adrenergic agonist, with weak β2 activity, and α1 selective activity, although it is used clinically in cases of cardiogenic shock for its β1 inotropic effect in increasing heart contractility and cardiac output. Dobutamine is administered as a racemic mixture consisting of both (+) and (−) isomers; the (+) isomer is a potent β1 agonist and α1 antagonist, while the (−) isomer is an α1 agonist. The administration of the racemate results in the overall β1 agonism responsible for its activity. (+)-Dobutamine also has mild β2 agonist activity, which makes it useful as a vasodilator. == History == It was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at Eli Lilly and Company, as a structural analogue of isoprenaline. == References == == External links == ""Dobutamine"". Drug Information Portal.

It is a first line treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, feeling tired, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, low blood pressure, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is among a class of drugs called ACE inhibitors and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. Quinapril was patented in 1980 and came into medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 253rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure. It may be used for the treatment of hypertension by itself or in combination with thiazide diuretics, and with diuretics and digoxin for heart failure. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Pregnancy Impaired renal and liver function Patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor Hypersensitivity to Quinapril == Side effects == Side effects of Quinapril include dizziness, cough, vomiting, upset stomach, angioedema, and fatigue. == Mechanism of action == Quinapril inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, an enzyme which catalyses the formation of angiotensin II from its precursor, angiotensin I. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure through a variety of mechanisms. Due to reduced angiotensin production, plasma concentrations of aldosterone are also reduced, resulting in increased excretion of sodium in the urine and increased concentrations of potassium in the blood. == Nitrosamine controversy and voluntary recall == In April of 2022, Pfizer voluntarily recalled five batches of the drug because of the presence of a nitrosamine, N-Nitroso-quinapril. Testing found that the amount of nitrosamines was above the acceptable daily intake level (all humans are exposed to nitrosamines up to a certain daily level by cured and grilled meats, water, dairy products, and vegetables) set by the U.S.'s Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Though long-term ingestion of N-Nitroso-quinapril potentially might cause cancer in some individuals, there is not believed to be an imminent risk of harm. == References == == External links == ""Quinapril hydrochloride"".

4259,"('Alosetron hcl', 'Lotronex', 'Gr 68755c', 'Alosetron (hydrochloride)', 'Alosetron hydrochloride(1:x)')",Medical,"Alosetron, sold under the brand name Lotronex among others, is a 5-HT3 antagonist used for the management of severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in females only. It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 2002. It is currently marketed by Prometheus Laboratories Inc. (San Diego). Alosetron was withdrawn from the market in 2000 owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, but was reintroduced in 2002 with availability and use restricted. == Medical uses == Alosetron is indicated only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) who have: chronic IBS symptoms (generally lasting 6 months or longer), had anatomic or biochemical abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract excluded, and not responded adequately to conventional therapy. Severe IBS-D includes diarrhea and 1 or more of the following: frequent and severe abdominal pain/discomfort, frequent bowel urgency or fecal incontinence, disability or restriction of daily activities due to IBS. === Efficacy === The phase III trial for approval was published in 2000 as an industry-funded randomized, placebo-controlled trial (PCT). Its authors found 1 mg alosetron, taken orally twice daily for 12 weeks, was associated with a 12% (CI 4.7-19.2) improvement in relief from abdominal pain and discomfort associated with diarrhea-predominant patients. The prescription of alosetron is currently approved in the U.S. at 0.5 and 1 mg. The FDA Medical Officer's Review, dated November 4, 1999, noted: ""Patients considered by investigators to fit the diarrhea-predominant subtype had at baseline... stool consistency values that were neither loose nor watery"". The FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee referred to the drug's efficacy as ""modest"", highlighting that the placebo brought relief on the primary outcome measure to 40–50% of women. == Contraindications == Lotronex's prescribing information brochure states that alosetron should not be initiated in patients with constipation. Other contraindications are: history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation; intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions, ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state; Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; diverticulitis; severe hepatic impairment. Concomitant use of fluvoxamine is also contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Alosetron was withdrawn in 2000 following the association of alosetron with serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects. The cumulative incidence of ischaemic colitis was 2 in 1000, while serious complications arising from constipation (obstruction, perforation, impaction, toxic megacolon, secondary colonic ischaemia, death) was 1 in 1000. A 1999 review performed by FDA medical officer John Senior, indicated that 27% of patients experienced constipation. The phase III trial reported constipation occurred in 30% and 3% of patients in the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. It was cited as the most important reason for patients dropping out of the study. == Mechanism of action == Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors of the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract. While being a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron, it is not classified or approved as an antiemetic. Since stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors is positively correlated with gastrointestinal motility, alosetron's 5-HT3 antagonism slows the movement of fecal matter through the large intestine, increasing the extent to which water is absorbed, and decreasing the moisture and volume of the remaining waste products. == History == Alosetron was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2000, after a seven-month review. At the time of the initial approval U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers found that alosetron improved symptoms in 10% to 20% of patients. Shipment to pharmacies started in March, 2000. On July 17, a health professional filed a report with the FDA on the death of a 50-year-old woman who suffered mesenteric ischemia. The report identified alosetron as the ""primary suspect"" in the death. Alosetron was withdrawn from the market voluntarily by GlaxoWellcome on November 28, 2000, owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, including 5 deaths and additional bowel surgeries. The FDA said it had reports of 49 cases of ischemic colitis and 21 cases of ""severe constipation"" and that ten of the 70 patients underwent surgeries and 34 others were examined at hospitals and released without surgery. Through November 17, 2000, pharmacists had filled 474,115 prescriptions for alosetron. Severe adverse events continued to be reported, with a final total of 84 instances of ischaemic colitis, 113 of severe constipation, 143 admissions to hospital, and 7 deaths. Patient advocacy groups, most notably the Lotronex Action Group and the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) lobbied for the drug's return. Public Citizen Health Research Group, another patient advocacy group, opposed the reintroduction. On June 7, 2002, the FDA announced the approval of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) that allows restricted marketing of Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride), to treat only women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The strict prescribing guidelines initially introduced in 2002 were relaxed slightly in 2016, enabling electronic prescriptions among other benefits. It is not known whether alosetron has been filed for registration in the EU. GSK sold Lotronex to the Californian corporation Prometheus in late 2007. Since 2015, generic versions of alosetron have been available in the US, sold by a number of different companies including Actavis Pharma Company, Prometheus Laboratories and Sebela Pharmaceuticals Inc === Criticism of the FDA === In 2001, the editor of the medical journal The Lancet, Richard Horton, criticized the FDA's handling of alosetron in an unusually sharp language. Horton argued that the treatment of a non-fatal condition did not justify the use of a drug with potentially lethal side effects, and that the FDA should have revoked the approval for alosetron sooner when postmarketing surveillance revealed that many patients had suffered constipation necessitating surgical intervention and ischaemic colitis. He asserted that FDA officials were improperly motivated to maintain and reinstate the approval for alosetron because of the extent to which the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is funded by user fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers, and that the reinstatement of alosetron was negotiated in confidential meetings with representatives of GlaxoSmithKline. An article published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) noted: ""By allowing the marketing of alosetron, a drug that poses a serious and significant public health concern according to its own terms, the FDA failed in its mission."" Others have argued that the approval process of Lotronex was an example of regulatory capture. == References ==",Lotronex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002076410164590925)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/lotronex.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=77, start_index=9, title='Lotronex: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/lotronex.html?utm_source=openai')])"
