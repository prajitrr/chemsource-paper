1885,"('Fusidic acid (sodium salt)', 'Sodium fusidate', 'Fusidic acid', 'Fusidine', 'Ramycin')",Medical,"Fusidic acid, sold under the brand name Fucidin among others, is a steroid antibiotic that is often used topically in creams or ointments and eyedrops but may also be given systemically as tablets or injections. As of October 2008, the global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in its use. == Medical uses == Fusidic acid is active in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, most coagulase-positive staphylococci, Beta-hemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium species, and most clostridium species. Fusidic acid has no known useful activity against enterococci or most Gram-negative bacteria (except Neisseria, Moraxella, Legionella pneumophila, and Bacteroides fragilis). Fusidic acid is active in vitro and clinically against Mycobacterium leprae but has only marginal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One use of fusidic acid is its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to fusidic acid, there is a low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation is all that is required), fusidic acid should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere. However, resistance selection is low when pathogens are challenged at high drug exposure. Topical fusidic acid is occasionally used as a treatment for acne vulgaris. As a treatment for acne, fusidic acid is often partially effective at improving acne symptoms. However, research studies have indicated that fusidic acid is not as highly active against Cutibacterium acnes as many other antibiotics that are commonly used as acne treatments. Fusidic acid is also found in several additional topical skin and eye preparations (e.g., Fucibet), although its use for these purposes is controversial. == Side effects == Fucidin tablets and suspension, whose active ingredient is sodium fusidate, occasionally cause liver damage, which can produce jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes). This condition will almost always get better after the patient finishes taking Fucidin tablets or suspension. Other related side-effects include dark urine and lighter-than-usual feces. These, too, should normalize when the course of treatment is completed. == Pharmacology == Fusidic acid acts as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by preventing the turnover of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. Fusidic acid is effective primarily on Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species. Fusidic acid is a tetracyclic, naturally occurring steroid derived from the fungus Fusidium coccineum. It was first isolated in 1960 and developed by Leo Pharma in Ballerup, Denmark, being used clinically from 1962 onwards. It has also been isolated from Mucor ramannianus, an Acremonium species, and Isaria kogana. The drug is licensed for use as its sodium salt sodium fusidate, and it is approved for use under prescription in Australia, Canada, Colombia, the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. == Mechanism of action == Fusidic acid binds to EF-G after translocation and GTP (guanosine-5'-triphosphate) hydrolysis. This interaction prevents the necessary conformational changes for EF-G release from the ribosome, effectively blocking the protein synthesis process. Fusidic acid can only bind to EF-G in the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. Since translocation is a part of elongation and ribosome recycling, fusidic acid can block either or both steps of protein synthesis. == Dose == Fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat S. aureus infections when used at low drug dosages. However, it may be possible to use fusidic acid as monotherapy when used at higher doses. The use of topical preparations (skin creams and eye ointments) containing fusidic acid is strongly associated with the development of resistance, and there are voices advocating against the continued use of fusidic acid monotherapy in the community. Topical preparations used in Europe often contain fusidic acid and gentamicin in combination, which helps to prevent the development of resistance. === Cautions === There is inadequate evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Animal studies and many years of clinical experience suggest that fusidic acid is devoid of teratogenic effects (birth defects), but fusidic acid can cross the placental barrier. == Resistance == In vitro susceptibility studies of US strains of several bacterial species such as S. aureus, including MRSA and coagulase negative Staphylococcus, indicate potent activity against these pathogens. Mechanisms of resistance have been extensively studied only in Staphylococcus aureus. The most studied mechanism is the development of point mutations in fusA, the chromosomal gene that codes for EF-G. The mutation alters EF-G so that fusidic acid is no longer able to bind to it. Resistance is readily acquired when fusidic acid is used alone and commonly develops during the course of treatment. As with most other antibiotics, resistance to fusidic acid arises less frequently when used in combination with other drugs. For this reason, fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat serious Staph. aureus infections. However, at least in Canadian hospitals, data collected between 1999 and 2005 showed rather low rate of resistance of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant to fusidic acid, and mupirocin was found to be the more problematic topical antibiotic for the aforementioned conditions. Some bacteria also display 'FusB-type' resistance, which has been found to be the most prevalent in Staphylococcus spp. in many clinical isolates. This resistance mechanism is mediated by fusB, fusC, and fusD genes found primarily on plasmids, but have also been found in chromosomal DNA. The product of fusB-type resistance genes is a 213-residue cytoplasmic protein which interacts in a 1:1 ratio with EF-G. FusB-type proteins bind in a region distinct from fusidic acid to induce a conformational change which results in liberation of EF-G from the ribosome, allowing the elongation factor to participate in another round of ribosome translocation. == Interactions == Fusidic acid should not be used with quinolone antibiotics, with which it is antagonistic. Although clinical practice over the past decade has supported the combination of fusidic acid and rifampicin, a recent clinical trial showed that there is an antagonistic interaction when both antibiotics are combined. On 8 August 2008, it was reported that the Irish Medicines Board was investigating the death of a 59-year-old Irish man who developed rhabdomyolysis after combining atorvastatin and fusidic acid, and three similar cases. In August 2011, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued a Drug Safety Update warning that ""systemic fusidic acid (Fucidin) should not be given with statins because of a risk of serious and potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis."" == Society and culture == === Brand names and preparations === == Research == An orally administered mono-therapy with a high loading dose is under development in the United States. A different oral dosing regimen, based on the compound's pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) profile is in clinical development in the US. as Taksta. Fusidic acid is being tested for indications beyond skin infections. There is evidence from compassionate use cases that fusidic acid may be effective in the treatment of patients with prosthetic joint-related chronic osteomyelitis. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthetic machinery in Fusidium coccineum (also known as Acremonium fusidioides) has been sequenced and analyzed.

1886,"('Trimethoprim', 'Proloprim', 'Trimpex', 'Trimetoprim', 'Bactramin')",Medical,"Trimethoprim (TMP) is an antibiotic used mainly in the treatment of bladder infections. Other uses include for middle ear infections and travelers' diarrhea. With sulfamethoxazole or dapsone it may be used for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Common side effects include nausea, changes in taste, and rash. Rarely it may result in blood problems such as not enough platelets or white blood cells. Trimethoprim may cause sun sensitivity. There is evidence of potential harm during pregnancy in some animals but not humans. It works by blocking folate metabolism via dihydrofolate reductase in some bacteria, preventing creation of bacterial DNA and RNA and leading to bacterial cell death. Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is primarily used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, although it may be used against any susceptible aerobic bacterial species. It may also be used to treat and prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. It is generally not recommended for the treatment of anaerobic infections such as Clostridioides difficile colitis (the leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea). Trimethoprim has been used in trials to treat retinitis. Resistance to trimethoprim is increasing, but it is still a first-line antibiotic in many countries. === Spectrum of susceptibility === Cultures and susceptibility tests should be done to make sure bacteria are treated by trimethoprim. Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Klebsiella pneumoniae Enterobacter species Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae == Side effects == === Common === Nauseas Change in taste Vomiting Diarrhea Rashes Sun sensitivity Itchiness === Rare === Can cause thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) by lowering folic acid levels; this may also cause megaloblastic anemia. Trimethoprim antagonizes the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule, thus acting like amiloride. This can cause increased potassium levels in the body (hyperkalemia). Can compete with creatinine for secretion into the renal tubule. This can cause an artificial rise in the serum creatinine. Use in EHEC infections may lead to an increase in expression of Shiga toxin. === Contraindications === Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim History of megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency It may be involved in a reaction similar to disulfiram when alcohol is consumed after it is used, in particular when used in combination with sulfamethoxazole. === Pregnancy === Based on the studies that show that trimethoprim crosses the placenta and can affect folate metabolism, there has been growing evidence of the risk of structural birth defects associated with trimethoprim, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. The trophoblasts in the early fetus are sensitive to changes in the folate cycle. A 2013 study found a doubling in the risk of miscarriage in women exposed to trimethoprim in the early pregnancy. == Mechanism of action == Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's inhibitory activity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is sixty thousand times greater than for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used in combination due to possible synergistic effects, and reduced development of resistance. This benefit has been questioned. == History == Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. In 1972, it was used as a prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections in Finland. Its name is derived from trimethyloxy-pyrimidine. == References ==",Bactramin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06114519387483597), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011407507583498955)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.029750604182481766)])","('INFO; https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/B/Bactramin.html ', [])"
1887,"('Prazosin (hydrochloride)', 'Prazosin', 'Furazosin', 'Prazosine', 'Prazocin')",Medical,"Prazosin, sold under the brand name Minipress among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, symptoms of an enlarged prostate, and nightmares related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is an α1 blocker. It is a less preferred treatment of high blood pressure. Other uses may include heart failure and Raynaud syndrome. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and heart palpitations. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure with standing and depression. Prazosin is a non-selective inverse agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptors. It works to decrease blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and helps with an enlarged prostate by relaxing the outflow of the bladder. How it works in PTSD is not entirely clear. Prazosin was patented in 1965 and came into medical use in 1974. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 183rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Prazosin is active after taken by mouth and has a minimal effect on cardiac function due to its α1-adrenergic receptor selectivity. When prazosin is started, however, heart rate and contractility can increase in order to maintain the pre-treatment blood pressures because the body has reached homeostasis at its abnormally high blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect becomes apparent when prazosin is taken for longer periods of time. The heart rate and contractility go back down over time and blood pressure decreases. The antihypertensive characteristics of prazosin make it a second-line choice for the treatment of high blood pressure. Prazosin is also useful in treating urinary hesitancy associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, blocking α1-adrenergic receptors, which control constriction of both the prostate and urethra. Although not a first-line choice for either hypertension or benign prostatic hyperplasia, it is a choice for people who present with both problems concomitantly. During its use for urinary hesitancy in military veterans in the 1990s, Murray A. Raskind and colleagues discovered that prazosin appeared to be effective in reducing nightmares. Subsequent reviews indicate prazosin is effective in improving sleep quality and treating nightmares related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prazosin is used off-label in the treatment of insomnia for its sedative effects. Prazosin is an inverse agonist at α1-adrenergic receptors; these receptors are expressed on dendrites that noradrenergic neurons synapse onto in the brain. Some of the noradrenergic pathways in the central nervous system form part of the ascending reticular activating system, which promotes arousal when stimulated. Prazosin inhibits the output neurons of the noradrenergic pathways in that system, in turn causing sedation. The drug is usually recommended for severe stings from the Indian red scorpion. == Adverse effects == Common (4–10% frequency) side effects of prazosin include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fatigue, weakness, palpitations, and nausea. Less frequent (1–4%) side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, edema, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea, syncope, vertigo, depression, anxiety, nasal congestion, and rash. A very rare side effect of prazosin is priapism. One phenomenon associated with prazosin is known as the ""first-dose response"", in which the side effects of the drug — specifically orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and drowsiness — are especially pronounced in the first dose. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope are associated with the body's poor ability to control blood pressure without active α-adrenergic receptors. The nasal congestion is exacerbated by changing body positions, because α1-adrenergic receptors also control nasal vascular blood flow and alpha blockers inhibit this, in the same way that alpha-adrenergic agonists have the opposite effect of being a decongestant. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Prazosin is an α1-blocker that acts as a non-selective inverse agonist at α1-adrenergic receptors, including of the α1A-, α1B-, and α1D-adrenergic receptor subtypes. It binds to these receptors with affinity (Ki) values of 0.13 to 1.0 nM for the α1Α-adrenergic receptor, 0.06 to 0.62 nM for the α1B-adrenergic receptor, and 0.06 to 0.38 nM for the α1D-adrenergic receptor. It has much lower affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 210–5,012 nM for the α2A-adrenergic receptor, 13–398 nM for the α2B-adrenergic receptor, and 10–200 nM for the α2C-adrenergic receptor). The α1-adrenergic receptors are found in vascular smooth muscle, where they are responsible for the vasoconstrictive action of norepinephrine. They are also found throughout the central nervous system. α1-Adrenergic receptors have additionally been found on immune cells, where catecholamine binding can stimulate and enhance cytokine production. === Pharmacokinetics === Prazosin has an onset of action of 30 to 90 minutes, the elimination half-life of prazosin is 2 to 3 hours, and its duration of action is 10 to 24 hours. == Research == Prazosin has been said to be the only selective α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist which has been used in the treatment of insomnia to any significant degree. It is used at doses of 1 to 12 mg for this purpose. The combination of prazosin and the beta blocker timolol may produce greater sedative effects than either of them alone. Prazosin has been shown to prevent death in animal models of cytokine storm. As a repurposed drug, prazosin is being investigated for the prevention of cytokine storm syndrome and complications of COVID-19 where it is thought to decrease cytokine dysregulation. == References ==",Furazosin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00043102685594931245)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12778206169605255), ('ICAL', -3.2186455882765586e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032771711703389883)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16022422909736633), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?code=C767&dictionary=NCI+Thesaurus ', [])"

Balaglitazone is a second generation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist with only partial agonistic properties. Balaglitazone is currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trial in United States and Europe. Selective PPAR-γ modulators bind in distinct manners to the ligand-binding pocket of PPAR-γ, leading to alternative receptor conformations, differential cofactor recruitment/displacement, differential gene expression, and ultimately differential biological responses. Based on this concept, new and improved novel antidiabetic agents are in current development. Clinical studies conducted with 409 subjects of randomized, double blind, parallel-group placebo and active comparator-controlled subject groups to determine the efficacy and safety of Balaglitazone. The study showed that the trial met its primary endpoint. Balaglitazone treated groups shown significantly reduce of HbA1c (%), FSG (mmol/L), postprandial glucose as comparison to pioglitazone. Phase III clinical studies data clearly shows that Balaglitazone provides robust glycemic control as an add-on to insulin therapy. Balaglitazone 10 mg and 20 mg show the similar magnitudes of the effects which comparable to the effects seen in the pioglitazone 45 mg group. The incidence of fluid retention and fat accumulation fewer than those observed with pioglitazone 45 mg. Hence, Balaglitazone is prominent candidate of new glitazone which requires fewer doses as comparison pioglitazone and shows better safety profile less incidence of special adverse effect like heart failure, peripheral oedema, and myocardial infarction. Unlike other marketed PPAR gamma agonists, Balaglitazone shows less fluid retention, less heart enlargement and no reduction of bone formation than full PPAR gamma agonists in preclinical studies. In present review, we have tried to cover classification PPARs various ligands, chemistry, physical properties, commercial synthesis, current patent status, polymorphic information, receptor interaction, pharmacophore rational, mechanism, adverse effect and clinical status of Balaglitazone, giving emphasis on medicinal chemistry aspect. Multidrug resistance in tumor cells is still a big challenge in cancer treatment. Therefore, identification ofsafe and effective multidrug resistance-reversing compounds with minimal side effects is an important approach in cancer treatment. Here, we investigated the role and potential mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in doxorubicin-resistant human myelogenous leukemia (K562/DOX) cells. The effect of doxorubicin on cell viability following treatment with balaglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, was evaluated using trypan blue and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Rhodamine123 assay was used to determine the activity of two common drug efflux membrane transporters P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein-1. P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein-1, and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 messenger RNA/protein expression levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate assay was also employed to investigate apoptosis. We showed that balaglitazone considerably enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. Balaglitazone also significantly downregulated P-glycoprotein expression and activity in K562/DOX cells and reduced multidrug resistance through elevation of intracellular doxorubicin in cells. Furthermore, upon balaglitazone treatment, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 expression could be restored in K562/DOX cells in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-dependent manner. We concluded that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, balaglitazone, could reverse multidrug resistance by inducing phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/ phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ might serve as an effective approach for circumventing multidrug resistance in chemotherapy of cancerous patients. Treatment of patients with perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ full agonists are associated with weight gain, heart failure, peripheral oedema, and bone loss. However, the safety of partial perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists has not been established in a clinical trial. The BALaglitazone glucose Lowering Efficacy Trial aimed to establish the glucose-lowering effects and safety parameters of the perioxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ partial agonist balaglitazone in diabetic patients on stable insulin therapy. Four hundred and nine subjects from three countries with type 2 diabetes on stable insulin therapy were randomized to 26 weeks of double-blind treatment with once daily doses of 10 or 20 mg balaglitazone, 45 mg pioglitazone, or matching placebo (n ≥ 99 in each group). The primary endpoint was the efficacy of balaglitazone 10 and 20 mg versus placebo on the absolute change in haemoglobin A(1c) . Secondary endpoints included levels of fasting serum glucose, and changes in body composition and bone mineral density as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, in comparison to pioglitazone 45 mg. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00515632. In the 10- and 20-mg balaglitazone groups, and in the 45-mg pioglitazone group, significant reductions in haemoglobin A(1c) levels were observed (−0.99, −1.11, and −1.22%, respectively; p < 0.0001) versus placebo. Fasting serum glucose was similarly reduced in all treatment arms. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analyses showed that, while balaglitazone at 10 mg caused weight gain and fluid retention compared to placebo, the magnitude of these effects was significantly smaller than that of pioglitazone 45 mg and balaglitazone 20mg. Balaglitazone at either dose did not appear to reduce bone mineral density, while Pioglitazone showed a trend towards a reduction. Patients treated with balaglitazone at 10 mg and 20 mg and pioglitazone at 45 mg showed clinically meaningful improvements in glucose levels and HbA(1c) .

The initial uptake rate showed an overshoot phenomenon in the presence of an inwardly directed sodium-ion concentration gradient. The overshoot disappeared when the sodium-ion concentration gradient was replaced with a potassium ion concentration gradient. d-Glucose and p-NP-beta-D-Glc analogues inhibited the uptake, whereas uridine, leucine and disaccharide did not. Data on the concentration dependence of p-NP-beta-D-Glc uptake indicated that two carrier-mediated systems are involved. The uptake via the high-affinity site required an inwardly directed sodium-ion concentration gradient, while the uptake via the low-affinity site proceeded such a gradient. D-Glucose competitively inhibited the initial uptake of p-NP-beta-D-Glc via the high-affinity site with a Ki value of 301 microM. The p-NP-beta-D-Glc is transported in the small intestine via both the same carrier-mediated transport system that takes up D-glucose and a distinct low-affinity carrier-mediated transport system. The ability of bacteria to hydrolyse esculin is an important phenotypic characteristic for their identification. The presence of 'esculinase' is especially useful in identifying genera of the Enterobacteriaceae and in separating Bacteroides, Listeria, and group D streptococci from other pathogens. Three methods have been used to measure esculin hydrolysis. Each of these methods suffered from limitations. A new procedure employing the hydrolysable substrate p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was developed.

After drug administration to beagle dogs, blood samples were collected at different time points for pharmacokinetic analysis using the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Parts of plasma samples were used for conformation transformation studies using a normal phase high performance liquid chromatographic (NP HPLC) method. The study showed that oxiracetam enantiomers maintained their original conformation when administered orally to beagle dogs. Concentrations of S-ORT were significantly higher than R-ORT 1.5 and 2 h after administration; the AUC0-∞ of S-ORT after oral administration tended to be higher than that of R-ORT, which showed that the different effects between S-ORT and R-ORT may be partly associated with their distinctive absorption at least. A chiral UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated to determine oxiracetam enantiomers in human plasma, urine, and feces. The R-Oxiracetam and S-Oxiracetam were quantified using a CHIRALPAK ®AD3 column at 25 ℃, and the resolution was greater than 3.2.

Several studies suggest that the substance is safe even when high doses are consumed for a long period of time. However, the mechanism of action of the racetam drug family is still a matter of research. Oxiracetam is not approved by Food and Drug Administration for any medical use in the United States. == Clinical findings == Oxiracetam has been studied to determine if it has an effect on symptoms of dementia, but no consistent results were obtained in patients with Alzheimer's dementia or organic solvent abuse. Patients with mild to moderate dementia experienced some beneficial effects, measured by higher scores on tests for logical performance, attention, concentration, memory and spatial orientation. Improvement was also seen in patients with exogenic post-concussion syndrome, organic brain syndromes and other dementias. Oxiracetam-treated laboratory mice demonstrated a significant increase in spatial learning performance as determined by the Morris water navigation task, compared to controls. This increase in performance was correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC. == Pharmacokinetics == Oxiracetam is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 56-82%. Peak serum levels are reached within one to three hours after a single 800 mg or 2000 mg oral dose, with the maximal serum concentration reaching between 19 and 31 μg/ml at these doses. Oxiracetam is mainly cleared renally and approximately 84% is excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life of oxiracetam in healthy individuals is about 8 hours, whereas it is 10–68 hours in patients with renal impairment. There is some penetration of the blood–brain barrier with brain concentrations reaching 5.3% of those in the blood (measured one hour after a single 2000 mg intravenous dose). Clearance rates range from 9 to 95 ml/min and steady-state concentrations when 800 mg is given twice daily range from 60 μM to 530 μM. The highest brain concentrations of oxiracetam are found in the septum pellucidum, followed by the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex and with the lowest concentrations in the striatum after a 200 mg/kg oral dose given to rats. Oxiracetam may be quantitated in plasma, serum or urine by liquid chromatography with one of several different detection techniques. The major metabolites of Oxiracetam include: beta-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidone, N-aminoacetyl-GABOB, GABOB (beta-hydroxy-GABA) and glycine.

It is taken orally, and is typically used for psoriasis. Acitretin is an oral retinoid used in the treatment of severe resistant psoriasis. Because of the potential for problems and severe side effects it is generally used in only very severe cases of psoriasis that have been unresponsive to other treatments. It binds to nuclear receptors that regulates gene transcription. They induce keratinocyte differentiation and reduce epidermal hyperplasia, leading to the slowing of cell reproduction. Acitretin is readily absorbed and widely distributed after oral administration. A therapeutic effect occurs after two to four weeks or longer. Patients who have received the medication are advised against giving blood for at least three years due to the risk of birth defects. == Adverse effects == Acitretin is highly teratogenic and noted for the possibility of severe birth defects. It should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant within 3 years following the use of acitretin. Sexually active women of childbearing age who use acitretin should also use at least two forms of birth control concurrently. Men and women who use it should not donate blood for three years after using it, because of the possibility that the blood might be used in a pregnant patient and cause birth defects. In addition, it may cause nausea, headache, itching, dry, red or flaky skin, dry or red eyes, dry or chapped lips, swollen lips, dry mouth, thirst, cystic acne or hair loss. == Pharmacokinetics == Acitretin is a metabolite of etretinate, which was used prior to the introduction of acitretin. Etretinate was discontinued because it had a narrow therapeutic index as well as a long elimination half-life (t1/2 = 120 days), making dosing difficult. In contrast, acitretin's half-life is approximately 2 days. However, because acitretin can be reverse metabolised into etretinate which has an extremely long half-life, women must avoid becoming pregnant for at least three years after discontinuing acitretin.

1898,"('Bisphenol a', 'Bisphenol', 'Diphenylolpropane', 'Diano', 'Bisphenol-a')","Medical, Industrial","Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical compound primarily used in the manufacturing of various plastics. It is a colourless solid which is soluble in most common organic solvents, but has very poor solubility in water. BPA is produced on an industrial scale by the condensation reaction of phenol and acetone. Global production in 2022 was estimated to be in the region of 10 million tonnes. BPA's largest single application is as a co-monomer in the production of polycarbonates, which accounts for 65–70% of all BPA production. The manufacturing of epoxy resins and vinyl ester resins account for 25–30% of BPA use. The remaining 5% is used as a major component of several high-performance plastics, and as a minor additive in PVC, polyurethane, thermal paper, and several other materials. It is not a plasticizer, although it is often wrongly labelled as such. The health effects of BPA have been the subject of prolonged public and scientific debate. BPA is a xenoestrogen, exhibiting hormone-like properties that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Although the effect is very weak, the pervasiveness of BPA-containing materials raises concerns, as exposure is effectively lifelong. Many BPA-containing materials are non-obvious but commonly encountered, and include coatings for the inside of food cans, clothing designs, shop receipts, and dental fillings. BPA has been investigated by public health agencies in many countries, as well as by the World Health Organization. While normal exposure is below the level currently associated with risk, several jurisdictions have taken steps to reduce exposure on a precautionary basis, in particular by banning BPA from baby bottles. There is some evidence that BPA exposure in infants has decreased as a result of this. BPA-free plastics have also been introduced, which are manufactured using alternative bisphenols such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F, but there is also controversy around whether these are actually safer. == History == Bisphenol A was first reported in 1891 by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Dianin. In 1934, workers at I.G. Farbenindustrie reported the coupling of BPA and epichlorohydrin. Over the following decade, coatings and resins derived from similar materials were described by workers at the companies of DeTrey Freres in Switzerland and DeVoe and Raynolds in the US. This early work underpinned the development of epoxy resins, which in turn motivated production of BPA. The utilization of BPA further expanded with discoveries at Bayer and General Electric on polycarbonate plastics. These plastics first appeared in 1958, being produced by Mobay, General Electric, and Bayer. The British biochemist Edward Charles Dodds tested BPA as an artificial estrogen in the early 1930s. Subsequent work found that it bound to estrogen receptors tens of thousands of times more weakly than estradiol, the major natural female sex hormone. Dodds eventually developed a structurally similar compound, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was used as a synthetic estrogen drug in women and animals until it was banned due to its risk of causing cancer; the ban on use of DES in humans came in 1971 and in animals, in 1979. BPA was never used as a drug. == Production == The synthesis of BPA still follows Dianin's general method, with the fundamentals changing little in 130 years. The condensation of acetone (hence the suffix 'A' in the name) with two equivalents of phenol is catalyzed by a strong acid, such as concentrated hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or a solid acid resin such as the sulfonic acid form of polystyrene sulfonate. An excess of phenol is used to ensure full condensation and to limit the formation of byproducts, such as Dianin's compound. BPA is fairly cheap to produce, as the synthesis benefits from a high atom economy and large amounts of both starting materials are available from the cumene process. As the only by-product is water, it may be considered an industrial example of green chemistry. Global production in 2022 was estimated to be in the region of 10 million tonnes. Usually, the addition of acetone takes place at the para position on both phenols, however minor amounts of the ortho-para (up to 3%) and ortho-ortho isomers are also produced, along with several other minor by‑products. These are not always removed and are known impurities in commercial samples of BPA. == Properties == BPA has a fairly high melting point but can be easily dissolved in a broad range of organic solvents including toluene, ethanol and ethyl acetate. It may be purified by recrystallisation from acetic acid with water. Crystals form in the monoclinic space group P 21/n (where n indicates the glide plane); within this individual molecules of BPA are arraigned with a 91.5° torsion angle between the phenol rings. Spectroscopic data is available from AIST. == Uses and applications == === Main uses === ==== Polycarbonates ==== About 65–70% of all bisphenol A is used to make polycarbonate plastics, which can consist of nearly 90% BPA by mass. Polymerisation is achieved by a reaction with phosgene, conducted under biphasic conditions; the hydrochloric acid is scavenged with aqueous base. This process converts the individual molecules of BPA into large polymer chains, effectively trapping them. ==== Epoxy and vinyl ester resins ==== About 25–30% of all BPA is used in the manufacture of epoxy resins and vinyl ester resins. For epoxy resin, it is first converted to its diglycidyl ether (usually abbreviated BADGE or DGEBA). This is achieved by a reaction with epichlorohydrin under basic conditions. Some of this is further reacted with methacrylic acid to form bis-GMA, which is used to make vinyl ester resins. Alternatively, and to a much lesser extent, BPA may be ethoxylated and then converted to its diacrylate and dimethacrylate derivatives (bis-EMA, or EBPADMA). These may be incorporated at low levels in vinyl ester resins to change their physical properties and see common use in dental composites and sealants. === Minor uses === The remaining 5% of BPA is used in a wide range of applications, many of which involve plastic. BPA is a major component of several high-performance plastics, the production of these is low compared to other plastics but still equals several thousand tons a year. Comparatively minor amounts of BPA are also used as additives or modifiers in some commodity plastics. These materials are much more common but their BPA content will be low. ==== Plastics ==== As a major component Polycyanurates can be produced from BPA by way of its dicyanate ester (BADCy). This is formed by a reaction between BPA and cyanogen bromide. Examples include BT-Epoxy, which is one of a number of resins used in the production of printed circuit boards. Polyetherimides such as Ultem can be produced from BPA via a nitro-displacement of appropriate bisnitroimides. These thermoplastic polyimide plastics have exceptional resistance to mechanical, thermal and chemical damage. They are used in medical devices and other high performance instrumentation. Polybenzoxazines may be produced from a number of biphenols, including BPA. Polysulfones can be produced from BPA and bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfone forming poly(bisphenol-A sulfone) (PSF). It is used as a high performance alternative to polycarbonate. Bisphenol-A formaldehyde resins are a subset of phenol formaldehyde resins. They are used in the production of high-pressure laminates As a minor component Polyurethane can incorporate BPA and its derivatives as hard segment chain extenders, particularly in memory foams. PVC can contain BPA and its derivatives through multiple routes. BPA is sometimes used as an antioxidant in phthalates, which are extensively used as plasticizers for PVC. BPA has also been used as an antioxidant to protect sensitive PVC heat stabilizers. Historically 5–10% by weight of BPA was included in barium-cadmium types, although these have largely been phased out due health concerns surrounding the cadmium. BPA diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is used as an acid scavenger, particularly in PVC dispersions, such as organosols or plastisols, which are used as coatings for the inside of food cans, as well as embossed clothes designs produced using heat transfer vinyl or screen printing machines. Derivatives used as flame retardants BPA is used to form a number of flame retardants used in plastics. Bromination of BPA forms tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), which is mainly used as a reactive component of polymers, meaning that it is incorporated into the polymer backbone. It is used to prepare fire-resistant polycarbonates by replacing some bisphenol A. A lower grade of TBBPA is used to prepare epoxy resins, used in printed circuit boards. TBBPA is also converted to TBBPA-BDBPE which can be used as a flame retardant in polypropylene. TBBPA-BDBPE is not chemically bonded to the polymer and can leach out into the environment. The use of these compounds is diminishing due to restrictions on brominated flame retardants. The reaction of BPA with phosphorus oxychloride and phenol forms BADP, which is used as a liquid flame retarder in some high performance polymer blends such as polycarbonate/ABS mixtures that are used to form the casings for household electronics. ==== Other applications ==== BPA is used as an antioxidant in several fields, particularly in brake fluids. BPA is used as a developing agent in thermal paper (shop receipts). Recycled paper products can also contain BPA, although this can depend strongly on how it is recycled. Deinking can remove 95% of BPA, with the pulp produced used to make newsprint, toilet paper and facial tissues. If deinking is not performed then the BPA remains in the fibers, paper recycled this way is usually made into corrugated fiberboard. Ethoxylated BPA finds minor use as a 'levelling agent' in tin electroplating. Several drug candidates have also been developed from bisphenol A, including ralaniten, ralaniten acetate, and EPI-001. == BPA substitutes == Concerns about the health effects of BPA have led some manufacturers replacing it with other bisphenols, such as bisphenol S and bisphenol F. These are produced in a similar manner to BPA, by replacing acetone with other compounds, which undergo analogous condensation reactions. Thus, in bisphenol F, the F signifies formaldehyde. Health concerns have also been raised about these substitutes. Alternative polymers, such as tritan copolyester have been developed to give the same properties as polycarbonate (durable, clear) without using BPA or its analogues. == Human safety == === Exposure === As a result of the presence of BPA in plastics and other commonplace materials, most people are frequently exposed to trace levels of BPA. The primary source of human exposure is via food, as epoxy and PVC are used to line the inside of food cans to prevent corrosion of the metal by acidic foodstuffs. Polycarbonate drink containers are also a source of exposure, although most disposable drinks bottles are actually made of PET, which contains no BPA. Among the non-food sources, exposure routes include through dust, thermal paper, clothing, dental materials, and medical devices. Although BPA exposure is common, it does not accumulate within the body, with toxicokinetic studies showing the biological half-life of BPA in adult humans to be around two to five hours. During its elimination, the body first converts BPA into more water-soluble compounds via glucuronidation or sulfation, which are then removed from the body through urine. This allows exposure to be easily determined by urine testing, facilitating convenient biomonitoring of populations. Food and drink containers made from Bisphenol A-containing plastics do not contaminate the content to cause any increased cancer risk. === Health effects and regulation === The health effects of BPA have been the subject of prolonged public and scientific discourse, with PubMed listing more than 18,000 publishings related to the subject as of 2024. Concern is mostly related to its estrogen-like activity, although it can interact with other receptor systems as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. These interactions are all very weak, but exposure to BPA is effectively lifelong, leading to concern over possible cumulative effects. Studying this sort of long‑term, low‑dose interaction is difficult, and although there have been numerous studies, there are considerable discrepancies in their conclusions regarding the nature of the effects observed as well as the levels at which they occur. A common criticism is that industry-sponsored trials tend to show BPA as being safer than studies performed by academic or government laboratories, although this has also been explained in terms of industry studies being better designed. In the 2010s public health agencies in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and Japan as well as the WHO all reviewed the health risks of BPA, and found normal exposure to be below the level currently associated with risk. Regardless, due to the scientific uncertainty, many jurisdictions continued to take steps to reduce exposure on a precautionary basis. In particular, infants were considered to be at greater risk, leading to bans on the use of BPA in baby bottles and related products by the US, Canada, and EU amongst others. Bottle producers largely switched from polycarbonate to polypropylene and there is some evidence that BPA exposure in infants has decreased as a result of this. The European Food Safety Authority completed a re-evaluation into the risks of BPA in 2023, concluding that its tolerable daily intake should be greatly reduced. This led the European Union to ban BPA in all the food contact materials, including plastic and coated packaging, in December of 2024. The ban will come into force after an implementation period of up to three years. BPA exhibits very low acute toxicity (i.e. from a single large dose) as indicated by its LD50 of 4 g/kg (mouse). Reports indicate that it is a minor skin irritant as well, although less so than phenol. === Pharmacology === BPA has been found to interact with a diverse range of hormone receptors, in both humans and animals. It binds to both of the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. BPA is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or partial agonist of the ER, so it can serve as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist. However, it is 1000- to 2000-fold less potent than estradiol, the major female sex hormone in humans. At high concentrations, BPA also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). In addition to receptor binding, the compound has been found to affect Leydig cell steroidogenesis, including affecting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase and aromatase expression and interfering with LH receptor-ligand binding. Bisphenol A's interacts with the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ). This orphan receptor (endogenous ligand unknown) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription. BPA seems to bind strongly to ERR-γ (dissociation constant = 5.5 nM), but only weakly to the ER. BPA binding to ERR-γ preserves its basal constitutive activity. It can also protect it from deactivation from the SERM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (afimoxifene). This may be the mechanism by which BPA acts as a xenoestrogen. Different expression of ERR-γ in different parts of the body may account for variations in bisphenol A effects. BPA has also been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). == Environmental safety == === Distribution and degradation === BPA has been detectable in the natural environment since the 1990s and is now widely distributed. It is primarily a river pollutant, but has also been observed in the marine environment, in soils, and lower levels can also be detected in air. The solubility of BPA in water is low (~300 g per ton of water) but this is still sufficient to make it a significant means of distribution into the environment. Many of the largest sources of BPA pollution are water-based, particularly wastewater from industrial facilities using BPA. Paper recycling can be a major source of release when this includes thermal paper, leaching from PVC items may also be a significant source, as can landfill leachate. In all cases, wastewater treatment can be highly effective at removing BPA, giving reductions of 91–98%. Regardless, the remaining 2–9% of BPA will continue through to the environment, with low levels of BPA commonly observed in surface water and sediment in the U.S. and Europe. Once in the environment BPA is aerobically biodegraded by a wide a variety of organisms. Its half life in water has been estimated at between 4.5 and 15 days, degradation in the air is faster than this, while soil samples degrade more slowly. BPA in sediment degrades most slowly of all, particularly where this is anaerobic. Abiotic degradation has been reported, but is generally slower than biodegradation. Pathways include photo-oxidation, or reactions with minerals such as goethite which may be present in soils and sediments. === Environmental effects === BPA is an environmental contaminant of emerging concern. Despite its short half-life and non-bioaccumulating character, the continuous release of BPA into the environment causes continuous exposure to both plant and animal life. Although many studies have been performed, these often focus on a limited range of model organisms and can use BPA concentrations well beyond environmental levels. As such, the precise effects of BPA on the growth, reproduction, and development of aquatic organism are not fully understood. Regardless, the existing data shows the effects of BPA on wildlife to be generally negative. BPA appears able to affect development and reproduction in a wide range of wildlife, with certain species being particularly sensitive, such as invertebrates and amphibians. == See also == Structurally related 4,4'-Dihydroxybenzophenone - used as a UV stabilizer in cosmetics and plastics Dinitrobisphenol A - a proposed metabolite of BPA, which may show increased endocrine disrupting character HPTE - a metabolite of the synthetic insecticide methoxychlor Others 2,2,4,4-Tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol - next generation BPA replacement 4-tert-Butylphenol - used as a chain-length regulator in the production of polycarbonates and epoxy resins, it has also been studied as a potential endocrine disruptor == References ==",Bisphenol-a,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.00017641419253777713), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029784437268972397)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=93, start_index=12, title='Bisphenol A', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A?utm_source=openai')])"

It is available both alone and in combination with an estrogen. NOMAC is taken by mouth. A birth control implant for placement under the skin was also developed but ultimately was not marketed. Side effects of NOMAC include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, and others. NOMAC is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has some antiandrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. Nomegestrol, a related compound, was patented in 1975, and NOMAC was described in 1983. NOMAC was first introduced for medical use, for the treatment of gynecological disorders and in menopausal hormone therapy, in Europe in 1986. It was subsequently approved in Europe in 2011 as a component of birth control pills. NOMAC is available widely throughout the world. It is not available in the United States or Canada. == Medical uses == NOMAC is used alone in the treatment of gynecological disorders including menstrual disturbances (e.g., dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, oligomenorrhea, polymenorrhea, amenorrhea), vaginal bleeding, breast pain, and premenstrual syndrome and in menopausal hormone therapy. It is used in combination with estradiol as a birth control pill and in menopausal hormone therapy. NOMAC-only tablets are also used as a form of progestogen-only birth control, although they are not specifically licensed as such. === Available forms === NOMAC is available both alone and in combination with estrogens. The following formulations are available: NOMAC 3.75 mg and 5 mg oral tablets (Lutenyl) – indicated for menopausal hormone therapy and gynecological disorders NOMAC 3.75 mg and estradiol 1.5 mg oral tablets (Naemis) – indicated for menopausal hormone therapy NOMAC 2.5 mg and estradiol 1.5 mg oral tablets (Zoely) – indicated for birth control The availability of these formulations differs by country. == Contraindications == Because NOMAC is metabolized by the liver, hepatic impairment can result in an accumulation of the medication. == Side effects == The side effects of NOMAC are similar to those of other progestogens. It is well tolerated and often produces no side effects. Possible side effects of NOMAC include menstrual irregularities (e.g., abnormal bleeding or spotting), headache, nausea, breast tenderness, and weight gain. However, body weight is generally unchanged. Rarely, meningiomas have been reported in association with NOMAC. == Overdose == There have been no reports of serious adverse effects due to overdose of NOMAC. NOMAC has been administered alone at a dosage of up to 40 times the recommended dosage, and the combination of NOMAC and estradiol has been administered in multiple doses of up to 5 times the recommended dosage to women in clinical trials, and no safety concerns or harmful effects were observed in either case. Symptoms of NOMAC and estradiol overdose might include nausea, vomiting, and, in young girls, slight vaginal bleeding. There is no antidote for NOMAC overdose and treatment of overdose should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == The metabolism of NOMAC is dependent on CYP3A4, so inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme such as ketoconazole and rifampicin, respectively, as well as some anticonvulsants, may pose a clinically significant drug interaction with NOMAC. (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see here.) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === NOMAC has progestogenic activity, antigonadotropic effects, antiandrogenic activity, and no other important hormonal activity. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== NOMAC is a potent and pure progestogen, acting as a selective, high-affinity full agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) (Ki = 3 nM, 67–303% of the relative binding affinity of progesterone), and is said to have higher potency and substantially improved selectivity for the PR relative to medroxyprogesterone acetate (the 6-hydrogenated or non-6-7-double bonded analogue of megestrol acetate and the most widely used progestin). In accordance, NOMAC is a potent antigonadotropin and exhibits no androgenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity, but does possess some antiandrogenic activity. Due to its potent antigonadotropic activity, NOMAC has strong functional antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects when administered at sufficiently high doses. Like many other progestogens, NOMAC has been assessed and found in vitro to inhibit the conversion of estrone sulfate to estrone (via inhibition of steroid sulfatase) and estrone to estradiol (via inhibition of 17β-HSDTooltip 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) at high concentrations (0.5–50 μM) and to stimulate the conversion of estrone into estrone sulfate (via activation of estrogen sulfotransferase activity) at low concentrations (0.05–0.5 μM), whilst not affecting aromatase activity at any tested concentration (up to 10 μM). These activities appear to be PR-dependent, as NOMAC is more potent in producing them in PR-rich cell lines (e.g., T47-D vs. MCF-7) and they can be blocked by the PR antagonist mifepristone (RU-486). Although the clinical implications of these actions are unclear and they have yet to be confirmed in vivo or assessed in clinical studies, it has been suggested that NOMAC and certain other progestins may be useful in the treatment of ERTooltip estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by decreasing levels of estrogens in breast tissue. In accordance with this notion, in vitro, NOMAC does not have proliferative effects on breast tissue, does not stimulate breast cell proliferation via PGRMC1Tooltip progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (similarly to progesterone), and reduces the breast proliferative effects of estradiol when added to it in medium. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of NOMAC is 1.5 to 5 mg/day. Due to its high antigonadotropic activity and its long elimination half-life, the contraceptive effectiveness of NOMAC is maintained even when a dose is missed; clinical studies found no increased incidence of pregnancy with one missed pill of Zoely or even with two missed pills during days 8 to 17 of the menstrual cycle. ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== NOMAC acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), with approximately 12 to 31% of the relative binding affinity of testosterone for the AR and 42% of the affinity of metribolone for the AR. Estimates of the antiandrogenic potency of NOMAC are mixed, ranging from 5 to 20%, 20 to 30%, and 90% of that of cyproterone acetate depending on the source. The antiandrogenic activity of NOMAC may be useful in helping to alleviate acne, seborrhea, and other androgen-dependent symptoms in women. ==== Other activity ==== Certain progestins have been found to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Progesterone and NOMAC, in contrast, act neutrally in this assay. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === NOMAC is well-absorbed, with an oral bioavailability of 63%. It is 97.5 to 98% protein-bound, to albumin, and does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. The medication is metabolized hepatically via hydroxylation by the enzymes CYP3A3, CYP3A4, and CYP2A6. It has six main metabolites, all of which have no or minimal progestogenic activity. The elimination half-life of NOMAC is approximately 50 hours, with a range of 30 to 80 hours. Steady-state concentrations of NOMAC are achieved after five days of repeated administration. As Zoely (2.5 mg/day NOMAC), the average circulating concentrations of NOMAC are 4.5 ng/mL at steady-state, with minimum and maximum concentrations of 3.1 ng/mL and 12.3 ng/mL, respectively. The medication is eliminated via urine and feces. == Chemistry == NOMAC, also known as 17α-acetoxy-6-methyl-δ6-19-norprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-6-methyl-19-norpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone belonging to the 19-norprogesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone groups. NOMAC is the C17α acetate ester of nomegestrol and the 19-demethylated (or 19-nor) analogue of megestrol acetate, and can also be referred to as 19-normegestrol acetate. == History == Nomegestrol was patented in 1975, and NOMAC, under the developmental code name TX-066, was first described in the literature in 1983. It was developed by Theramex Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company in Monaco (a satellite country of France). The medication was first introduced in Europe alone or in combination with estradiol under the respective brand names Lutenyl and Naemis for the treatment of gynecological disorders and menopausal symptoms in 1986, and was subsequently developed and approved in 2011 in Europe as a birth control pill in combination with estradiol under the brand name Zoely. As Zoely, NOMAC has been studied in over 4,000 women as a method of birth control. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nomegestrol acetate is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name. It is also known by its former developmental code name TX-066. === Brand names === NOMAC is marketed in combination with estradiol as a birth control pill primarily under the brand name Zoely, in combination with estradiol for use in menopausal hormone therapy primarily under the brand name Naemis, and as a standalone medication for use in menopausal hormone therapy and the treatment of gynecological disorders primarily under the brand name Lutenyl. NOMAC is also marketed alone or in combination with estradiol under a variety of other less common brand names throughout the world. === Availability === NOMAC (either alone (e.g., as Lutenyl) or in combination with estradiol (e.g., as Naemis)) is available for the treatment of gynecological disorders and menopausal symptoms in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Georgia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Taiwan, Tunisia, Turkey, and Vietnam. As a component of birth control pills with estradiol (under the brand name Zoely), NOMAC is available in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Costa Rica, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It was expected that Zoely would become available in the United States in 2010, but the FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration rejected the NDATooltip New Drug Application for Zoely in 2011 and NOMAC ultimately has not been introduced in any form in this country. == Research == Under the tentative brand name Uniplant, NOMAC was under development by Theramex as a 38 mg or 55 mg 4 cm Silastic (silicone-plastic) subcutaneous birth control implant of one-year duration (75 ug/day or 100 μg/day release rate) in Brazil from the 1990s and was extensively studied for this purpose in clinical trials. The clinical studies included 19,900 women-months of use and demonstrated a one-year failure rate of 0.94%. Uniplant was regarded as showing high effectiveness, and was well tolerated. In spite of this however, ""[f]urther plans to make it available have been deferred by decision of the company holding the progestin patent"", and, although it continued to be investigated as late as 2006, the implant ultimately never became commercially available. Oral NOMAC was under development for the treatment of breast cancer and for use as a progestogen-only pill for birth control but did not complete development for these indications. An estradiol and NOMAC vaginal ring was under development for use in birth control and to treat dysmenorrhea but did not complete development and was not marketed. A continuous oral formulation of estradiol and NOMAC was under development for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and the treatment or prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis but did not complete development. == References == == Further reading ==",Nomegestrol acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.033323527139146e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043394684325903654)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomegestrol_acetate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Nomegestrol acetate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomegestrol_acetate?utm_source=openai')])"
1900,"('Pheniramine (maleate)', 'Pheniramine', 'Prophenpyridamine', 'Propheniramine', 'Tripoton')",Medical,"Pheniramine (trade name Avil among others) is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties used to treat allergic conditions such as hay fever or urticaria. It has relatively strong sedative effects, and may sometimes be used off-label as an over-the-counter sleeping pill in a similar manner to other sedating antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Pheniramine is also commonly found in eyedrops used for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. It was patented in 1948. Pheniramine is generally sold in combination with other medications, rather than as a stand-alone drug, although some formulations are available containing pheniramine by itself. == Side effects == Pheniramine may cause drowsiness or Tachycardia, and over-dosage may lead to sleep disorders. Overdose may lead to seizures, especially in combination with alcohol. People combining with cortisol in the long term should avoid pheniramine as it may decrease levels of adrenaline (epinephrine) which may lead to loss of consciousness. Pheniramine is a deliriant (hallucinogen) in toxic doses. Recreational use of Coricidin for the dissociative (hallucinogenic) effect of its dextromethorphan is hazardous because it also contains chlorpheniramine. == Chemical relatives == Halogenation of pheniramine increases its potency 20-fold. Halogenated derivatives of pheniramine include chlorphenamine, brompheniramine, dexchlorpheniramine, dexbrompheniramine, and zimelidine.

Approved by the FDA in 2002, it was subsequently removed from the market in 2007 due to FDA concerns about possible adverse cardiovascular effects. Before then, it was the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to help relieve the abdominal discomfort, bloating, and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Its use was also approved to treat chronic idiopathic constipation. == Mechanism of action == The drug functions as a motility stimulant, achieving its desired therapeutic effects through activation of the 5-HT4 receptors of the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract. It also stimulates gastrointestinal motility and the peristaltic reflex, and allegedly reduces abdominal pain. Additionally, tegaserod is a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist. == Withdrawal from market == On 30 March 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration requested that Novartis withdraw tegaserod from shelves.

1904,"('Conivaptan (hydrochloride)', 'Ym 087', 'Conivaptan', 'Conivaptan (inn)', 'Conivaptan [inn]')",Medical,"Conivaptan, sold under the brand name Vaprisol, is a non-peptide inhibitor of the receptor for anti-diuretic hormone, also called vasopressin. It was approved in 2004 for hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels). Additionally, Conivaptan is used for the treatment of Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Conivaptan inhibits two of the three subtypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2). Effectively, it causes iatrogenic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Conivaptan has not been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. However, in theory, vasopressin receptor antagonism would be particularly useful in this setting, and an initial study shows that it has some promise. The compound was discovered by Astellas and marked in 2006. The drug is now marketed by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. == Medical uses == Conivaptan is most commonly used in the hospital in cases of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, conditions where the sodium level in the blood falls significantly below normal. In the United States hyponatremia affects about four percent of hospitalized patients. Although many patients do not show symptoms, extreme cases may result in brain swelling, respiratory arrest and even death. Hypervolemic hyponatremia specifically is when the body’s serum sodium levels fall below the total body water increase, which results in edema. This is associated with congestive heart failure, liver disease and kidney failure. == Pharmacology == Conivaptan hydrochloride is an arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonist with affinity for human V1A and V2 receptors in the nanomolar range in vitro. AVP levels in blood are crucial for water and electrolyte regulation and balance. V2 receptors maintain plasma osmolality and are coupled to aquaporin channels in the collecting ducts of kidneys where they regulate AVP levels. Conivaptan hydrochloride functions by antagonizing V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts and thus causing aquaresis or water secretion. Typical pharmacodynamic effects of the drug are an increase in net fluid loss, increase in urine output, and decrease in the osmolality of urine. Conivaptan inhibits its own metabolism in the body, displaying non-linear pharmacokinetics. About 99% of conivaptan found is bound to human plasma proteins over the range of 10 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL. The mean half-life of the drug is 5 hours and mean clearance is 15.2 L/hr. == Adverse effects == Most adverse reactions to conivaptan are found at the site of infusion. Other complications include blood and lymphatic system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders, psychiatric disorders as well as vascular disorders. There is risk of too rapid correction of hyponatremia causing fatal osmotic demyelination syndrome. == Chemistry == Conivaptan hydrochloride is an off-white or a pale yellow power with a solubility of 0.25 mg/mL in water at 23 °C. The injectable formulation consists of 20 mg conivaptan hydrochloride, 0.4 g ethanol, 1.2 g propylene glycol and water. == Development and commercialization == Conivaptan hydrochloride was discovered by Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals and marketed by Astellas. Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals filed a new drug application to the FDA for conivaptan hydrochloride to treat hyponatremia on 2 February 2004. On 1 December, Yamanouchi received approval for investigational hyponatremia treatment using conivaptan hydrochloride. Yamanouchi pharmaceuticals and Fujisawa Pharmaceuticlas merged and were renamed as Astellas’ in 2005. Astellas gained FDA approval for Conivaptan hydrochloride on 29 December 2005, and marked the drug under the brand name of Vaprisol in 2006. On 2 March 2007, vaprisol also gained FDA approval for the treatment of hypervolemia hyponatremia. On 22 October 2008, Vaprisol further gained approval as a 5% Dextrose premixed formulation for the treatment of hyponatremia. In 2014 Cumberland pharmaceuticals bought Vaprisol from Astellas and took full responsibility of all development and marketing of the drug. Cumberland Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company based in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to Vaprisol, Cumberland produces Acetadote, Caldolor, Kristalose, Omeclamox, and Ethyol. Hepatoren, Boxban, Vasculan, and currently in phase II clinical trials. Protaban, Methotrexate, and Totect are waiting for pre-approval. == References == == External links == ""Conivaptan"".

1905,"('Rutin', 'Rutoside', 'Quercetin 3-o-rutinoside', 'Phytomelin', 'Quercetin 3-rutinoside')","Food, Medical","Rutin (rutoside, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside or sophorin) is the glycoside combining the flavonol quercetin and the disaccharide rutinose (α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranose). It is a flavonoid glycoside found in a wide variety of plants, including citrus. == Occurrences == Rutin is one of the phenolic compounds found in the plant species Carpobrotus edulis. Its name comes from the name of Ruta graveolens, a plant that also contains rutin. Various citrus fruit peels contain 32 to 49 mg/g of flavonoids expressed as rutin equivalents. Citrus leaves contain rutin at concentrations of 11 and 7 g/kg in orange and lime trees, respectively. In 2021, Samoan researchers identified rutin in the native plant matalafi (Psychotria insularum). == Metabolism == The enzyme quercitrinase found in Aspergillus flavus is in the rutin catabolic pathway. == In food == Rutin is a citrus flavonoid glycoside found in many plants, including buckwheat, the leaves and petioles of Rheum species, and asparagus. Tartary buckwheat seeds have been found to contain more rutin (about 0.8–1.7% dry weight) than common buckwheat seeds (0.01% dry weight). Rutin is one of the primary flavonols found in 'clingstone' peaches. It is also found in green tea infusions. Approximate rutin content of selected foods, in milligrams per 100 milliliters: == Research == Rutin (rutoside or rutinoside) and other dietary flavonols are under preliminary clinical research for their potential biological effects, such as in reducing post-thrombotic syndrome, venous insufficiency, or endothelial dysfunction, but there was no high-quality evidence for their safe and effective uses as of 2018. A 2020 review indicated that oral rutosides may reduce leg edema in people with post-thrombotic syndrome, but the risk of adverse effects was higher. As a flavonol among similar flavonoids, rutin has low bioavailability due to poor absorption, high metabolism, and rapid excretion that collectively make its potential for use as a therapeutic agent limited. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis pathway of rutin in mulberry (Morus alba L.) leaves begins with phenylalanine, which produces cinnamic acid under the action of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). Cinnamic acid is catalyzed by cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) to form p-coumaroyl-CoA. Subsequently, chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the condensation of p-coumaroyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to produce naringenin chalcone, which is eventually converted into naringenin flavanone with the participation of chalcone isomerase (CHI). With the action of flavanone 3-hydroxylas (F3H), dihydrokaempferol (DHK) is generated. DHK can be further hydroxylated by flavonoid 3´-hydroxylase (F3'H) to produce dihydroquercetin (DHQ), which is then catalyzed by flavonol synthase (FLS) to form quercetin. After quercetin is catalyzed by UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) to form isoquercitrin, finally, the formation of rutin from isoquercitrin is catalyzed by flavonoid 3-O-glucoside L-rhamnosyltransferase. == References == == External links == Media related to Rutin at Wikimedia Commons",Phytomelin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.313294380903244)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3361825942993164), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.597392201423645)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Rutin,https://www.givaudan.com/print/866206 ', [])"

1907,"('Myricetin', 'Cannabiscetin', 'Myricetol', 'Myricitin', 'Lopac-m-6760')","Food, Medical","Myricetin is a member of the flavonoid class of polyphenolic compounds, with antioxidant properties. Common dietary sources include vegetables (including tomatoes), fruits (including oranges), nuts, berries, tea, and red wine. Myricetin is structurally similar to fisetin, luteolin, and quercetin and is reported to have many of the same functions as these other members of the flavonol class of flavonoids. Reported average intake of myricetin per day varies depending on diet, but has been shown in the Netherlands to average 23 mg/day. Myricetin is produced from the parent compound taxifolin through the (+)-dihydromyricetin intermediate and can be further processed to form laricitrin and then syringetin, both members of the flavonol class of flavonoids. Dihydromyricetin is frequently sold as a supplement and has controversial function as a partial GABAA receptor potentiator and treatment in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Myricetin can alternatively be produced directly from kaempferol, which is another flavonol. == Sources == == Oxidative Properties == === Antioxidant === Antioxidants are molecules present in fruits and vegetables that have been demonstrated to protect against some forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Biomolecules and cell structures can experience oxidative stress due to the presence and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS like •OH, •O2−, and H2O2 are produced during cellular metabolism processes (aerobic respiration). ROS can damage lipids, DNA, and proteins. Gradual but steady accretion of such damage can lead to the development of many diseases and conditions including thrombosis, diabetes, persistent inflammation, cancer, and atherosclerosis. Flavonoids including myricetin are able to scavenge for ROS and can chelate intracellular transition metal ions that ultimately produce ROS. Myricetin also enhances the effects of other antioxidants. Myricetin can induce the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST). GST has been suggested to protect cells against oxidative stress by protecting cells against free-radicals. In vitro studies have shown that myricetin significantly increased GST activity. === Pro-oxidant === Multiple studies have demonstrated that myricetin also has the potential to act as a pro-oxidant due to its tendency to undergo autoxidation depending upon its environment . It has been seen that when in the presence of cyanide, autoxidation is favored, resulting in superoxide, a byproduct characteristic of causing cellular damage . However, sodium azide, superoxide dismutase, and catalase have been seen to inhibit the autoxidation of myricetin. Myricetin may also act as a pro-oxidant in its ability to increase the production of hydroxy radicals through reactions with Fe2+ or Fe3+−EDTA and hydrogen peroxide. The resulting hydroxy radicals are often linked to DNA degradation, however, there are doubts as to whether or not this damage would be significant when analyzed in vivo since in vitro studies with both bovine and human serum albumin exhibited extensive protection against it. Myricetin's pro-oxidative capabilities can also be seen in its ability to act as an inhibitory agent against glutathione reductase, which is responsible for regenerating glutathione, a scavenger of free radicals and peroxides. == Potential health effects == === Anticarcinogen === Myricetin is also effective in protecting cells from carcinogenic mutation. Myricetin reduces the risk of skin tumorigenicity that is caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzo(a)pyrene, a highly carcinogenic compound. Myricetin provided protection against the formation of skin tumors in mice models after tumor initiating and tumor promoter agents were applied to the skin. On a more biochemical level, it was shown that topical application of myricetin to mice inhibited the binding of benzo(a)pyrenes to DNA and protein native to epidermal skin cells. Myricetin also has been shown to inhibit the act of genetic mutation as exhibited by the Ames test. This test showed that myricetin was more effective in preventing mutagenesis initiated by certain carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,h)pyrene, and dibenzo(a,i)pyrene) as compared to others in which it was less effective in preventing against mutagenesis (benzo(a)pyrene 4, 5-oxide and the bay-region diol-epoxides of benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, and benzo(c)phenathrene). This data shows that myricetin is not unilaterally able to reduce the carcinogenic activity of all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or even the more specific subclass of benzo(a)pyrenes. Myricetin’s exact biochemical activity is still not fully understood. Clearly there is a multifaceted, complex system involved in the anticarcinogenic activity displayed by myricetin that does not apply equally to all carcinogens of the same subfamily. === Mutagen === It has also been shown that myricetin can itself act as an agent of mutagenicity. Myricetin can produce frameshift mutations in the genomes of particular strains of Salmonella typhimurium. In general, biochemical structural studies have shown that flavonoid structures can tautomerize in biological systems to become active mutagens. === Interactions with DNA === Myricetin can act as a pro-oxidant compound when it interacts with DNA. Studies involving in vitro models have shown that myricetin causes the degradation of DNA. Additionally, myricetin, in the presence of Fe3+ and Cu2+, intensified this DNA degradation. The antioxidants catalase, superoxide dismutase, mannitol, and sodium azide in combination with Cu2+ increased the DNA degradation activity of myricetin. Myricetin was shown to create reactive oxygen species that caused the DNA damage. It has been demonstrated that myricetin, depending on its concentration, displays different oxidizing effects on DNA. Polyphenols like myricetin are able to reduce (donate electrons to) Fe3+. Thus, this reaction yields a less oxidized (more reduced) form of the iron cation: Fe2+ and a less reduced (more oxidized) form of myricetin. This allows myricetin to form a complex with oxygen and biochemically target the DNA molecule. At higher and higher concentrations of myricetin, the rate of DNA damage has been shown to decrease. A current hypothesis for why this occurs can be attributed to myricetin’s ability to chelate iron (Fe) (myricetin ligand forms two or more coordinate bonds to iron). These in vitro studies cannot be correlated directly to human models and should not be extrapolated. Myricetin also impacts the biochemical efficacy and binding ability of large intracellular biomolecules. Myricetin has been shown to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase, cellular DNA polymerase, and cellular RNA polymerase. Inhibition of cellular DNA polymerases could have dangerous effects on the cell’s ability to replicate its genome and its progression through the cell cycle. Inhibition of cellular RNA polymerase could have deleterious effects on the cell’s capacity to transcribe and translate DNA and RNA to produce vital proteins for the cell. Researchers have found that myricetin has the ability to interfere in the RNA polymerase pathway in two different ways. In E. coli myricetin competitively inhibited GTP substrate binding to RNA polymerase. In T7 bacteriophages myricetin competitively inhibited DNA template binding to RNA polymerase. === Antiviral === Myricetin has been seen to demonstrate antiviral activity against a number of viruses including Moloney murine leukemia virus, Rauscher murine leukemia virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus. Its effects against the proliferation of viruses is thought to be a consequence of myricetin’s ability to inhibit the proper functioning of reverse transcriptase. Myricetin was identified as a competitive inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase of Rauscher murine leukemia virus and a partial competitor with respect to the human immunodeficiency virus. Investigations into the activity of the HIV-1 strain when introduced to myricetin suggest the antiviral effects are derived from the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, however, there are suspicions that the inhibition is non-specific. Structural analysis of myricetin and other flavonoids with observed antiviral effects indicate that the 3,4’ free hydroxyl groups likely are responsible for inhibition. === Antithrombotic === Polyphenols such as myricetin may prevent oxidative stress-induced platelet activation/aggregation. Thus, consumption of antioxidants may serve an anti-thrombotic function. In addition to offering protection by neutralizing peroxide radicals and effecting thromboxane production via the PTGS1 pathway, polyphenols such as myricetin may target other platelet activation pathways, limiting fibrinogen’s ability to bind platelet surface receptors. === Antidiabetic === Several in vitro and animal studies have indicated the antidiabetic capabilities of myricetin; however, the evidence in clinical trials is less convincing. The flavonoid has been demonstrated to have a hypoglycemic effect by increasing the ability of adipocytes, as well as cells of the soleus muscle and liver of rats, to uptake glucose. This insulinomimetic effect is hypothesized to be a consequence of myricetin's either direct or indirect interaction with GLUT4, however, no analysis has produced concrete conclusions detailing exactly from where this effect is derived. In the hepatocytes of rats suffering from diabetes, myricetin has been observed to increase the activity of glycogen synthase 1. In trials done on Xenopus laevis oocytes, myricetin is thought to regulate the transport of glucose and fructose through the function of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) in sugar absorption. In addition, daily injections of myricetin into rats has been seen to be correlated with increased sensitivity to insulin, indicating the possibility of using a myricetin as treatment or protection against insulin resistance, a frequent cause of diabetes mellitus. In the mouse myoblast cell line known as C2C12, treatment with myricetin not only increased glucose uptake, but also enhanced lipogenesis, a result not seen from any of the other bioflavonoids tested. Although myricetin has not been concluded to have more than a neutral effect on humans, it has been used as a form of traditional medicine for diabetes in Northern Brazil and is hypothesized by the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey to potentially be correlated to the lower risk of Type 2 diabetes in individuals whose diets included higher than average amounts of myricetin. However, since studies in the United States, such as the Women's Health Study, do not confirm these results, there is doubt of whether or not the difference is risk can actually be accredited to myricetin and is not the result of the inability to fully control other variables such as racial background or inconsistencies in diet between participants. There is also evidence indicating that other characteristics of myricetin, such as its effect against inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyperlipidemia, may be helpful to reduce or even prevent other clinical issues which arise from diabetes mellitus. === Antiatherosclerotic === Antioxidants, including flavonoids such as myricetin, are often touted to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, the hardening of arteries associated with high cholesterol. However, in vivo studies are lacking and in vitro studies are contradictory and do not support this claim. This claim is based on myricetin's proposed ability to increase LDL uptake by macrophages, which in theory would protect against atherosclerosis. This theoretical action of myricetin is not supported by experimental data. It is also proposed that myricetin may have the ability as a potent flavonoid antioxidant to prevent LDL oxidation, thus slowing the body's local inflammatory response and delaying the appearance of the first fatty streak and onset of atherosclerosis. Although mechanisms relating to myricetin specifically have not been proven, a diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables, and therefore rich in antioxidants, correlates with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. === Neuroprotectant === It has also been shown that myricetin is effective in protecting neurons against oxidative stressors. Researchers have shown that PC12 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidative stressor experience cell death due to apoptosis. When treated with myricetin, these oxidatively stressed cells displayed statistically significant increased cell survival. It has been suggested that myricetin not only has oxygen radical scavenging abilities, but also inherent, specific cell-survival capacities. Other molecules known for oxygen radical scavenging (vitamin E and boldine) did not successfully protect the cell models from oxidative stress and eventual cell death as effectively as myricetin and other biochemically related molecules. === Anti-inflammatory === Myricetin, along with other lipoxygenase- and cyclooxygenase-blocker flavonoids are seen to have significant anti-inflammatory characteristics, demonstrated by their ability to reduce edemas caused by carrageenan and croton oil. The anti-inflammatory nature of myricetin lies in its ability to inhibit the amplified production of cytokines that occurs during inflammation. Testing on various types of macrophage cells, including RAW264.7, as well as on human synovial sarcoma cells, demonstrated the inhibition of several kinds of cytokines, such as interleukin-12 and interleukin-1β, through down-regulation of transcription factors and mediators involved in their production. Other studies suggest that myricetin's anti-inflammatory nature could also potentially be dependent upon interfering in inflammatory signal pathways by inhibiting various kinases and, consequently, the function of tumor necrosis factor alpha. === Anti-platelet aggregation activity === Exposure to myricetin caused inhibition of rabbit platelet aggregation, induced by adenosine diphosphate, arachidonic acid, collagen and platelet activating factor (PAF). It inhibited specific receptor binding of PAF in rabbit platelets. The compound was found to be active against thrombin and neutrophil elastase. In addition, A prostacyclin-stimulated rise in the levels of platelet adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) was stimulated by myricetin. === Immunomodulatory activities === Myricetin's preclinical immunomodulatory properties are now becoming increasingly widely known. It was discovered that myricetin may prevent T-lymphocyte stimulation in a mouse model by binding to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies immobilised on beads. The inhibitory effect of myricetin on T cells, which was described in this study, was explained as being mediated via extracellular H2O2 production. Through the inhibition of NF-B binding activity, these natural compounds were reported to significantly reduce the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-12 production in mouse main macrophages as well as the RAW264.7 monocytic cell-line. Myricetin produced epithelial layer contractile reflexes in separate rat aortic rings at a concentration of 50 M. This substance induces the synthesis of cytosolic unbound calcium in cultured bovine endothelial cells. Myricetin suppressed the release of IL-2 protein from mouse EL-4 T cells that had been stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin in a daily dosage approach. == References ==",Myricitin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0008432185277342796), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.003496012417599559), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.10022567212581635), ('ĠEND', -0.10678069293498993), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018182270228862762)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26891321/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='Myricetin: A Dietary Molecule with Diverse Biological Activities', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26891321/?utm_source=openai')])"

Thus, owing to the symmetry and chirality, the three isomers of mivacurium are (E)-1R,1'R,2R,2'R, (identified as BW1217U84), (E)-1R,1'R,2R,2'S, (BW1333U83) and (E)-1R,1'R,1'S,2'S, (BW1309U83). These are also known as cis-cis, cis-trans and trans-trans mivacurium. The proportions are; (E)-cis-cis 6% of the mixture, (E)-cis-trans 36% of the mixture and (E)-trans-trans 56% of the mixture. Unlike the potency of the cis-cis isomer of atracurium (also known as 51W89 and eventually produced as the drug cisatracurium), the cis-cis isomer of mivacurium has by far the lowest potency as a muscle relaxant when compared with its other two stereoisomers. It has approximately 10% of the activity of each of the other two structures. Mivacurium belongs to a class of compounds that is commonly and erroneously referred to as ""benzylisoquinolines;"" mivacurium is in fact a bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinolinium agent, often abbreviated to bbTHIQ. The orientation of the two O atoms in the bridge is to the THIQ side of the carbonyl C=O group, whereas in atracurium the O atom is on the bridge side. Atracurium's groups are ""reversed ester"" linkages. This makes ester hydrolysis degradation by plasma cholinesterase more favourable. == Pharmacology == Having ten methoxy -OCH3 groups, mivacurium is a more potent neuromuscular blocking drug than atracurium (which has eight), but is less potent than doxacurium (which has twelve). Like other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the pharmacological action of mivacurium is antagonism to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, unlike other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, it is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase (similar to the depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine). == Availability == Mivacurium is available worldwide. It became unavailable in the United States in 2006 due to manufacturing issues, but was reintroduced in 2016. == History == Mivacurium represents the second generation of tetrahydroisoquinolinium neuromuscular blocking drugs in a long lineage of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists synthesized by Mary M. Jackson and James C. Wisowaty, PhD (both chemists within the Chemical Development Laboratories at Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC) in collaboration with John J. Savarese MD (who at the time was an anesthesiologist in the Dept. of Anesthesia, Harvard Medical School at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Specifically, mivacurium was first synthesized in 1981. Early structure-activity studies had confirmed that the bulky nature of the ""benzylisoquinolinium"" entity provided a non-depolarizing mechanism of action. Partial saturation of the benzylisoquinoline ring to the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring provided an even further increase in potency of the molecules without detrimental effects to other pharmacological properties: this key finding led to the rapid adoption of the tetrahydroisoquinolinium structures as a standard building block (along with a 1-benzyl attachment), and it is the primary reason why the continued unwarranted reference to ""benzylisoquinolinium"" is a complete misnomer for all clinically introduced and currently used neuromuscular blocking agents in this class because they are all, in fact, tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. By definition, therefore, there has never been, in the history of clinical anesthetic practice, the use of a benzylisoquinoline neuromuscular blocking agent. The heritage of mivacurium and indeed its very closely related cousin, doxacurium chloride, harks back to the synthesis of numerous compounds following structure-activity relationships that drove researchers to find the ideal replacement for succinylcholine (suxamethonium). Both mivacurium and doxacurium are descendants of early vigorous attempts to synthesize potent non-depolarizing agents with pharmacophores derived from cross-combinations of the non-depolarizing agent, laudexium, and the well-known depolarizing agent, succinylcholine (suxamethonium chloride). Ironically, laudexium itself was invented by a cross-combination between the prototypical non-depolarizing agent, d-tubocurarine and the depolarizing agent, decamethonium. From the 1950s through to the 1970s, the present-day concept of a neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid onset and an ultra-short duration of action had not taken root: researchers and clinicians were still on the quest for potent but non-depolarizing replacements devoid of the histamine release and the dreaded ""recurarizing"" effects seen with tubocurarine and, more importantly, the absence of a depolarizing mechanism of action as seen with succinylcholine and decamethonium. == Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics == The first clinical trial of mivacurium (BW1090U), in 1984, was conducted in a cohort of 63 US patients undergoing surgical anesthesia. at the Harvard Medical School at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Preliminary data from the study confirmed a promise for this agent to elicit considerably lesser severity of histamine release than that observed with its immediate predecessor clinically tested agents, BW785U77 and BWA444U, which were discontinued from further clinical development. Mivacurium did not exhibit the ultra-short duration of action seen with BW785U; whereas, BW A444U produced an intermediate duration of action. Mivacurium is a biodegradable neuromuscular blocking agent owing to its degradation by plasma cholinesterases - the esterases rapidly hydrolyze one ester moiety initially resulting in a two mono-quaternary metabolites of which one still has an intact ester moiety. The second ester is metabolized much more slowly, although the lack of a bis-quaternary structure effectively terminates the neuromuscular blocking action. == References ==",Mivacurium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.173549288883805e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044371772673912346)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mivacurium_chloride?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Mivacurium chloride', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mivacurium_chloride?utm_source=openai')])"

1913,"('Norethindrone acetate', 'Norethisterone acetate', 'Norlutin acetate', 'Orlutate', 'Aygestin')",Medical,"Norethisterone acetate (NETA), also known as norethindrone acetate and sold under the brand name Primolut-Nor among others, is a progestin medication which is used in birth control pills, menopausal hormone therapy, and for the treatment of gynecological disorders. The medication available in low-dose and high-dose formulations and is used alone or in combination with an estrogen. It is ingested orally. Side effects of NETA include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and others. NETA is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. NETA was patented in 1957 and was introduced for medical use in 1964. It is sometimes referred to as a ""first-generation"" progestin. NETA is marketed widely throughout the world. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == NETA is used as a hormonal contraceptive in combination with estrogen, in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as abnormal uterine bleeding, and as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. === Available forms === NETA is available in the form of tablets for use by mouth both alone and in combination with estrogens including estradiol, estradiol valerate, and ethinylestradiol. Transdermal patches providing a combination of 50 μg/day estradiol and 0.14 or 0.25 mg/day NETA are available under the brand names CombiPatch and Estalis. NETA was previously available for use by intramuscular injection in the form of ampoules containing 20 mg NETA, 5 mg estradiol benzoate, 8 mg estradiol valerate, and 180 mg testosterone enanthate in oil solution under the brand name Ablacton to suppress lactation in postpartum women. == Contraindications == == Side effects == Side effects of NETA include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, mood changes, acne, increased hair growth, and others. == Overdose == == Interactions == == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === NETA is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. Upon oral ingestion, it is rapidly converted into norethisterone by esterases during intestinal and first-pass hepatic metabolism. Hence, as a prodrug of norethisterone, NETA has essentially the same effects, acting as a potent progestogen with additional weak androgenic and estrogenic activity (the latter via its metabolite ethinylestradiol). ==== Progestogenic effects ==== In terms of dosage equivalence, norethisterone and NETA are typically used at respective dosages of 0.35 mg/day and 0.6 mg/day as progestogen-only contraceptives, and at respective dosages of 0.5–1 mg/day and 1–1.5 mg/day in combination with ethinylestradiol in combined oral contraceptives. Conversely, the two drugs have been used at about the same dosages in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. NETA is of about 12% higher molecular weight than norethisterone due to the presence of its C17β acetate ester. Micronization of NETA has been found to increase its potency by several-fold in animals and women. The endometrial transformation dosage of micronized NETA per cycle is 12 to 14 mg, whereas that for non-micronized NETA is 30 to 60 mg. ==== Estrogenic effects ==== NETA metabolizes into ethinylestradiol at a rate of 0.20 to 0.33% across a dose range of 10 to 40 mg. Peak levels of ethinylestradiol with a 10, 20, or 40 mg dose of NETA were 58, 178, and 231 pg/mL, respectively. For comparison, a 30 to 40 μg dose of oral ethinylestradiol typically results in a peak ethinylestradiol level of 100 to 135 pg/mL. As such, in terms of ethinylestradiol exposure, 10 to 20 mg NETA may be equivalent to 20 to 30 μg ethinylestradiol and 40 mg NETA may be similar to 50 μg ethinylestradiol. In another study however, 5 mg NETA produced an equivalent of 28 μg ethinylestradiol (0.7% conversion rate) and 10 mg NETA produced an equivalent of 62 μg ethinylestradiol (1.0% conversion rate). Due to its estrogenic activity via ethinylestradiol, high doses of NETA have been proposed for add-back in the treatment of endometriosis without estrogen supplementation. Generation of ethinylestradiol with high doses of NETA may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism but may also decrease menstrual bleeding relative to progestogen exposure alone. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== NETA has antigonadotropic effects via its progestogenic activity and can dose-dependently suppress gonadotropin and sex hormone levels in women and men. The ovulation-inhibiting dose of NETA is about 0.5 mg/day in women. In healthy young men, NETA alone at a dose of 5 to 10 mg/day orally for 2 weeks suppressed testosterone levels from ~527 ng/dL to ~231 ng/dL (–56%). == Chemistry == NETA, also known as norethinyltestosterone acetate, as well as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-acetate or 17α-ethynylestra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one 17β-acetate, is a progestin, or synthetic progestogen, of the 19-nortestosterone group, and a synthetic estrane steroid. It is the C17β acetate ester of norethisterone. NETA is a derivative of testosterone with an ethynyl group at the C17α position, the methyl group at the C19 position removed, and an acetate ester attached at the C17β position. In addition to testosterone, it is a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone). === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of NETA have been published. == History == Schering AG filed for a patent for NETA in June 1957, and the patent was issued in December 1960. The drug was first marketed, by Parke-Davis as Norlestrin in the United States, in March 1964. This was a combination formulation of 2.5 mg NETA and 50 μg ethinylestradiol and was indicated as an oral contraceptive. Other early brand names of NETA used in oral contraceptives included Minovlar and Anovlar. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Norethisterone acetate is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of NETA while norethindrone acetate is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia. === Brand names === NETA is marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world including Primolut-Nor (major), Aygestin (USTooltip United States), Gestakadin, Milligynon, Monogest, Norlutate (USTooltip United States, CATooltip Canada), Primolut N, SH-420 (UKTooltip United Kingdom), Sovel, and Styptin among others. === Availability === ==== United States ==== NETA is marketed in high-dose 5 mg oral tablets in the United States under the brand names Aygestin and Norlutate for the treatment of gynecological disorders. In addition, it is available under a large number of brand names at much lower dosages (0.1 to 1 mg) in combination with estrogens such as ethinylestradiol and estradiol as a combined oral contraceptive and for use in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. == Research == NETA has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with testosterone in men. == See also == Ethinylestradiol/norethisterone acetate Norethisterone enanthate == References ==",Aygestin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4662635294371285e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009230881696566939)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/aygestin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=9, title='Aygestin: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/aygestin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

This study compared the efficacy and safety of risankizumab and apremilast in adults with moderate plaque psoriasis eligible for systemic therapy. It also evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to risankizumab vs. continuing apremilast in patients who did not achieve ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75 nonresponders) after 16 weeks of treatment with apremilast. This 52-week, phase IV, multicentre, randomized, open-label, efficacy assessor-blinded study (NCT04908475) enrolled patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of moderate chronic plaque psoriasis (≥ 6 months) and who were candidates for systemic therapy. The enrolled patients (randomized 1 : 2) received subcutaneous risankizumab (150 mg at weeks 0 and 4) or oral apremilast (30 mg twice daily). At week 16, all patients treated with apremilast were re-randomized (1 : 1) to risankizumab or apremilast, stratified by week-16 PASI 75 response. The co-primary outcomes in period A at week 16 were the achievement of ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) and static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) 0/1 with a two-grade or better improvement from baseline. At week 52, the primary endpoint in period B was the achievement of PASI 90 in PASI 75 nonresponders with apremilast at week 16. Safety was monitored throughout the study. All patients who received one dose of treatment were included in the efficacy and safety analysis. At baseline, 118 and 234 patients were assigned to receive risankizumab and apremilast, respectively. At week 16, PASI 90 was achieved by 55.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 47.0-64.9] and 5.1% (95% CI 2.3-8.0), and sPGA 0/1 by 75.4% (95% CI 67.7-83.2) and 18.4% (95% CI 13.4-23.3), respectively. In period B, among PASI 75 nonresponders with apremilast at week 16, 83 switched to risankizumab and 78 continued apremilast. At week 52, 72.3% (95% CI 62.7-81.9) who switched to risankizumab achieved PASI 90 vs. 2.6% (95% CI 0.0-6.1) who continued apremilast. The most frequent adverse events (reported in ≥ 5%) in risankizumab-treated patients were COVID-19 infection and nasopharyngitis. Diarrhoea, nausea and headache were most frequent among apremilast-treated patients. For patients with moderate psoriasis, treatment with risankizumab demonstrated superior efficacy to those treated with apremilast, including those who did not benefit from prior treatment with apremilast. The safety profile of risankizumab was similar to prior studies, and no new safety signals were identified. These results show that, compared with apremilast, risankizumab treatment can significantly improve clinical outcomes in systemic-eligible patients with moderate psoriasis. Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced impairment of astrocytes may lead to neuronal dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS). Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor primarily used for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that has demonstrated certain neuroprotective properties. PDE4 is an isoenzyme that degrades 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which serves as a neuroprotective agent by promoting neuronal recovery through protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and subsequent expression of the neurotrophic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma (Bcl-2). However, the effects of apremilast in astrocytes have not been elucidated. In the present study, we employed an in vitro model of ischemic stroke using oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)-challenged astrocytes to investigate the effects of apremilast against apoptosis (the flow cytometry assay), cell death (the lactate dehydrogenase release assay), oxidative stress (2', 7' dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining), and the expression of the key neuroprotective factors CREB and BDNF (Western blot analysis). Our findings show that treatment with apremilast could significantly reduce astrocyte apoptosis and cell death induced by OGD/R as evidenced by reduced release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and improvement of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The results of MTT assay, measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and flow cytometry confirmed the improvement in cell viability mediated by apremilast. Importantly, we found that CREB phosphorylation was required for the increases in BDNF and Bcl-2 induced by apremilast as well as the decrease in astrocyte apoptosis. These preliminary findings indicate that apremilast may have the potential to prevent astrocyte cell death and promote neuronal healing in cerebral ischemic injury. Further in vivo research will expand our understanding of these promising results. To assess apremilast's impact on patient quality of life (QoL) in active Behçet's syndrome and correlations between improvement in patients' QoL and efficacy measures in the phase 3 RELIEF study. QoL measures included Behçet's Disease QoL (BDQoL), 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey V.2 (SF-36v2) Physical/Mental Component Summary (PCS/MCS) and eight subscale scores, focusing on Physical Functioning (PF). Pearson's correlation coefficients assessed relationships between efficacy endpoints (oral ulcer count, oral ulcer pain, Behçet's Syndrome Activity Scale (BSAS), Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF)) and QoL endpoints for apremilast at Week 12. Apremilast (n=104) demonstrated significantly greater improvements versus placebo (n=103) in SF-36v2 PCS (3.1 vs 0.9), MCS (4.6 vs ─0.7) and PF (2.9 vs 0.14), respectively (all p<0.05). Mild correlations were observed in improvements of SF-36v2 measures (PCS, MCS, PF) with oral ulcer count (r=-0.11, PCS), and change in oral ulcer pain from baseline (r=-0.28, PCS; r=-0.10, PF) and BSAS (r=-0.38, PCS; r=-0.20, PF; r=-0.16, MCS). Correlations among BDCAF and SF-36v2 components and BDQoL were variable. BDQoL showed mild/moderate correlations with SF-36v2 components (r=-0.18, PCS; r=-0.13, PF; r=-0.45, MCS). Apremilast was associated with significant improvements in QoL measures of SF-36v2 PCS, MCS and PF and BDQoL in patients with Behçet's syndrome. Correlations of improvement among QoL endpoints support the beneficial clinical effects of apremilast in Behçet's syndrome.

Severe gastrointestinal symptoms, when they occur, typically start within the first few weeks of treatment. === Psychological === Worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, and other mood changes may occur with apremilast. === Weight loss === Weight loss has been associated with apremilast. Reports from clinical studies indicated a 5 to 10% decrease in body weight in 10% of patients taking apremilast (compared to 3.3% of patients taking placebo). === Other === Common, usually mild to moderate adverse effects associated with apremilast include headache, back pain, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections. == Interactions == Concurrent use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers has been shown to decrease exposure of apremilast and can result in reduced or loss of efficacy of apremilast. Using it simultaneously with strong P450 enzyme inducers, including rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort is not recommended. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Apremilast is a small-molecule inhibitor of PDE4, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). In inflammatory cells, PDE4 is the dominant enzyme responsible for this reaction. The resulting increase in cAMP levels down-regulates expression of a number of pro-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin 17, interleukin 23, and many others, and up-regulates the anti-inflammatory interleukin 10. In ex vivo models of arthritis, IL-12/IL-23p40 was specifically identified as a downstream target of apremilast. The importance of these individual factors for the clinical effect of apremilast is not clear. === Pharmacokinetics === Apremilast is absorbed well from the gut (73%), independently of food intake, and reaches peak blood plasma concentrations after 2.5 hours. Plasma protein binding is 68%. It is metabolised in the liver, mainly via the enzyme CYP3A4, but to a minor extent via CYP1A2 and CYP2A6. The main metabolite is O-desmethylapremilast glucuronide. Its half-life is 6–9 hours. The substance is eliminated through the kidney (58%) and feces (39%), mainly in form of its metabolites. Only 3% of the original substance is found in the urine, and 7% in the feces. == Chemistry == Apremilast is a phthalimide derivative. It is a white to pale yellow, nonhygroscopic powder that is practically insoluble in water and buffer solutions in a wide pH range, but is soluble in lipophilic solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, butanone, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran. In vitro, apremilast reduces PDE4 activity, leading to an increase in cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations in immune and nonimmune cell types, partially inhibiting the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IFN-γ IL-2, IL-12, and IL-23 and elevating the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The inhibition potency of apremilast in TNF-α production is similar to lenalidomide. Celgene reported seven kinds of crystal forms — A, B, C, D, E, F, and G — and thought the crystal form B was the most thermodynamically stable anhydrous form. However, Utopharm reported another more thermodynamically stable anhydrous crystal form II than the crystal form B. == History == Apremilast was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014, for treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and approved in 2019, for oral ulcers associated with Behçet's disease. Apremilast is taken by mouth. == Society and culture == === Economics === Apremilast is available in the US, but is dispensed only through a network of specialty pharmacies. The estimated wholesale price is US$22,500 for a year of treatment. In Austria, a year of treatment costs health insurances about €11,000 as of 2018. Celgene made Otezla available in the UK in 2015. In 2019, Amgen acquired Otezla from Celgene for $13.4 billion. In 2020, Otezla generated $2.2 billion for Amgen. Apremilast was listed on the PBS in Australia in January 2021, for chronic plaque psoriasis. As of October 2024, the cost to the Australian government for a year of treatment is about $8500, and the cost to consumer is about $400. === Legal status === Apremilast was approved for use in the European Union in January 2015. Generic versions of the medication are available in Canada. In April 2023, an American court case confirmed Amgen's patents on Otezla until 2028, delaying the introduction of generics until at least that date. In February 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Apremilast Accord, intended for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and Behcet's disease. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Apremilast Accord was approved for medical use in the European Union in April 2024. == Research == Apremilast has been studied as a treatment for alcohol-use disorder. == References ==",Apremilast,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6569954823353328e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016723664884921163)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; , ,  ', [])"
1916,"('Phytic acid (dodecasodium salt hydrate)', 'Phytic acid', 'Fytic acid', 'Phytate', 'Inositol hexaphosphate')","Food, Medical","Phytic acid is a six-fold dihydrogenphosphate ester of inositol (specifically, of the myo isomer), also called inositol hexaphosphate, inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) or inositol polyphosphate. At physiological pH, the phosphates are partially ionized, resulting in the phytate anion. The (myo) phytate anion is a colorless species that has significant nutritional role as the principal storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues, especially bran and seeds. It is also present in many legumes, cereals, and grains. Phytic acid and phytate have a strong binding affinity to the dietary minerals calcium, iron, and zinc, inhibiting their absorption in the small intestine. The lower inositol polyphosphates are inositol esters with less than six phosphates, such as inositol penta- (IP5), tetra- (IP4), and triphosphate (IP3). These occur in nature as catabolites of phytic acid. == Significance in agriculture == Phytic acid was discovered in 1903. Generally, phosphorus and inositol in phytate form are not bioavailable to non-ruminant animals because these animals lack the enzyme phytase required to hydrolyze the inositol-phosphate linkages. Ruminants are able to digest phytate because of the phytase produced by rumen microorganisms. In most commercial agriculture, non-ruminant livestock, such as swine, fowl, and fish, are fed mainly grains, such as maize, legumes, and soybeans. Because phytate from these grains and beans is unavailable for absorption, the unabsorbed phytate passes through the gastrointestinal tract, elevating the amount of phosphorus in the manure. Excess phosphorus excretion can lead to environmental problems, such as eutrophication. The use of sprouted grains may reduce the quantity of phytic acids in feed, with no significant reduction of nutritional value. Also, viable low-phytic acid mutant lines have been developed in several crop species in which the seeds have drastically reduced levels of phytic acid and concomitant increases in inorganic phosphorus. However, germination problems have reportedly hindered the use of these cultivars thus far. This may be due to phytic acid's critical role in both phosphorus and metal ion storage. Phytate variants also have the potential to be used in soil remediation, to immobilize uranium, nickel, and other inorganic contaminants. == Biological effects == === Plants === Although indigestible for many animals as they occur in seeds and grains, phytic acid and its metabolites have several important roles for the seedling plant. Most notably, phytic acid functions as a phosphorus store, as an energy store, as a source of cations and as a source of myo-inositol (a cell wall precursor). Phytic acid is the principal storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. === Animals === In animal cells, myo-inositol polyphosphates are ubiquitous, and phytic acid (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is the most abundant, with its concentration ranging from 10 to 100 μM in mammalian cells, depending on cell type and developmental stage. Being not directly absorbed in the gut, phytic acid is not obtained from the animal diet, but must be synthesized inside the cell from phosphate and inositol (which in turn is produced from glucose, usually in the kidneys). ==== In vitro ==== The interaction of intracellular phytic acid with specific intracellular proteins has been investigated in vitro, and these interactions have been found to result in the inhibition or potentiation of the activities of those proteins. Inositol hexaphosphate facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice. These studies identify IP6 as a naturally occurring small molecule that promotes both assembly and maturation of HIV-1. == Dentistry == IP6 has potential use in endodontics, adhesive, preventive, and regenerative dentistry, and in improving the characteristics and performance of dental materials. == Food science == Phytic acid, mostly as phytate in the form of phytin (i.e. the calcium/magnesium salts of phytate), is found within the hulls and kernels of seeds, including nuts, grains, and pulses. In-home food preparation techniques may break down the phytic acid in all of these foods. Simply cooking the food will reduce the phytic acid to some degree. More effective methods are soaking in an acid medium, sprouting, and lactic acid fermentation such as in sourdough and pickling. No detectable phytate (less than 0.02% of wet weight) was observed in vegetables such as scallion and cabbage leaves or in fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, or pears. As a food additive, phytic acid is used as the preservative E391. It is allowed as a food additive in the US (GRAS), the EU, Japan, and China. It offers some antioxidant activity by binding away iron, and is especially effective in meat. It also inhibits polyphenol oxidase, the enzyme responsible for apple browning. Basic research also suggests that it may deter the growth of pathogenic bacteria and spoilage mold. === Dietary mineral absorption === Phytic acid has a strong affinity to the dietary trace elements, calcium, iron, and zinc, inhibiting their absorption from the small intestine. Phytochemicals such as polyphenols and tannins also influence the binding. When iron and zinc bind to phytic acid, they form insoluble precipitates and are far less absorbable in the intestines. Likewise, absorption of calcium is impaired with the result that diets high in phytates but low in calcium can result in rickets. Because phytic acid also can affect the absorption of iron, ""dephytinization should be considered as a major strategy to improve iron nutrition during the weaning period"". Dephytinization by exogenous phytase to phytate-containing food is an approach being investigated to improve nutritional health in populations that are vulnerable to mineral deficiency due to their reliance on phytate-laden food staples. Crop breeding to increase mineral density (biofortification) or reducing phytate content are under preliminary research. == Fire retarding agent == Recently, phytic acid, in combination with other chemicals like silicates or other, has been increasingly used to enhance the fire retardancy of various composite materials. == See also == Antinutrient Essential nutrient Oxalic acid == References ==",Inositol hexaphosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.01845906488597393), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0009118211455643177), (' INDUSTR', -0.03177287057042122), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0052004302851855755), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.018172437325119972), ('ĠINDU', -0.07448995858430862), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -9.703165414975956e-05), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12700815498828888)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11366552/,https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/inositol-hexaphosphate ', [])"
1917,"('Mestranol', 'Norquen', 'Menophase', 'Devocin', 'Ovastol')",Medical,"Mestranol, sold under the brand names Enovid, Norinyl, and Ortho-Novum among others, is an estrogen medication which has been used in birth control pills, menopausal hormone therapy, and the treatment of menstrual disorders. It is formulated in combination with a progestin and is not available alone. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of mestranol include nausea, breast tension, edema, and breakthrough bleeding among others. It is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. Mestranol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol in the body. Mestranol was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was the estrogen component in the first birth control pill. In 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most birth control pills, although mestranol continues to be used in a few birth control pills even today. Mestranol remains available only in a few countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile. == Medical uses == Mestranol was employed as the estrogen component in many of the first oral contraceptives, such as mestranol/noretynodrel (brand name Enovid) and mestranol/norethisterone (brand names Ortho-Novum, Norinyl), and is still in use today. In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive, mestranol has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. == Side effects == == Pharmacology == Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver (via O-Dealkylation) with a conversion efficiency of 70% (50 μg of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35 μg of ethinylestradiol). It has been found to possess 0.1 to 2.3% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol (100%) for the estrogen receptor, compared to 75 to 190% for ethinylestradiol. The elimination half-life of mestranol has been reported to be 50 minutes. The elimination half-life of the active form of mestranol, ethinylestradiol, is 7 to 36 hours. The effective ovulation-inhibiting dosage of mestranol has been studied in women. It has been reported to be about 98% effective at inhibiting ovulation at a dosage of 75 or 80 μg/day. In another study, the ovulation rate was 15.4% at 50 μg/day, 5.7% at 80 μg/day, and 1.1% at 100 μg/day. == Chemistry == Mestranol, also known as ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether (EEME) or as 17α-ethynyl-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17β-ol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol (17α-ethynylestradiol) with a methyl ether at the C3 position. == History == In April 1956, noretynodrel was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in the first large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate in the country and concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts (1–2%) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol (noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, mestranol, that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 μg mestranol per pill. Around 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The rationale was that ethinylestradiol was approximately twice as potent by weight as mestranol and hence that the dose could be halved, which it was thought might result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism. Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Mestranol is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while mestranolo is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. === Brand names === Mestranol has been marketed under a variety of brand names, mostly or exclusively in combination with progestins, including Devocin, Enavid, Enovid, Femigen, Mestranol, Norbiogest, Ortho-Novin, Ortho-Novum, Ovastol, and Tranel among others. Today, it continues to be sold in combination with progestins under brand names including Lutedion, Necon, Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, and Sophia. === Availability === Mestranol remains available only in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile. It is only marketed in combination with progestins, such as norethisterone. == Research == Mestranol has been studied as a male contraceptive and was found to be highly effective. At a dosage of 0.45 mg/day, it suppressed gonadotropin levels, reduced sperm count to zero within 4 to 6 weeks, and decreased libido, erectile function, and testicular size. Gynecomastia occurred in all of the men. These findings contributed to the conclusion that estrogens would be unacceptable as contraceptives for men. == Environmental presence == In 2021, mestranol was one of the 12 compounds identified in sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California that were collectively associated with estrogenic activity in in vitro. == References ==",Ovastol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001706367009319365), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3192249536514282), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2026333063840866)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO; ([catalog.md](https://www.catalog.md/drugs/ovastol.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=6, title='Ovastol.

1918,"('Metaxalone', 'Skelaxin', 'Zorane', 'Methaxalonum', 'Metaxalon')",Medical,"Metaxalone, sold under the brand name Skelaxin, is a muscle relaxant medication used to relax muscles and relieve pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but it may be due to general central nervous system depression. It is a moderately strong muscle relaxant, with relatively low incidence of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and central nervous system (CNS) side effects, such as dizziness, headache, and irritability. The metabolism of metaxalone involves enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the cytochrome P450 system. Because many medications are metabolized by enzymes in this system, precaution must be taken when administering it with other medications involving the P450 system to avoid interactions. Because of the potential for side effects, this drug is considered high risk in the elderly. == Pharmacokinetics == Metaxalone exhibits increased bioavailability when taken with food. Specifically, in one study, compared to fasted conditions, the presence of food at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 77.5%, AUC0-t by 23.5%, and AUC0-∞ by 15.4%. Metaxalone is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A, and an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. == Assay == A literature survey reveals very few methods are reported for the determination of metaxalone to date.

1919,"('Mecamylamine (hydrochloride)', 'Mecamylamine', 'Versamine', 'Mecamine', 'Revertina')",Medical,"Mecamylamine (INN, BAN; or mecamylamine hydrochloride (USAN); brand names Inversine, Vecamyl) is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that was introduced in the 1950s as an antihypertensive drug. In the United States, it was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2009 but was brought to market in 2013 as Vecamyl and eventually was marketed by Turing Pharmaceuticals. Chemically, mecamylamine is a secondary aliphatic amine, with a pKaH of 11.2 == Medical uses == Mecamylamine has been used as an orally-active ganglionic blocker in treating autonomic dysreflexia and hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, it is more often used now as a research tool. Mecamylamine is also sometimes used as an antiaddictive drug to help people stop smoking tobacco, and is now more widely used for this application than it is for lowering blood pressure. This effect is thought to be due to its blocking α3β4 nicotinic receptors in the brain. It has also been reported to bring about sustained relief from tics in Tourette syndrome when a series of more usually used agents had failed. In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial in Indian patients with major depression, (S)-mecamylamine (TC-5214) appeared to have efficacy as an augmentation therapy. This is the first substantive evidence that shows that compounds where the primary pharmacology is antagonism to neuronal nicotinic receptors will have antidepressant properties. TC-5214 is currently in Phase III of clinical development as an add-on treatment and on stage II as a monotherapy treatment for major depression. The first results reported from the Phase III trials showed that TC-5214 failed to meet the primary goal and the trial did not replicate the effects that had been encouraging in the Phase II trial. Development is funded by Targacept and AstraZeneca. It did not produce meaningful, beneficial results on patients as measured by changes on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale after eight weeks of treatment as compared with placebo. == Overdose == The LD50 for the HCl salt in mice: 21 mg/kg (i.v.); 37 mg/kg (i.p.); 96 mg/kg (p.o.). == Pharmacology == (S)-(+)-Mecamylamine dissociates more slowly from α4β2 and α3β4 receptors than does the (R)-(−)-enantiomer. A large SAR study of mecamylamine and its analogs was reported by a group from Merck in 1962. Another, more recent SAR study was undertaken by Suchocki et al. A comprehensive review of the pharmacology of mecamylamine was published in 2001. == History == Mecamylamine was brought to market by Merck & Co. in the 1950s; in 1996 Merck sold the asset to Layton Bioscience. In 2002, Targacept acquired it from Layton, intending to repurpose it for CNS conditions. Targacept voluntarily withdrew mecamylamine from the market in 2009 for reasons not related to safety or efficacy. Manchester Pharmaceuticals brought the drug back to market in 2013. Retrophin acquired Manchester in 2014 and after Martin Shkreli was forced out of Retrophin, in 2014 his new company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired the rights to mecamylamine from Retrophin. == See also == Bupropion Scopolamine == References ==",Mecamylamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.45700973412022e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005615564878098667)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/mecamylamine.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Mecamylamine Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/mecamylamine.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1920,"('Cromolyn (sodium)', 'Disodium cromoglycate', 'Cromolyn', 'Cromoglicic acid', 'Cromoglycic acid')",Medical,"Cromoglicic acid (INN)—also referred to as cromolyn (USAN), cromoglycate (former BAN), or cromoglicate—is traditionally described as a mast cell stabilizer, and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt sodium cromoglicate or cromolyn sodium. This drug prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells. It is considered a breakthrough drug in management of asthma, as the patients can be freed from steroids in many cases; however, it is mainly effective as a prophylaxis for allergic and exercise-induced asthma, not as a treatment for acute asthma attacks. Cromoglicic acid has been the non-corticosteroid treatment of choice in the treatment of asthma, for which it has largely been replaced by leukotriene receptor antagonists because of their safety and convenience. Cromoglicic acid requires administration four times daily, and does not provide additive benefit in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. == History == Cromolyn was discovered in 1965 by Roger Altounyan, a pharmacologist who had asthma. Altounyan was investigating certain plants and herbs which have bronchodilating properties. One such plant was khella (Ammi visnaga) which had been used as a muscle relaxant since ancient times in Egypt. Altounyan deliberately inhaled derivatives of the active ingredient khellin to determine if they could block his asthma attacks. After several years of trial, he isolated an effective and safe asthma-preventing compound called cromolyn sodium. == Preparations == Cromoglicic acid is available in multiple forms: as a nasal spray (Rynacrom (UK), Lomusol (France), Nasalcrom (the only over-the-counter form, US), Prevalin (non-direct version, NL)) to treat allergic rhinitis. in a nebulizer solution for aerosol administration to treat asthma. as an inhaler (Intal, Fisons Pharmaceuticals, UK) for preventive management of asthma. The maker of Intal, King Pharmaceuticals, has discontinued manufacturing the inhaled form, cromolyn sodium inhalation aerosol, due to issues involving CFC-free propellant. As stocks are depleted, this inhaler preparation will no longer be available to patients. In the EU it is manufactured without CFCs by Sanofi, although it must be imported from Canada or Mexico for USA residents. as eye drops (Opticrom and Optrex Allergy (UK), Crolom, Cromolyn (Canada)) for allergic conjunctivitis in an oral form (Gastrocrom, Nalcrom) to treat mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndrome, dermatographic urticaria and ulcerative colitis. Another oral product, Intercron (sodium cromoglicate in distilled water, from Zambon France), is used for food allergies. == Mechanism of action == ""Cromolyn works because it prevents the release of mediators that would normally attract inflammatory cells and because it stabilizes the inflammatory cells. MCT mast cells found in the mucosa are stabilised."" Nedocromil is another mast cell stabilizer that also works in controlling asthma. The underlying mechanism of action is not fully understood; for while cromoglicate stabilizes mast cells, this mechanism is probably not why it works in asthma. Pharmaceutical companies have produced 20 related compounds that are equally or more potent at stabilising mast cells and none of them have shown any anti-asthmatic effect. It is more likely that these work by inhibiting the response of sensory C fibers to the irritant capsaicin, inhibiting local axon reflexes involved in asthma, and may inhibit the release of preformed T cell cytokines and mediators involved in asthma. It is known to somewhat inhibit chloride channels (37% ± 7%) and thus may inhibit the: exaggerated neuronal reflexes triggered by stimulation of irritant receptors on sensory nerve endings (e.g. exercise-induced asthma) release of preformed cytokines from several type of inflammatory cells (T cells, eosinophils) in allergen-induced asthma Note: Another chemical (NPPB: 5-nitro-2(3-phenyl) propylamino-benzoic acid) was shown, in the same study, to be a more effective chloride channel blocker.

1921,"('Primaquine (diphosphate)', 'Primaquine (phosphate)', 'Primaquine (bisphosphate)', 'Primachin', 'Neo-quipenyl')",Medical,"Primaquine is a medication used to treat and prevent malaria and to treat Pneumocystis pneumonia. Specifically it is used for malaria due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale along with other medications and for prevention if other options cannot be used. It is an alternative treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia together with clindamycin. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. Primaquine should not be given to people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to the risk of red blood cell breakdown. It is often recommended that primaquine not be used during pregnancy. It may be used while breastfeeding if the baby is known not to have G6PD deficiency. The mechanisms of action is not entirely clear but is believed to involve effects on the malaria parasites' DNA. Primaquine was first made in 1946. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Malaria === Primaquine is primarily used to prevent relapse of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. It eliminates hypnozoites, the dormant liver form of the parasite, after the organisms have been cleared from the bloodstream. If primaquine is not administered to patients with proven P. vivax or P. ovale infection, a very high likelihood of relapse exists for weeks or months (sometimes years). But it has been hypothesized that primaquine (and perhaps also the newer, related drug tafenoquine) might kill a proportion of non-circulating merozoites as well as hypnozoites, such as merozoites in bone marrow, thereby reducing the number of recrudescences (not only hypnozoite-mediated relapses) that take place. Clarity in this regard is expected to be forthcoming soon. Use of primaquine in combination with quinine or chloroquine each of which is very effective at clearing P. vivax from blood, improves outcomes; they appear to also potentiate the action of primaquine. As of 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of primaquine for primary prophylaxis prior to travel to areas with a high incidence of P. vivax, and for terminal prophylaxis (anti-relapse therapy) after travel. A single dose of primaquine has rapid and potent ability to kill gametocytes (stage V) of P. falciparum and P. vivax in blood; it also kills asexual trophozoites of P. vivax in blood, but not of P. falciparum. Because of its action against gametocytes, the WHO recommends it for use in reducing transmission to control P. falciparum infections. === Pneumocystis pneumonia === Primaquine is also used in the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a fungal infection commonly occurring in people with AIDS and, more rarely, in those taking immunosuppressive drugs. To treat PCP effectively, it is usually combined with clindamycin. === Special populations === Primaquine has not been studied extensively in people 65 and older so it is not known if dosing should be adjusted for this population. Primaquine should not be administered to anyone with G6PD deficiency because a severe reaction can occur, resulting in hemolytic anemia. However, the WHO has recommended that a single dose of primaquine (0.25 mg/kg) is safe to give even in individuals with G6PD deficiency, for the purpose of preventing transmission of P. falciparum malaria. Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy, because the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase status of the fetus would be unknown. Primaquine overdose can cause a dangerous reduction in various blood cell counts, and therefore should be avoided in people at risk for agranulocytosis, which include people with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, and those taking concurrent medications that also decrease blood cell counts. Hemolytic reactions (moderate to severe) may occur in individuals with G6PD deficiency and in individuals with a family or personal history of favism. Areas of high prevalence of G6PD deficiency are Africa, Southern Europe, Mediterranean region, Middle East, South-East Asia, and Oceania. People from these regions have a greater tendency to develop hemolytic anemia (due to a congenital deficiency of erythrocytic G6PD) while receiving primaquine and related drugs. == Adverse reactions == Common side effects of primaquine administration include nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. In persons with cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, primaquine causes methemoglobinemia, a condition in which the blood carries less oxygen that it does normally. Overdosing can reduce the number of function of various kinds of blood cells, including loss of red blood cells, methemoglobinemia, and loss of white blood cells. Persons with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) may develop hemolytic anemia from primaquine. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Primaquine is lethal to P. vivax and P. ovale in the liver stage, and also to P. vivax in the blood stage through its ability to do oxidative damage to the cell. However, the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. Liver hypnozoites aside, primaquine can possibly eliminate P. vivax merozoites in bone marrow as a result of accumulation there of hydrogen peroxide. === Pharmacokinetics === Primaquine is well-absorbed in the gut and extensively distributed in the body without accumulating in red blood cells. Administration of primaquine with food or grapefruit juice increases its oral bioavailibity. In blood, about 20% of circulating primaquine is protein-bound, with preferential binding to the acute phase protein orosomucoid. With a half-life on the order of 6 hours, it is quickly metabolized by liver enzymes to carboxyprimaquine, which does not have anti-malarial activity. Renal excretion of the parent drug is less than 4%. == Chemistry == Primaquine is an analog of pamaquine which was the first drug of the 8-aminoquinoline class; tafenoquine is another such drug. == History == Primaquine was first made by Robert Elderfield of Columbia University in the 1940s as part of a coordinated effort led by the Office of Scientific Research and Development in World War II to develop anti-malarial drugs to protect and treat soldiers fighting in the Pacific theater. == Society and culture == It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Names == It is a generic drug and is available under many brand names worldwide, including Jasoprim, Malirid, Neo-Quipenyl, Pimaquin, Pmq, Primachina, Primacin, Primaquina, Primaquine, Primaquine diphosphate, Primaquine Phosphate, and Remaquin. SN-13272 == Research == Primaquine has been studied in animal models of Chagas disease and was about four times as effective as the standard of care, nifurtimox.

While not effective as an antibiotic by itself, it restores potency to existing antibiotics by inhibiting the β-lactamase enzymes that would otherwise degrade them. When combined with an appropriate antibiotic it can be used for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. In the United States, the combination drug meropenem/vaborbactam (Vabomere) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis. The combination was approved for medical use in Canada in December 2024. == Biochemistry == Vaborbactam is a boronic acid β-lactamase inhibitor with a high affinity for serine β-lactamases, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Vaborbactam inhibits a variety of β-lactamases, exhibiting a 69 nM Ki against the KPC-2 carbapenemase and even lower inhibition constants against CTX-M-15 and SHV-12. Boronic acids are unusual in their ability to reversibly form covalent bonds with alcohols such as the active site serine in a serine carbapenemase. This property enables them to function as transition state analogs of serine carbapenemase-catalyzed lactam hydrolysis and thereby inhibit these enzymes. Carbapenemases can be broadly divided into two different categories based on the mechanism they use to hydrolyze the lactam ring in their substrates: Metallo-β-lactamases contain bound zinc ions in their active sites and are therefore inhibited by chelating agents like EDTA, while serine carbapenemases feature an active site serine that participates in the hydrolysis of the substrate. Serine carbapenemase-catalyzed hydrolysis employs a three-step mechanism featuring acylation and deacylation steps analogous to the mechanism of protease-catalyzed peptide hydrolysis, proceeding through a tetrahedral transition state. Given their mechanism of action, the possibility of off-target effects brought about through inhibition of endogenous serine hydrolases is an obvious possible concern in the development of boronic acid β-lactamase inhibitors, and in fact boronic acids like bortezomib have previously been investigated or developed as inhibitors of various human proteases. Vaborbactam, however, is a highly specific β-lactamase inhibitor, with an IC50 >> 1 mM against all human serine hydrolases against which it has been tested. Consistent with its high in vitro specificity, vaborbactam exhibited a good safety profile in human phase I clinical trials, with similar adverse events observed in both placebo and treatment groups. Hecker et al. argue this specificity results from the higher affinity of human proteases to linear molecules; thus it is expected that a boron heterocycle will have zero effect on them. == References ==",Vaborbactam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002325502864550799), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0052597238682210445)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaborbactam?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Vaborbactam', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaborbactam?utm_source=openai')])"
1926,"('Ritodrine (hydrochloride)', 'Ritodrine', 'Yutopar', 'Ritodrina [inn-spanish]', 'Ritodrinium [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Ritodrine, formerly sold under the brand name Yutopar among others, is a tocolytic drug used to stop premature labor. It was withdrawn from the US market, according to the FDA Orange Book. It was available in oral tablets or as an injection and was typically used as the hydrochloride salt. The drug acts as a selective β2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. == Medical uses == Ridodrine is used to treat preterm labor. == Contraindications == Possible contraindications of ritodrine include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and migraines. == Side effects == Most side effects of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists result from their concurrent β1-adrenergic receptor agonistic activity, and include increase in heart rate, rise in systolic blood pressure, decrease in diastolic blood pressure, chest pain secondary to myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. β-Adrenergic receptor agonists may also cause fluid retention secondary to decrease in water clearance, which when added to the tachycardia and increased myocardial work, may result in heart failure. In addition, they increase gluconeogenesis in the liver and muscle resulting in hyperglycemia, which increases insulin requirements in diabetic patients. The passage of β-adrenergic receptor agonists through the placenta does occur and may be responsible for fetal tachycardia, as well as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia at birth. It has also been associated with postpartum bleeding. Ritodrine has been reported rarely to cause serious side effects including rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, leukopenia, pulmonary edema, and psychiatric symptoms, among others. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ritodrine is a short-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist – a class of medication used for smooth muscle relaxation (other similar drugs are used in asthma or other pulmonary diseases such as salbutamol [albuterol]). Since ritodrine has a bulky N-substituent, it has high β2-adrenergic receptor selectivity. Also, the 4-hydroxy group on the benzene ring is important for activity as it is needed to form hydrogen bonds. Since the drug is β2-selective, it is used for premature labor. === Pharmacokinetics === The 4-hydroxy group of ritodrine makes it susceptible to metabolism by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). == Chemistry == Ritodrine, also known as 4-hydroxy-β-hydroxy-N-(4-hydroxyphenylethyl)amphetamine or as N-(4-hydroxyphenylethyl)-4-hydroxynorephedrine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative.

1928,"('Palmitic acid', 'Hexadecanoic acid', 'Cetylic acid', 'Palmitate', 'N-hexadecanoic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid in IUPAC nomenclature) is a fatty acid with a 16-carbon chain. It is the most common saturated fatty acid found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Its chemical formula is CH3(CH2)14COOH, and its C:D ratio (the total number of carbon atoms to the number of carbon-carbon double bonds) is 16:0. It is a major component of palm oil from the fruit of Elaeis guineensis (oil palms), making up to 44% of total fats. Meats, cheeses, butter, and other dairy products also contain palmitic acid, amounting to 50–60% of total fats. Palmitates are the salts and esters of palmitic acid. The palmitate anion is the observed form of palmitic acid at physiologic pH (7.4). Major sources of C16:0 are palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and milk fat. == Occurrence and production == Palmitic acid was discovered by saponification of palm oil, which process remains today the primary industrial route for producing the acid. Triglycerides (fats) in palm oil are hydrolysed by high-temperature water and the resulting mixture is fractionally distilled. === Dietary sources === Palmitic acid is produced by a wide range of plants and organisms, typically at low levels. Among common foods it is present in milk, butter, cheese, and some meats, as well as cocoa butter, olive oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil, (see table). Karukas contain 44.90% palmitic acid. The cetyl ester of palmitic acid, cetyl palmitate, occurs in spermaceti. == Biochemistry == Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major body component of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21–30% (molar) of human depot fat, and it is a major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk. Palmitate negatively feeds back on acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which in turn is used to add to the growing acyl chain, thus preventing further palmitate generation. Some proteins are modified by the addition of a palmitoyl group in a process known as palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is important for localisation of many membrane proteins. == Applications == === Surfactant === Palmitic acid is used to produce soaps, cosmetics, and industrial mold release agents. These applications use sodium palmitate, which is commonly obtained by saponification of palm oil. To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm trees (species Elaeis guineensis), is treated with sodium hydroxide (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes hydrolysis of the ester groups, yielding glycerol and sodium palmitate. === Foods === Because it is inexpensive and adds texture and ""mouthfeel"" to processed foods (convenience food), palmitic acid and its sodium salt find wide use in foodstuffs. Sodium palmitate is permitted as a natural additive in organic products. === Military === Aluminium salts of palmitic acid and naphthenic acid were the gelling agents used with volatile petrochemicals during World War II to produce napalm. The word ""napalm"" is derived from the words naphthenic acid and palmitic acid. == Research == It is well accepted in the medical community that palmitic acid from dietary sources raises low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol. The World Health Organization have stated there is convincing evidence that palmitic acid increases cardiovascular disease risk. A 2021 review indicated that replacing dietary palmitic acid and other saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, could reduce several biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. == See also == Retinyl palmitate Ascorbyl palmitate SN2 Palmitate Juniperic acid (16-hydroxypalmitic acid) == References == == External links == Media related to Palmitic acid at Wikimedia Commons ""Palmitic Acid"" .

1929,"('Pyrazinamide', 'Pyrazinecarboxamide', 'Pyrazinoic acid amide', 'Pyrazine-2-carboxamide', 'Zinamide')",Medical,"Pyrazinamide is a medication used to treat tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis, it is often used with rifampicin, isoniazid, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. It is not generally recommended for the treatment of latent tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pains, and rash. More serious side effects include gout, liver toxicity, and sensitivity to sunlight. It is not recommended in those with significant liver disease or porphyria. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe but it is likely okay during breastfeeding. Pyrazinamide is in the antimycobacterial class of medications. How it works is not entirely clear. Pyrazinamide was first made in 1936, but did not come into wide use until 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Pyrazinamide is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Pyrazinamide is only used in combination with other drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and as directly observed therapy (DOT). It is never used on its own. It has no other indicated medical uses. In particular, it is not used to treat other mycobacteria; Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium leprae are innately resistant to pyrazinamide. Pyrazinamide is used in the first 2 months of treatment to reduce the duration of treatment required. Regimens not containing pyrazinamide must be taken for 9 months or more. Pyrazinamide is a potent antiuricosuric drug and consequently has an off-label use in the diagnosis of causes of hypouricemia and hyperuricosuria. It acts on URAT1. == Adverse effects == The most common (roughly 1%) side effect of pyrazinamide is joint pains (arthralgia), but this is not usually so severe that patients need to stop taking it. Pyrazinamide can precipitate gout flares by decreasing renal excretion of uric acid. The most dangerous side effect of pyrazinamide is hepatotoxicity, which is dose-related. The old dose for pyrazinamide was 40–70 mg/kg daily and the incidence of drug-induced hepatitis has fallen significantly since the recommended dose has been reduced to 12–30 mg/kg daily. In the standard four-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol), pyrazinamide is the most common cause of drug-induced hepatitis. It is not possible to clinically distinguish pyrazinamide-induced hepatitis from hepatitis caused by isoniazid or rifampicin; test dosing is required (this is discussed in detail in tuberculosis treatment) Other side effects include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, sideroblastic anemia, skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, dysuria, interstitial nephritis, malaise, rarely porphyria, and fever. == Pharmacokinetics == Pyrazinamide is well absorbed orally. It crosses inflamed meninges and is an essential part of the treatment of tuberculous meningitis. It is metabolised by the liver and the metabolic products are excreted by the kidneys. Pyrazinamide is routinely used in pregnancy in the UK and the rest of the world; the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends its use in pregnancy; and extensive clinical experience shows that it is safe. In the US, pyrazinamide is not used in pregnancy, citing insufficient evidence of safety. Pyrazinamide is removed by haemodialysis, so doses should always be given at the end of a dialysis session. == Mechanism of action == Pyrazinamide is a prodrug that stops the growth of M. tuberculosis. Pyrazinamide diffuses into the granuloma of M. tuberculosis, where the tuberculosis enzyme pyrazinamidase converts pyrazinamide to the active form pyrazinoic acid. Under acidic conditions of pH 5 to 6, the pyrazinoic acid that slowly leaks out converts to the protonated conjugate acid, which is thought to diffuse easily back into the bacilli and accumulate. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesize fatty acids although this has been discounted. The accumulation of pyrazinoic acid was also suggested to disrupt membrane potential and interfere with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. However, since an acidic environment is not essential for pyrazinamide susceptibility and pyrazinamide treatment does not lead to intrabacterial acidification nor rapid disruption of membrane potential, this model has also been discounted. Pyrazinoic acid was proposed to bind to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibit trans-translation, but more detailed experiments have shown that it does not have this activity. The current hypothesis is that pyrazinoic acid blocks synthesis of coenzyme A. Pyrazinoic acid binds weakly to the aspartate decarboxylase PanD, triggering its degradation. This is an unusual mechanism of action in that pyrazinamide does not directly block the action of its target, but indirectly triggers its destruction. === Resistance === Mutations in the pncA gene of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a pyrazinamidase and converts pyrazinamide to its active form pyrazinoic acid, are responsible for the majority of pyrazinamide resistance in M. tuberculosis strains. A few pyrazinamide-resistant strains with mutations in the rpsA gene have also been identified. However, a direct association between these rpsA mutations and pyrazinamide resistance has not been established. The pyrazinamide-resistant M. tuberculosis strain DHMH444, which harbors a mutation in the carboxy terminal coding region of rpsA, is fully susceptible to pyrazinoic acid and pyrazinamide resistance of this strain was previously associated with decreased pyrazinamidase activity. Further, this strain was found to be susceptible to pyrazinamide in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Thus, current data indicate that rpsA mutations are not likely to be associated with pyrazinamide resistance. Currently, three main methods of testing are used for pyrazinamide resistance: 1) phenotypic tests where a tuberculosis strain is grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of pyrazinamide, 2) measuring levels of pyrazinamidase enzyme produced by the tuberculosis strain, or 3) looking for mutations in the pncA gene of tuberculosis. Concerns exist that the most widely used method for phenotypic resistance testing may overestimate the number of resistant strains. Global resistance of tuberculosis to pyrazinamide has been estimated to be in 16% of all cases, and 60% of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. == Abbreviations == The abbreviations PZA and Z are standard, and used commonly in the medical literature, although best practice discourages the abbreviating of drug names to prevent mistakes. == Presentation == Pyrazinamide is a generic drug, and is available in a wide variety of presentations. Pyrazinamide tablets form the bulkiest part of the standard tuberculosis treatment regimen. Pyrazinamide tablets are so large, some people find them impossible to swallow: pyrazinamide syrup is an option. Pyrazinamide is also available as part of fixed-dose combinations with other TB drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin (Rifater is an example). == History == Pyrazinamide was first discovered and patented in 1936, but not used against tuberculosis until 1952. Its discovery as an antitubercular agent was remarkable since it has no activity against tuberculosis in vitro, due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily not be expected to work in vivo. However, nicotinamide was known to have activity against tuberculosis and pyrazinamide was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at Lederle and Merck confirmed its ability to kill tuberculosis and it was rapidly used in humans. == References ==",Zinamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0033006970770657063), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0016807490028440952)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/zinamide,https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/5273/smpc/,https://patient.info/medicine/pyrazinamide-for-tuberculosis-zinamide ', [])"

The medication is taken by mouth or via the rectum. It typically begins working in around 30 minutes when given by rectum and within twelve hours when given by mouth. It is a weaker laxative than bisacodyl and castor oil. Common side effects of senna glycoside include abdominal cramps. It is not recommended for long-term use, as it may result in poor bowel function or electrolyte problems. While no harm has been found to result from use while breastfeeding, such use is not typically recommended. It is not typically recommended in children. Senna may change urine to a somewhat reddish color. Senna derivatives are a type of stimulant laxative and are of the anthraquinone type. While its mechanism of action is not entirely clear, senna is thought to act by increasing fluid secretion within and contraction of the large intestine. Sennosides come from the group of plants Senna. In plant form, it has been used at least since the 700s AD. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 280th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with docusate was the 261st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is sold under a number of brand names including Ex-Lax and Senokot. == Medical uses == Senna is used for episodic and chronic constipation though there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support its use for these purposes. It may also be used to aid in the evacuation of the bowel prior to surgery or invasive rectal or colonic examinations. === Administration === Oral senna products typically produce a bowel movement in 6 to 12 hours. Rectal suppositories can act within minutes or take up to two hours. == Contraindications == According to Commission E, senna is contraindicated in cases of intestinal obstruction, acute intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn's disease), ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, and abdominal pain of unknown origin. Senna is considered contraindicated in people with a documented allergy to anthraquinones. Such allergies are rare and typically limited to dermatological reactions of redness and itching. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are typically limited to gastrointestinal reactions and include abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Regular use of senna products can lead to a characteristic brown pigmentation of the internal colonic wall seen on colonoscopy. This abnormal pigmentation is known as melanosis coli. === Interactions === Senna glycosides can increase digoxin toxicity in patients taking digoxin by reducing serum potassium levels, thereby enhancing the effects of digoxin. == Mechanism of action == The breakdown products of senna act directly as irritants on the colonic wall to induce fluid secretion and colonic motility. == Pharmacology == They are anthraquinones derivatives and dimeric glycosides. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Senna is an over-the-counter drug available in multiple formulations, including oral formations (liquid, tablet, granular) and rectal suppositories.

Oxidative stress is known to play an important role in the pathophysiology of diseases, including epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the effects of sennoside B on PTZ-induced seizures in rats. The rats were grouped into Group Electroencephalography and Group Behavioral. Both Groups were divided into eight subgroups, and these subgroups were compared in terms of the time of first myoclonic jerk, Racine's Convulsion Scale, malondialdehyde levels, and brain superoxide dismutase activity. The experimental seizure model was performed with pentylenetetrazol. The spike percentage was significantly lower in groups that received sennoside B, and this beneficial effect was shown to be associated with the dose of sennoside B received. The RCS score was lower and the FJM onset time was higher in the sennoside B-administered groups. Additionally, brain MDA and brain aquaporin-3 levels were lower and brain SOD activity was higher in the sennoside-administered groups. The present study shows the beneficial effects of sennoside B on PTZ-induced convulsion in rats. It is considered that sennoside B which is a natural and safe product would be a good candidate for strengthening the management of epilepsy without serious side effects. The current Ph. Eur. monographs for senna pods, senna leaf and senna leaf dry extract standardised describe a photometric assay based on the Bornträger reaction to determine hydroxyanthracene glycosides, calculated as sennoside B. The method is timeconsuming, unspecific for sennosides and the precision is not adequate for a modern assay. The photometric method shall therefore be replaced by a modern HPLC method. About 70 % of the total anthrachinone content in herbal drugs of senna species is due to sennoside A and sennoside B. These substances are therefore suitable for the standardisation of Senna products. The Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) already describes an HPLC method to determine sennoside A and sennoside B in the monograph for senna leaf. It uses ion-pair chromatography with tetraheptylammoniumbromide. The procedure described in the monograph has a runtime of 70 min. The adapted and validated method described here uses solid-phase extraction (SPE) which allows a selective sample preparation by using an anion exchange phase. A conventional RP C18 column Tosh TSKgel ODS-80TS (4.6 mm × 150 mm), 5 μm, was used as stationary phase and acetonitrile for chromatography R, water R, phosphoric acid R (200:800:1 V/V/V) as mobile phase. The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min, the column temperature 40 °C, the detection wavelength 380 nm, and the injection volume 20 μL. The runtime is 10 min, the chromatogram shows 2 peaks due to sennoside A/B and 2 additional smaller compounds. One of them is rhein-8-O-glucoside. The procedure has been successfully validated according to ICH guidelines. We analysed 6 batches of Senna. The pods (Senna angustifolia) showed a total content of sennoside A and B of 1.74-2.76 % m/m and the content of senna leaves was clearly lower with 1.07-1.19 % m/m, respectively. The suggested method is considered to be suitable to determine sennoside A and sennoside B in senna leaves and senna pods. The consideration is based on the performed validation and on the results for the analysed samples. A short run time and better resolution are clear advantages of the suggested method, compared to other methods. Sennoside A (erythro) and sennoside B (threo) are dianthrone glycosides and diastereomers. We investigated their abilities to prevent the gastric lesions associated with diseases, such as, gastritis and gastric ulcer. To elucidate their gastroprotective effects, the inhibitions of HCl•EtOH-induced gastritis and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers were assessed in rats. It was observed that both sennoside A and sennoside B increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels and inhibited H(+)/K(+)-ATPase (proton pump). In a rat model, both compounds reduced gastric juice, total acidity and increased pH, indicating that proton pump inhibition reduces gastric acid secretion. Furthermore, sennoside A and B increased PGE2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In a gastric emptying and intestinal transporting rate experiment, both sennoside A and sennoside B accelerated motility. Our results thus suggest that sennoside A and sennoside B possess significant gastroprotective activities and they might be useful for the treatment of gastric disease.",Sennoside b,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.030909765511751175), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0031786637846380472), (' FOOD', -0.00014644917973782867)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.31809940934181213), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.10022976994514465), ('ĠFOOD', -0.020378271117806435), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038063790649175644)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -5.836499985889532e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.318681188422488e-05), (' FOOD', -0.0005530327325686812)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://www.chemdatabank.com/compounds/compound-sennoside-B.html,https://plantaanalytica.com/product/sennoside-b/,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/652.html ', [])"
1933,"('Perindopril (erbumine)', 'Perindopril tert-butylamine salt', 'Perindoprilum', 'Coversyl', 'Mcn-a-2833')",Medical,"Perindopril is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, or stable coronary artery disease. As a long-acting ACE inhibitor, perindopril works by inhibiting production of the vasoconstriction hormone, angiotensin, thereby relaxing blood vessels, increasing urine output, and decreasing blood volume, leading to a reduction of blood pressure. It also increases blood renin activity and decreases aldosterone secretion, causing increased urine production and excretion of sodium. As a prodrug, perindopril is hydrolyzed in the liver to its active metabolite, perindoprilat. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1988. Perindopril is taken in the form of perindopril arginine/amlodipine or perindopril erbumine. Both forms are therapeutically equivalent and interchangeable, but the dose prescribed to achieve the same effect may differ between the two forms. Perindopril should not be used during pregnancy, as it may harm the fetus. Some people may have allergic reactions to perindopril, while common side-effects may include cough, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, or upset stomach. In Australia during 2023-24, it was the fourth-most prescribed drug. == Medical uses == Perindopril shares the indications of ACE inhibitors as a class, including essential hypertension, stable coronary artery disease (reduction of risk of cardiac events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or revascularization), treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease or heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy. === Combination therapy === ==== With indapamide ==== In combination with indapamide, perindopril has been shown to significantly reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease and renal complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, the Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) found that whilst perindopril monotherapy demonstrated no significant benefit in reducing recurrent strokes when compared to placebo, the addition of low dose indapamide to perindopril therapy was associated with larger reductions in both blood pressure lowering and recurrent stroke risk in patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, irrespective of their blood pressure. There is evidence to support the use of perindopril and indapamide combination over perindopril monotherapy to prevent strokes and improve mortality in patients with a history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack or other cardiovascular disease. ==== With amlodipine ==== The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BLA) was a 2005 landmark trial that compared the effects of the established therapy of the combination of atenolol and bendroflumethiazide to the new drug combination of amlodipine and perindopril (trade names Viacoram, AceryCal). The study of more than 19,000 patients worldwide was terminated earlier than anticipated because it clearly demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with the newer treatment. The combination of amlodipine and perindopril remains in the current treatment guidelines for hypertension. == Warning and adverse effects == Perindopril may cause death or birth defects of a fetus if taken by the mother during pregnancy. It is poisonous in children and is not prescribed for them. It may cause allergic reactions, and may have adverse effects in people with heart, liver or kidney problems. == Precautions == Assess kidney function before and during treatment where appropriate. Renovascular hypertension Surgery/anesthesia An analysis on the PROGRESS trial showed that perindopril has key benefits in reducing cardiovascular events by 30% in patients with chronic kidney disease defined as a CrCl <60ml/min. A 2016 and 2017 meta-analysis review looking at ACE inhibitors demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events but also slowed the decline of renal failure by 39% when compared to placebo. These studies included patients with moderate to severe kidney disease and those on dialysis. Its renoprotective benefits of decreasing blood pressure and removing filtration pressure is highlighted in a 2016 review. ACE inhibitor can result in an initial increase of serum creatinine, but mostly returns to baseline in a few weeks in majority of patients. It has been suggested that increased monitoring, especially in advanced kidney failure, will minimise any related risk and improve long-term benefits. Use cautiously in patients with sodium or volume depletion due to potential excessive hypotensive effects of renin-angiotensin blockade causing symptomatic hypotension. Careful monitoring or short-term dose reduction of diuretics prior to commencing perindopril is recommended to prevent this potential effect. A diuretic may later be given in combination if necessary; potassium-sparing diuretics are not recommended in combination with perindopril due to the risk of hyperkalaemia. Combination with neuroleptics or imipramine-type drugs may increase the blood pressure lowering effect. Serum lithium concentrations may rise during lithium therapy. == Side effects == Usually mild at the start of treatment, side effects may include cough, fatigue, headache, nausea, or upset stomach, among other minor effects. == Composition == Each tablet contains 2, 4, or 8 mg of the tert-butylamine salt of perindopril. Perindopril is also available under the trade name Coversyl Plus, containing 4 mg of perindopril combined with 1.25 mg indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic. In Australia, each tablet contains 2.5, 5, or 10 mg of perindopril arginine. Perindopril is also available under the trade name Coversyl Plus, containing 5 mg of perindopril arginine combined with 1.25 mg indapamide and Coversyl Plus LD, containing 2.5 mg of perindopril arginine combined with 0.625 mg indapamide. The efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of 4 mg perindopril and 5 mg amlodipine, a calcium channel antagonist, is used. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Perindopril is available under the following brand names among others: === Marketing === In July 2014, the European Commission imposed fines of €427,700,000 on Laboratoires Servier and five companies which produce generics due to Servier's abuse of their dominant market position, in breach of European Union Competition law.

Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to synchronize the cells in G1/early S phase. The prefix deoxy- is often left out since there are no precursors of thymine nucleotides involved in RNA synthesis.

Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). It exists in solid form as small white crystals or white crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 242.229 Da and a melting point of 185 °C. The stability of deoxythymidine under standard temperature and pressure (STP) is very high. Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and is part of one of the four nucleosides in DNA. It is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. Instead of thymidine, RNA contains uridine (uracil joined to ribose). Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, which is also known as 5-methyluracil. Since thymine nucleotides are precursors of DNA (but not RNA), the prefix ""deoxy"" is often left out, i.e., deoxythymidine is often just called thymidine.

Istradefylline reduces ""off"" periods resulting from long-term treatment with the antiparkinson drug levodopa. An ""off"" episode is a time when a patient's medications are not working well, causing an increase in PD symptoms, such as tremor and difficulty walking. Relatively common side effects include involuntary muscle movements (dyskinesia), constipation, hallucinations, dizziness, and, much like its parent molecule caffeine, nausea and sleeplessness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Adverse effects == The adverse effects of istradefylline have only been studied in the context of treating ""off"" episodes in Parkinson's disease. The most common adverse effects of istradefylline in clinical trials are dyskinesia exacerbation (roughly 9% increase relative to placebo), malaise, and nasopharyngitis (common cold). == Mechanism of action == Istradefylline is a selective antagonist at the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), but the precise mechanism by which it exerts its therapeutic effect in Parkinson's disease is unknown. However, it is known that dimers of these receptors form heterotetramers with the dimers of dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) within striatum. Adenosine acts as an endogenous A2AR agonist, but also as a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) within these tetramers towards D2Rs, thus inhibiting the D2R mediated effects of dopamine, an endogenous D2R agonist. Istradefylline is believed to bind an A2AR within an A2AR-D2R-tetramer and function as a NAM towards the other A2AR (instead of D2R), thus inhibiting the effects of adenosine and enhancing the movement (locomotion) promoting effects exerted by dopamine via D2R. However, at high istradefylline concentration, it causes locomotion depression akin to caffeine (which is a broad-spectrum adenosine receptor antagonist), and might do so by displacing adenosine, and working as a NAM towards D2R (instead of A2AR). == History == It was first approved in Japan in 2013. The effectiveness of Nourianz in treating ""off"" episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease who are already being treated with levodopa/carbidopa was shown in four 12-week placebo-controlled clinical studies that included a total of 1,143 participants. In all four studies, people treated with Nourianz experienced a statistically significant decrease from baseline in daily ""off"" time compared to patients receiving a placebo. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019. and approval was granted to Kyowa Kirin, Inc. == Research == === Wakefulness effects === The wakefulness-promoting effects of non-selective adenosine receptor antagonists like caffeine appear to be mediated specifically and exclusively by antagonism of the adenosine A2A receptor. There is preliminary clinical evidence that istradefylline has wakefulness-promoting effects similarly to caffeine. === Motivational disorders === Istradefylline shows pro-motivational effects in animals and has been found to reduce apathy, fatigue, and anhedonia in people with Parkinson's disease. Selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists like istradefylline and preladenant may be useful in the treatment of motivational disorders in humans. === Other conditions === In addition to Parkinson's disease, istradefylline was under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), restless legs syndrome, and substance-related disorders.

However, few effective interventions are available to improve the outcome due to the complicated mechanisms and lack of appropriate therapeutic targets. Hence, this research aimed to explore the effect of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) compounds on I/R-induced kidney damage. One of the main causes of renal I/R injury is the ferroptosis of renal tubular cells. In this study, compared with the antidiabetic TZD pioglitazone (PGZ), we found its derivative mitoglitazone (MGZ) exerted significantly inhibitory effects on erastin-induced ferroptosis by suppressing mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization and lipid ROS production in HEK293 cells. Moreover, MGZ pretreatment remarkably alleviated I/R-induced renal damages by inhibiting cell death and inflammation, upregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and reducing iron-related lipid peroxidation in C57BL/6 N mice. Additionally, MGZ exhibited excellent protection against I/R-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production, mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, and mitochondrial morphology in kidney tissues. Mechanistically, molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that MGZ exhibited a high binding affinity with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein mitoNEET. Collectively, our findings indicated the renal protective effect of MGZ was closely linked to regulating the mitoNEET-mediated ferroptosis pathway, thus offering potential therapeutic strategies for ameliorating I/R injuries. Lung cancer is a disease in which lung cells grow abnormally and uncontrollably, and the cause of it is direct smoking, secondhand smoke, radon, asbestos, and certain chemicals. The worldwide leading cause of death is lung cancer, which is responsible for more than 1.8 million deaths yearly and is expected to rise to 2.2 million by 2030. The most common type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for about 80% and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is more aggressive than NSCLC and is often diagnosed later and accounts for 20% of cases. The global concern for lung cancer demands efficient drugs with the slightest chance of developing resistance, and the idea of multitargeted drug designing came up with the solution. In this study, we have performed multitargeted molecular docking studies of Drug Bank compounds with HTVS, SP and XP algorithms followed by MM\GBSA against the four proteins of lung cancer cellular survival and stress responses, which revealed Mitoglitazone as a multitargeted inhibitor with a docking and MM\GBSA score ranging from - 5.784 to - 7.739 kcal/mol and - 25.81 to - 47.65kcal/mol, respectively.

1942,"('Terbutryn', 'Clarosan', 'Shortstop', 'Prebane', 'Terbutrex')",Medical,"Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is the baseball or softball fielding position between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. Historically, the position was assigned to defensive specialists who were typically poor at batting and were often placed at the bottom of the batting order. Today, shortstops are often able to hit well and many are placed at the top of the lineup. In the numbering system used by scorers to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6. More hit balls go to the shortstop than to any other position, as there are more right-handed hitters in baseball than left-handed hitters, and most hitters have a tendency to pull the ball slightly. Like a second baseman, a shortstop must be agile, for example when performing a 4-6-3 double play. Also, like a third baseman, the shortstop fields balls hit to the left side of the infield, where a strong arm is needed to throw out a batter-runner before they reach the safety of first base. == History == Doc Adams of the Knickerbockers created the concept of the shortstop position, according to baseball historian John Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield because of the balls' light weight. Adams's shortstop position, which he started playing at some time from 1849 to 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. The position, more of a fourth outfielder than an infielder, was also then called ""short fielder"" (a term still used in soft-pitch softball for the 10th player). With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved to the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. However, Dickey Pearce, primarily of the Brooklyn Atlantics, is credited as the first to have played the shortstop position as it is played now. Adams had a long playing career with the Knickerbockers: he remained a player with the team until 1860. == Positioning == Unlike the pitcher and catcher, who must start every play in a designated area (the pitcher must be on the pitcher's mound, with one foot in contact with the pitcher's rubber, and the catcher must be behind home plate in the catcher's box) the shortstop and the other fielders can vary their positioning in response to what they anticipate will be the actions of the batter and runner(s) once the play begins. The shortstop ordinarily is positioned near second base on the third-base side. Because right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball more toward third base, a shortstop will generally move closer to third base if the batter is batting right-handed, and more toward first base if the batter is batting left-handed. A shortstop typically has a strong throwing arm, because he has a relatively long throw to first base, and often has less time in which to make a throw, given that the ground balls he fields have often traveled relatively far. A shortstop must also be extremely agile, because balls hit to or near the shortstop position are usually hit harder than to other infield positions. Shortstops are required to cover second base in double play situations when the ball is hit to the second baseman or first baseman. They also cover second when a runner is attempting a stolen base, but only when a left-handed hitter is batting because the infield will respond to a left-handed batter by shifting toward first base, resulting in the shortstop being the infielder who is closest to second base. Shortstops also must cover third at various times, including the rotation play; the latter occurs when there are runners on first and second and a sacrifice bunt is attempted toward third base, requiring the third baseman to move in away from third base in order to field it. Shortstops generally are given precedence on catching pop-ups in the infield as well, so they end up calling off other players many times, although on deep pop-ups they generally fall back when called off by an outfielder. They often become the cutoff man on balls to any part of the outfield that are being directed towards third base and all balls to left and center field that are destined for second base. Depending on the system the shortstop may cut balls from left field heading home; however, this is usually the job of the third baseman. The emphasis on defense makes the position unusually difficult to fill. Historically, a strong shortstop did not have to be a good hitter. Some of the weakest hitters in Major League Baseball have played the position, including Mario Mendoza, for whom George Brett popularized the eponymous Mendoza Line to describe a batting average below .200. Since the 1960s, however, such mediocre hitting has become rarer as teams increasingly demand players with ability to both field and hit. In practice, a marginal fielder as a shortstop who hits well can be moved to almost any other position, especially second base or third base, whether early in their careers (examples: George Brett and Mike Schmidt were both tried early in their careers as shortstops) or later due to diminished fielding range, slower reflexes, weaker throwing arms, increased risk of injury, or co-existence with another dominant shortstop, as with Ernie Banks, Cal Ripken Jr., Alex Rodríguez, Michael Young, or Miguel Tejada. == Significant shortstops == === Shortstops inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame === The year in which the player was inducted is given in brackets after his name. ==== Notes ==== John Henry Lloyd and Willie Wells were elected for their play in the Negro leagues. George Wright was elected as a pioneer, but also starred as a shortstop in the 1860s and 1870s. Robin Yount started his career as a shortstop, and moved to the outfield where he played his last nine seasons. (Besides winning the MVP award as a shortstop in 1982, Yount also won the award as a centerfielder in 1989.) Ernie Banks played shortstop for the first half of his career and first base for the remainder. === Multiple Gold Glove Award winners === === All-time single season assist leaders among shortstops === Ozzie Smith: 621 (San Diego Padres, 1980) Glenn Wright: 601 (Pittsburgh Pirates, 1924) Dave Bancroft: 598 (Philadelphia Phillies/New York Giants, 1920) Tommy Thevenow: 597 (St. Louis Cardinals, 1926) Iván DeJesús: 595 (Chicago Cubs, 1977) Cal Ripken Jr.: 583 (Baltimore Orioles, 1984) Whitey Wietelmann: 581 (Boston Braves, 1943) Dave Bancroft: 579 (New York Giants, 1922) Rabbit Maranville: 574 (Boston Braves, 1914) Don Kessinger: 573 (Chicago Cubs, 1968) Source: (does not list teams) === All-time single season putout leaders among shortstops === Donie Bush: 425 (Detroit Tigers, 1914) Hughie Jennings: 425 (Baltimore Orioles [National League], 1895) Joe Cassidy: 408 (Washington Senators, 1905) Rabbit Maranville: 407 (Boston Braves, 1914) Dave Bancroft: 405 (New York Giants, 1922) Eddie Miller: 405 (Boston Braves, 1940) Monte Cross: 404 (Philadelphia Phillies, 1898) Dave Bancroft: 396 (New York Giants, 1921) Mickey Doolan: 395 (Philadelphia Phillies, 1906) Buck Weaver: 392 (Chicago White Sox, 1913) === All-time single-season fielding percentage leaders among shortstops === Mike Bordick: .9982 (Baltimore Orioles, 2002) Cal Ripken Jr.: .9956 (Baltimore Orioles, 1990) Omar Vizquel: .9954 (Cleveland Indians, 2000) Rey Sánchez: .9941 (Kansas City Royals, 2000) Rey Ordóñez: .9938 (New York Mets, 1999) Omar Vizquel: .9933 (San Francisco Giants, 2006) Omar Vizquel: .9931 (Cleveland Indians, 1998) J.

1943,"('Ganciclovir', 'Bw 759')",Medical,"Ganciclovir, sold under the brand name Cytovene among others, is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Ganciclovir was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1988. == Medical use == Ganciclovir is indicated for: Sight-threatening CMV retinitis in severely immunocompromised people CMV pneumonitis in bone marrow transplant recipients Prevention of CMV disease in bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients Confirmed CMV retinitis in people with AIDS (intravitreal implant) It is also used for acute CMV colitis in HIV/AIDS and CMV pneumonitis in immunosuppressed patients. Ganciclovir has also been used with some success in treating Human herpesvirus 6 infections. Ganciclovir has also been found to be an effective treatment for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis. == Veterinary use == Ganciclovir (in gel form) appears to be effective for treating the ophthalmic Felid herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) virus infection in cats. == Adverse effects == Ganciclovir is commonly associated with a range of serious haematological adverse effects. Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) include: granulocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, anorexia, raised liver enzymes, headache, confusion, hallucination, seizures, pain and phlebitis at injection site (due to high pH), sweating, rash, itch, increased serum creatinine and blood urea concentrations. === Toxicity === Ganciclovir is considered a potential human carcinogen, teratogen, and mutagen. It is also considered likely to cause inhibition of spermatogenesis. Thus, it is used judiciously and handled as a cytotoxic drug in the clinical setting. == Mechanism of action == Ganciclovir (9-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]guanine) is a potent inhibitor of viruses of the herpes family, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), that are pathogenic for humans and animals. The primary mechanism of ganciclovir action against CMV is inhibition of the replication of viral DNA by ganciclovir-5'-triphosphate (ganciclovir-TP). This inhibition includes a selective and potent inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase. Ganciclovir is metabolized to the triphosphate form by primarily three cellular enzymes: (1) a deoxyguanosine kinase induced by CMV-infected cells; (2) guanylate kinase; and (3) phosphoglycerate kinase. Other nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes may be involved as well. The selective antiviral response associated with ganciclovir treatment is achieved because of the much weaker inhibition of cellular DNA polymerases by ganciclovir-TP. Activity and selectivity are also amplified by the accumulation of ganciclovir-TP in CMV-infected cells. == Pharmacokinetics == === Administration === Acute infections are treated in two phases: induction phase, 5 mg per kilogram intravenously every 12 hours for 14–21 days, the intravenous dose given as a 1-hour infusion maintenance phase, 5 mg per kg intravenously every day Stable disease is treated with 1000 mg orally three times daily. Similar dosing is used to prevent disease in high-risk patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or those with organ transplants. Ganciclovir is also available in slow-release formulations for insertion into the vitreous humour of the eye, as treatment for CMV retinitis (associated with HIV infection). A topical ophthalmic gel preparation of ganciclovir was recently approved for the treatment of acute herpes simplex keratitis. == See also == Valganciclovir – the prodrug of ganciclovir == References == == Further reading ==",Ganciclovir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001685477327555418), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015120989410206676)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605011.html?utm_source=openai), [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ganciclovir-oral-route-intravenous-route/description/drg-20064078?utm_source=openai), [medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a689014.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=335, start_index=9, title='Ganciclovir: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605011.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=335, start_index=9, title='Ganciclovir (oral route, intravenous route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ganciclovir-oral-route-intravenous-route/description/drg-20064078?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=335, start_index=9, title='Ganciclovir Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a689014.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1946,"('Uracil', 'Pyrimidine-2,4-diol', 'Pyrimidine-2,4(1h,3h)-dione', 'Pyrod', 'Hybar x')","Endogenous, Medical","Uracil () (symbol U or Ura) is one of the four nucleotide bases in the nucleic acid RNA. The others are adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, uracil binds to adenine via two hydrogen bonds. In DNA, the uracil nucleobase is replaced by thymine (T). Uracil is a demethylated form of thymine. Uracil is a common and naturally occurring pyrimidine derivative. The name ""uracil"" was coined in 1885 by the German chemist Robert Behrend, who was attempting to synthesize derivatives of uric acid. Originally discovered in 1900 by Alberto Ascoli, it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein; it was also found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ. It is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light. Uracil that was formed extraterrestrially has been detected in the Murchison meteorite, in near-Earth asteroid Ryugu, and possibly on the surface of the moon Titan. It has been synthesized under cold laboratory conditions similar to outer space, from pyrimidine embedded in water ice and exposed to ultraviolet light. == Properties == In RNA, uracil base-pairs with adenine and replaces thymine during DNA transcription. Methylation of uracil produces thymine. In DNA, the evolutionary substitution of thymine for uracil may have increased DNA stability and improved the efficiency of DNA replication (discussed below). Uracil pairs with adenine through hydrogen bonding. When base pairing with adenine, uracil acts as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen bond donor. In RNA, uracil binds with a ribose sugar to form the ribonucleoside uridine. When a phosphate attaches to uridine, uridine 5′-monophosphate is produced. Uracil undergoes amide-imidic acid tautomeric shifts because any nuclear instability the molecule may have from the lack of formal aromaticity is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability. The amide tautomer is referred to as the lactam structure, while the imidic acid tautomer is referred to as the lactim structure. These tautomeric forms are predominant at pH 7. The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil. Uracil also recycles itself to form nucleotides by undergoing a series of phosphoribosyltransferase reactions. Degradation of uracil produces the substrates β-alanine, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. C4H4N2O2→ H3NCH2CH2COO− + NH+4 + CO2 Oxidative degradation of uracil produces urea and maleic acid in the presence of H2O2 and Fe2+ or in the presence of diatomic oxygen and Fe2+. Uracil is a weak acid. The first site of ionization of uracil is not known. The negative charge is placed on the oxygen anion and produces a pKa of less than or equal to 12. The basic pKa = −3.4, while the acidic pKa = 9.389. In the gas phase, uracil has four sites that are more acidic than water. === In DNA === Uracil is rarely found in DNA, and this may have been an evolutionary change to increase genetic stability. This is because cytosine can deaminate spontaneously to produce uracil through hydrolytic deamination. Therefore, if there were an organism that used uracil in its DNA, the deamination of cytosine (which undergoes base pairing with guanine) would lead to formation of uracil (which would base pair with adenine) during DNA synthesis. Uracil-DNA glycosylase excises uracil bases from double-stranded DNA. This enzyme would therefore recognize and cut out both types of uracil – the one incorporated naturally, and the one formed due to cytosine deamination, which would trigger unnecessary and inappropriate repair processes. This problem is believed to have been solved in terms of evolution, that is by ""tagging"" (methylating) uracil. Methylated uracil is identical to thymine. Hence the hypothesis that, over time, thymine became standard in DNA instead of uracil. So cells continue to use uracil in RNA, and not in DNA, because RNA is shorter-lived than DNA, and any potential uracil-related errors do not lead to lasting damage. Apparently, either there was no evolutionary pressure to replace uracil in RNA with the more complex thymine, or uracil has some chemical property that is useful in RNA, which thymine lacks. Uracil-containing DNA still exists, for example in: DNA of several phages Endopterygote development Hypermutations during the synthesis of vertebrate antibodies. == Synthesis == === Biological === Organisms synthesize uracil, in the form of uridine monophosphate (UMP), by decarboxylating orotidine 5'-monophosphate (orotidylic acid). In humans this decarboxylation is achieved by the enzyme UMP synthase. In contrast to the purine nucleotides, the pyrimidine ring (orotidylic acid) that leads uracil is synthesized first and then linked to ribose phosphate, forming UMP. === Laboratory === There are many laboratory synthesis of uracil available. The first reaction is the simplest of the syntheses, by adding water to cytosine to produce uracil and ammonia: C4H5N3O + H2O → C4H4N2O2 + NH3 The most common way to synthesize uracil is by the condensation of malic acid with urea in fuming sulfuric acid: C4H4O4 + NH2CONH2 → C4H4N2O2 + 2 H2O + CO Uracil can also be synthesized by a double decomposition of thiouracil in aqueous chloroacetic acid. Photodehydrogenation of 5,6-diuracil, which is synthesized by beta-alanine reacting with urea, produces uracil. === Prebiotic === In 2009, NASA scientists reported having produced uracil from pyrimidine and water ice by exposing it to ultraviolet light under space-like conditions. This suggests a possible natural original source for uracil. In 2014, NASA scientists reported that additional complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, starting with ice, pyrimidine, ammonia, and methanol, which are compounds found in astrophysical environments. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds. Based on 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, it is believed that uracil, xanthine, and related molecules can also be formed extraterrestrially. Data from the Cassini mission, orbiting in the Saturn system, suggests that uracil is present in the surface of the moon Titan. In 2023, uracil was observed in a sample from 162173 Ryugu, a near-Earth asteroid, with no exposure to Earth's biosphere, giving further evidence for synthesis in space. == Reactions == Uracil readily undergoes regular reactions including oxidation, nitration, and alkylation. While in the presence of phenol (PhOH) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), uracil can be visualized in ultraviolet light. Uracil also has the capability to react with elemental halogens because of the presence of more than one strongly electron donating group. Uracil readily undergoes addition to ribose sugars and phosphates to partake in synthesis and further reactions in the body. Uracil becomes uridine, uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine diphosphate (UDP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose). Each one of these molecules is synthesized in the body and has specific functions. When uracil reacts with anhydrous hydrazine, a first-order kinetic reaction occurs and the uracil ring opens up. If the pH of the reaction increases to > 10.5, the uracil anion forms, making the reaction go much more slowly. The same slowing of the reaction occurs if the pH decreases, because of the protonation of the hydrazine. The reactivity of uracil remains unchanged, even if the temperature changes. == Uses == Uracil's use in the body is to help carry out the synthesis of many enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates. Uracil serves as allosteric regulator and coenzyme for reactions in animals and in plants. UMP controls the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and aspartate transcarbamoylase in plants, while UDP and UTP regulate CPSase II activity in animals. UDP-glucose regulates the conversion of glucose to galactose in the liver and other tissues in the process of carbohydrate metabolism. Uracil is also involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and the transportation of sugars containing aldehydes. Uracil is important for the detoxification of many carcinogens, for instance those found in tobacco smoke. Uracil is also required to detoxify many drugs such as cannabinoids (THC) and morphine (opioids). It can also slightly increase the risk for cancer in unusual cases in which the body is extremely deficient in folate. The deficiency in folate leads to increased ratio of deoxyuridine monophosphates (dUMP)/deoxythymidine monophosphates (dTMP) and uracil misincorporation into DNA and eventually low production of DNA. Uracil can be used for drug delivery and as a pharmaceutical. When elemental fluorine reacts with uracil, they produce 5-fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is an anticancer drug (antimetabolite) used to masquerade as uracil during the nucleic acid replication process. Because 5-fluorouracil is similar in shape to, but does not undergo the same chemistry as, uracil, the drug inhibits RNA transcription enzymes, thereby blocking RNA synthesis and stopping the growth of cancerous cells. Uracil can also be used in the synthesis of caffeine. Uracil has also shown potential as a HIV viral capsid inhibitor. Uracil derivatives have antiviral, anti-tubercular and anti-leishmanial activity. Uracil can be used to determine microbial contamination of tomatoes. The presence of uracil indicates lactic acid bacteria contamination of the fruit. Uracil derivatives containing a diazine ring are used in pesticides. Uracil derivatives are more often used as antiphotosynthetic herbicides, destroying weeds in cotton, sugar beet, turnips, soya, peas, sunflower crops, vineyards, berry plantations, and orchards. Uracil derivatives can enhance the activity of antimicrobial polysaccharides such as chitosan. In yeast, uracil concentrations are inversely proportional to uracil permease. Mixtures containing uracil are also commonly used to test reversed-phase HPLC columns. As uracil is essentially unretained by the non-polar stationary phase, this can be used to determine the dwell time (and subsequently dwell volume, given a known flow rate) of the system. == References == == External links == Uracil MS Spectrum",Uracil,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0016059131594374776), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.584861744660884e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.015005686320364475), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.8013790142722428e-05), ('OUS', -2.3841830625315197e-06), (',', -0.12716804444789886), ('ĠFOOD', -0.7642095685005188), (',', -0.20179122686386108), ('ĠINDU', -0.4745491147041321), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -0.00012957210128661245), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.4743138253688812), ('ĠMED', -0.00013052565918769687), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0069063282571733)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.014163863845169544), (' FOOD', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000048?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927231/?utm_source=openai), [deascal.com](https://www.deascal.com/ingredient-information/uracil/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=306, start_index=42, title='FComEx: Uracil (PC000048)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000048?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=306, start_index=42, title='Therapeutic potential of uracil and its derivatives in countering pathogenic and physiological disorders', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32927231/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=306, start_index=42, title='Uracil: An In-Depth Look at Its Role in Cosmetics – Deascal®', type='url_citation', url='https://www.deascal.com/ingredient-information/uracil/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a hydroxy ketone attached to two phenyl groups. It appears as off-white crystals, with a light camphor-like odor. Benzoin is synthesized from benzaldehyde in the benzoin condensation. It is chiral and it exists as a pair of enantiomers: (R)-benzoin and (S)-benzoin. Benzoin is not a constituent of benzoin resin obtained from the benzoin tree (Styrax) or tincture of benzoin.

The H4R antagonist adriforant (PF-3893787 or ZPL389) indicated clinical efficacy in a Ph2a study in atopic dermatitis. Preclinical investigations of adriforant had been scarce as experiments in transfectants with H4R from several species suggested partial agonism, not seen in human cells. During the Ph2b trial in AD, we performed experiments to understand the pharmacology of adriforant in primary murine cells and in vivo models. We assessed its effects on ERK phosphorylation and transcriptional changes in bone marrow-derived mast cells, histamine-dependent Ca We show that, contrary to transfectants, adriforant is a competitive antagonist of the murine histamine receptor 4, antagonizes histamine-induced ERK phosphorylation, normalizes histamine-induced transcriptional changes in mast cells and reduces histamine-dependent Ca Our results suggest that functional inhibition of histamine receptor 4 by adriforant reduces itch and inflammation in vivo. The effects observed in mice, however, did not translate to clinical efficacy in patients as the Ph2b clinical trial with adriforant did not meet pre-specified efficacy endpoints.

1950,"('Norgestimate metabolite norelgestromin', 'Norelgestromin', 'Evra', 'Ortho evra', 'Deacetylnorgestimate')",Medical,"A contraceptive patch, also known as ""the patch"", is a transdermal patch applied to the skin that releases synthetic oestrogen and progestogen hormones to prevent pregnancy. They have been shown to be as effective as the combined oral contraceptive pill with perfect use, and the patch may be more effective in typical use. Xulane and Twirla are approved for use in the United States. Evra is approved for use in Canada and marketed by Janssen Inc., and it is approved for use in the United Kingdom and in Europe and marketed by Janssen-Cilag. The patches are packaged in boxes of three and are only available by prescription. == Medical uses == Because the patch works similarly to that of birth control pills, many of the benefits are the same. For example, the patch may make a woman's period lighter and more regular. It may also help to clear acne, decrease cramps, and reduce PMS symptoms. Additionally, the patch is associated with increased protection against iron deficiency anemia, ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, and endometrial and ovarian cancer. The patch is a simple and convenient form of birth control that requires weekly attention. When a woman stops using the patch, her ability to become pregnant returns quickly. == Side effects == In three large clinical trials involving a total of 3,330 women using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch for up to one year, 12% of users discontinued the patch because of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events leading to patch discontinuation were: nausea and/or vomiting (2.4%), application site reaction (1.9%), breast discomfort, engorgement or pain (1.9%), headache (1.1%), and emotional lability (1.0%). The most frequent adverse events reported while using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch were: breast discomfort, engorgement or pain (22%), headache (21%), application site reaction (17%), nausea (17%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%), menstrual cramps (10%), and abdominal pain (9%). Breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting while using the Ortho Evra / Evra patch was reported by: 18% in cycle 1, 12% in cycle 3, 8% in cycle 6 and cycle 13. Breakthrough bleeding (requiring more than one pad or tampon per day) was reported by: 4% in cycle 1, 3% in cycle 3 and cycle 6, and 1% in cycle 13. Overall, side effects that tend to go away after two or three months include bleeding between periods, breast tenderness, and nausea and vomiting. Symptoms that may last longer include skin irritation around the area where the patch is placed and a change in the woman's sexual desires. Additional side effect information is provided in the Ortho Evra label information and the Evra Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and PIL. === Interactions and contraindications === Contraceptive effectiveness of the patch or any other hormonal contraceptive may be reduced significantly if administered alongside various antibiotics, antifungals, anticonvulsants, or other drugs that increase metabolism of contraceptive steroids. However, despite the interactions with many other antibiotics, a clinical pharmacokinetic drug interaction study showed that oral administration of tetracycline HCl 500 mg for three days prior to and seven days during use of Ortho Evra ""did not reduce effectiveness of Ortho Evra."" This is a significant factor in the common decision to administer tetracycline-derived antibiotics following an abortion (preventatively to fight potential infection) when synthetic hormone contraceptives are to be used afterwards. Drugs containing St. John's wort are also known to affect the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. It has also been found that the patch is less effective in women who weigh more than 198 pounds (90 kg). The contraceptive patch and other combination hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated in women older than 35 years who smoke cigarettes. The contraceptive patch is contraindicated for use in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. === Thromboembolism === All combined hormonal birth control products have a very small increased risk of serious or fatal thromboembolic events. There is ongoing research into the thromboembolic risks of Ortho Evra as compared to combined oral contraceptive pills. A recent study found that users of the contraceptive patch may have a twofold increased risk for non-fatal venous thromboembolic events compared with women who took a norgestimate-containing oral contraceptive with 35 μg of estrogen. However, a different study concluded that the risk of nonfatal venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive patch is similar to the risk for oral contraceptives containing 35 μg of ethinylestradiol and norgestimate. The contradiction in findings between the two studies is not easily resolved, because the confidence intervals for the studies are overlapping. In studies with oral contraceptives, the risk for cardiovascular disease (such as thromboembolism) is significantly increased in women over the age of 35 years who also smoke tobacco. Hence, Ortho Evra's package insert states: ""Women who use hormonal contraceptives, including Ortho Evra, should be strongly advised not to smoke."" According to the manufacturer, the patches introduce a 60% higher level of estrogen into the bloodstream as compared to oral contraceptives; however, the clinical significance of this difference is unknown. On November 10, 2005, Ortho McNeil, in conjunction with the FDA, revised the label for Ortho Evra, including a new bolded warning about higher exposure to estrogen for women using the weekly patch compared to taking a daily birth control pill containing 35 μg of estrogen, noting that higher levels of estrogen may put some women at increased risk for getting blood clots. The label was again revised in September 2006, and on January 18, 2008, the FDA again updated the label to reflect study results: ""The FDA believes that Ortho Evra is a safe and effective method of contraception when used according to the labeling, which recommends that women with concerns or risk factors for serious blood clots talk with their health care provider about using Ortho Evra versus other contraceptive options."" == Method of use == The patch is first applied onto the upper outer arm, buttocks, abdomen or thigh on either the first day of the menstrual cycle (day 1) or on the first Sunday following that day, whichever is preferred. The day of application is known from that point as patch change day. Seven days later, when patch change day comes again, the user removes the patch and applies another to one of the approved locations on the body. This process is repeated again on the next patch change day. On the following patch change day, the patch is removed and not replaced. The user waits seven days without a patch in place, and on the next patch change day they apply a new patch. Extended use regimens, where patches are used for several weeks before a patch-free week, have been studied. The patch should be applied to skin that is clean, dry, and intact. This means if skin is red, irritated, or cut, the patch should not be placed in that area. Additionally, avoid using lotions, powder, or makeup around the area where the patch is or will be placed. === Backup contraception === If someone chooses to begin with their patch change day as day one of their menstrual cycle, the patch is able to take effect in time to prevent ovulation (see Mechanism of Action below) and no form of backup contraception is needed at all. In the case that one wishes to begin using the contraceptive patch following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, patch application can be done immediately afterwards. This can be considered the same as a day one start above, and no backup contraception is required. If a user chooses to begin with their patch change day as the first Sunday following day 1, it is necessary to use a backup form of contraception such as spermicide or condoms for the first week of patch wear. If the user is late placing her patch in the first week, or more than two days late placing the patch in the second and third weeks, they should apply the patch immediately, and then use a backup form of barrier protection for a week. == Mechanism of action == Like all combined hormonal contraceptives, Ortho Evra / Evra works primarily by preventing ovulation. A secondary mechanism of action is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the cervical mucus. Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the endometrium that theoretically could affect implantation; however, no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use. The 20 cm2 Ortho Evra contraceptive patch contains 750 μg ethinylestradiol (an estrogen) and 6000 μg norelgestromin (a progestin). The 20 cm2 Evra contraceptive patch contains 600 μg ethinylestradiol and 6000 μg norelgestromin. The Ortho Evra contraceptive patch and the Evra contraceptive patch are both intended to gradually release into the systemic circulation approximately 20 μg/day of ethinylestradiol and 150 μg/day of norelgestromin. == Lawsuits == The patch has been associated with strokes and thrombosis and the mechanism for hormone absorption and dissipation from the body's tissues is different from ""the pill"". Several lawsuits have been instigated over these issues. A lawsuit filed in Federal Court in New Jersey on September 2, 2005, by a Georgia woman who had a pulmonary embolism alleges the company promoted the patch despite knowledge of its health risks, for financial gain, while failing to warn of the risks of blood clots and other injuries. The parents of a 14-year-old girl from Wisconsin have filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson because they claim that she died from a blood clot that arose from her use of the patch. == References ==",Ortho evra,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0490362910786644e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005595310358330607)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/ortho_evra.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Ortho Evra Patch: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/ortho_evra.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1951,"('Pirfenidone', 'Esbriet', 'Deskar', 'Pirespa', 'Pirfenidonum')",Medical,"Pirfenidone, sold under the brand name Pirespa among others, is a medication used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It works by reducing lung fibrosis through downregulation of the production of growth factors and procollagens I and II. It was first approved in Japan for the treatment of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after clinical trials in 2008. It was approved for use in the European Union in 2011, in Canada in 2012, and in the United States in October 2014. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == In the European Union, pirfenidone is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2011. In October 2008, it was approved for use in Japan, in India in 2010, and in China in 2011 (commercial launch in 2014). In October 2014, it was approved for medical use in the United States. A tablet version was approved for use in the United States in January 2017. In Mexico it was approved as a gel for the treatment of scars and fibrotic tissue. == Adverse effects == === Gastrointestinal === Pirfenidone is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as dyspepsia, nausea, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease and vomiting. To reduce the severity of these reactions, pirfenidone is to be taken after meals. === Skin === Pirfenidone is known to cause photosensitivity reactions, rash, pruritus and dry skin. Patients are usually advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, including sun lamps, and to use protective clothing and sunscreening agents. Continuing photosensitivity reactions are usually managed by dose adjustment and temporary discontinuation of treatment if required, along with local symptomatic treatment. === Hepatic dysfunction === Pirfenidone can increase hepatic enzyme levels, especially those of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; periodic monitoring of hepatic enzyme levels is required during therapy: once before the initiation of therapy, monthly monitoring until 6 months after initiation of therapy, and 3 monthly thereafter. Extra precaution is required while prescribing the drug in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are concomitantly taking a CYP1A2 inhibitor. The drug is contraindicated in patients who have severe hepatic impairment. === Dizziness and fatigue === Dizziness and fatigue have been reported in patients undergoing pirfenidone treatment. Dizziness typically resolves, although patients should know how they react to pirfenidone before undertaking activities that need mental alertness or coordination. If severe, dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation may be required. === Weight loss === Weight loss has been reported in patients treated with pirfenidone. Doctors should monitor patients’ weight and encourage increased caloric intake if necessary. == Interactions == Most drug interactions are mediated by various cytochrome P450 enzymes. === CYP1A2 inhibitors === Since Pirfenidone is metabolised through the CYP1A2 enzyme pathway, any drug which inhibits this enzyme is likely to precipitate the toxicity of pirfenidone: concomitant therapy is to be avoided. Fluvoxamine is contraindicated in patients who are on treatment with pirfenidone. Other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as ciprofloxacin, amiodarone and propafenone should be used with caution. === Other CYP inhibitors === Some pirfenidone is also metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes other than CYP1A2. Consequently, strong inhibitors of other cytochrome P450 enzymes such as fluconazole (CYP2C9), chloramphenicol (CYP2C19), fluoxetine and paroxetine (both CYP2D6) should be used with caution. === CYP1A2 inducers === Moderate inducers of CYP1A2 such as omeprazole should be used with caution since they might reduce the circulating plasma levels of the drug. === Cigarette smoking === Cigarette smoking causes increased clearance of pirfenidone by inducing CYP1A2, thereby decreasing exposure to the drug. Patients must be advised to abstain from cigarette smoking while on therapy with pirfenidone. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Pirfenidone has well-established antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in various in vitro systems and animal models of fibrosis. A number of cell-based studies have shown that pirfenidone reduces fibroblast proliferation, inhibits transforming growth factor beta stimulated collagen production and reduces the production of fibrogenic mediators such as transforming growth factor beta. Pirfenidone has also been shown to reduce production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-1β in both cultured cells and isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These activities are consistent with the broader antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities observed in animal models of fibrosis. === Pharmacokinetics === Pirfenidone is administered orally. Though the presence of food significantly reduces the extent of absorption, the drug is to be taken after food, to reduce the nausea and dizziness associated with the drug. The drug is around 60% bound to plasma proteins, especially to albumin. Up to 50% of the drug is metabolized by hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme system to yield 5-carboxypirfenidone, the inactive metabolite. Almost 80% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours of intake. == History == The drug was developed by several companies worldwide, including the original patent holder, Marnac, InterMune (now part of Roche), Shionogi, and GNI Group. In August 2023, Roche subsidiary Genentech sued Novartis in a New Jersey court. The lawsuit asserts that Novartis subsidiary Sandoz did not apply for a license when it began to sell pirfenidone in the U.S. market. Esbriet had a revenue of $740 million in the U.S. market (2021), and Genentech alleges that Sandoz's unlawful sale of pirfenidone has caused ""significant financial harm."" === Preclinical studies in models of fibrosis === In animal models, pirfenidone displays a systemic antifibrotic activity and has been shown to reduce biochemical and histopathological indices of fibrosis of the lung, liver, heart and kidney. Pirfenidone demonstrates a consistent antifibrotic effect in several animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. Of these, the bleomycin model is the most widely used model of pulmonary fibrosis. In this model, bleomycin administration results in oxidative stress and acute inflammation, with the subsequent onset of pulmonary fibrosis in a number of animal species including the mouse and hamster. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pirfenidone attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. One study investigated the effect of pirfenidone over a 42-day period after repeated bleomycin administration. Administration of pirfenidone minimised early lung oedema and pulmonary fibrosis when treatment was initiated concurrently with lung damage. This study evaluated pulmonary protein expression and found pirfenidone treatment normalised expression of proinflammatory and fibrogenic proteins. Similar reductions in pulmonary fibrosis were observed when pirfenidone treatment was delayed until pulmonary fibrosis was established and progressing, i.e. when administered in a therapeutic as opposed to a prophylactic treatment regimen. The antifibrotic effect of pirfenidone has been further established in animal models of cardiac (heart), renal (kidney), and hepatic (liver) fibrosis, as well as in Dupuytren's contracture. In these models, pirfenidone demonstrated a consistent ability to reduce fibrosis and the expression of fibrogenic mediators. Pirfenidone has also been shown to inhibit spondyloarthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes and osteoblasts in vitro. === Clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis === The clinical efficacy of pirfenidone has been studied in three Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The first Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was conducted in Japan. This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, trial, in which 275 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to receive pirfenidone 1800 mg/day (110 patients), pirfenidone 1200 mg/day (56 patients), or placebo (109 patients), for 52 weeks. Pirfenidone 1800 or 1200 mg/day reduced the mean decline in vital capacity from baseline to week 52 compared with placebo. Progression-free survival was also improved with pirfenidone compared with placebo. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III studies in eleven countries across Europe, North America, and Australia. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were randomly assigned to treatment with oral pirfenidone or placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks. In study 004, pirfenidone reduced decline in forced vital capacity. Mean change in FVC at week 72 was –8.0% in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and –12.4% in the placebo group, a difference of 4.4%. Thirty-five (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients, respectively, had a decline in forced vital capacity of at least 10%. In study 006, the difference between groups in forced vital capaticy change at week 72 was not statistically significant. Mean change in forced vital capacity FVC at week 72 was –9.0% in the pirfenidone group and –9.6% in the placebo group. The difference between groups in change in predicted forced vital capacity at week 72 was not significant. In May 2014, the results of another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 555 patients were published. They confirmed observations from previous clinical studies that pirfenidone significantly reduced the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as measured by change in percent predicted forced vital capacity from baseline to week 52. In addition, significant treatment effects were shown on both of the key secondary endpoints of six-minute walk test distance change and progression-free survival. A pre-specified analysis of the pooled population of 1,247 subjects from three studies showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 48% in the pirfenidone group compared to the placebo group. A review by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that pirfenidone appears to improve progression-free survival and, to a lesser effect, pulmonary function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Randomised studies comparing non-steroid drugs with placebo or steroids in adult patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were included. Four placebo-controlled trials of pirfenidone treatment were reviewed, involving a total of 1155 patients. The result of the meta-analysis showed that pirfenidone significantly reduces the risk of disease progression by 30%. In addition, meta-analysis of the two Japanese studies confirmed the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on the change in vital capacity from baseline compared with placebo. === Regulatory progress === In May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve the use of pirfenidone for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, requesting additional clinical trials. In December 2010, an advisory panel to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended approval of the drug. In February 2011, the European Commission granted marketing authorisation in all 27 EU member states and the China Food and Drug Administration granted approval in September 2011. Afterwards, a randomised, Phase III trial was completed in the U.S. in 2014, with regulatory approval in U.S. following shortly after. In October 2010, the Indian Company Cipla launched the drug as Pirfenex, and MSN laboratories launched it as Pulmofib. It was approved for use in the European Union in 2011, under the brand name Esbriet; it was approved in Canada in 2012 under the same name; and was approved in the United States in October 2014, also as Esbriet. In September 2011, the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration provided GNI Group Ltd with new drug approval of pirfenidone in China, and later manufacture approval in 2013, under the brand name of Etuary. In 2014, it was approved in Mexico under the name KitosCell LP, indicated for pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis. In Mexico it has also been approved in gel for the treatment of chronic wounds and skin injuries and the oral form it is approved for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis. == Research == Other research shows that pirfenidone may be an effective anti-fibrotic treatment for chronic liver fibrosis. == See also == Nintedanib == References ==",Pirespa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.059865078597795e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004338276921771467)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pulmonaryfibrosis.org](https://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/patients-caregivers/medical-and-support-resources/clinical-trials-education-center/pipeline/drug/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/pirfenidone-%28esbriet-pirfenex-pirespa-%29?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=258, start_index=9, title='Pirfenidone (Esbriet®, Pirfenex®, Pirespa®) | Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/patients-caregivers/medical-and-support-resources/clinical-trials-education-center/pipeline/drug/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis/pirfenidone-%28esbriet-pirfenex-pirespa-%29?utm_source=openai')])"

It is an adjunct in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Both oral and intravenous forms of metoprolol are available for administration. The different salt versions of metoprolol – metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate – are approved for different conditions and are not interchangeable. Off-label uses include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects, especially with higher doses, include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea, unusual dreams, trouble sleeping, depression, and vision problems such as blurred vision or dry eyes. β-blockers, including metoprolol, reduce salivary flow via inhibition of the direct sympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. Metoprolol may also cause the hands and feet to feel cold. Due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia, vivid dreams and nightmares. Patients should be cautious while driving or operating machinery due to its potential to cause decreased alertness. There may also be an impact on blood sugar levels, and it can potentially mask signs of low blood sugar. The safety of metoprolol during pregnancy is not fully established. === Precautions === Metoprolol reduces long-term mortality and hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. A meta-analysis further supports reduced incidence of heart failure worsening in patients treated with beta-blockers compared to placebo. However, in some circumstances, particularly when initiating metoprolol in patients with more symptomatic disease, an increased prevalence of hospitalisation and mortality has been reported within the first two months of starting. Patients should monitor for swelling of extremities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A Cochrane Review concluded that although metoprolol reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence, it is unclear whether the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. This medicine may cause changes in blood sugar levels or cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. It also may cause some people to become less alert than they are normally, making it dangerous for them to drive or use machines. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Risk for the fetus has not been ruled out, per being rated pregnancy category C in Australia, meaning that it may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus (but no malformations). It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. == Overdose == Excessive doses of metoprolol can cause bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest. Blood or plasma concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of overdose or poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 200 μg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 1–20 mg/L in overdose victims. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Metoprolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Metoprolol exerts its effects by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters, specifically adrenaline and noradrenaline. It does this by selectively binding to and antagonizing β1 adrenergic receptors in the body. When adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are released from nerve endings or secreted by the adrenal glands, they bind to β1 adrenergic receptors found primarily in cardiac tissues such as the heart. This binding activates these receptors, leading to various physiological responses, including an increase in heart rate, force of contraction (inotropic effect), conduction speed through electrical pathways in the heart, and release of renin from the kidneys. Metoprolol competes with adrenaline and noradrenaline for binding sites on these β1 receptors. By occupying these receptor sites without activating them, metoprolol blocks or inhibits their activation by endogenous catecholamines like adrenaline or noradrenaline. Metoprolol blocks β1-adrenergic receptors in heart muscle cells, thereby decreasing the slope of phase 4 in the nodal action potential (reducing Na+ uptake) and prolonging repolarization of phase 3 (slowing down K+ release). It also suppresses the norepinephrine-induced increase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and the spontaneous SR Ca2+ release, which are the major triggers for atrial fibrillation. Through this mechanism of selective blockade at β1 receptors, metoprolol exerts the following effects: Heart rate reduction, i.e., decrease of the resting heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reduction of excessive elevations resulting from exercise or stress. Reduction of the force of contraction, i.e., decrease in contractility (negative inotropic effect), which lessens how hard each heartbeat contracts. Decrease in cardiac output, i.e., decrease in both heart rate and contractility within myocardium cells, where β1 is predominantly located, overall blood output per minute lowers called cardiac output/dysfunction, allowing decreased demands placed onto impaired hearts, reducing oxygen demand-supply mismatch. Lowering of blood pressure. Antiarrhythmic effects, such as supraventricular tachycardia prevention. Metoprolol also prevents electrical wave propagation. === Pharmacokinetics === Metoprolol is mostly absorbed from the intestine with an absorption fraction of 0.95. The systemic bioavailability after oral administration is approximately 50%. Less than 5% of an orally administered dose of metoprolol is excreted unchanged in urine; most of it is eliminated in metabolized form through feces via bile secretion into the intestines. Metoprolol undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, mainly α-hydroxylation and O-demethylation through various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 (primary), CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. The primary metabolites formed are α-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol. Metoprolol is classified as a moderately lipophilic beta blocker. More lipophilic beta blockers tend to cross the blood–brain barrier more readily, with greater potential for effects in the central nervous system as well as associated neuropsychiatric side effects. Metoprolol binds mainly to human serum albumin with an unbound fraction of 0.88. It has a large volume of distribution at steady state (3.2 L/kg), indicating extensive distribution throughout the body. == Chemistry == Metoprolol was synthesized and its activity discovered in 1969. The specific agent in on-market formulations of metoprolol is either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, where tartrate is an immediate-release formulation and the succinate is an extended-release formulation (with 100 mg metoprolol tartrate corresponding to 95 mg metoprolol succinate). === Stereochemistry === Metoprolol contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, i.e. a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and the (S)-form: == Society and culture == === Legal status === Metoprolol was approved for medical use in the United States in August 1978. === Economics === In the 2000s, a lawsuit was brought against the manufacturers of Toprol XL (a time-release formula version of metoprolol) and its generic equivalent (metoprolol succinate) claiming that to increase profits, lower cost generic versions of Toprol XL were intentionally kept off the market. It alleged that the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca LP, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and Aktiebolaget Hassle violated antitrust and consumer protection law. In a settlement by the companies in 2012, without admission to the claims, they agreed to a settlement pay-out of US$ 11 million. === Sport === Because beta blockers can be used to reduce heart rate and minimize tremors, which can enhance performance in sports such as archery, metoprolol is banned by the world anti-doping agency in some sports. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017).

It is a Janus kinase inhibitor and it was developed by Pfizer. It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), headache, acne, herpes simplex (viral infection of the mouth or the genitals), increased levels of creatine phosphokinase in the blood (an enzyme released into the blood when muscle is damaged), vomiting, dizziness and pain in the upper belly. Abrocitinib was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2021, and in the United States in January 2022. == Medical uses == In the EU, abrocitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. In the US, abrocitinib is indicated for the treatment of people twelve years of age and older with refractory, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. === Efficacy of abrocitinib in treating atopic dermatitis === According to the latest meta-analysis in 2023, abrocitinib is both efficient and safe in treating moderate-to-severe AD in adolescents and adults. It also relieves itching rapidly and alleviates symptoms of AD. Abrocitinib gives significantly better results than the placebo at both 100 mg and 200 mg. The severity of AD is quantified through Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), which is based on the severity of lesion clinical signs. Abrocitinib was more effective than placebo in terms of EASI-reduction, but it also decreased other symptoms. The improvement of depression and anxiety was better in the experimental group than that in the control group. In another meta-analysis including 2256 patients from three different studies have shown that abrocitinib improved the EASI scores in comparison with dupilumab, even in the second week of treatment. A faster onset of Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response at the second week was also achieved by administering abrocitinib and early relief of itching occurred at 2 weeks. In other studies, abrocitinib (200 mg dose) achieved rapid relief from itching after four days of treatment compared with dupilumab and placebo in AD patients. == Side effects == The most common adverse effects in studies were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. The most common side effects in clinical trials were nasopharyngitis, nausea, headaches, herpes simplex (including oral herpes, ophthalmic herpes, herpes dermatitis and genital herpes), and increase in blood creatine phosphokinase. Abrocitinib can cause serious infections, malignancy, major cardiac events, thrombosis and other laboratory abnormalities including thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and lipid elevations. However, according to clinical data, Abrocitinib is well tolerated. The total adverse reactions were not statistically different between the placebo and the dose of 100 mg of abrocitinib. However, it was slightly higher for the dose of 200 mg of abrocitinib. Symptoms such as acne, headache, and nausea, appeared in the first two weeks of starting abrocitinib, and it was not necessary to interrupt the treatment. In general, the AE frequency of abrocitinib was the same or a little bit higher than in case of placebo or dupilumab. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === It is a selective inhibitor of the enzyme janus kinase 1 (JAK1). It inhibits JAK1 by 28 fold of selectivity over JAK2 and more than 340 fold of selectivity over JAK3. Two mechanisms are involved in atopic dermatitis, one involves epidermal barrier disruptions, and the other one is cutaneous inflammation due to the immune system over response. Acute inflammation in AD typically involves IL-13, IL-4, and IL-33. Consequently, inhibiting JAK1 results in suppressing the signaling cytokines IL-4, IL-3, and IL-31. Many other cytokines are involved in AD and mediated by JAK1 such as type II cytokine receptors for IL-22, IL-19, IL-10, IL-20 and glycoprotein 130 (gp130) including IL-6 and IL-12 which are also associated with JAK2 and TYK2; IFN-α and INF-β signal. === Pharmacokinetics === Abrocitinib is quickly absorbed from the gut and generally reaches highest blood plasma concentrations within one hour. Only 1.0 to 4.4% of the dose are found unmetabolized in the urine. The half-life of abrocitinib is 5 hours and the absorption is not affected by food. A higher dose (400–800 mg) would delay the absorption to 1.5–4 hours. A steady plasma concentration of abrocitinib can be obtained within 48 hours of treatments. The dose is one daily, and abrocitinib is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) in liver such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. The major metabolites of abrocitinib are pyrrolidinone pyrimidine (inactive), 2-hydroxypropyl (active), and 3-hydroxypropyl (active). Dose reduction to half is advisable when abrocitinib is taken with strong inhibitors of CYP2C19. According to phase 1 clinical trials on abrocitinib oral dose of 200 mg, hepatic functions were not altered. However, it is advisable to reduce the dose by half in case of reduced renal function. In serious hepatic impairment and final stages of renal disease, Abrocitinib is contraindicated. Some changes may occur during the abrocitinib treatment such as the reduction in platelet counts after 4 weeks of starting Abrocitinib. However, they will return to normal at the end of the treatment. An increase in LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels was also recorded after 4 weeks of Abrocitinib treatment. The increased levels depend on the abrocitinib dose (15% increase in LDL with 200 mg dose versus 10% increase with 100 mg). == History == April 2016: initiation of Phase 2b trial December 2017: initiation of JADE Mono-1 Phase 3 trial May 2018: Results of Phase 2b trial posted October 2019: Results of Phase 3 trial presented June 2020: Results of second Phase 3 trial published The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved abrocitinib based on evidence from three controlled clinical trials enrolling a total of 1615 participants supporting efficacy and safety. Two of the trials enrolled participants twelve years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and one trial enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The trials were conducted at multiple sites in 18 countries (i.e., United States, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Chile, Great Britain, Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Latvia, Slovakia, Spain, Italy, Japan, Korea, Taiwan). In addition, safety analyses were performed on the combined results of these 3 controlled clinical trials and one additional controlled study in a total of 1,540 participants. All three trials evaluated two doses of abrocitinib: 100 mg and 200 mg. The monotherapy trials were identically designed, 16-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 3 trials. Trial-AD-3 with concomitant background therapy was a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator (dupilumab) and placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. In this trial, at Week 16, subjects previously receiving placebo were re-randomized to receive abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg, subjects previously receiving abrocitinib continued on their respective dose and subjects previously receiving dupilumab continued to take placebo. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In October 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Cibinqo, intended for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Pfizer Europe MA EEIG. In December 2021, the European Commission approved abrocitinib for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In January 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved abrocitinib for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. == Other therapeutic effects of abrocitinib == === In pediatric peanut allergy === Abrocitinib has the ability to decrease T-cell activation and the allergen-specific basophil in the case of peanut allergy. Subsequently, the in vitro allergic responses of peanut allergy are reduced. Abrocitinib may play the role of an immune modulator in oral immunotherapy of peanut or may be administered alone as monotherapy in cases of allergy to certain food. === Therapy of oral lichen planus === Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory T- cellular disorder that strikes the oral mucosa. In a clinical report in 2022, a fast resolving of OLP was achieved in a patient treated with Abrocitinib. A dose of 200 mg of Abrocitinib was administered daily as monotherapy for twelve weeks. A constant improvement of lesions, a depletion of Wickham striae, and a disappearance of erosions were observed at weeks four and eight of treatment. At week twelve, there was a total recovery of the right buccal mucosa. No adverse events have occurred during the treatment and Abrocitinib was well tolerated by the patient. === Improving the lesions of extensive necrobiosis lipoidica === Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is chronic granulomatous disease of the skin. It involves shiny patches or plaques with a sclerotic center and inflammatory edge. It may appear on different parts of the body and specially, the front part of the legs. The atrophic scars remain after healing which can be inconvenient for patients. Nevertheless, new lesions may occur. Systemic therapy with abrocitinib was administered at 200 mg/day for 12 weeks and then reduced to 100 mg. A slight stomach ache accompanies the 200 mg dose and no adverse events occurred with the 100 mg dose. An improvement with the old lesions was obvious and no new lesions were observed. The inflammatory edges decreased and the lesions disappeared. Thus, abrocitinib is linked to improving the life quality of the patient. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT03349060 for ""Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years And Older With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (JADE Mono-1)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03575871 for ""Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 in Subjects Aged 12 Years And Older With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (JADE Mono-2)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03720470 for ""Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of PF-04965842 and Dupilumab in Adult Subjects With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis on Background Topical Therapy (JADE Compare)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Cibinqo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.158996332786046e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010287232726113871)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrocitinib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Abrocitinib', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrocitinib?utm_source=openai')])"

1958,"('Piperacillin (sodium)', 'Sodium piperacillin', 'Piperacillin', 'Pipracil', 'Piperacillin anhydrous')",Medical,"Piperacillin is a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic of the ureidopenicillin class. The chemical structure of piperacillin and other ureidopenicillins incorporates a polar side chain that enhances penetration into Gram-negative bacteria and reduces susceptibility to cleavage by Gram-negative beta lactamase enzymes. These properties confer activity against the important hospital pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus piperacillin is sometimes referred to as an ""anti-pseudomonal penicillin"". When used alone, piperacillin lacks strong activity against the Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, as the beta-lactam ring is hydrolyzed by the bacteria's beta-lactamase. It was patented in 1974 and approved for medical use in 1981. Piperacillin is most commonly used in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (piperacillin/tazobactam), which enhances piperacillin's effectiveness by inhibiting many beta lactamases to which it is susceptible. However, the co-administration of tazobactam does not confer activity against MRSA, as penicillin (and most other beta lactams) do not avidly bind to the penicillin-binding proteins of this pathogen. The World Health Organization classifies piperacillin as critically important for human medicine. == Medical uses == Piperacillin is used almost exclusively in combination with the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam for the treatment of serious, hospital-acquired infections. This combination is among the most widely used drug therapies in United States non-federal hospitals, accounting for $388M in spending in spite of being a low-cost generic drug. Piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended as part of a three-drug regimen for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia suspected as being due to infection by multi-drug resistant pathogens. It is also one of several antibacterial drugs recommended for the treatment of infections known to be caused by anaerobic Gram-negative rods. Piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as initial empiric treatment for people with suspected neutropenic sepsis. Piperacillin is used to treat patients diagnosed with various internal infections such as abdominal, bacteremia, gynecological, respiratory, and urinary, mainly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other infectious bacteria. They are primarily used in current and former neutropenic patients, and patients with biliary tract infections. Other uses include applications in surgical infection prophylaxis; in biliary surgery, a single dose of piperacillin is administered intravenously to inhibit the development of acute cholangitis and prevent wound infections. The combination of piperacillin and an aminoglycoside is commonly used to treat severe infections, but due to the incompatibilities in drug interaction, they are administered separately. === Pneumonia === The piperacillin-tazobactam (piptaz) antibiotic commonly used with an aminoglycoside retains similar levels of drug safety and efficacy as other antibiotic combinations such as ceftazidime with the aminoglycoside tobramycin in the treatment of patients with hospital acquired pneumonia. In a clinical comparison primarily targeting patients not initially placed in intensive care units, piperacillin-tazobactam was found to produce higher clinical and microbiological rates of success. By contrast, the drug efficacy of ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in similar response rates (61.5% and 63.9 respectively) when tobramycin was added into both groups. Identical evaluations are shown when compared to the imipenem and tobramycin combination, where the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam on patients (especially those under mechanical ventilation) was only consisted of a slightly higher response rate. == Administration == Piperacillin is not absorbed orally, and must therefore be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. It has been shown that the bactericidal actions of the drug do not increase with concentrations of piperacillin higher than 4-6× MIC, which means that the drug is concentration-independent in terms of its actions. Piperacillin has instead shown to offer higher bactericidal activity when its concentration remains above the MIC for longer periods of time (50% time above MIC showing the highest activity). This higher activity present in continuous dosing has not been directly linked to clinical outcomes, but however does show promise of lowering possibility of resistance and decreasing mortality. Extending the time of piperacillin-tazobactam infusion allows the drugs to maintain the necessary concentrations needed within the body to prevent bacterial growth, enhancing bactericidal activity. The studies supporting this theory generally administered ~3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam every 8 hours during a 4-hour infusion, while for organisms with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations, ~4.5 g of piperacillin-tazobactam was administered every 6 hours during a 3-hour infusion. The recommended doses provided by the BNFC for infants with hospital-acquired infections are 90 mg/kg every 8 hours for infants, a maximum of 4.5 g every 6 hours for children, and 4.5 g every 8 hours for children aged 12 and above. A dosage of 90 mg/kg every 6 hours is suggested for infants and children diagnosed with neutropenia. == Adverse effects == Common side effects associated with the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam include: Gastrointestinal: constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting Dermatologic: erythema, pain, phlebitis, rash Neurologic: headaches, insomnia Prolonged periods of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy have been associated with the potential development of hematologic adversities such as leukopenia (16.3%), neutropenia (10%), and eosinophilia (10%) in adult patients. The combination of piperacillin-tazobactam with other antibiotics was found to be a major risk factor for leukopenia as well. Additionally, the chances of developing these illnesses increases in younger patients with fewer conditions, prolonging their time to recover. Other cases of adverse effects include instances of renal dysfunction, hepatitis, hyperactivity, anemia, abnormalities in coagulation, and hypokalemia. Allergic reactions can be induced from the side chains of β-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, or antibodies surrounding the nucleus of penicillin. == Interactions == The combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, commonly branded as Zosyn, improves their overall bactericidal activity as amino-benzylpenicillins and ureidopencillins work synergistically with β-lactamase inhibitors. Concurrent use or unregulated dosages of piperacillin results in increasing levels of piperacillin within the body, prolonging neuromuscular transmission blockages created by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, and disruptions in urine tests for glucose. Some compounds that may interfere with the bactericidal activity of piperacillin include chloramphenicol, macrolides, and sulfonamides. Following two studies conducted in 1986 and 2006, piperacillin was found to inhibit the removal of methotrexate in animal kidneys. Furthermore, in the presence of piperacillin-tazobactam, the decay time for methotrexate triples in comparison to the normal half-life, leaving the patient exposed to cytotoxic effects produced by the chemical agent. While penicillin antibiotics generally work synergistically with aminoglycosides by enhancing their penetration of bacterial membranes, they can also work adversely by inactivating them. A reformulation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam has produced results showing an increase in their affinity with amikacin and gentamicin in vitro, enabling the process of simultaneous Y-site infusion to occur. However, tobramycin was found to be incompatible as a combination through Y-site infusion. == Pharmacology == Piperacillin irreversibly binds to the enzyme penicillin-binding proteins, inhibiting the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. === Mechanism of action === As a β-lactam antibiotic, piperacillin inhibits penicillin-binding proteins, preventing the spread of bacteria and infections. Responsible for catalyzing the cross-linkage between peptidoglycan strands that protect the bacterial cell from osmotic rupture, penicillin-binding proteins are unique to bacterial organisms, where every known bacteria with a peptidoglycan cell wall consists of homologous sub-families. By sharing a similar stereochemistry with the substrates that bind to penicillin-binding proteins, piperacillin is able to bind to serine residues found at the active site of the enzyme through the formation of a covalent complex, preventing other substrates from binding. Moreover, this leads to the release of autolysins that break down the bacteria's cell wall. Some β-lactamase enzymes also consist of residue at their active site, enabling them to hydrolyze the β-lactam ring found within these antibiotics. However, this hydrolytic activity is inhibited when piperacillin works in conjunction with tazobactam. Tazobactam binds to these enzymes to form a stable acyl-enzyme complex; similar to one formed during the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring. Thus, protecting piperacillin from hydrolysis. The inclusion of a β-lactamase inhibitor does not always increase drug efficacy. Some bacteria may produce certain types of β-lactamase such as AmpC, which are intrinsically resistant to tazobactam. === Mechanisms of resistance === A major mechanism of resistance against piperacillin-tazobactam is Gram-negative bacteria producing β-lactamases. Other currently known mechanisms include mutations in the active site of penicillin-binding proteins, changes in membrane efflux, or bacteria permeability. Some enzymes, such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) have evolved from narrow-spectrum β-lactamases due to genetic mutations, increasing their capabilities to hydrolyze much broader spectrum penicillin. Due to prior conflicting reports on the drug's affinity with ESBL-producing bacteria, piperacillin-tazobactam treatment for such is not recommended. Antibiotic resistance occurs sporadically, conferred by the continuous use of piperacillin-tazobactam in situations where it may prove to be ineffective, leading to cases where plasmid-mediated β-lactamases are being produced in bacteria that do not naturally produce it. Some Gram-positive bacteria penicillin-binding proteins such as Enterococcus faecium (PBP-5) or Staphylococcus aureus (PBP-2a) are intrinsically antibiotic resistant, consisting of relatively low affinity with piperacillin and therefore high resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam. Furthermore, mutations in penicillin-binding proteins cause fluctuations in piperacillin affinity, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae (PBP-2b) autolytic response is significantly reduced due to decreased affinity with piperacillin. Although membrane permeability changes are less common as a mechanism of resistance, studies investigating Klebsiella pneumoniae have reported a correlation between decreased permeability of piperacillin and increased SHV-1 β-lactamase production. === Pharmacokinetics === Piperacillin is generally available in their stable form as crystallized potassium or sodium salt, quickly losing bactericidal activity upon dissolution due to their short half-lives. As the gastrointestinal tract does not absorb piperacillin and tazobactam, they are dissolved in a solution before being administered to a patient, through parenteral means. Excreted through renal mechanisms like glomerular or tubular filtration as a component of urine, uncontrolled dosages of the drug can cause renal dysfunction and competitive inhibition of excretion, delaying piperacillin-tazobactam excretion, and endangering patients to drug exposure. Although the distribution of the drug remained the same, the half-life for elimination increased by three to five folds for patients diagnosed with renal dysfunction. Measured by creatinine clearance (CrCl), patients with less than 30 mL/min of clearance had significantly reduced levels of piperacillin/tazobactam excretion, measuring down to 35% of the initial dosage, while the area under the curve (AUC) for piperacillin increased by about three folds for those with less than 20 mL/min. A reduced dosage or alteration in the interval of administration is recommended for patients lying under 40 mL/min of CrCl, depending on the severity of dysfunction. Renal is the main pathway for drug elimination for both tazobactam and piperacillin in the body. While there are other non-renal means of drug elimination like hepatobiliary excretion, they occur less frequently. A substantial amount (~80%) of piperacillin found in urine when excreted through glomerular and tubular filtration is unmetabolized. Tazobactam renal elimination may be significantly reduced through piperacillin interaction, dropping from 63.7% to 56.8% of the administered dose over a 24-hour period. Piperacillin may be actively diffused through filtration into the biliary tract during renal clearing, indicated by a generally higher concentration of piperacillin than tazobactam in the bile. The metabolites that make up the remaining percentage in the excreted urine are composed of M1 (inactive) and N-desethyl-piperacillin (active), formed from the division of β-lactam rings of both tazobactam and piperacillin respectively. Due to the hydrophilic nature of piperacillin-tazobactam, a volume distribution of ~15 L amounting to various sites (tissues) is desired, as hydrophilic compounds are not able to pass through plasma membranes as easily as hydrophobic compounds. Concentrations often in the range of 90 MIC or above are located in specific areas including the gallbladder, lung, muscle, and skin, making up 16–85% of the plasma concentrations. The concentration of piperacillin-tazobactam is especially lower in fatty tissue, making up less than 10% of the plasma concentrations. === Pharmacodynamics === Compared to concentration dependent bactericidal antibiotics like aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, the antibacterial activity of β-lactam antibiotics are generally more time dependent. Unlike the former, when piperacillin-tazobactam concentrations exceed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a pathogen by five folds, the exponential relationship between concentration and activity begins to level off. Otherwise, piperacillin-tazobactam bactericidal efficacy is shown to consist of a strong association with the duration of time the concentration exceeds minimum inhibitory concentrations (T>MIC). When the T>MIC in the serum equates to 60–70% of the frequency for drug administration (dosing interval), maximal activity is achieved against Gram-negative bacteria, while for Gram-positive bacteria it occurs at around 40–50%. Within a 24-hour period in one clinical study, a T>MIC surpassing 60% was found for piperacillin-susceptible bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in two dosing regimes (4.5 g every 8 hours and 3.375 g every 8 hours). The evidence for this was obtained through Monte Carlo experiments procured by a special program (OPTAMA), where for several different scenarios (e.g. hospital acquired infections, secondary peritonitis, skin or soft tissue infections), the probability of attaining those figures were in the ranges of 85–95% and 90–89% respectively for the two regimes. In addition, two similar dosing regimes (3.375 g and 4.5 g every 6 hours) both had lower chances of reaching the 90% T>MIC threshold compared to the 50% threshold against hospital acquired pneumonia pathogens. The optimization of piperacillin-tazobactam drug efficiency has been covered by various studies, limiting the focus down to two types of infusions; continuous and intermittent. A comparison using the two administration methods under the same dosage regime of 13.5 g per day highlighted no major differences when treating complex intra-abdominal infections. Furthermore, a follow-up analysis of this trial deduced that both methods of administration lead to higher concentrations compared to the MIC of the pathogens that were used. Similar results are found in a study where a select number of β-lactam susceptible pathogens consisting of Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii were used to test a ~10 g every 24 hour dosing interval for continuous infusion. Organisms with a piperacillin-tazobactam MIC values equal to 32 or less than 16 μg/mL lead to 50% T>MIC when extended-interval intermittent administrations under two different dosing intervals (8.1 g and 6.75 g every 12 hours) were used against them. The pharmacodynamic target attainments corresponding to pathogens with MIC values of 16 μg/mL are found to reach 92% when a more traditional 4 hour dosing regime is utilized to administer at irregular intervals. One study using the Monte Carlo simulation produced contradicting results to the previous studies, deducing that inadequate pharmacodynamic targets were achieved (T>MIC > 50%) for similar ESBL-producing bacteria, applying to both continuous and high dosage intermittent infusion. == Chemistry == Derived from “the addition of a hydrophilic heterocyclic group to the α-amino group of ampicillin”, the structure consists of a thiazolidine ring conjoined to a β-lactam ring contained within several ring compounds. The addition of this substituent increases the compound's affinity to penicillin-binding protein PBP-3, improving activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and thus broadening its spectrum of activity. Susceptible β-lactamase producing bacteria such as Staphylococcus spp. or Haemophilus influenzae, the combination of tazobactam (which shares a similar structure to sulbactam, another β-lactamase inhibitor), and piperacillin significantly improves the stability of the drug against β-lactamases. == References ==",Pipracil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.606540359323844e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009201106731779873)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/ingredient/piperacillin.html,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/piperacillin,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00319 ', [])"
1959,"('Cyclic amp', 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', ""Adenosine cyclic 3', 5'-monophosphate"", 'Camp', ""Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"")","Endogenous, Medical","Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP, or 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger, or cellular signal occurring within cells, that is important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway. == History == Earl Sutherland of Vanderbilt University won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971 ""for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones"", especially epinephrine, via second messengers (such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic AMP). == Synthesis == The synthesis of cAMP is stimulated by trophic hormones that bind to receptors on the cell surface. cAMP levels reach maximal levels within minutes and decrease gradually over an hour in cultured cells. Cyclic AMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase located on the inner side of the plasma membrane and anchored at various locations in the interior of the cell. Adenylate cyclase is activated by a range of signaling molecules through the activation of adenylate cyclase stimulatory G (Gs)-protein-coupled receptors. Adenylate cyclase is inhibited by agonists of adenylate cyclase inhibitory G (Gi)-protein-coupled receptors. Liver adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to adrenaline. cAMP decomposition into AMP is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphodiesterase. == Functions == cAMP is a second messenger, used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones like glucagon and adrenaline, which cannot pass through the plasma membrane. It is also involved in the activation of protein kinases. In addition, cAMP binds to and regulates the function of ion channels such as the HCN channels and a few other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins such as Epac1 and RAPGEF2. === Role in eukaryotic cells === cAMP is associated with kinases function in several biochemical processes, including the regulation of glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism. In eukaryotes, cyclic AMP works by activating protein kinase A (PKA, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase). PKA is normally inactive as a tetrameric holoenzyme, consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory units (C2R2), with the regulatory units blocking the catalytic centers of the catalytic units. Cyclic AMP binds to specific locations on the regulatory units of the protein kinase, and causes dissociation between the regulatory and catalytic subunits, thus enabling those catalytic units to phosphorylate substrate proteins. The active subunits catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. The phosphorylated proteins may act directly on the cell's ion channels, or may become activated or inhibited enzymes. Protein kinase A can also phosphorylate specific proteins that bind to promoter regions of DNA, causing increases in transcription. Not all protein kinases respond to cAMP. Several classes of protein kinases, including protein kinase C, are not cAMP-dependent. Further effects mainly depend on cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which vary based on the type of cell. Still, there are some minor PKA-independent functions of cAMP, e.g., activation of calcium channels, providing a minor pathway by which growth hormone-releasing hormone causes a release of growth hormone. However, the view that the majority of the effects of cAMP are controlled by PKA is an outdated one. In 1998 a family of cAMP-sensitive proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity was discovered. These are termed Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac) and the family comprises Epac1 and Epac2. The mechanism of activation is similar to that of PKA: the GEF domain is usually masked by the N-terminal region containing the cAMP binding domain. When cAMP binds, the domain dissociates and exposes the now-active GEF domain, allowing Epac to activate small Ras-like GTPase proteins, such as Rap1. ==== Additional role of secreted cAMP in social amoebae ==== In the species Dictyostelium discoideum, cAMP acts outside the cell as a secreted signal. The chemotactic aggregation of cells is organized by periodic waves of cAMP that propagate between cells over distances as large as several centimetres. The waves are the result of a regulated production and secretion of extracellular cAMP and a spontaneous biological oscillator that initiates the waves at centers of territories. === Role in bacteria === In bacteria, the level of cAMP varies depending on the medium used for growth. In particular, cAMP is low when glucose is the carbon source. This occurs through inhibition of the cAMP-producing enzyme, adenylate cyclase, as a side-effect of glucose transport into the cell. The transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) also called CAP (catabolite gene activator protein) forms a complex with cAMP and thereby is activated to bind to DNA. CRP-cAMP increases expression of a large number of genes, including some encoding enzymes that can supply energy independent of glucose. cAMP, for example, is involved in the positive regulation of the lac operon. In an environment with a low glucose concentration, cAMP accumulates and binds to the allosteric site on CRP (cAMP receptor protein), a transcription activator protein. The protein assumes its active shape and binds to a specific site upstream of the lac promoter, making it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the adjacent promoter to start transcription of the lac operon, increasing the rate of lac operon transcription. With a high glucose concentration, the cAMP concentration decreases, and the CRP disengages from the lac operon. == Pathology == Since cyclic AMP is a second messenger and plays vital role in cell signalling, it has been implicated in various disorders but not restricted to the roles given below: === Role in human carcinoma === Some research has suggested that a deregulation of cAMP pathways and an aberrant activation of cAMP-controlled genes is linked to the growth of some cancers. === Role in prefrontal cortex disorders === Research suggests that cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN). HCN channels will open when exposed to cAMP. Once the HCN channel is open, the electrical activity within the neuron is disrupted and the cell becomes less responsive. This interferes with the function of the prefrontal cortex in working memory tasks. Inhibition of cAMP has been observed to improve spatial working memory. cAMP is involved in activation of trigeminocervical system leading to neurogenic inflammation and causing migraine. === Role in infectious disease agents' pathogenesis === Disrupted functioning of cAMP has been noted as one of the mechanisms of several bacterial exotoxins. They can be subgrouped into two distinct categories: Toxins that interfere with enzymes ADP-ribosyl-transferases, and invasive adenylate cyclases. ==== ADP-ribosyl-transferases related toxins ==== Cholera toxin is an AB toxin that has five B subunints and one A subunit. The toxin acts by the following mechanism: First, the B subunit ring of the cholera toxin binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of target cells. If a cell lacks GM1 the toxin most likely binds to other types of glycans, such as Lewis Y and Lewis X, attached to proteins instead of lipids. == Uses == Forskolin is commonly used as a tool in biochemistry to raise levels of cAMP in the study and research of cell physiology. == See also == Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) Acrasin specific to chemotactic use in Dictyostelium discoideum. phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) which degrades cAMP == References ==","Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate",WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0003685861302074045), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00010926496179308742), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.009745048359036446), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.3470558769768104e-05), ('OUS', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4741433262825012)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=112, start_index=12, title='Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate?utm_source=openai')])"

1964,"('Indole-3-carbinol', '(1h-indol-3-yl)methanol', 'Indinol', 'Indole 3 carbinol', '(1h-indol-3-yl)-methanol')","Food, Medical","Indole-3-carbinol (I3C, C9H9NO) is produced by the breakdown of the glucosinolate glucobrassicin, which can be found at relatively high levels in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collard greens and kale. It is also available in dietary supplements. Indole-3-carbinol is the subject of on-going biomedical research into its possible anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and anti-atherogenic effects. Research on indole-3-carbinol has been conducted primarily using laboratory animals and cultured cells. Limited and inconclusive human studies have been reported. A recent review of the biomedical research literature found that ""evidence of an inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and breast or prostate cancer in humans is limited and inconsistent"" and ""larger randomized controlled trials are needed"" to determine if supplemental indole-3-carbinol has health benefits. == Indole-3-carbinol and cancer == Investigation of mechanisms by which consumption of indole-3-carbinol might influence cancer incidence focuses on its ability to alter estrogen metabolism and other cellular effects. Controlled studies have been performed on such animals as rats, mice, and rainbow trout, introducing various controlled levels of carcinogens, and levels of indole-3-carbinol into their daily diet. Results showed dose-related decreases in tumor susceptibility due to indole-3-carbinol (inferred by decreases in aflatoxin–DNA binding). The first direct evidence of pure anti-initiating activity by a natural anticarcinogen (indole-3-carbinol) found in human diet was claimed by Dashwood et al. in 1989. Indole-3-carbinol induces a G1 growth arrest of human reproductive cancer cells. This is potentially relevant to the prevention and treatment of cancer, as the G1 phase of cell growth occurs early in the cell life cycle, and, for most cells, is the major period of cell cycle during its lifespan. The G1 phase is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required in the next (""S"") phase, including those needed for DNA replication. Overuse of indole-3-carbinol supplements in the hope of preventing cancer may be unwise, as the hormone balance should be tested (via simple blood test) before regular consumption. Such caution is advised, due to its effect on estrogen levels (estrogen has a significant impact on brain function). It promotes liver cancer in trout when it is combined with aflatoxin B1 and demotes metastasis. == Melanoma == Indole-3-carbinol causes proliferation arrest and apoptosis in human melanoma cells. Kim et al. (2011) showed that the master regulator of melanoma biology, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF-M) was downregulated by indole-3-carbinol to induce apoptosis. Kundu et al. (2017) demonstrated that the anticancer property of indole-3-carbinol is driven by specific targeting of oncogenic pathways. In two different studies using xenografted mouse model of melanoma, they observed that subcutaneous injection of indole-3-carbinol could bring down tumor burden significantly. The underlying molecular mechanism of this anti-tumor effect was found to be by the specific inhibition of activity of oncogenic BRAFV600E in tumors that harbored the mutation. However, in tumors that expressed wild type BRAF, indole-3-carbinol did not cause any comparable antiproliferative effect. Additionally indole-3-carbinol did not cause antiproliferation even in normal epidermal melanocytes underscoring the specificity and selectivity of its action. Kundu et al. further showed that inhibition of BRAF V600E activity by indole-3-carbinol resulted in downregulation of MITF-M by downstream signaling which caused a G1 cell cycle arrest leading to the observed antiproliferative effect. In a second study Kundu et al. showed that in melanoma cells where PTEN is downregulated, indole-3-carbinol directly interacts with NEDD41 to prevent PTEN ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This results in stabilization of PTEN and inhibition of proliferation by downstream AKT signaling. Overall scientific evidence shows that in melanoma, indole-3-carbinol specifically inhibits the two most commonly associated driver mutation signaling pathways to cause proliferation, a fact that can be used to design clinical trial to treat human patients with indole-3-carbinol in future. == Systemic lupus erythematosus == Indole-3-carbinol can shift estrogen metabolism towards less estrogenic metabolites. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus), an autoimmune disease, is associated with estrogen. In a study using mice bred to develop lupus, indole-3-carbinol was fed to one group while another group was fed a standard mouse diet; the group fed the indole-3-carbinol diet lived longer and had fewer signs of disease. Another study of lupus-prone mice with indole-3-carbinol defined the mechanism for the improvement of their disease to be due to sequential blocks in the development of B and T cells of these mice. The maturation arrests resulted in a fall in autoantibody production, thought to be a crucial component of lupus causation. In addition, I3C supplementation of the disease prone mice led to a normalization of their T cell function. Women with lupus can manifest a metabolic response to indole-3-carbinol and might also benefit from its antiestrogenic effects. Clinical trials are currently underway to determine the efficacy of treating human patients with lupus using indole-3-carbinol. == Effect in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis == There is evidence suggesting that indole-3-carbinol may have an effect on human papillomavirus-infected cells in both pediatrics and adult patients.

US FDA granted fast track designation for pritelivir in 2017 and breakthrough therapy designation 2020. == Medical use == Pritelivir is currently being developed for the treatment of immunocompromised patients with mucocutaneous HSV lesions that are resistant to acyclovir. === HSV in immunocompromised patients === Although HSV infection is very common in the general population, it rarely causes serious disease and is effectively contained by the immune system. In those with a weakened immune system such as transplant recipients, people receiving chemo- or radiotherapy, or HIV patients, an active HSV infection can cause disease in 35-68% of patients and may become severe or even life-threatening. === Standard of care treatments === HSV treatment revolves around the use of nucleoside analogues (NA) which act via the viral DNA polymerase, causing DNA chain termination and prevention of viral replication. First-line treatment is generally acyclovir or its prodrug valacyclovir. Resistance to acyclovir is more common in HSV patients with weakened or suppressed immune systems, affecting between 4 and 25% of cases. ==== Resistance to standard treatments ==== If HSV drug resistance is mediated by mutation(s) of the viral UL23 gene, which encodes the viral thymidine kinase (TK), then the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet may be effective as a rescue treatment, since it does not require activation by TK. The use of foscarnet is commonly accompanied by restrictive toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity. If the virus also acquires resistance to foscarnet, then there is currently no FDA approved treatment. == Clinical research == === Completed phase II clinical trials in otherwise healthy patients with genital herpes === A Double-blind Randomized Placebo Controlled Dose-finding Trial to Investigate Different Doses of a New Antiviral Drug in Subjects With Genital HSV Type 2 Infection. A Double-blind, Double Dummy, Randomized Crossover Trial to Compare the Effect of ""AIC316 (Pritelivir)"" 100 mg Once Daily Versus Valacyclovir 500 mg Once Daily on Genital HSV Shedding in HSV-2 Seropositive Adults. === Ongoing phase II / phase III clinical trials with pritelivir === A phase II / III multinational, comparator-controlled, clinical trial in immunocompromised patients with acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous lesions is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Pritelivir is a member of the helicase-primase inhibitors (HPI), a novel class of direct-acting antiviral drugs acting specifically against HSV-1 and HSV-2. As the name suggests, the drugs act through inhibition of the viral helicase primase complex, encoded by the UL5 (helicase), UL8 (scaffold protein) and UL52 (primase) genes, which is essential for HSV replication. The helicase primase complex is encoded separately from the viral DNA polymerase (encoded by the UL30 gene). Because HPIs i) do not target the viral DNA polymerase and ii) do not require activation by the viral thymidine kinase enzyme (encoded by the UL23 gene), mutations causing resistance to NAs are not protective against HPIs. Similarly, resistance to HPIs does not confer resistance to NAs. == See also == Amenamevir == References ==",Pritelivir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.017272294731811e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007160721579566598)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritelivir?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Pritelivir', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritelivir?utm_source=openai')])"
1966,"('Ecabet (sodium)', 'Ecabet', 'Ecabet [inn]', 'Ecabet (inn)', '(1r,4as,10ar)-1,4a-dimethyl-7-propan-2-yl-6-sulfo-2,3,4,9,10,10a-hexahydrophenanthrene-1-carboxylic acid')",Medical," Several studies have reported that the application of ecabet sodium during the eradication of Helicobacter pylori can improve the eradication rate and reduce therapy-associated side effects. However, the efficacy and safety of this therapy are controversial. To determine whether ecabet sodium improves the eradication rate of H. pylori and examine treatment safety by conducting a meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Literature searches were conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Science Citation Index, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, and the Wanfang Database. A meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing ecabet sodium supplementation with nonecabet sodium-containing therapy was performed. Thirteen RCTs that included a total of 1808 patients were assessed. The meta-analysis showed that the eradication rate in the ecabet sodium-containing quadruple therapy group was higher than that in the standard triple therapy group (84.5% vs 74.55%, OR 1.757 (95%CI: 1.307 to 2.362), p < .001). The analysis also showed that the eradication rate in the ecabet sodium-containing triple therapy group was significantly higher than that in the PPI plus amoxicillin or clarithromycin therapy group (74.6% vs 43.9%,OR 3.727 (95%CI: 2.320 to 5.988), p < .001)(ITT), (74.6% vs 43.9%,OR 3.863 (95%CI: 2.369 to 6.298), p < .001) (PP). Furthermore, our meta-analysis suggested that the occurrence of side effects did not significantly differ between patients receiving ecabet sodium-containing therapy and patients receiving nonecabet sodium-containing therapy (14.0% vs 13.3%, OR 1.055 (95%CI: 0.632 to 1.759), p = .839). Supplementation with ecabet sodium during H. pylori eradication therapy improves the eradication rate. The use of ecabet sodium does not increase the side effects based on our meta-analysis. Ecabet sodium (ES) is currently applied to some clinical gastrointestinal disease primarily by the inhibition of the ROS production. In this study, the protective role of ES was evaluated against the neomycin-induced hair cell loss using zebrafish experimental animal model. Zebrafish larvae (5-7 dpf), were treated with each of the following concentrations of ES: 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μg/mL for 1 h, followed by 125 μM neomycin for 1h. The positive control group was established by 125 μM neomycin-only treatment (1h) and the negative control group with no additional chemicals was also established. Hair cells inside four neuromasts ( SO1, SO2, O1, OC1) were assessed using fluorescence microscopy (n = 10). Hair cell survival was calculated as the mean number of viable hair cells for each group. Apoptosis and mitochondrial damage were investigated using special staining (TUNEL and DASPEI assay, respectively), and compared among groups. Ultrastructural changes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Pre-treatment group with ES increased the mean number of viable hair cells as a dose-dependent manner achieving almost same number of viable hair cells with 40 μM/ml ES treatment (12.98 ± 2.59 cells) comparing to that of the negative control group (14.15 ± 1.39 cells, p = 0.72) and significantly more number of viable hair cells than that of the positive control group (7.45 ± 0.91 cells, p < 0.01). The production of reactive oxygen species significantly increased by 183% with 125 μM neomycin treatment than the negative control group and significantly decreased down to 105% with the pre-treatment with 40 μM/ml ES (n = 40, p = 0.04). A significantly less number of TUNEL-positive cells (reflecting apoptosis, p < 0.01) and a significantly increased DASPEI reactivity (reflecting viable mitochondria, p < 0.01) were observed in 40 μM/ml ES pre-treatment group. Our data suggest that ES could protect against neomycin-induced hair cell loss possibly by reducing apoptosis, mitochondrial damages, and the ROS generation.",Ecabet (sodium),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002614550176076591), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00018892886873800308), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860970005393028)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/salts/DBSALT000062?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Ecabet sodium | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/salts/DBSALT000062?utm_source=openai')])"
1967,"('Ribavirin', 'Tribavirin', 'Rebetol', 'Virazole', 'Copegus')",Medical,"Ribavirin, also known as tribavirin, is an antiviral medication used to treat illness caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, as well as some viral hemorrhagic fevers. For HCV, it is used in combination with other medications, such as simeprevir, sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2a. It can also be used for viral hemorrhagic fevers—specifically, for Lassa fever, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infections (with exceptions for Ebola or Marburg virus diseases). Ribavirin is usually taken orally (by mouth) or inhaled. Despite widespread usage, it has faced scrutiny in the 21st century because of lack of proven efficacy in treating viral infections for which it has been prescribed in the past. Its common side effects include fatigue, headache, nausea, fever, muscle pains, and an irritable mood. Serious side effects include red blood cell breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Its use during pregnancy can bring harm to the developing fetus. Effective birth control is recommended for both males and females for at least seven months during and after use. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is not entirely clear. Ribavirin was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Ribavirin is primarily used to treat chronic hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers (an orphan indication in most countries). Its efficacy for these purposes has been questioned in light of its Food and Drug Administration boxed warning against its use as monotherapy for chronic hepatitis C. Thus, it may be prescribed in the United States only as an adjunct to one or more other medications. Its efficacy against viruses other than HCV, including those that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, has not been conclusively demonstrated. In effect, it is not approved in the United States for treatment of viruses other than HCV. === Hepatitis C === For chronic HCV infection, the oral (capsule or tablet) form of ribavirin is used only in combination with pegylated interferon alfa. Statins may improve this combination's efficacy in treating hepatitis C. When possible, genotyping of the specific viral strain is done; and ribavirin is only used as a dose-escalating adjuvant to specific combinations of genotypes and other medications. Acute hepatitis C infection (within the first 6 months) often does not require immediate treatment, as many infections eventually resolve without treatment. When the decision is made to treat acute hepatitis C, ribavirin may be used as an adjunct to several drug combinations. However, other medications are still preferred. === Viral hemorrhagic fever === Ribavirin is the only known treatment for a variety of viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection, although data regarding these infections are scarce and the drug might be effective only in early stages. It is noted by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) that ""Ribavirin has poor in vitro and in vivo activity against the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and the flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and Kyasanur forest disease)"" The aerosol form has been used in the past to treat respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases in children, although the evidence to support this is rather weak. Despite questions surrounding its efficacy, ribavirin remains the only antiviral known to be effective in treating Lassa fever. It has been used (in combination with ketamine, midazolam, and amantadine) in treatment of rabies. === Experimental uses === Experimental data indicate that ribavirin may have useful activity against canine distemper and poxviruses. Ribavirin has also been used as a treatment for herpes simplex virus. One small study found that ribavirin treatment reduced the severity of herpes outbreaks and promoted recovery, as compared with placebo treatment. Another study found that ribavirin potentiated the antiviral effect of acyclovir. Some interest has been seen in its possible use as a treatment for cancers with elevated eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in head and neck cancers. Ribavirin targeted eIF4E in AML patients in monotherapy and combination studies and this corresponded to objective clinical responses including complete remissions. Ribavirin resistance in AML patients arose leading to loss of eIF4E targeting and relapse. Resistance was caused by deactivation of ribavirin through its glucuronidation in AML cells or impaired drug entry/retention in the AML cells. There may be additional forms of ribavirin resistance displayed by cancer cells. In HPV related oropharyngeal cancers, ribavirin reduced levels of phosphorylated form of eIF4E in some patients. The best response here was stable disease but another head and neck study had more promising results. == Adverse effects == The medication has two FDA ""black box"" warnings: One raises concerns that use before or during pregnancy by either sex may result in birth defects in the baby, and the other is regarding the risk of red blood cell breakdown. Ribavirin should not be given with zidovudine because of the increased risk of anemia; concurrent use with didanosine should likewise be avoided because of an increased risk of mitochondrial toxicity. == Mechanisms of action == It is a guanosine (ribonucleic) analog used to stop viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping, thus, it is a nucleoside analog. Ribavirin is a prodrug, which when metabolized resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this form, it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. Over five direct and indirect mechanisms have been proposed for its mechanism of action. The enzyme inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) dephosphorylates ribavirin triphosphate in vitro to ribavirin monophosphate, and ITPase reduced enzymatic activity present in 30% of humans potentiates mutagenesis in hepatitis C virus. === RNA viruses === Ribavirin's amide group can make the native nucleoside drug resemble adenosine or guanosine, depending on its rotation. For this reason, when ribavirin is incorporated into RNA, as a base analog of either adenine or guanine, it pairs equally well with either uracil or cytosine, inducing mutations in RNA-dependent replication in RNA viruses. Such hypermutation can be lethal to RNA viruses. === DNA viruses === Neither of these mechanisms explains ribavirin's effect on many DNA viruses, which is more of a mystery, especially given the complete inactivity of ribavirin's 2' deoxyribose analogue, which suggests that the drug functions only as an RNA nucleoside mimic, and never a DNA nucleoside mimic. Ribavirin 5'-monophosphate inhibits cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby depleting intracellular pools of GTP. == eIF4E targeting in cancer == The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E plays multiple roles in RNA metabolism with translation being the best described. Biophysical and NMR studies first revealed that ribavirin directly bound the eIF4E, providing another mechanism for its action. 3H Ribavirin also interacts with eIF4E in cells. While inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) presumably only binds the ribavirin monophosphate metabolite (RMP), eIF4E can bind ribavirin and with higher affinity ribavirin's phosphorylated forms. In many cell lines, studies into steady state levels of metabolites indicate that ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is more abundant than the RMP metabolite which is the IMPDH ligand. RTP binds to eIF4E in its cap-binding site as observed by NMR. Ribavirin inhibits eIF4E activities in cells including in its RNA export, translation and oncogenic activities lines. In AML patients treated with ribavirin, ribavirin blocked the nuclear import of eIF4E through interfering with its interaction with its nuclear importer, Importin 8, thereby impairing its nuclear activities. Clinical relapse in AML patients corresponded to loss of ribavirin binding leading to nuclear re-entry of eIF4E and re-emergence of its nuclear activities. == History and culture == Ribavirin was first made in 1972 under the National Cancer Institute's Virus-Cancer program. This was done by researchers from International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation including Roberts A. Smith, Joseph T. Witkovski and Roland K. Robins. It was reported that ribavirin was active against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses in culture and in animals, without undue toxicity in the context of cancer chemotherapies. By the late 1970s, the Virus-Cancer program was widely considered a failure, and the drug development was abandoned. After the US Government announced that AIDS was caused by a retrovirus in 1984, drugs examined during the Virus-Cancer program and its focus on retroviruses were re-examined. Although the FDA first approved ribavirin as an antiviral in 1986, it was not indicated to treat HIV or AIDS. As a result, many people with AIDS sought to obtain black market ribavirin via buyer's clubs. The drug was approved for investigational use against hantavirus in the United States in 1993, but the results from a non-randomized uncontrolled trial were not encouraging: 71% of recipients became anemic and 47% died. In 2002 with the SARS outbreak, early speculation focused on ribavirin as a possible anti-SARS agent. Early protocols adopted in Hong Kong adopted a ""Hit Hard Hit Early"" approach treating SARS with high doses of off-label steroids and Ribavirin. Unfortunately, it later turned out this haphazard approach was at best ineffective and at worst fatal, with many deaths attributed to SARS caused by ribavirin toxicity. === Names === Ribavirin is the INN and USAN, whereas tribavirin is the BAN. Brand names of generic forms include Copegus, Ribasphere, Rebetol. == Derivatives == Ribavirin is possibly best viewed as a ribosyl purine analogue with an incomplete purine 6-membered ring. This structural resemblance historically prompted replacement of the 2' nitrogen of the triazole with a carbon (which becomes the 5' carbon in an imidazole), in an attempt to partly ""fill out"" the second ring--- but to no great effect. Such 5' imidazole riboside derivatives show antiviral activity with 5' hydrogen or halide, but the larger the substituent, the smaller the activity, and all proved less active than ribavirin. Note that two natural products were already known with this imidazole riboside structure: substitution at the 5' carbon with OH results in pyrazofurin, an antibiotic with antiviral properties but unacceptable toxicity, and replacement with an amino group results in the natural purine synthetic precursor 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), which has only modest antiviral properties. === Taribavirin === The most successful ribavirin derivative to date is the 3-carboxamidine derivative of the parent 3-carboxamide, first reported in 1973 by J. T. Witkowski et al., and now called taribavirin (former names ""viramidine"" and ""ribamidine""). This drug shows a similar spectrum of antiviral activity to ribavirin, which is not surprising as it is now known to be a pro-drug for ribavirin. Taribavirin, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than ribavirin. The first property is due to taribavirin's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide in liver tissue. Taribavirin completed phase III human trials in 2012. == Notes == == References == == External links == ""Ribavirin"". Drug Information Portal.

1968,"('Oxytetracycline', 'Terramycin', 'Oxyterracine', 'Oxytetracyclin', 'Adamycin')",Medical,"Oxytetracycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, the second of the group to be discovered. Oxytetracycline works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to produce essential proteins. Without these proteins, the bacteria cannot grow, multiply and increase in numbers. Oxytetracycline therefore stops the spread of the infection, and the remaining bacteria are killed by the immune system or eventually die. Oxytetracycline is active against a wide variety of bacteria. However, some strains of bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic, which has reduced its effectiveness for treating some types of infections. Oxytetracycline is used to treat infections caused by Chlamydia, such as psittacosis, trachoma, and urethritis, and infections caused by Mycoplasma organisms, such as pneumonia. Oxytetracycline is used to treat acne, due to its activity against the bacteria on the skin that influence the development of acne (Cutibacterium acnes). It is used to treat flare-ups of chronic bronchitis, due to its activity against Haemophilus influenzae. Oxytetracycline may be used to treat other rarer infections, such as those caused by a group of microorganisms called rickettsiae (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever). To make sure the bacteria causing an infection are susceptible to it, a tissue sample is usually taken; for example, a swab from the infected area or a urine or blood sample. Oxytetracycline was patented in 1949 and came into commercial use in 1950. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as an alternative to tetracycline. == Medical uses == Oxytetracycline, like other tetracyclines, is used to treat many infections, both common and rare. Its better absorption profile makes it preferable to tetracycline for moderately severe acne at a dosage of 250–500 mg four times a day for usually six to eight weeks at a time, but alternatives should be sought if no improvement occurs by three months. It is sometimes used to treat spirochaetal infections, clostridial wound infection, and anthrax in patients sensitive to penicillin. Oxytetracycline is used to treat infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts, skin, ear, eye and gonorrhoea, although its use for such purposes has declined in recent years due to large increases in bacterial resistance to this class of drugs. The drug is particularly useful when penicillins and/or macrolides cannot be used due to allergy. It may be used to treat Legionnaire's disease as a substitute for a macrolide or quinolone. Oxytetracycline is especially valuable in treating nonspecific urethritis, Lyme disease, brucellosis, cholera, typhus, tularaemia, and infections caused by Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia. Doxycycline is now preferred to oxytetracycline for many of these indications because it has improved pharmacologic features. The standard dose is 250 to 500 mg every six hours by mouth. In particularly severe infections, this dose may be increased accordingly. Occasionally, oxytetracycline is given by intramuscular injection or topically in the form of creams, ophthalmic ointments, or eye drops. == Side effects == Side effects are mainly gastrointestinal and photosensitive allergic reactions common to the tetracycline antibiotics group. It can damage calcium-rich organs, such as teeth and bones, although this is very rare. It sometimes causes nasal cavities to erode; because of this, tetracyclines should not be used to treat pregnant or lactating women and children under age twelve except in certain conditions where it has been approved by a specialist because there are no obvious substitutes. Candidiasis (thrush) is not uncommon following treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. == History == It was first found near Pfizer laboratories in a soil sample yielding the, then new, actinomycete Streptomyces rimosus by Finlay et al. In 1950, a group at Pfizer led by Francis A. Hochstein, working in a loose collaboration with the Harvard organic chemist Robert B. Woodward, worked out the chemical structure of oxytetracycline, enabling Pfizer to mass-produce the drug under the trade name Terramycin. This discovery was a major advancement in tetracycline research and paved the way for the discovery of an oxytetracycline derivative, doxycycline, which is one of the most popularly used antibiotics today. == Biosynthesis == Oxytetracycline belongs to a structurally diverse class of aromatic polyketide antibiotics, also known as bacterial aromatic polyketides, produced by Streptomyces via type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). Other compounds produced via type II PKSs are important bioactive compounds ranging from anticancer agents like doxorubicin to antibiotics such as tetracycline. The biosynthesis of oxytetracycline can be broken down into three general portions: first is the formation of an amidated polyketide backbone with minimal polyketide synthases (PKSs), second is the cyclization of the polyketide backbone, and finally, the formation of anhydrotetracycline—a shared intermediate with tetracycline—to produce oxytetracycline. The biosynthesis of oxytetracycline begins with the utilization of PKS enzymes ketosynthase (KS), the chain length factor (CLF), the acyl carrier protein (ACP), and an acyltransferase (encoded as OxyA, OxyB, OxyC and OxyP in the oxytetracycline gene cluster) to catalyze the extension of the malonamyl-CoA starting unit with eight malonyl-CoA extender units. The process of elongating the polypeptide skeleton occurs through a series of Claisen-like decarboxylation reactions until the linear tetracyclic skeleton is formed. Thus, minimal PKSs form a completed amidated polyketide backbone without any additional post-synthase tailoring enzymes (Figure 1). Following the formation of the linear tetracyclic skeleton, four successive cyclization reactions must occur in a regioselective manner to produce the aromatic natural product known as pretetramid, a common precursor to both oxytetracycline and other tetracycline antibiotics. In the oxytetracycline gene cluster, these enzymes are encoded as OxyK (aromatase), OxyN (cyclase), and OxyI (cyclase). Formation of pretetramid allows for one of the most important intermediates en route to the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline; this is the generation of anhydrotetracycline. Anhydrotetracycline contains the first functionalized A ring in this biosynthetic pathway. After the formation of anhydrotetracycline, ATC monooxygenase (OxyS) oxidizes the C-6 position in an enantioselective manner in the presence of the cofactor NADPH and atmospheric oxygen to produce 5a,11a-dehydrotetracycline. Next, a hydroxylation occurs at the C-5 position of 5a,11a-dehydrotetracycline via the oxygenase encoded as OxyE in the oxytetracycline gene cluster. This produces the intermediate 5a,11a-dehydro-oxytetracycline. However, the exact mechanism of this step remains unclear. The final step of this biosynthesis occurs through the reduction of a double bond in the α, β—unsaturated ketone of 5a,11a-dehydro-oxytetracycline. In this final step, the cofactor NADPH is employed by TchA (reductase) as the reducing agent. Upon reduction, the enol form is favored due to conjugation, thus producing the aromatic polyketide oxytetracycline. Figure 2 shows the biosynthesis as described above, as well as an arrow-pushing mechanism of NADPH being used as the final cofactor in the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline. == Veterinary indications == Oxytetracycline is used to control the outbreak of American foulbrood and European foulbrood in honeybees. Oxytetracycline can be used to correct breathing disorders in livestock. It is administered in a powder or through an intramuscular injection. American livestock producers apply oxytetracycline to livestock feed to prevent diseases and infections in cattle and poultry. The antibiotic is partially absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal and the remaining is deposited in manure. Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service studied the breakdown of oxytetracycline in manure depending on various environmental conditions. They found the breakdown slowed with increased saturation of the manure and concluded this was a result of decreased oxygen levels. This research helps producers understand the effects of oxytetracycline in animal feed on the environment, bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance. Oxytetracycline is used to mark fish which are released and later recaptured. The oxytetracycline interferes with bone deposition, leaving a visible mark on growing bones. Oxytetracycline has been formulated as a broad-spectrum anti-infective for fish under the name Terramycin 200 (TM200). It is used to control certain diseases that adversely affect salmonids, catfish, and lobsters. == References ==",Terramycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014494798961095512), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04861105978488922)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/terramycin.html,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Terramycin,https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Oxytetracycline ', [])"

Cariporide has been shown to actively suppress the cell death caused by oxidative stress. Cariporide is a potent NHE1 inhibitor is may also be useful for treatment of cancer. == Mechanism of action == Cariporide targets and inhibits the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoform 1, which is ubiquitously expressed and involved in pH regulation of the myocardium. During myocardial ischemia, NHE activation leads to an influx of Na+ and, upon reperfusion, reverses the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and results in an overload of intracellular Ca2+. By inhibiting the NHE1, cariporide limits the early influx of Na+ and lends a cardioprotective effect upon ischemia/reperfusion. Additionally, cariporide slows the normalization of cellular pH following an H+ efflux during reperfusion triggered by ischemia-induced acidosis. It is hypothesized that cariporide may also serve as a highly selective target for anti-cancer therapy through the inhibition of NHE1 in tumor cells (see Continuing Research). == Clinical trials == === Phase I === Following experimental research into NHE-activation and its effects on myocardial injury, cariporide was proposed for a Phase I trial to test whether inhibition of the NHE approves myocardial function in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA). Results of this trial were published in 2000. A group of 100 individuals were placed in two trial groups. The first group was given a 40-mg intravaneous bolus dose of cariporide prior to reperfusion. A second group was given a placebo. 21 days post-injection, patients in the cariporide group showed a number of improvements over the placebo group. This trial proved NHE inhibition with cariporide may be an effective way to aid recovery post-PCTA. === Phase II/Phase III: GUARDIAN trial === Acute coronary syndrome, including heart attack or unstable angina, is the number one cause of death in America. The Guard During Ischemia Against Necrosis (GUARDIAN) trial was conducted to determine whether cariporide reduced the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction in at-risk patients. It was the first large-scale trial to determine the efficacy and safety of cariporide. The trial began in May 1997 and patients were enrolled until April 1999. A total of 382 investigative sites were chosen in 23 countries, totaling 11,590 patients. Patients were split between four study groups: placebo, 20, 80 or 120 mg doses as 60-minute infusions three times daily. The primary goals of the GUARDIAN trial were to assess (1) the rate of death or myocardial infarction at day 36 in the four trial groups and (2) the large-scale safety and side effects associated with cariporide. Results showed that 20- and 80-mg doses were statistically similar to the placebo group, while the 120-mg group showed a 10% relative risk reduction and similar mortality rates. While cariporide showed efficacy for certain sub-groups of patients at varying drug concentrations, overall the GUARDIAN trial showed that cariporide did not significantly reduce patient risk of myocardial infarction or mortality. Despite this result, cariporide showed promise in the post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) sub-group of patients. Here, there was a 25% reduction in post-surgery mortality or MI, suggesting that high-doses and prolonged releases of cariporide may be efficacious for high-risk patients. === Phase III: EXPEDITION trial === The Sodium-Proton Exchange Inhibition to Prevent Coronary Events in Acute Cardiac Conditions (EXPEDITION) trial was a Phase III trial to assess the efficacy and safety of cariporide in patients who have received a CABG surgery. 5,761 patients were accepted from July 2001 to July 2002 and were placed in two trial groups. The first group received a consecutive dosing regimen detailed in the table below: The second group received a placebo. The results of the trial showed a statistically significant decline in mortality or myocardial infarction from 20.3% to 16.6%. However, when looked at individually, the rate of myocardial infarction declined from 18.9% to 14.4%, while mortality increased 0.7%. Due to the increase in mortality, cariporide did not pass clinical trials. However, these studies showed for the first time that inhibition of the NHE affords protection to the myocardium and research into decoupling its adverse effects on mortality from its protective effects is ongoing. == Dosing == In all clinical trials, cariporide was given was an intravenous injection. Early clinical trials (see Phase I) showed significant improvements over a placebo at a 40-mg dose prior to arterial surgery. Both Phase III clinical trials for cariporide conclude that it is highly dose-dependent. While earlier trials showed that high doses of cariporide (120-mg, three times daily) may increase efficacy, the EXPEDITION trial found an increased rate of mortality associated with these higher doses. == Side effects == The largest clinical trial for cariporide found no significant adverse effects of cariporide on patients (see Phase III: GUARDIAN Trial). However, a later clinical trial found dose-dependent increases in mortality for patients using cariporide post-CABG (see Phase III: EXPEDITION Trial). == Research == Since the findings of the EXPEDITION trial in 2003, research into cariporide has slowed. The increased risk of mortality associated with high concentrations and the lack of efficacy at low concentration make it unlikely that cariporide will reach market as a cardioprotective agent during ischaemia and reperfusion. However, more recent research has been conducted into cariporide as an anti-cancer treatment. Through its inhibition of NHE1, cariporide may provide a mechanism for initiating internal acidification of cancer cells leading to apoptosis. Cancer cells utilize NHE1 in a unique mechanism of providing high intracellular pH and low extracellular pH, preventing internal acidification and leading to an efflux of H+ from tumor cells. == Patents == The first patent pertaining to cariporide use was submitted March 30, 1994 as an antiarrhythmic agent and was granted on January 8, 1997. Since then, multiple patents have been issued for the use, delivery, and investigation of cariporide. However, no drug has been approved and marketed with cariporide. == References ==",Cariporide,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.04859213903546333)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004205787554383278), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029764417558908463)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18355507/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11060730/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cariporide ', [])"

1972,"('Levobunolol (hydrochloride)', 'Bunolol hydrochloride', 'Levobunololum', 'Bunolol', 'Levobunololum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Levobunolol (trade names AKBeta, Betagan, Vistagan, among others) is a non-selective beta blocker. It is used topically in the form of eye drops to manage ocular hypertension (high pressure in the eye) and open-angle glaucoma. == Contraindications == Like other non-selective beta blockers, levobunolol is contraindicated in patients with airway diseases such as asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as heart problems such as sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, and cardiogenic shock. Combination with MAO-A inhibitors is also contraindicated because it could cause a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Levobunolol is not useful for the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. == Side effects == The most common side effect is eye irritation felt as stinging or burning, which occurs in up to a third of patients. Blepharoconjunctivitis occurs in up to 5% of patients. Rarer adverse effects include keratitis, edema and increased lacrimation. Allergies are rare, but seem to be more common than under the related drug timolol. If the substance reaches the nasal mucosa via the tear duct, it can be absorbed into the bloodstream and cause systemic side effects. These include orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) and other effects on the heart and circulatory system, breathing problems in people with asthma, and skin symptoms such as itching and aggravation of psoriasis. == Interactions == Even in the form of eye drops, levebunolol may cause hypotension when combined with alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs that lower blood pressure. It can also cause severe hypertension (high blood pressure) when combined with sympathomimetic drugs or MAO-A inhibitors, bradycardia (low heart rate) when combined with antiarrhythmics or mefloquine, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when combined with antidiabetic drugs such as insulin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Levobunolol is a non-cardioselective beta blocker, that is, it blocks beta-1 receptors as well as beta-2 receptors. The latter type dominates in the ciliary body, where it controls aqueous humour production. Blocking this type of receptor reduces aqueous humour production, lowering intraocular pressure. The substance has no relevant membrane stabilizing effect or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Like other beta blockers, and unlike the anti-glaucoma medication pilocarpine, levobunolol has no effect on accommodation and pupil size. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance quickly penetrates the cornea and reaches the aqueous humour. It is reduced to dihydrolevobunolol, which is equally active, in the eye's tissues. The drug starts to lower intraocular pressure within an hour, reaches its maximum effect after two to six hours, and remains effective for up to 16 hours. It has an elimination half-life of six hours and is mainly excreted via the kidney. == Chemistry == Levobunolol is the pure L-enantiomer of bunolol and has more than 60 times the pharmacological activity of D-bunolol. It is used as the hydrochloride, which melts at 209 to 211 °C (408 to 412 °F) and is soluble in water and methanol and slightly soluble in ethanol. == References == Ishibashi T, Yokoi N, Kinoshita S (2003).

1973,"('Gibberellic acid', 'Gibberellin a3', 'Gibberellin', 'Berelex', 'Brellin')","Food, Medical","Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, flower development, and leaf and fruit senescence. They are one of the longest-known classes of plant hormone. It is thought that the selective breeding (albeit unconscious) of crop strains that were deficient in GA synthesis was one of the key drivers of the ""green revolution"" in the 1960s, a revolution that is credited to have saved over a billion lives worldwide. == Chemistry == All known gibberellins are diterpenoid acids synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in plastids and then modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol until they reach their biologically active form. All are derived via the ent-gibberellane skeleton but are synthesised via ent-kaurene. The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery. Gibberellic acid, which was the first gibberellin to be structurally characterized, is GA3. As of 2020, there are 136 GAs identified from plants, fungi, and bacteria. Gibberellins are tetracyclic diterpene acids. There are two classes, with either 19 or 20 carbons. The 19-carbon gibberellins are generally the biologically active forms. They have lost carbon 20 and, in place, possess a five-member lactone bridge that links carbons 4 and 10. Hydroxylation also has a great effect on its biological activity. In general, the most biologically active compounds are dihydroxylated gibberellins, with hydroxyl groups on both carbons 3 and 13. Gibberellic acid is a 19-carbon dihydroxylated gibberellin. === Bioactive GAs === The bioactive Gibberellins are GA1, GA3, GA4, and GA7. There are three common structural traits between these GAs: 1) hydroxyl group on C-3β, 2) a carboxyl group on carbon 6, and 3) a lactone between carbons 4 and 10. The 3β-hydroxyl group can be exchanged for other functional groups at C-2 and/or C-3 positions. GA5 and GA6 are examples of bioactive GAs without a hydroxyl group on C-3β. The presence of GA1 in various plant species suggests that it is a common bioactive GA. == Biological function == Gibberellins are involved in the natural process of breaking dormancy and other aspects of germination. Before the photosynthetic apparatus develops sufficiently in the early stages of germination, the seed reserves of starch nourish the seedling. Usually in germination, the breakdown of starch to glucose in the endosperm begins shortly after the seed is exposed to water. Gibberellins in the seed embryo are believed to signal starch hydrolysis through inducing the synthesis of the enzyme α-amylase in the aleurone cells. In the model for gibberellin-induced production of α-amylase, it is demonstrated that gibberellins from the scutellum diffuse to the aleurone cells, where they stimulate the secretion α-amylase. α-Amylase then hydrolyses starch (abundant in many seeds), into glucose that can be used to produce energy for the seed embryo. Studies of this process have indicated gibberellins cause higher levels of transcription of the gene coding for the α-amylase enzyme, to stimulate the synthesis of α-amylase. Exposition to cold temperatures increases the production of Gibberellins. They stimulate cell elongation, breaking and budding, and seedless fruits. Gibberellins cause also seed germination by breaking the seed's dormancy and acting as a chemical messenger. Its hormone binds to a receptor, and calcium activates the protein calmodulin, and the complex binds to DNA, producing an enzyme to stimulate growth in the embryo. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Gibberellins are usually synthesized from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP), with the participation of three classes of enzymes: terpene syntheses (TPSs), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). The MEP pathway follows eight steps: GGDP is converted to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CDP) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) ent-CDP is converted to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase (KS) ent-kaurene is converted to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) ent-kaurenol is converted to ent-kaurenal by KO ent-kaurenal is converted to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO ent-kaurenoic acid is converted to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid is converted to GA12-aldehyde by KAO GA12-aldehyde is converted to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase. One or two genes encode the enzymes responsible for the first steps of GA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and rice. The null alleles of the genes encoding CPS, KS, and KO result in GA-deficient Arabidopsis dwarves. Multigene families encode the 2ODDs that catalyze the formation of GA12 to bioactive GA4. AtGA3ox1 and AtGA3ox2, two of the four genes that encode GA3ox in Arabidopsis, affect vegetative development. Environmental stimuli regulate AtGA3ox1 and AtGA3ox2 activity during seed germination. In Arabidopsis, GA20ox overexpression leads to an increase in GA concentration. ==== Sites of biosynthesis ==== Most bioactive Gibberellins are located in actively growing organs on plants. Both GA20ox and GA3ox genes (genes coding for GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase) and the SLENDER1 gene (a GA signal transduction gene) are found in growing organs on rice, which suggests bioactive GA synthesis occurs at their site of action in growing organs in plants. During flower development, the tapetum of anthers is believed to be a primary site of GA biosynthesis. ==== Differences between biosynthesis in fungi and lower plants ==== The flower Arabidopsis and the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi possess different GA pathways and enzymes. P450s in fungi perform functions analogous to the functions of KAOs in plants. The function of CPS and KS in plants is performed by a single enzyme in fungi (CPS/KS). In plants the Gibberellin biosynthesis genes are found randomly on multiple chromosomes, but in fungi are found on one chromosome . Plants produce low amount of Gibberellic Acid, therefore is produced for industrial purposes by microorganisms. Industrially GA3 can be produced by submerged fermentation, but this process presents low yield with high production costs and hence higher sale value, nevertheless other alternative process to reduce costs of its production is solid-state fermentation (SSF) that allows the use of agro-industrial residues. === Catabolism === Several mechanisms for inactivating Giberellins have been identified. 2β-hydroxylation deactivates them, and is catalyzed by GA2-oxidases (GA2oxs). Some GA2oxs use 19-carbon Gibberellins as substrates, while other use C20-GAs. Cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase, encoded by elongated uppermost internode (eui), converts Gibberellins into 16α,17-epoxides. Rice eui mutants amass bioactive Gibberellins at high levels, which suggests cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase is a main enzyme responsible for deactivation GA in rice. The Gamt1 and gamt2 genes encode enzymes that methylate the C-6 carboxyl group of GAs. In a gamt1 and gamt2 mutant, concentrations of GA in developing seeds is increased. === Homeostasis === Feedback and feedforward regulation maintains the levels of bioactive Gibberellins in plants. Levels of AtGA20ox1 and AtGA3ox1 expression are increased in a Gibberellin deficient environment, and decreased after the addition of bioactive GAs, Conversely, expression of the Gibberellin deactivation genes AtGA2ox1 and AtGA2ox2 is increased with addition of Gibberellins. == Regulation == === Regulation by other hormones === The auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) regulates concentration of GA1 in elongating internodes in peas. Removal of IAA by removal of the apical bud, the auxin source, reduces the concentration of GA1, and reintroduction of IAA reverses these effects to increase the concentration of GA1. This has also been observed in tobacco plants. Auxin increases GA 3-oxidation and decreases GA 2-oxidation in barley. Auxin also regulates GA biosynthesis during fruit development in peas. These discoveries in different plant species suggest the auxin regulation of GA metabolism may be a universal mechanism. Ethylene decreases the concentration of bioactive GAs. === Regulation by environmental factors === Recent evidence suggests fluctuations in GA concentration influence light-regulated seed germination, photomorphogenesis during de-etiolation, and photoperiod regulation of stem elongation and flowering. Microarray analysis showed about one fourth cold-responsive genes are related to GA-regulated genes, which suggests GA influences response to cold temperatures. Plants reduce growth rate when exposed to stress. A relationship between GA levels and amount of stress experienced has been suggested in barley. === Role in seed development === Bioactive GAs and abscisic acid (ABA) levels have an inverse relationship and regulate seed development and germination. Levels of FUS3, an Arabidopsis transcription factor, are upregulated by ABA and downregulated by Giberellins, which suggests that there is a regulation loop that establishes the balance of Gibberellins and Abscisic Acid. In the practice, this means that farmers can alter this balance to make all fruits mature a little later, at a same time, or 'glue' the fruit in the trees until the harvest day (because ABA participates in the maturation of the fruits, and many crops mature and drop a few fruits a day for several weeks, that is undesirable for markets). == Signalling mechanism == === Receptor === In the early 1990s, there were several lines of evidence that suggested the existence of a GA receptor in oat seeds located at the plasma membrane. However, despite intensive research, to date, no membrane-bound GA receptor has been isolated. This, along with the discovery of a soluble receptor, GA insensitive dwarf 1 (GID1) has led many to doubt that a membrane-bound receptor exists.GID1 was first identified in rice and in Arabidopsis there are three orthologs of GID1, AtGID1a, b, and c. GID1s have a high affinity for bioactive GAs. GA binds to a specific binding pocket on GID1; the C3-hydroxyl on GA makes contact with tyrosine-31 in the GID1 binding pocket. GA binding to GID1 causes changes in GID1 structure, causing a 'lid' on GID1 to cover the GA binding pocket. The movement of this lid results in the exposure of a surface which enables the binding of GID1 to DELLA proteins. === DELLA proteins: Repression of a repressor === DELLA proteins (such as SLR1 in rice or GAI and RGA in Arabidopsis) are repressors of plant development, characterized by the presence of a DELLA motif (aspartate-glutamate-leucine-leucine-alanine or D-E-L-L-A in the single letter amino acid code). DELLAs inhibit seed germination, seed growth, flowering and GA reverses these effects. When Gibberellins bind to the GID1 receptor, it enhances the interaction between GID1 and DELLA proteins, forming a GA-GID1-DELLA complex. In that complex it is thought that the structure of DELLA proteins experience changes, enabling their binding to F-box proteins for their degradation. F-box proteins (SLY1 in Arabidopsis or GID2 in rice) catalyse the addition of ubiquitin to their targets. Adding ubiquitin to DELLA proteins promotes their degradation via the 26S-proteosome. This releases cells from DELLAs repressive effects. === Targets of DELLA proteins === ==== Transcription factors ==== The first targets of DELLA proteins identified were Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs). PIFs are transcription factors that negatively regulate light signalling and are strong promoters of elongation growth. In the presence of GA, DELLAs are degraded and this then allows PIFs to promote elongation. It was later found that DELLAs repress a large number of other transcription factors, among which are positive regulators of auxin, brassinosteroid and ethylene signalling. DELLAs can repress transcription factors either by stopping their binding to DNA or by promoting their degradation. ==== Prefoldins and microtubule assembly ==== In addition to repressing transcription factors, DELLAs also bind to prefoldins (PFDs). PFDs are molecular chaperones (they assist in the folding of other proteins) that work in the cytosol, but when DELLAs bind to them are restricted to the nucleus. An important function of PFDs is to assist in the folding of β-tubulin, a vital component of the cytoskeleton in the form of microtubules. As such, in the absence of Gibberellins (high level of DELLA proteins), PFDs reduce its activity, leading to a lower cellular pool of β-tubulin. When GA is present the DELLAs are degraded, PFDs can move to the cytosol and assist in the folding of β-tubulin. As such, GA allows for re-organisation of the cytoskeleton, and the elongation of cells. Microtubules are also required for the trafficking of membrane vesicles, that is needed for the correct positioning of several hormone transporters. One of the most well characterized hormone transporters are PIN proteins, which are responsible for the movement of the hormone auxin between cells. In the absence of Gibberellins, DELLA proteins reduce the levels of microtubules and thereby inhibit membrane vesicle trafficking. This reduces the level of PIN proteins at the cell membrane, and the level of auxin in the cell. GA reverses this process and allows for PIN protein trafficking to the cell membrane to enhance the level of auxin in the cell. == References == == External links == Gibberellin in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Gibberellin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.404814213514328)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5862183570861816), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00029952809563837945)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.005233763717114925)])","('INFO; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibberellin ', [])"

O6-methylation of guanosine (m(6)G) is particularly notable for its high mutagenicity, pairing with T, during DNA replication. Yet, while m(6)G accumulates in both DNA and RNA, little is known about its effects on RNA. Here, we investigate the effects of m(6)G on the decoding process, using a reconstituted bacterial translation system. m(6)G at the first and third position of the codon decreases the accuracy of tRNA selection. The ribosome readily incorporates near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) by forming m(6)G-uridine codon-anticodon pairs. Surprisingly, the introduction of m(6)G to the second position of the codon does not promote miscoding, but instead slows the observed rates of peptide-bond formation by >1000-fold for cognate aa-tRNAs without altering the rates for near-cognate aa-tRNAs. These in vitro observations were recapitulated in eukaryotic extracts and HEK293 cells. Interestingly, the analogous modification N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) at the second position has only a minimal effect on tRNA selection, suggesting that the effects on tRNA selection seen with m(6)G are due to altered geometry of the base pair. Given that the m6G:U base pair is predicted to be nearly indistinguishable from a Watson-Crick base pair, our data suggest that the decoding center of the ribosome is extremely sensitive to changes at the second position. Our data, apart from highlighting the deleterious effects that these adducts pose to cellular fitness, shed new insight into decoding and the process by which the ribosome recognizes codon-anticodon pairs. High-resolution proton and phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance studies are reported on the self-complementary d(C1-G2-N3-G4-A5-A6-T7-T8-C9-O6meG10-C11-G12) duplexes (henceforth called O6meG X A 12-mer when N3 = A3 and O6meG X G 12-mer when N3 = G3), which contain symmetry-related A3 X O6meG10 and G3 X O6meG10 interactions in the interior of the helices. We observe inter-base-pair nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) between the base protons at the N3 X O6meG10 modification site and protons of flanking G2 X C11 and G4 X C9 base-pairs, indicative of the stacking of N3 and O6meG10 bases in both O6meG X A 12-mer and O6meG X G 12-mer duplexes. We have assigned all the base and a majority of the sugar protons from two-dimensional proton-correlated and nuclear Overhauser effect experiments on the O6meG X A 12-mer duplex and O6meG X G 12-mer duplex in solution. The observed NOEs establish that the A3 and O6meG10 at the modification site and all other residues adopt the anti configuration about the glycosidic bond, and that the O6meG X A 12-mer forms a right-handed duplex. The interaction between the bulky purine A3 and O6meG10 residues in the anti orientation results in large proton chemical shift perturbations at the (G2-A3-G4) X (C9-O6meG10-C11) segments of the helix. By contrast, we demonstrate that the O6meG10 residue adopts a syn configuration, while all other bases adopt an anti configuration about the glycosidic bond in the right-handed O6meG X G 12-mer duplex. This results in altered NOE patterns between the base protons of O6meG10 and the base and sugar protons of flanking C9 and C11 residues in the O6meG X G 12-mer duplex. The phosphorus backbone is perturbed at the modification site in both duplexes, since the phosphorus resonances are dispersed over 2 parts per million in the O6meG X A 12-mer and over 1 part per million in the O6meG X G 12-mer compared to a 0.5 part per million dispersion for an unperturbed DNA helix. We propose tentative pairing schemes for the A3 X O6meG10 and G3 X O6meG10 interactions in the above dodecanucleotide duplexes.

Rifalazil is used as a treatment for many different diseases. The most common are Chlamydia infection, Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD), and tuberculosis (TB). Using rifalazil and the effects that coincide with taking rifalazil for treating a bacterial disease vary from person to person, as does any drug put into the human body. Food interactions and genetic variation are a few causes for the variation in side effects from the use of rifalazil. Its development was terminated in 2013 due to severe side effects. == Biological properties == Rifalazil works well alone, and in conjunction with other antibiotics alone. In a study conducted in 2005, it was found that combining rifalazil with vancomycin increased bacterial killing by a factor of 3. Rifalazil also has a very long half-life which allows for more infrequent dosages as opposed to frequent small dosages of antibiotics. Many different studies have been conducted that have researched the effect of rifalazil on certain strains of bacterial diseases. In a study conducted in 2004, it was found that rifalazil reduced C. difficile strains when studied in vitro. == Uses == Rifalazil has been developed to treat cases of tuberculosis and chlamydia. It is a very good treatment for tuberculosis because rifalazil achieves a very high concentration in the blood cells and the lungs. In addition, rifalazil is becoming more widely used because it can be used along with many other indications, such as HIV, TB, and MRSA. Rifalazil has a very long half-life which is very useful for certain medications. The drug is administered orally which is also convenient in terms of drug administration. A longer half-life allows for fewer treatments and dosages, which makes this an up-and-coming drug for tuberculosis, CDAD, and chlamydia. Although the uses for rifalazil seem very effective, there are negative side effects that make its use limited. Rifalazil interacts with other drugs and on top of that, rapid resistance develops to other drugs. === Tested diseases for rifalazil treatment === Chlamydia infection Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea Trachoma Tuberculosis Leprosy Buruli ulcer == References ==",Rifalazil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.17976313829421997), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.60137271147687e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001515431678853929)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifalazil?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Rifalazil', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifalazil?utm_source=openai')])"
1977,"('Dofetilide', 'Uk 68789', 'Tikosyn', 'Dofetilida', 'Dofetilidum')",Medical,"Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. It is marketed under the trade name Tikosyn by Pfizer, and is available in the United States in capsules containing 125, 250, and 500 μg of dofetilide. It is not available in Europe or Australia. == Medical uses == Dofetilide is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in individuals prone to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and flutter arrhythmias, and for chemical cardioversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and flutter. Based on the results of the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmias and Mortality on Dofetilide (""DIAMOND"") study, dofetilide does not affect mortality in the treatment of patients post-myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, however it was shown to decrease all-cause readmissions as well as CHF-related readmissions. Because of the results of the DIAMOND study, some physicians use dofetilide in the suppression of atrial fibrillation in individuals with LV dysfunction, however use appears limited: After initially receiving marketing approval in Europe in 1999, Pfizer voluntarily withdrew this approval in 2004 for commercial reasons and it is not registered in other first world countries. It has clinical advantages over other class III antiarrhythmics in chemical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, and maintenance of sinus rhythm, and does not have the pulmonary or hepatotoxicity of amiodarone, however atrial fibrillation is not generally considered life-threatening, and dofetilide causes an increased rate of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in comparison to other therapies. == Contraindications == Prior to administration of the first dose, the corrected QT (QTc) must be determined. If the QTc is greater than 440 msec (or 500 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide is contraindicated. If heart rate is less than 60 bpm, the uncorrected QT interval should be used. After each subsequent dose of dofetilide, QTc should be determined and dosing should be adjusted. If at any time after the second dose of dofetilide the QTc is greater than 500 msec (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide should be discontinued. == Adverse effects == Torsades de pointes is the most serious side effect of dofetilide therapy. The incidence of torsades de pointes is 0.3-10.5% and is dose-related, with increased incidence associated with higher doses. The majority of episodes of torsades de pointes have occurred within the first three days of initial dosing. Patients should be hospitalized and monitored for the first three days after starting dofetilide. The risk of inducing torsades de pointes can be decreased by taking precautions when initiating therapy, such as hospitalizing individuals for a minimum of three days for serial creatinine measurement, continuous telemetry monitoring and availability of cardiac resuscitation. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Dofetilide works by selectively blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier outward potassium current (IKr). This causes the refractory period of atrial tissue to increase, hence its effectiveness in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Dofetilide does not affect dV/dTmax (the slope of the upstroke of phase 0 depolarization), conduction velocity, or the resting membrane potential. There is a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval and the corrected QT interval (QTc). Because of this, many practitioners will initiate dofetilide therapy only on individuals under telemetry monitoring or if serial EKG measurements of QT and QTc can be performed. === Pharmacokinetics === Peak plasma concentrations are seen two to three hours after oral dosing when fasting. Dofetilide is well absorbed in its oral form, with a bioavailability of >90%. Intravenous administration of dofetilide is not available in the United States. The elimination half-life of dofetilide is roughly 10 hours; however, this varies based on many physiologic factors (most significantly creatinine clearance), and ranges from 4.8 to 13.5 hours. Due to the significant level of renal elimination (80% unchanged, 20% metabolites), the dose of dofetilide must be adjusted to prevent toxicity due to impaired renal function. Dofetilide is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 enzymes predominantly in the liver and GI tract. This means that it is likely to interact with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, or ketoconazole, resulting in higher and potentially toxic levels of dofetilide. ==== Metabolism ==== A steady-state plasma level of dofetilide is achieved in 2–3 days. 80% of dofetilide is excreted by the kidneys, so the dose of dofetilide should be adjusted in individuals with chronic kidney disease, based on creatinine clearance. In the kidneys, dofetilide is eliminated via cation exchange (secretion). Agents that interfere with the renal cation exchange system, such as verapamil, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide, itraconazole, ketoconazole, prochlorperazine, and trimethoprim should not be administered to individuals taking dofetilide. About 20 percent of dofetilide is metabolized in the liver via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Drugs that interfere with the activity of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme can increase serum dofetilide levels. If the renal cation exchange system is interfered with (as with the medications listed above), a larger percentage of dofetilide is cleared via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme system. == History == After its initial US FDA approval, due to the pro-arrhythmic potential, it was only made available to hospitals and prescribers that had received education and undergone specific training in the risks of treatment with dofetilide; however, this restriction was subsequently removed in 2016. == See also == Antiarrhythmic agents Cardiac action potential Electrocardiogram == References ==",Dofetilida,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4570634852570947e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -3.755022044060752e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601235.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Dofetilide: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601235.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1981,"('Amiodarone (hydrochloride)', 'Amiodarone', 'Cordarone', 'Amiodarona', 'Amiodaronum')",Medical,"Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat and prevent a number of types of cardiac dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and wide complex tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin. Common side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the fetus or the infant. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again. Amiodarone was first made in 1961 and came into medical use in 1962 for chest pain believed to be related to the heart. It was pulled from the market in 1967 due to side effects. In 1974 it was found to be useful for arrhythmias and reintroduced. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the long-term suppression of arrhythmias. Amiodarone is commonly used to treat different types of abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial arrhythmias (supraventricular arrhythmias) and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias are terms often used interchangeably to refer to abnormal heart rhythms originating from the upper chambers of the heart, known as the atria. These types of arrhythmias include conditions such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. They are collectively referred to as supraventricular or atrial arrhythmias because they occur above (supra) the ventricles in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Ventricular arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart. These arrhythmias can be potentially life-threatening and may disrupt the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Amiodarone can be effective in treating conditions like ventricular fibrillation (a rapid and irregular heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat originating from the lower chambers), and cardiac arrest due to shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. In cases where a patient is experiencing shock-resistant ventricular arrhythmias including stable ventricular tachycardia or unstable ventricular fibrillation, amiodarone may be used. A recent study suggested that another antiarrhythmic, procainamide, may be more effective in stopping ventricular tachycardia – with less side effects and a higher survival rate in patients requiring multiple shocks. However, due to a small sample size and lack of statistical significance, more evidence is required, and amiodarone remains the drug of choice in ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone is also commonly used as the first-line therapy for patients who receive shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators caused by ventricular arrhythmias. Combining amiodarone with beta-blockers has been shown to reduce the likelihood of experiencing inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators. === Cardiac arrest === Defibrillation is the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. While amiodarone has been used in shock-refractory cases, evidence of benefit is poor. Although amiodarone does not appear to improve survival in those who had a cardiac arrest in-hospital, some studies suggested that early administration of amiodarone was associated with better survival and positive outcomes for people who had a cardiac arrest out-of-hospital. === Ventricular tachycardia === Amiodarone may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in certain instances. Individuals with hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia should not initially receive amiodarone. These individuals should be cardioverted. Amiodarone can be used in individuals with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia. In these cases, amiodarone can be used regardless of the individual's underlying heart function and the type of ventricular tachycardia; it can be used in individuals with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, but is contraindicated in individuals with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as it is associated with a prolonged QT interval which will be made worse with anti-arrhythmic drugs. === Atrial fibrillation === Individuals who have undergone open heart surgery are at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (or AF) in the first few days post-procedure. In the ARCH trial, intravenous amiodarone (2 g administered over 2 d) has been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery when compared to placebo. However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy and have shown potentially fatal side effects such as pulmonary toxicities. While amiodarone is not approved for AF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is a commonly prescribed off-label treatment due to the lack of equally effective treatment alternatives. So-called 'acute onset atrial fibrillation', defined by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2003, responds well to short-duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low. Amiodarone is an effective, antiarrhythmic-of-choice in achieving cardioversion to sinus rhythm in critical care populations with new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). However, other anti-arrhythmic agents may exert superior rhythm control, rate control and lower mortality rate which may be more favourable than amiodarone in specific cases. == Contraindications == Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are strongly advised not to take amiodarone. Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking the drug are advised to stop nursing. It is contraindicated in individuals with sinus nodal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and second or third-degree heart block who do not have an artificial pacemaker. Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated. Formulations of amiodarone that contain benzyl alcohol should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol may cause the potentially fatal ""gasping syndrome"". Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by digitalis toxicity. Contraindications of amiodarone also include: hypersensitivity to amiodarone or any of its components; severe hepatic impairment; sinus node dysfunction, including severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, since amiodarone can cause significant bradycardia and sinus nodal arrest; second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, due to its negative chronotropic (affecting the heart rate) and dromotropic (affecting the conductivity) effects on the AV conduction system, unless a pacemaker is implanted; thyrotoxicosis that cannot be controlled by conventional means, such as Graves' disease. There are no specific guidelines for endurance or high-intensity exercise while taking amiodarone. However, since amiodarone may cause bradycardia and QTc prolongation which can affect exercise capacity and increase the risk of arrhythmias during intense exercise, it would generally be advisable for patients taking this medication to consult their healthcare provider before engaging in high-intensity physical activities such as strenuous endurance exercises. == Side effects == At oral doses of 400 mg per day or higher, amiodarone can have serious, varied side effects, including toxicity to the thyroid gland, liver, lung, and retinal functions, requiring clinical surveillance and regular laboratory testing. Allergic reactions to amiodarone may occur. Most individuals administered amiodarone on a chronic basis will experience at least one side effect. In some people, daily use of amiodarone at 100 mg oral doses can be effective for arrhythmia control with no or minimal side effects. Some common side effects include: nausea and vomiting; taste disturbances (changes in taste perception, often described as a metallic or bitter taste in the mouth); photosensitivity of the skin, also known as photodermatitis, where exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation may lead to skin reactions such as rashes or sunburn-like symptoms; corneal microdeposits (deposits may accumulate on the cornea over time, resulting in blurred vision or visual halos—bright circles or rings around a light source, such as headlights; still, these corneal deposits typically do not affect vision significantly); thyroid dysfunction (in approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; the drug can lead to both hypo- and hyperthyroidism); pulmonary toxicity (lung problems such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease may occur rarely but have the potential for serious consequences if left untreated); liver abnormalities (liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and hepatotoxicity, although severe cases are rare); bradycardia and heart block (since it slows down heart rate by affecting the sinus node function and AV conduction system, it can increase the risk of heart block); QT Interval prolongation. Amiodarone can potentially cause renal toxicity, but solid studies on whether amiodarone may be toxic to the kidneys are lacking. === Lung === Side effects of oral amiodarone at doses of 400 mg or higher include various pulmonary effects. The most serious reaction is interstitial lung disease. Risk factors include high cumulative dose, more than 400 milligrams per day, duration over two months, increased age, and preexisting pulmonary disease. Some individuals were noted to develop pulmonary fibrosis after a week of treatment, while others did not develop it after years of continuous use. Common practice is to avoid the agent if possible in individuals with decreased lung function. The most specific test of pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone is a dramatically decreased DLCO noted on pulmonary function testing. === Thyroid === Induced abnormalities in thyroid function are common. In approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur. Amiodarone is structurally similar to thyroxine and also contains iodine. Both of these factors contribute to the effects of amiodarone on thyroid function. Amiodarone also causes an anti-thyroid action, via Plummer and Wolff–Chaikoff effects, due its large amount of iodine in its molecule, which causes a particular ""cardiac hypothyroidism"" with bradycardia and arrhythmia. Thyroid function should be checked at least every six months. Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which compared amiodarone with other medications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5–10 mU/L) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or sotalol). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/L) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within the first six months of amiodarone treatment. Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), can be caused due to the high iodine content in the drug via the Jod-Basedow effect. This is known as Type 1 AIT, and usually occurs in patients with an underlying predisposition to hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, within weeks to months after starting amiodarone. Type 1 AIT is usually treated with anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy. Type 2 AIT is caused by a destructive thyroiditis due to a direct toxic effect of amiodarone on thyroid follicular epithelial cells. Type 2 AIT can occur even years after starting amiodarone, is usually self-limited and responds to anti-inflammatory treatment such as corticosteroids. In practice, often the type of AIT is undetermined or presumed as mixed with both treatments combined. Thyroid uptake measurements (I-123 or I-131), which are used to differentiate causes of hyperthyroidism, are generally unreliable in patients who have been taking amiodarone. Because of the high iodine content of amiodarone, the thyroid gland is effectively saturated, thus preventing further uptake of isotopes of iodine. However, positive radioactive iodine can be used to rule in type 1AIT . === Eye === Corneal micro-deposits (cornea verticillata, also called vortex or whorl keratopathy) are almost universally present (over 90%) in individuals taking amiodarone longer than 6 months, especially doses greater than 400 mg/day. These deposits typically do not cause any symptoms. About 1 in 10 individuals may complain of a bluish halo. Anterior subcapsular lens deposits are relatively common (50%) in higher doses (greater than 600 mg/day) after 6 months of treatment. Optic neuropathy, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION), occurs in 1–2% of people and is not dosage dependent. Bilateral optic disc swelling and mild and reversible visual field defects can also occur. Loss of eyelashes has been linked to amiodarone use. === Liver === Abnormal liver enzyme results are common in people taking amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). In clinical observations, it has been noted that the administration of amiodarone, even at lower therapeutic doses, has been associated with the development of a condition mimicking alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition, often referred to as pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis, presents with similar histopathological features to those observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, this extreme adverse event manifestation—pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis caused by low dose amiodarone—is very rare. === Skin === Long-term administration of amiodarone (usually more than eighteen months) is associated with a light-sensitive blue-grey discoloration of the skin, sometimes called ceruloderma; such patients should avoid exposure to the sun and use sunscreen that protects against ultraviolet-A and -B. The discoloration will slowly improve upon cessation of the medication, however, the skin color may not return completely. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use during pregnancy may result in a number of problems in the infant including thyroid problems, heart problems, neurological problems, and preterm birth. Use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended though one dose may be okay. === Other === Long-term use of amiodarone has been associated with peripheral neuropathies. Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for epididymitis. Amiodarone accumulates in the head of the organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped. Some cases of gynecomastia have been reported in men on amiodarone. A retrospective cohort study found an increased risk of digestive, liver, head and neck and liver cancers amongst male patients exposed to amiodarone versus female participants in the same study and the general population. This study also identified that the Standardized Incidence Ratio of cancer occurrence increased significantly in males aged 20-59 and >80 years old who were exposed to a higher dose of Amiodarone in comparison to those exposed to a lower dose. This suggests that there is a dose-effect relationship. These results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the study design and care should be taken prior to altering current clinical and prescribing practices. Amiodarone and its effect on cancer is still a topic that requires more robust research. == Drug-drug interactions == The pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs, including many that are commonly administered to individuals with heart disease, are affected by amiodarone. Amiodarone has particularly important interactions with the following drugs: class I antiarrhythmics (amiodarone should not be combined with other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, etc., due to an increased risk of QTc prolongation and potential arrhythmias); beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (combining amiodarone with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, such as sotalol, can further slow down heart rate and cause bradycardia or heart block); digoxin (amiodarone inhibits a protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which transports digoxin out of cells in the gut, liver, and kidneys, therefore, concurrent use of these medications increases digoxin levels in the body, potentially leading to digoxin toxicity); statins (amiodarone can inhibit enzymes in the liver responsible for metabolizing certain statins, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, etc., therefore interaction elevates plasma concentrations of these statins, increasing the risk of myopathy, that is muscle damage, or rhabdomyolysis, that is severe muscle breakdown); warfarin (since the anticoagulation effects of warfarin depend on metabolism of warfarin by both cytochromes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, coadministation leads to rise in international normalized ratio (INR)—the amount of time taken for the blood to form a clot—placing patient at higher bleeding risks); Amiodarone potentiates the action of warfarin by inhibiting the clearance of both (S) and (R) warfarin. Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin doses adjusted based on their dosing of amiodarone and have their anticoagulation status (measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) measured more frequently. Dose reduction of warfarin is as follows: 40% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 400 mg daily, 35% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 300 mg daily, 30% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 200 mg daily, and 25% reduction if amiodarone dose is 100 mg daily. The effect of amiodarone on the warfarin concentrations can be as early as a few days after initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks; anti-HIV medications (several HIV medications, such as ritonavir, indinavir, etc., interact with amiodarone by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzyme hence leading to decreased clearance of amiodarone, i.e., increasing the concentration of amiodarone in the organism). Amiodarone inhibits the action of the cytochrome P450 isozyme family; such inhibition reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following: ciclosporin, digoxin, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, sildenafil, simvastatin, theophylline, warfarin. In 2015, Gilead Sciences warned healthcare providers about people who began taking the hepatitis C drugs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir along with amiodarone, who developed abnormally slow heartbeats or died of cardiac arrest. == Metabolism == Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, therefore, amiodarone and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs that depend on cytochrome P450, such as digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, etc. The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic properties. The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by grapefruit, leading to elevated serum levels of amiodarone. On 8 August 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure or death, when simvastatin is used with amiodarone. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg. This drug combination, especially with higher doses of simvastatin, should be avoided. Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway of amiodarone is by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. The metabolism of amiodaron can be characterized by two phases: phase I metabolism, when amiodarone undergoes oxidative processes mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8; these reactions result in the formation of several active metabolites, including desethylamiodarone (DEA) and di-desethylamiodarone (DDEA); DEA is the most abundant metabolite and exhibits similar pharmacological effects as amiodarone; phase II metabolism, when both amiodarone and its major metabolite DEA can undergo conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid; this process increases water solubility of these compounds for their efficient elimination from the body. Amiodarone has an exceptionally long half-life due to a combination of several factors: high lipid solubility, given that amiodarone has high lipid solubility, which allows it to distribute throughout various tissues in the body rapidly; the extensive tissue distribution of amiodarone contributes to a large volume of distribution that leads to slow clearance from plasma compartments; extensive tissue binding, so that amiodarone extensively binds to different tissues, including fat deposits, muscles, heart tissue, and other organs; this binding creates reservoirs where drug release can occur slowly over time, resulting in an extended duration of action even after stopping the therapy; enterohepatic recycling, meaning that amiodarone undergoes enterohepatic recycling, where it is reabsorbed from the intestines after being excreted into bile, which contributes to its prolonged presence. === Excretion === Excretion is primarily via the liver and the bile duct with almost no elimination via the kidney and it is not dialyzable. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25 to 100 days [Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st edition]) for amiodarone and 36 days for the active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA). There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as a presence in breast milk. Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i.e. liver, lungs), therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months. Whereas amiodarone is primarily eliminated from the body through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, a very small portion of amiodarone and its metabolites are excreted unchanged in urine or feces. The liver plays a significant role in the elimination of amiodarone. After being extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, amiodarone is transported into bile via multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) transporter. Bile containing amiodarone and its metabolites is then released into the gastrointestinal tract. Some of these compounds can be reabsorbed back into systemic circulation through enterohepatic recirculation, where they may undergo additional rounds of metabolism before eventually being excreted again into bile. Because renal excretion contributes only minimally to the elimination of amiodarone, dose adjustment based on kidney function is generally not necessary. This is because most patients with normal renal function can adequately clear the drug through hepatic metabolism and biliary elimination pathways. == Pharmacology == Amiodarone is categorized as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability. It has numerous other effects, however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Amiodarone is a blocker of voltage gated potassium (KCNH2) and voltage gated calcium channels (CACNA2D2). Amiodarone slows the conduction rate and prolongs the refractory period of the SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibers without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. Amiodarone has been shown to prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive β-adrenergic inhibitor. It also shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, via sodium-channel effects. It is suggested that amiodarone may also exacerbate the phenotype associated with Long QT-3 syndrome causing mutations such as ∆KPQ. This effect is due to a combination of blocking the peak sodium current, but also contributing to an increased persistent sodium current. Amiodarone chemically resembles thyroxine (thyroid hormone), and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions. The mechanisms of action of amiodarone include blocking potassium ion channels (prolonging repolarization), blocking sodium ion channels, and antagonizing alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The action of amiodarone can be characterized by the following effects: potassium channel blockade, since amiodarone blocks potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization during phase 3 of the action potential, so that this blockade prolongs the duration of cardiac action potentials, resulting in an increased refractory period and decreased excitability; sodium channel blockade, characterized by inhibiting sodium ion influx through voltage-gated sodium channels, so that amiodarone reduces the conduction velocity of electrical impulses in cardiac tissue that leads to a slowed heart rate and improved rhythm control; calcium channel blockade, by inhibiting L-type calcium channels in myocardial cells, decreasing intracellular calcium concentration during ventricular contraction; noncompetitive adrenergic receptor antagonism, meaning that amiodarone has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonistic effects, which help reduce sympathetic stimulation on the heart. == History == The original observation that amiodarone's progenitor molecule, khellin, had cardioactive properties, was made by the Russian physiologist Gleb von Anrep while working in Cairo in 1946. Khellin is obtained from a plant extract of Khella or Ammi visnaga, a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments. This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound. Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, Belgium, by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for angina pectoris. As a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and sotalol had antiarrhythmic properties and belonged to a new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular functions with K+ channels. Based on Singh's work, the Argentinian physician Mauricio Rosenbaum began using amiodarone to treat his patients who have supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results. Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh's theories, physicians in the United States began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was reluctant to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown an increased incidence of serious pulmonary side effects of the drug. In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians if it was not approved. In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias. === Name === Amiodarone may be an acronym for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-[4-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-3,5-diiodophenyl]methanone, where ar is a placeholder for phenyl. This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone, where the arylmethanone is conserved. == Dosing == Amiodarone is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Orally, it is available under the brand names Pacerone (produced by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.) and Cordarone (produced by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). It is also available under the brand name Aratac (produced by Alphapharm Pty Ltd) in Australia and New Zealand, and further in Australia under the brands Cardinorm and Rithmik as well as a number of generic brands. Also Arycor in South Africa (Produced by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals.). In South America, it is known as Atlansil and is produced by Roemmers. In India, amiodarone is marketed (produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) under the brand name Tachyra. It is also available in intravenous ampules and vials. The dose of amiodarone administered is tailored to the individual and the dysrhythmia that is being treated. When administered orally, the bioavailability of amiodarone is quite variable. Absorption ranges from 22 to 95%, with better absorption when it is given with food. == References ==",Cordarone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014923889830242842), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0012018608395010233)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;https://www.drugs.com/pro/cordarone.html ', [])"
