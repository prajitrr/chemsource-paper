(2'R-cis)-2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) is substantially less toxic than its optical antipode, and is undergoing development for the therapy of HIV infection. Cytidine deaminase from Escherichia coli is shown here to deaminate 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine enantioselectively to leave 3TC essentially optically pure. This reaction has been used to develop a process for production of 3TC in multikilogram amounts. The production of cytidine deaminase was enhanced by strain improvement, fermentation development, and finally by cloning and overexpression of the gene. The enzyme was immobilized on Eupergit-C, which allowed it to be reused many times. The biotransformation conditions were optimized so that the best use could be made of the catalyst. A robust scaleable product isolation process was developed to yield the crystalline product. Overall, yields through the resolution process of 76% were obtained. All aspects of this process are capable of substantial further scaleup with only minor modifications. 2',3'-Dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine (FTC) has been shown to be a potent and selective compound against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in acutely infected primary human lymphocytes. FTC is also active against human immunodeficiency virus type 2, simian immunodeficiency virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus in various cell culture systems, including human monocytes. The antiviral activity can be prevented by 2'-deoxycytidine, but not by other natural nucleosides, suggesting that FTC must be phosphorylated to be active and 2'-deoxycytidine kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation. By using chiral columns or enzymatic techniques, the two enantiomers of FTC were separated. The (-)-beta-enantiomer of FTC was about 20-fold more potent than the (+)-beta-enantiomer against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and was also effective in thymidine kinase-deficient CEM cells. Racemic FTC and its enantiomers were nontoxic to human lymphocytes and other cell lines at concentrations of up to 100 microM. Studies with human bone marrow cells indicated that racemic FTC and its (-)-enantiomer had a median inhibitory concentration of > 30 microM. The (+)-enantiomer was significantly more toxic than the (-)-enantiomer to myeloid progenitor cells. The susceptibilities to FTC of pretherapy isolates in comparison with those of posttherapy 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine-resistant viruses in human lymphocytes were not substantially different. Similar results were obtained with well-defined 2',3'-dideoxyinosine- and nevirapine-resistant viruses. (-)-FTC-5'-triphosphate competitively inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase, with an inhibition constant of 2.9 microM, when a poly(I)n.oligo(dC)19-24 template primer was used. These results suggest that further development of the (-)-Beta-enantiomer of FTC is warranted as an antiviral agent for infections caused by human immunodeficiency viruses. Two cis stereoisomers of 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (SddC) were investigated for their activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia H-9 cells. (-)-SddC is six times more potent against HIV-1 and at least 1.7-fold less cytotoxic than (+)-SddC. Metabolism studies showed that the intracellular accumulation of the active triphosphate form of (-)-SddC is more than 2-fold greater than that of (+)-SddCTP in H-9 cells. In contrast, (+)-SddCTP is approximately 1.5 times more potent than (-)-SddCTP as an inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using a rRNA template (Ki = 0.22 and 0.034 microM, respectively) and gapped DNA (Ki = 0.53 and 1.02 microM, respectively). The enantiomers are comparable as substrates for incorporation into DNA by the RNA-dependent HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; however, neither analog is incorporated as readily as dCTP. The above observations do not explain the difference in the anti-HIV potency between the enantiomers. A novel 3'-5' exonuclease was partially purified from the cytosol of H-9 cells and assayed for the removal of (+)- and (-)-SddCMP-terminated DNA. Removal of (+)-SddCMP was approximately two to three times faster from 3'-terminals of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, whereas on DNA/RNA substrates, the exonucleolytic cleavage of (+)-SddCMP proceeded approximately six times faster than that of (-)-SddCMP. This result correlates with the observed difference in the anti-HIV effect between the two compounds and suggests that this novel enzyme may be an important determinant of their antiviral activities.","Lamivudine, cis-",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012706785928457975), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03806046396493912)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Lamivudine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine?utm_source=openai')])"

4264,"('Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride', 'Cyclobenzaprine hcl', 'Flexeril', 'Flexiban', 'Lisseril')",Medical,"Cyclobenzaprine, sold under several brand names including, historically, Flexeril, is a muscle relaxer used for muscle spasms from musculoskeletal conditions of sudden onset. It is not useful in cerebral palsy. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, feeling tired, dizziness, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include an irregular heartbeat. There is no evidence of harm in pregnancy, but it has not been well studied in this population. It should not be used together with MAOIs. How it works is unclear. In any case, it is known to inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and to block serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Chemically, it is very similar to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline. Cyclobenzaprine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available by prescription as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 45th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. It was not available in the United Kingdom as of 2012. == Medical uses == Cyclobenzaprine is used, in conjunction with physical therapy, to treat muscle spasms that occur because of acute musculoskeletal conditions. After sustaining an injury, muscle spasms occur to stabilize the affected body part, which may increase pain to prevent further damage. Cyclobenzaprine is used to treat such muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It decreases pain in the first two weeks, peaking in the first few days, but has no proven benefit after two weeks. Since no benefit is proven beyond that, therapy should not be continued long-term. It is the best-studied muscle relaxer. It is not useful for spasticity due to neurologic conditions such as cerebral palsy. It may also be used along with other treatments for tetanus. === Comparison to other medications === Cyclobenzaprine has been found not to be inferior to tizanidine, orphenadrine, and carisoprodol in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none have been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines. However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and ataxia are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics. In a study on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain treatment with cyclobenzaprine alone or in combination with ibuprofen, no significant differences in pain scores were noted among the three treatment groups. Peak benefit was found to occur on day seven of the treatment for all groups. == Side effects == Cyclobenzaprine results in increased rates of drowsiness (38%), dry mouth (24%), and dizziness (10%). Drowsiness and dry mouth appear to intensify with increasing dose. The sedative effects of cyclobenzaprine are likely due to its antagonistic effect on histamine, serotonin, and muscarinic receptors. Agitation is a common side effect observed, especially in the elderly. Some experts believe that cyclobenzaprine should be avoided in elderly patients because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment. In general, the National Committee for Quality Assurance recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects. Dysphagia, a life-threatening side-effect, may rarely occur. Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related tricyclic, such as tricyclic antidepressants. == Overdose == The most common effects of overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia. Rare but potentially critical complications are cardiac arrest, abnormal heart rhythms, severe low blood pressure, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Life-threatening overdose is rare, however, as the median lethal dose is about 338 milligrams/kilogram in mice and 425 mg/kg in rats. The potential harm is increased when central nervous system depressants and antidepressants are also used; deliberate overdose often includes other drugs. == Interactions == Cyclobenzaprine has major contraindications with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). At least one study also found increased risk of serotonin syndrome when cyclobenzaprine was taken with the serotonergic drugs duloxetine or phenelzine. These substances may interact with cyclobenzaprine: Central nervous system depressants (e.g. alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines, phenothiazines, carbamates, barbiturates, major tranquilizers) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors taken within two weeks of cyclobenzaprine may result in serious, life-threatening side effects. Cyclobenzaprine may affect the medications used in surgical sedation and some surgeons request that patients temporarily discontinue its use prior to surgery. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant with a chemical structure that is very similar to those of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. Its known actions include serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonism, α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, histamine H1 receptor noncompetitive antagonism, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism. In terms of its antimuscarinic activity, it is said to be an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine M1, M2, and M3 receptors, but not of the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 or M5 receptor. The mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine as a muscle relaxant is unknown. However, it may work through modulating the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. The antihistamine activity of cyclobenzaprine is thought to play a major role in its sedative effects. Similarly to tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine shows antidepressant-like effects in animals. === Pharmacokinetics === Cyclobenzaprine has an oral bioavailability of about 55% and approximately 93% is bound to proteins in plasma. Its metabolite norcyclobenzaprine (NCBP) is active. The elimination half-life of cyclobenzaprine is 18 hours and it has a clearance of 0.7 L/min. == Chemistry == Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic compound of the dibenzocycloheptene group. It is very similar in chemical structure to tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine, which are likewise dibenzocycloheptenes. Cyclobenzaprine differs from amitriptyline in structure only by the presence of a single double bond within the tricyclic ring system. == Society and culture == === Formulations === By mouth, cyclobenzaprine is marketed as Apo-Cyclobenzaprine, Fexmid, Flexeril and Novo-Cycloprine. It is available in generic form. A once-a-day, extended-release formulation, Amrix, is available. Cyclobenzaprine is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical creams. == Research == === Fibromyalgia === A 2004 review found benefit for fibromyalgia symptoms, with a reported number needed to treat of 4.8 (meaning that 1 person out of every 4.8 benefits from treatment) for pain reduction, but no change in fatigue or tender points. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to justify its use in myofascial pain syndrome. Two Phase 3 clinical trials reported that an experimental sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102 SL, was able to reduce pain and improve sleep quality in patients with fibromyalgia. The RESILIENT trial reported significant reductions in daily pain and improvements in various fibromyalgia symptoms, including fatigue and depressive symptoms, compared to placebo. A separate Phase 3 clinical trial evaluated TNX-102 SL in patients with military-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and reported the drug did not provide a sustained, significant improvement in overall PTSD severity, but it did demonstrate improvements in sleep quality during the 12-week trial. == References == == External links ==",Flexiban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.320462075062096e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004409771354403347)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00861456897109747)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacycode.com](https://pharmacycode.com/Flexiban.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Flexiban - Tranquilizing Agents, Muscle Relaxants, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic, Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, ATC:M03BX08', type='url_citation', url='https://pharmacycode.com/Flexiban.html?utm_source=openai')])"

No safe and effective radioprotector or mitigator has yet been approved for clinical therapy. Here, we investigated the potential protective effects of fresh biomass of  In cyanobacteria, the nitrogen and carbon metabolisms are functionally bridged and consequently respond to the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Consequently, a nitrogen deficiency results in carbon excess. For the first time, the biological adaptation of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 to nitrogen starvation has been deeply characterized at the cellular structure scale. The results indicated that the carbon excess is rerouted into carbon storage granules, such as the polyhydroxyalkanoate and glycogen granules corroborating existing data. Additionally, this photosynthetic organism hugely secreted exopolysaccharides, which could constitute another biological carbon reservoir. It has been reported that few cells in trichomes of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 still display a high level of fluorescence after a long-term nitrogen starvation. The transmission electron microscopy showed that some cells still contained thylakoids and phycobilisomes after this long-term nitrogen starvation, which could explain the remaining fluorescence. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that play a crucial role in the Earth's nitrogen and carbon cycles. Nitrogen availability is one of the most important factors in cyanobacterial growth. Interestingly, filamentous non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria, such as Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005, have developed survival strategies that enable them to adapt to nitrogen deprivation. Metabolic studies recently demonstrated a substantial synthesis and accumulation of glycogen derived from amino acids during nitrogen starvation. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of this adaptation is poorly understood. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first proteomic and cellular analysis of Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005 under nitrogen depletion. Label-free differential proteomic analysis indicated the global carbon and nitrogen reprogramming of the cells during nitrogen depletion as characterized by an upregulation of glycogen synthesis and the use of endogenous nitrogen sources. The degradation of proteins and cyanophycin provided endogenous nitrogen when exogenous nitrogen was limited. Moreover, formamides, cyanates and urea were also potential endogenous nitrogen sources. The transporters of some amino acids and alternative nitrogen sources such as ammonium permease 1 were induced under nitrogen depletion. Intriguingly, although Arthrospira is a non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium, we observed the upregulation of HetR and HglK proteins, which are involved in heterocyst differentiation.

4267,"('Isoprenaline hydrochloride', 'Isuprel', 'Isoprenaline hcl', 'Euspiran', 'Aerolone')",Medical,"Isoprenaline, also known as isoproterenol and sold under the brand name Isuprel among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used in the treatment of acute bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block, and rarely for asthma, among other indications. It is used by injection into a vein, muscle, fat, or the heart, by inhalation, and in the past under the tongue or into the rectum. Side effects of isoprenaline include rapid heart beat, heart palpitations, and arrhythmias, among others. Isoprenaline is a selective agonist of the β-adrenergic receptors, including both the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. By activating these receptors, it increases heart rate and the force of heart contractions. Chemically, isoprenaline is a synthetic catecholamine and is the N-isopropyl analogue of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). Isoprenaline was one of the first synthetic sympathomimetic amines and was the first selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist. The medication was discovered in 1940 and was introduced for medical use in 1947. == Medical uses == Isoprenaline is used to treat heart block and episodes of Adams–Stokes syndrome that are not caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, in emergencies for cardiac arrest until electric shock can be administered, for bronchospasm occurring during anesthesia, and as an adjunct in the treatment of hypovolemic shock, septic shock, low cardiac output (hypoperfusion) states, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. It is also used to prevent Torsades de Pointes in patients with long QT refractory to magnesium and to treat patients with intermittent Torsades de Pointes refractory to treatment with magnesium. Isoprenaline is used in the acute management of bradycardia, though not in the chronic treatment of bradycardia. Historically, it was used to treat asthma via metered aerosol or nebulizing devices; it was also available in sublingual, oral, intravenous, and intramuscular formulations. The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel recommends against its use as a nebulizer for acute bronchoconstriction. === Available forms === Many formulations of isoprenaline appear to have been discontinued in the United States and many other countries. In the United States, it remains available only as an injectable solution. It was previously also available in the United States as a solution, metered aerosol, powder, or disc for inhalation and as a tablet for sublingual and rectal administration, but these formulations were discontinued. == Contraindications == It should not be used in people with tachyarrhythmias (except in special circumstances), tachycardia or heart block caused by digitalis poisoning, ventricular arrhythmias which require inotropic therapy, or with angina. == Side effects == Side effects of isoprenaline may include nervousness, headache, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, tachycardia, palpitations, angina, Adams-Stokes attacks, pulmonary edema, hypertension, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, difficulty breathing, sweating, mild tremors, weakness, flushing, and pallor. Isoprenaline has been reported to cause insulin resistance leading to diabetic ketoacidosis. == Overdose == Overdose of isoprenaline may produce effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, angina, hypotension, hypertension, and myocardial necrosis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Isoprenaline is a β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor full agonist and has almost no activity at the α-adrenergic receptors at lower concentrations. It has similar affinity for the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. At higher concentrations, isoprenaline can also evoke responses mediated by α-adrenergic receptors. Its agonist effects at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) additionally provide it with pharmacodynamic effects that resemble those of the endogenous trace amines, like tyramine. Isoprenaline's effects on the cardiovascular system (non-selective) relate to its actions on cardiac β1-adrenergic receptors and β2-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle within the tunica media of arterioles. Isoprenaline has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart. β2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation in arteriolar smooth muscle induces vasodilation. Its inotropic and chronotropic effects elevate systolic blood pressure, while its vasodilatory effects tend to lower diastolic blood pressure. The overall effect is to decrease mean arterial pressure due to the vasodilation caused by β2-adrenergic receptor activation. The isopropylamine group in isoprenaline makes it selective for β-adrenergic receptors. The adverse effects of isoprenaline are also related to the drug's cardiovascular effects. Isoprenaline can produce tachycardia (an elevated heart rate), which predisposes people who take it to cardiac arrhythmias. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Data on the absorption of isoprenaline are limited. Oral isoprenaline is well-absorbed but is subject to strong first-pass metabolism and is approximately 1,000 times less potent than intravenous administration. Hence, its oral bioavailability is very low. Another study suggested that its oral bioavailability, based on pharmacodynamic activity via different routes, was slightly less than 4%. ==== Distribution ==== Isoprenaline is minimally able to cross the blood–brain barrier and hence is a peripherally selective drug. This is attributed to its high hydrophilicity. Whereas the extraction of isoprenaline in a single passage of the brain circulation following intravenous injection in humans was 3.8%, the extraction of propranolol, which is a more lipophilic compound and is readily able to cross into the brain, was 63.0%. The plasma protein binding of isoprenaline is 68.8 ± 1.2%. It is bound mainly to albumin. ==== Metabolism ==== Isoprenaline is metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) and conjugation by sulfation. It does not appear to be glucuronidated. There is very large interindividual variability in the sulfation of isoprenaline. The free catechol hydroxyl groups keep it susceptible to enzymatic metabolism. The drug is a poor substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. This is in contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine. Isoprenaline is much more strongly metabolized and conjugated with oral administration than with intravenous administration. Its metabolite 3-O-methylisoprenaline, formed by COMT, is active as a weak β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. ==== Elimination ==== Isoprenaline is excreted primarily in the urine, as sulfate conjugates. It is excreted 59 to 107% in urine and 12 to 27% in feces. A majority of isoprenaline is excreted in urine in conjugated form, whereas 6.5 to 16.2% is excreted as unchanged isoprenaline and 2.6 to 11.4% is excreted as 3-O-methylisoprenaline and conjugates. The elimination half-life of isoprenaline by intravenous administration is approximately 2.5 to 5 minutes. Its half-life with oral administration is approximately 40 minutes. == Chemistry == Isoprenaline, also known as N-isopropyl-3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine or as N-isopropylnorepinephrine, is a substituted phenethylamine and synthetic catecholamine derivative. It is the N-isopropyl analogue of norepinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine) and epinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine). Isoprenaline is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C11H17NO3 and a molecular weight of 211.26 g/mol. It is a hydrophilic compound with a predicted log P of -0.6 to 0.25. For comparison, the experimental log P values of epinephrine and norepinephrine are -1.37 and -1.24, respectively. Isoprenaline is used pharmaceutically as the hydrochloride and sulfate salts. It is also used to a much lesser extent as the free base. Isoprenaline is a racemic mixture of levorotatory and dextrorotatory enantiomers. The levorotatory or (R)-enantiomer of isoprenaline is known as levisoprenaline (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name) but was never marketed. Synthetic analogues closely related to isoprenaline include arbutamine, dichloroisoprenaline (dichloroisoproterenol), hexoprenaline, isoetharine (α-ethylisoprenaline), orciprenaline (metaproterenol; a positional isomer of isoprenaline), prenalterol, and soterenol (3-methanesulfonamidylisoprenaline), among others. == History == Isoprenaline was discovered in 1940 and was developed in the 1940s. It was first approved for medical use in 1947 in the United States. Isoprenaline was one of the first synthetic sympathomimetic amines, was the first selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist, and was the first major sympathomimetic agent devoid of pressor effects. Between 1963 and 1968 in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand there was an increase in deaths among people using isoprenaline to treat asthma. This was attributed to unintentional overdose: the inhalers produced in that area were dispensing five times the dosage dispensed by inhalers produced in the United States and Canada, where the deaths were not observed. The short duration of action and poor oral activity of isoprenaline led to the development of the much longer-acting and orally active orciprenaline (metaproterenol). == Society and culture == === Names === Isoprenaline is the major generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. Isoprenalina is its Italian generic name and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. Isoprenaline hydrochloride and isoprenaline sulfate are its BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts, respectively. Isoproterenol is another important synonym of the drug. Isoproterenol hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt and isoproterenol sulfate is its USAN and JAN in the case of the sulfate salt. Other synonyms of the drug include isopropylnorepinephrine, isopropylnoradrenaline, and isopropydine. It is additionally known by the former developmental code name WIN-5162. Isoprenaline has been marketed under many brand names worldwide. These include Aleudrina, Asthpul, Iludrin, Iprenol, Isomenyl, Isuprel, Isoprenaline, Isoprenalina, Isoproterenol, Neo-Epinine, Neodrenal, Proternol, and Saventrine, among others. It is also marketed as a combination drug with cromoglicic acid as Frenal Compositum, in combination with pronase as Isopal P, and in combination with atropine as Stmerin D. == References ==",Aerolone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01568903587758541), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011230352334678173)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4268,"('Vinblastine sulfate', 'Velsar', 'Vinblastine (sulfate)', 'Velban', 'Velbe')",Medical,"Vinblastine, sold under the brand name Velban among others, is a chemotherapy medication, typically used with other medications, to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, melanoma, and testicular cancer. It is given by injection into a vein. Most people experience some side effects. Commonly it causes a change in sensation, constipation, weakness, loss of appetite, and headaches. Severe side effects include low blood cell counts and shortness of breath. It should not be given to people who have a current bacterial infection. Use during pregnancy will likely harm the baby. Vinblastine works by blocking cell division. Vinblastine was isolated in 1958. An example of a natural herbal remedy that has since been developed into a conventional medicine, vinblastine was originally obtained from the Madagascar periwinkle. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Vinblastine is a component of a number of chemotherapy regimens, including ABVD for Hodgkin lymphoma, and along with methotrexate in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). It is also used to treat histiocytosis according to the established protocols of the Histiocytosis Association. == Side effects == Adverse effects of vinblastine include hair loss, loss of white blood cells and blood platelets, gastrointestinal problems, high blood pressure, excessive sweating, depression, muscle cramps, vertigo and headaches. As a vesicant, vinblastine can cause extensive tissue damage and blistering if it escapes from the vein from improper administration. == Pharmacology == Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid and a chemical analogue of vincristine. It binds tubulin, thereby inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. Vinblastine treatment causes M phase specific cell cycle arrest by disrupting microtubule assembly and proper formation of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochore, each of which are necessary for the separation of chromosomes during anaphase of mitosis. Toxicities include bone marrow suppression (which is dose-limiting), gastrointestinal toxicity, potent vesicant (blister-forming) activity, and extravasation injury (forms deep ulcers). Vinblastine paracrystals may be composed of tightly packed unpolymerized tubulin or microtubules. Vinblastine is reported to be an effective component of certain chemotherapy regimens, particularly when used with bleomycin and methotrexate in VBM chemotherapy for Stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphomas. The inclusion of vinblastine allows for lower doses of bleomycin and reduced overall toxicity with larger resting periods between chemotherapy cycles. === Mechanism of action === Microtubule-disruptive drugs like vinblastine, colcemid, and nocodazole have been reported to act by two mechanisms. At very low concentrations they suppress microtubule dynamics and at higher concentrations they reduce microtubule polymer mass. Recent findings indicate that they also produce microtubule fragments by stimulating microtubule minus-end detachment from their organizing centers. Dose-response studies further indicate that enhanced microtubule detachment from spindle poles correlate best with cytotoxicity. But research into the mechanism is still ongoing as recent studies also show vinblastine inducing apoptosis that is phase-independent in certain leukemias. === Pharmacokinetics === Vinblastine appears to be a peripherally selective drug due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. == Isolation and synthesis == Vinblastine may be isolated from the Madagascar Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), its only known biological producer, along with several of its precursors, catharanthine and vindoline. Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed. Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16'S, C14'R stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine. Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20. The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps. In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed by a series of cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry. The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%. Stereochemistry is controlled through a mixture of chiral agents (Sharpless catalysts), and reaction conditions (temperature, and selected enantiopure starting materials). Due to difficulty of stereochemical restraints in total synthetic processes, other semi-synthetic methods from precursors, catharanthine and vindoline, continue to be developed. == History == Vinblastine was first isolated by Robert Noble and Charles Thomas Beer at the University of Western Ontario from the Madagascar periwinkle plant. Vinblastine's utility as a chemotherapeutic agent was first suggested by its effect on the body when an extract of the plant was injected in rabbits to study the plant's supposed anti-diabetic effect. (A tea made from the plant was a folk-remedy for diabetes.) The rabbits died from a bacterial infection, due to a decreased number of white blood cells, so it was hypothesized that vinblastine might be effective against cancers of the white blood cells such as lymphoma. It was approved by FDA in 1965. == References ==",Velbe,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.8742269680369645e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008629531599581242)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4269,"('Malathion', 'Carbophos', 'Carbofos', 'Mercaptothion', 'Karbofos')",Medical,"Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide which acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In the USSR, it was known as carbophos, in New Zealand and Australia as maldison and in South Africa as mercaptothion. == Pesticide use == Malathion is a pesticide that is widely used in agriculture, residential landscaping, public recreation areas, and in public health pest control programs such as mosquito eradication. In the US, it is the most commonly used organophosphate insecticide. A malathion mixture with corn syrup was used in the 1980s in Australia and California to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly. In Canada and the US starting in the early 2000s, malathion was sprayed in many cities to combat west Nile virus. Malathion was used over the last couple of decades on a regular basis during summer months to kill mosquitoes, but homeowners were allowed an exemption for their properties if they chose.. In the United Kingdom, malathion was withdrawn from sale in 2002. == Mechanism of action == Malathion is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, a diverse family of chemicals. Upon uptake into the target organism, it binds irreversibly to the serine residue in the active catalytic site of the cholinesterase enzyme. The resultant phosphoester group is strongly bound to the cholinesterase, and irreversibly deactivates the enzyme which leads to rapid build-up of acetylcholine at the synapse. == Production method == Malathion is produced by the addition of dimethyl dithiophosphoric acid to diethyl maleate or diethyl fumarate. The compound is chiral but is used as a racemate. == Medical use == Malathion in low doses (0.5% preparations) is used as a treatment for: Head lice and body lice. Malathion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of pediculosis. It is claimed to effectively kill both the eggs and the adult lice, but in fact has been shown in UK studies to be only 36% effective on head lice, and less so on their eggs. This low efficiency was noted when malathion was applied to lice found on schoolchildren in the Bristol area in the UK, and is caused by the tested population of lice having developed resistance against malathion. Scabies Preparations include Derbac-M, Prioderm, Quellada-M and Ovide. == Safety == === General === Malathion is of low toxicity. In arthropods it is metabolized into malaoxon which is 61x more toxic, being a more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, no reliable information is available on adverse health effects of chronic exposure. In 1989, Malathion was sprayed over a 1,400 sq mi (3,600 km2) area to control an outbreak of Mediterranean fruit flies in California. In order to demonstrate the chemical's safety, B. T. Collins, director of the California Conservation Corps, publicly swallowed a mouthful of dilute malathion solution. === Carcinogenicity === Malathion is classified by the IARC as probable carcinogen (group 2A). Malathion is classified by US EPA as having ""suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity"". This classification was based on the occurrence of liver tumors at excessive doses in mice and female rats and the presence of rare oral and nasal tumors in rats that occurred following exposure to very large doses. Exposure to organophosphates is associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Malathion used as a fumigant was not associated with increased cancer risk. Between 1993 and 1997, as part of the Agricultural Health Study, no clear association between malathion exposure and cancer was reported. === Amphibians === Malathion is toxic to leopard frog tadpoles. == Risks == Malathion is of low toxicity; however, absorption or ingestion into the human body readily results in its metabolism to malaoxon, which is substantially more toxic. In studies of the effects of long-term exposure to oral ingestion of malaoxon in rats, malaoxon has been shown to be 61 times more toxic than malathion, and malaoxon is 1,000 times more potent than malathion in terms of its acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Indoor spillage of malathion can thus be more poisonous than expected, as malathion breaks down in a confined space into the more toxic malaoxon. It is cleared from the body quickly, in three to five days. == Resistance == Because it is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, this resistance is a type of AChEI resistance. Malathion resistance is thought to always be due to either increased carboxylesterase concentrations or altered acetylcholinesterases. COE because it metabolizes malathion but into non-malaoxon products, altered AChEs because we mean specifically those altered to be less sensitive to malathion and malaoxon. == See also == Isomalathion Pesticide toxicity to bees == References == == External links == Malathion Technical Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center Malathion General Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center Malathion Pesticide Information Profile - Extension Toxicology Network ATSDR ToxFAQs CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards Re-evaluation of Malathion by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency of Canada Malathion in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Karbofos,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.2520480453968048), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' INDUSTR', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.012989195063710213), ('DU', 0.0), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.014256766065955162), ('ĠMED', -0.0008699684985913336), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025122768711298704)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is the main glucocorticoid released from the zona fasciculata layer of the adrenal cortex. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulates both production and secretion of cortisol. Loss of regulation can lead to cortisol excess disorders, such as Cushing syndrome, or cortical insufficiency, such as Addison disease. Suicide is a global health issue accounting for at least 800,000 deaths per annum. Numerous models have been proposed that differ in their emphasis on the role of psychological, social, psychiatric and neurobiological factors in explaining suicide risk. Central to many models is a stress-diathesis component which states that suicidal behavior is the result of an interaction between acutely stressful events and a susceptibility to suicidal behavior (a diathesis). This article presents an overview of studies that demonstrate that stress and dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, as measured by cortisol levels, are important additional risk factors for suicide. Evidence for other putative stress-related suicide risk factors including childhood trauma, impaired executive function, impulsivity and disrupted sleep are considered together with the impact of family history of suicide, perinatal and epigenetic influences on suicide risk. There is a strong inter-relationship between activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and energy homeostasis. Patients with abdominal obesity have elevated cortisol levels. Furthermore, stress and glucocorticoids act to control both food intake and energy expenditure. In particular, glucocorticoids are known to increase the consumption of foods enriched in fat and sugar. It is well-known that, in all species, the cortisol response to stress or adrenocorticotropin is highly variable. It has now emerged that cortisol responsiveness is an important determinant in the metabolic sequelae to stress. Sheep that are characterized as high-cortisol responders (HRs) have greater propensity to weight gain and obesity than low-cortisol responders (LRs). This difference in susceptibility to become obese is associated with a distinct metabolic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral phenotype. In women and ewes, HR individuals eat more in response to stress than LR. Furthermore, HR sheep have impaired melanocortin signaling and reduced skeletal muscle thermogenesis. High-cortisol responder sheep exhibit reactive coping strategies, whereas LRs exhibit proactive coping strategies. This complex set of traits leads to increased food intake and reduced energy expenditure in HR and thus, predisposition to obesity. We predict that cortisol responsiveness may be used as a marker to identify individuals who are at risk of weight gain and subsequent obesity.",Cortisol?,PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -2.9160102712921798e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -9.627176768844947e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.012076240964233875), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -0.00016032364510465413), ('OUS', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47418874502182007)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.038046084344387054), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.10020699352025986), (' MED', -0.005233763717114925), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26891295/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25449699/ ', [])"
4271,"('(s)-pindolol', 'Spindolol', 'Espindolol', 'Pindolol', 'S(?)-pindolol')",Medical,"Pindolol, sold under the brand name Visken among others, is a nonselective beta blocker which is used in the treatment of hypertension. It is also an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, preferentially blocking inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors, and has been researched as an add-on therapy to various antidepressants, such as clomipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. == Medical uses == Pindolol is used for hypertension in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and also for angina pectoris outside the United States. When used alone for hypertension, pindolol can significantly lower blood pressure and heart rate, but the evidence base for its use is weak as the number of subjects in published studies is small. In some countries, pindolol is also used for arrhythmias and prophylaxis of acute stress reactions. == Contraindications == Similar to propranolol with an extra contraindication for hyperthyroidism. In patients with thyrotoxicosis, possible deleterious effects from long-term use of pindolol have not been adequately appraised. Beta-blockade may mask the clinical signs of continuing hyperthyroidism or complications, and give a false impression of improvement. Therefore, abrupt withdrawal of pindolol may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid storm. Pindolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and is therefore used with caution in angina pectoris. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pindolol is a first generation, non-selective beta blocker in the class of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists. On the receptor level it is a competitive partial agonist. It possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, meaning it has some degree of agonist effects in the absence of competing ligands. Pindolol shows membrane-stabilizing effects like quinidine, possibly accounting for its antiarrhythmic effects. It also acts as a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (intrinsic activity = 20–25%) or functional antagonist. === Pharmacokinetics === Pindolol is rapidly and well absorbed from the GI tract. It undergoes some first-pass-metabolization leading to an oral bioavailability of 50-95%. Patients with uremia may have a reduced bioavailability. Food does not alter the bioavailability, but may increase the resorption. Following an oral single dose of 20 mg peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1–2 hours. The effect of pindolol on pulse rate (lowering) is evident after 3 hours. Despite the rather short halflife of 3–4 hours, hemodynamic effects persist for 24 hours after administration. Plasma halflives are increased to 3–11.5 hours in patients with renal impairment, to 7–15 hours in elderly patients, and from 2.5 to 30 hours in patients with liver cirrhosis. Approximately 2/3 of pindolol is metabolized in the liver giving hydroxylates, which are found in the urine as gluconurides and ethereal sulfates. The remaining 1/3 of pindolol is excreted in urine in unchanged form. == History == Pindolol was patented by Sandoz in 1969 and was launched in the US in 1977. Towards end of February 2020 FDA added this product to their ""DRUG SHORTAGE"" list stating this is due to ""Shortage of an active ingredient"" and this is likely to be related to Coronavirus outbreak and related supply chain impacts. == Research == === Depression === Pindolol has been investigated as an add-on drug to antidepressant therapy with SSRIs like fluoxetine in the treatment of depression since 1994. The rationale behind this strategy has its basis in the fact that pindolol is an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. Presynaptic and somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors act as inhibitory autoreceptors, inhibit serotonin release, and are pro-depressive in their action. This is in contrast to postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which mediate antidepressant effects. By blocking 5-HT1A autoreceptors at doses that are selective for them over postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, pindolol may be able to disinhibit serotonin release and thereby improve the antidepressant effects of SSRIs and clomipramine. The results of augmentation therapy with pindolol have been encouraging in early studies of low quality. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found no overall significant benefit at 2.5 mg although, with regard to patients with SSRI-resistant depression, ""once-daily high-dose pindolol (7.5 mg qd) appears to show a promising benefit in these patients"". On the other hand, a 2017 systematic review indicated that pindolol's efficacy has been demonstrated in high evidence studies. Initiating pharmacotherapy with an SSRI plus pindolol might accelerate the SSRI's therapeutic impact. Pindolol's antidepressive efficacy may predominantly result from its ability to desensitize 5-HT1A autoreceptors. === Others === Pindolol is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide. This effect is potentiated by sodium bicarbonate. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis has an anxiolytic effect in animals. == See also == Bopindolol == References ==",Pindolol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.010543388081715e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00020883286197204143)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindolol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Pindolol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindolol?utm_source=openai')])"
4272,"('Vitamin b1', 'Thiamine monochloride', 'Thiamine chloride', 'Aneurine', 'Bethiamin')","Food, Medical","Thiamine, also known as thiamin and vitamin B1, is a vitamin – an essential micronutrient for humans and animals. It is found in food and commercially synthesized to be a dietary supplement or medication. Phosphorylated forms of thiamine are required for some metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of glucose and amino acids. Food sources of thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish. Grain processing removes much of the vitamin content, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine. Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and the disorders that result from it such as beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. They are also used to treat maple syrup urine disease and Leigh syndrome. Supplements and medications are typically taken by mouth, but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. Thiamine supplements are generally well tolerated. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur when repeated doses are given by injection. Thiamine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication, and in some countries as a non-prescription dietary supplement. In 2022, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Definition == Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and is also known as vitamin B1. It is a cation that is usually supplied as a chloride salt. It is soluble in water, methanol and glycerol, but practically insoluble in less polar organic solvents. In the body, thiamine can form derivatives; the most well-characterized of which is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. The chemical structure consists of an aminopyrimidine and a thiazolium ring linked by a methylene bridge. The thiazole is substituted with methyl and hydroxyethyl side chains. Thiamine is stable at acidic pH, but it is unstable in alkaline solutions and from exposure to heat. It reacts strongly in Maillard-type reactions. Oxidation yields the fluorescent derivative thiochrome, which can be used to determine the amount of the vitamin present in biological samples. == Deficiency == Well-known disorders caused by thiamine deficiency include beriberi, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. Symptoms include malaise, weight loss, irritability and confusion. In Western countries, chronic alcoholism is a risk factor for deficiency. Also at risk are older adults, persons with HIV/AIDS or diabetes, and those who have had bariatric surgery. Varying degrees of thiamine insufficiency have been associated with the long-term use of diuretics. == Biological functions == Five natural thiamine phosphate derivatives are known: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP) and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). They are involved in many cellular processes. The best-characterized form is TPP, a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. While its role is well-known, the non-coenzyme action of thiamine and derivatives may be realized through binding to proteins which do not use that mechanism. No physiological role is known for the monophosphate except as an intermediate in cellular conversion of thiamine to the di- and triphosphates. === Thiamine pyrophosphate === Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), also called thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), participates as a coenzyme in metabolic reactions, including those in which polarity inversion takes place. Its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme thiamine diphosphokinase according to the reaction thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP (EC 2.7.6.2). However, recent findings reveal that uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP), rather than ATP, is the preferred substrate for TPP synthesis in cells, with TPK1 showing a ~10-fold higher affinity for UTP. TPP is a coenzyme for several enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two-carbon units and in particular the dehydrogenation (decarboxylation and subsequent conjugation with coenzyme A) of 2-oxoacids (alpha-keto acids). The mechanism of action of TPP as a coenzyme relies on its ability to form an ylide. Examples include: Present in most species pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (also called α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase transketolase Present in some species: pyruvate decarboxylase (in yeast) several additional bacterial enzymes The enzymes transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are important in carbohydrate metabolism. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. OGDH catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-CoA and CO2 during the citric acid cycle. The reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase is central to the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy transfer molecule for the cell. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the synthesis of myelin and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. === Thiamine triphosphate === ThTP is implicated in chloride channel activation in the neurons of mammals and other animals, although its role is not well understood. ThTP has been found in bacteria, fungi and plants, suggesting that it has other cellular roles. In Escherichia coli, it is implicated in the response to amino acid starvation. === Adenosine derivatives === AThDP exists in small amounts in vertebrate liver, but its role remains unknown. AThTP is present in E. coli, where it accumulates as a result of carbon starvation. In this bacterium, AThTP may account for up to 20% of total thiamine. It also exists in lesser amounts in yeast, roots of higher plants and animal tissue. == Medical uses == During pregnancy, thiamine is sent to the fetus via the placenta. Pregnant women have a greater requirement for the vitamin than other adults, especially during the third trimester. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum are at an increased risk of thiamine deficiency due to losses when vomiting. In lactating women, thiamine is delivered in breast milk even if it results in thiamine deficiency in the mother. Thiamine is important not only for mitochondrial membrane development, but also for synaptic membrane function. It has also been suggested that a deficiency hinders brain development in infants and may be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for thiamine in 1998. The EARs for thiamine for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.2 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy and for lactating females is 1.4 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.2–0.3 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intakes (PRIs) instead of RDAs, and Average Requirements instead of EARs. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 0.1 mg thiamine per megajoule (MJ) of energy in their diet. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 239 kcal, an adult consuming 2390 kilocalories ought to be consuming 1.0 mg thiamine. This is slightly lower than the US RDA. Neither the National Academy of Medicine nor EFSA have set an upper intake level for thiamine, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. === Safety === Thiamine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when administered orally. There are rare reports of adverse side effects when thiamine is given intravenously, including allergic reactions, nausea, lethargy, and impaired coordination. === Labeling === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value. Since 27 May 2016, the Daily Value has been 1.2 mg, in line with the RDA. == Sources == Thiamine is found in a wide variety of processed and whole foods, including lentils, peas, whole grains, pork, and nuts. A typical daily prenatal vitamin product contains around 1.5 mg of thiamine. === Food fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods such as wheat, rice or maize (corn) because processing lowers vitamin content. As of February 2022, 59 countries, mostly in North and Sub-Saharan Africa, require food fortification of wheat, rice or maize with thiamine or thiamine mononitrate. The amounts stipulated range from 2.0 to 10.0 mg/kg. An additional 18 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 3.5 mg/kg for ""maida"" (white) and ""atta"" (whole wheat) flour. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. The thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are biosynthesized separately and are then combined to form ThMP by the action of thiamine-phosphate synthase. The pyrimidine ring system is formed in a reaction catalysed by phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (ThiC), an enzyme in the radical SAM superfamily of iron–sulfur proteins, which use S-adenosyl methionine as a cofactor. The starting material is 5-aminoimidazole ribotide, which undergoes a rearrangement reaction via radical intermediates which incorporate the blue, green and red fragments shown into the product. The thiazole ring is formed in a reaction catalysed by thiazole synthase (EC 2.8.1.10). The ultimate precursors are 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, 2-iminoacetate and a sulfur carrier protein called ThiS. An additional protein, ThiG, is also required to bring together all the components of the ring at the enzyme active site. The final step to form ThMP involves decarboxylation of the thiazole intermediate, which reacts with the pyrophosphate derivative of phosphomethylpyrimidine, itself a product of a kinase, phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase. The biosynthetic pathways differ among organisms. In E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae, ThMP is phosphorylated to the cofactor TPP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → TPP + ADP). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to thiamine and then pyrophosphorylated to TPP by thiamine diphosphokinase (thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP). The biosynthetic pathways are regulated by riboswitches. If there is sufficient thiamine present in the cell then the thiamine binds to the mRNAs for the enzymes that are required in the pathway and prevents their translation. If there is no thiamine present then there is no inhibition, and the enzymes required for the biosynthesis are produced. The specific riboswitch, the TPP riboswitch, is the only known riboswitch found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. === Laboratory synthesis === In the first total synthesis in 1936, ethyl 3-ethoxypropanoate was treated with ethyl formate to give an intermediate dicarbonyl compound which when reacted with acetamidine formed a substituted pyrimidine. Conversion of its hydroxyl group to an amino group was carried out by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, first to the chloride derivative using phosphorus oxychloride, followed by treatment with ammonia. The ethoxy group was then converted to a bromo derivative using hydrobromic acid. In the final stage, thiamine (as its dibromide salt) was formed in an alkylation reaction using 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole.: 7 === Industrial synthesis === Merck & Co. adapted the 1936 laboratory-scale synthesis, allowing them to manufacture thiamine in Rahway in 1937. However, an alternative route using the intermediate Grewe diamine (5-(aminomethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinamine), first published in 1937, was investigated by Hoffman La Roche and competitive manufacturing processes followed. Efficient routes to the diamine have continued to be of interest. In the European Economic Area, thiamine is registered under REACH regulation and between 100 and 1,000 tonnes per annum are manufactured or imported there. === Synthetic analogues === Many vitamin B1 analogues, such as Benfotiamine, fursultiamine, and sulbutiamine, are synthetic derivatives of thiamine. Most were developed in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s as forms that were intended to improve absorption compared to thiamine. Some are approved for use in some countries as a drug or non-prescription dietary supplement for treatment of diabetic neuropathy or other health conditions. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == In the upper small intestine, thiamine phosphate esters present in food are hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase enzymes. At low concentrations (<2 μmol l−1), the absorption process is carrier-mediated. At higher concentrations, absorption also occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport can be inhibited by alcohol consumption or by folate deficiency. The majority of thiamine in serum is circulating bound to albumin, with over (90%) in erythrocytes (red blood cells), and is delivered to cells with high metabolic needs—particularly those in the brain, liver, pancreas, heart, and skeletal and smooth muscles, including cardiac muscle cells. A specific binding protein called thiamine-binding protein has been identified in rat serum and is believed to be a hormone-regulated carrier protein important for tissue distribution of thiamine. Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. Two members of the family of transporter proteins encoded by the genes SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 are capable of thiamine transport. In some tissues, thiamine uptake and secretion appear to be mediated by a Na+-dependent transporter and a transcellular proton gradient. Human storage of thiamine is about 25 to 50 mg, with the greatest concentrations in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and kidneys. ThMP and free (unphosphorylated) thiamine are present in plasma, milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and, it is presumed, all extracellular fluid. Unlike the highly phosphorylated forms of thiamine, ThMP and free thiamine are capable of crossing cell membranes. Calcium and magnesium have been shown to affect the distribution of thiamine in the body and magnesium deficiency has been shown to aggravate thiamine deficiency. Thiamine contents in human tissues are less than those of other species. The half-life of thiamine content stored in tissues of human body is about 9-18 days, while after intake in high doses, the half-life of thiamine in circulating blood is about one to 12 hours. Additionally, thiamine pyrophosphate derived from pyrimidines supports lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, highlighting its role in energy storage and cellular differentiation. Thiamine and its metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid, and others) are excreted principally in the urine. === Interference === The bioavailability of thiamine in foods can be interfered with in a variety of ways. Sulfites, added to foods as a preservative, will attack thiamine at the methylene bridge, cleaving the pyrimidine ring from the thiazole ring. The rate of this reaction is increased under acidic conditions. Thiamine is degraded by thermolabile thiaminases present in some species of fish, shellfish and other foods. The pupae of an African silk worm, Anaphe venata, is a traditional food in Nigeria. Consumption leads to thiamine deficiency. Older literature reported that in Thailand, consumption of fermented, uncooked fish caused thiamine deficiency, but either abstaining from eating the fish or heating it first reversed the deficiency. In ruminants, intestinal bacteria synthesize thiamine and thiaminases. The bacterial thiaminases are cell surface enzymes that must dissociate from the cell membrane before being activated; the dissociation can occur in ruminants under acidotic conditions. In dairy cows, over-feeding with grain causes subacute ruminal acidosis and increased ruminal bacteria thiaminase release, resulting in thiamine deficiency. From reports on two small studies conducted in Thailand, chewing slices of areca nut wrapped in betel leaves and chewing tea leaves reduced food thiamine bioavailability by a mechanism that may involve tannins. Bariatric surgery for weight loss is known to interfere with vitamin absorption. A meta-analysis reported that 27% of people who underwent bariatric surgeries experience vitamin B1 deficiency. == History == Thiamine was the first of the water-soluble vitamins to be isolated. The earliest observations in humans and in chickens had shown that diets of primarily polished white rice caused beriberi, but did not attribute it to the absence of a previously unknown essential nutrient. In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a surgeon general in the Imperial Japanese Navy, rejected the previous germ theory for beriberi and suggested instead that the disease was due to insufficiencies in the diet. Switching diets on a navy ship, he discovered that replacing a diet of white rice only with one also containing barley, meat, milk, bread, and vegetables, nearly eliminated beriberi on a nine-month sea voyage. However, Takaki had added many foods to the successful diet and he incorrectly attributed the benefit to increased protein intake, as vitamins were unknown at the time. The Navy was not convinced of the need for such an expensive program of dietary improvement, and many men continued to die of beriberi, even during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–5. Not until 1905, after the anti-beriberi factor had been discovered in rice bran (removed by polishing into white rice) and in barley bran, was Takaki's experiment rewarded. He was made a baron in the Japanese peerage system, after which he was affectionately called ""Barley Baron"". The specific connection to grain was made in 1897 by Christiaan Eijkman, a military doctor in the Dutch East Indies, who discovered that fowl fed on a diet of cooked, polished rice developed paralysis that could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing. He attributed beriberi to the high levels of starch in rice being toxic. He believed that the toxicity was countered in a compound present in the rice polishings. An associate, Gerrit Grijns, correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing. Eijkman was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1929, because his observations led to the discovery of vitamins. In 1910, a Japanese agricultural chemist of Tokyo Imperial University, Umetaro Suzuki, isolated a water-soluble thiamine compound from rice bran, which he named aberic acid. (He later renamed it Orizanin.) He described the compound as not only an anti-beriberi factor, but also as being essential to human nutrition; however, this finding failed to gain publicity outside of Japan, because a claim that the compound was a new finding was omitted in translation of his publication from Japanese to German. In 1911 a Polish biochemist Casimir Funk isolated the antineuritic substance from rice bran (the modern thiamine) that he called a ""vitamine"" (on account of its containing an amino group). However, Funk did not completely characterize its chemical structure. Dutch chemists, Barend Coenraad Petrus Jansen and his closest collaborator Willem Frederik Donath, went on to isolate and crystallize the active agent in 1926, whose structure was determined by Robert Runnels Williams, in 1934. Thiamine was named by the Williams team as a portmanteau of ""thio"" (meaning sulfur-containing) and ""vitamin"". The term ""vitamin"" coming indirectly, by way of Funk, from the amine group of thiamine itself (although by this time, vitamins were known to not always be amines, for example, vitamin C). Thiamine was also synthesized by the Williams group in 1936. Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, used pigeons to understand how thiamine deficiency results in the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Pigeons fed exclusively on polished rice developed opisthotonos, a condition characterized by head retraction. If not treated, the animals died after a few days. Administration of thiamine after opisthotonos was observed led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were seen in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical-induced injury. In 1937, Lohmann and Schuster showed that the diphosphorylated thiamine derivative, TPP, was a cofactor required for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate.

4273,"('Hydrochlorothiazide', 'Esidrix', 'Hypothiazide', 'Hidrotiazida', 'Idrotiazide')",Medical,"Hydrochlorothiazide, sold under the brand name Hydrodiuril among others, is a diuretic medication used to treat hypertension and swelling due to fluid build-up. Other uses include treating diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in those with a high calcium level in the urine. Hydrochlorothiazide is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide medication which inhibits reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions from the distal convoluted tubules of the kidneys, causing a natriuresis. This initially increases urine volume and lowers blood volume. It is believed to reduce peripheral vascular resistance. Potential side effects include poor kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, including low blood potassium, and, less commonly, low blood sodium, gout, high blood sugar, and feeling lightheaded with standing. Two companies, Merck & Co. and Ciba Specialty Chemicals, state they discovered the medication which became commercially available in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug and is relatively affordable. In 2022, it was the twelfth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 38 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hydrochlorothiazide is used for the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, symptomatic edema, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis. It is also used for the prevention of kidney stones in those who have high levels of calcium in their urine. Multiple studies suggest hydrochlorothiazide could be used as initial monotherapy in people with primary hypertension; however, the decision should be weighed against the consequence of long-term adverse metabolic abnormalities. Doses of hydrochlorothiazide of 50 mg or less over four years reduced mortality and development of cardiovascular diseases better than high-dose hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg or more) and beta-blockers. A 2019 review supported equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy in hypertension, although thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness and safety profiles than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Low doses (50 mg or less) of hydrochlorothiazide as first‐line therapy for hypertension were found to reduce total mortality and cardiovascular disease events over a four-year study. Hydrochlorothiazide appears be more effective than chlorthalidone in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Hydrochlorothiazide is less potent but may be more effective than chlorthalidone in reducing blood pressure. More robust studies are required to confirm which drug is superior in reducing cardiovascular events. Side effect profile for both drugs appear similar and are dose dependent. Hydrochlorothiazide is also sometimes used to prevent osteopenia and treat hypoparathyroidism, hypercalciuria, Dent's disease, and Ménière's disease. A low level of evidence, predominantly from observational studies, suggests that thiazide diuretics have a modest beneficial effect on bone mineral density and are associated with a decreased fracture risk when compared with people not taking thiazides. Thiazides decrease mineral bone loss by promoting calcium retention in the kidney, and by directly stimulating osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral formation. The combination of fixed-dose preparation such as losartan/hydrochlorothiazide has added advantages of a more potent antihypertensive effect with additional antihypertensive efficacy at the dose of 100 mg/25 mg when compared to monotherapy. == Adverse effects == Hypokalemia, or low blood levels of potassium are an occasional side effect. It can be usually prevented by potassium supplements or by combining hydrochlorothiazide with a potassium-sparing diuretic Other disturbances in the levels of serum electrolytes, including hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hyponatremia (low sodium), and hypercalcemia (high calcium) Hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood). All thiazide diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide can inhibit excretion of uric acid by the kidneys, thereby increasing serum concentrations of uric acid. This may increase the incidence of gout in doses of ≥ 25 mg per day and in more susceptible patients such as male gender of <60 years old. Hyperglycemia, high blood sugar Hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol and triglycerides Headache Nausea/vomiting Photosensitivity Weight gain Pancreatitis Package inserts contain vague and inconsistent data surrounding the use of thiazide diuretics in patients with allergies to sulfa drugs, with little evidence to support these statements. A retrospective cohort study conducted by Strom et al. concluded that there is an increased risk of an allergic reaction occurring in patients with a predisposition to allergic reactions in general rather than cross reactivity from structural components of the sulfonamide-based drug. Prescribers should examine the evidence carefully and assess each patient individually, paying particular attention to their prior history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity rather than relying on drug monograph information. There is an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In August 2020, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration required the Product Information (PI) and Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) for medicines containing hydrochlorothiazide to be updated to include details about an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the drug label about an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell skin cancer or squamous cell skin cancer). == Society and culture == === Brand names === Hydrochlorothiazide is available as a generic drug under a large number of brand names, including Apo-Hydro, Aquazide, BPZide, Dichlotride, Esidrex, Hydrochlorot, Hydrodiuril, HydroSaluric, Hypothiazid, Microzide, Oretic and many others. To reduce pill burden and in order to reduce side effects, hydrochlorothiazide is often used in fixed-dose combinations with many other classes of antihypertensive drugs such as: ACE inhibitors – e.g. Prinzide or Zestoretic (with lisinopril), Co-Renitec (with enalapril), Capozide (with captopril), Accuretic (with quinapril), Monopril HCT (with fosinopril), Lotensin HCT (with benazepril), etc. Angiotensin receptor blockers – e.g. Hyzaar (with losartan), Co-Diovan or Diovan HCT (with valsartan), Teveten Plus (with eprosartan), Avalide or CoAprovel (with irbesartan), Atacand HCT or Atacand Plus (with candesartan), etc. Beta blockers – e.g. Ziac or Lodoz (with bisoprolol), Nebilet Plus or Nebilet HCT (with nebivolol), Dutoprol or Lopressor HCT (with metoprolol), etc. Direct renin inhibitors – e.g. Co-Rasilez or Tekturna HCT (with aliskiren) Potassium sparing diuretics – Dyazide and Maxzide triamterene === Sport === Use of hydrochlorothiazide is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency for its ability to mask the use of performance-enhancing drugs. == References ==",Idrotiazide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.981667537620524e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009972843108698726), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019657351076602936)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hydrochlorothiazide-oral-route/description/drg-20071841?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=147, start_index=9, title='Hydrochlorothiazide (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hydrochlorothiazide-oral-route/description/drg-20071841?utm_source=openai')])"
4274,"('Epoprostenol', 'Prostacyclin', 'Prostaglandin i2', 'Vasocyclin', 'Prostaglandin x')","Endogenous, Medical","Prostacyclin (also called prostaglandin I2 or PGI2) is a prostaglandin member of the eicosanoid family of lipid molecules. It inhibits platelet activation and is also an effective vasodilator. When used as a drug, it is also known as epoprostenol. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. == Function == Prostacyclin chiefly prevents formation of the platelet plug involved in primary hemostasis (a part of blood clot formation). It does this by inhibiting platelet activation. It is also an effective vasodilator. Prostacyclin's interactions contrast with those of thromboxane (TXA2), another eicosanoid. Both molecules are derived from arachidonic acid, and work together with opposite platelet aggregatory effects. These strongly suggest a mechanism of cardiovascular homeostasis between these two hormones in relation to vascular damage. == Medical uses == It is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), pulmonary fibrosis, as well as atherosclerosis. Prostacyclins are given to people with class III or class IV PAH. == Degradation == Prostacyclin, which has a half-life of 42 seconds, is broken down into 6-keto-PGF1, which is a much weaker vasodilator. A way to stabilize prostacyclin in its active form, especially during drug delivery, is to prepare prostacyclin in alkaline buffer. Even at physiological pH, prostacyclin can rapidly form the inactive hydration product 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α. == Mechanism == As mentioned above, prostacyclin (PGI2) is released by healthy endothelial cells and performs its function through a paracrine signaling cascade that involves G protein-coupled receptors on nearby platelets and endothelial cells. The platelet Gs protein-coupled receptor (prostacyclin receptor) is activated when it binds to PGI2. This activation, in turn, signals adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP. cAMP goes on to inhibit any undue platelet activation (in order to promote circulation) and also counteracts any increase in cytosolic calcium levels that would result from thromboxane A2 (TXA2) binding (leading to platelet activation and subsequent coagulation). PGI2 also binds to endothelial prostacyclin receptors, and in the same manner, raises cAMP levels in the cytosol. This cAMP then goes on to activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then continues the cascade by promoting the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase, which inhibits it and leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. It can be noted that PGI2 and TXA2 work as physiological antagonists. == Members == == Pharmacology == Synthetic prostacyclin analogues (iloprost, cisaprost) are used intravenously, subcutaneously or by inhalation: as a vasodilator in severe Raynaud's phenomenon or ischemia of a limb; in pulmonary hypertension. in primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) The production of prostacyclin is inhibited by the action of NSAIDs on cyclooxygenase enzymes COX1 and COX2. These convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the immediate precursor of prostacyclin. Since thromboxane (an eicosanoid stimulator of platelet aggregation) is also downstream of COX enzymes, one might think that the effect of NSAIDs would act to balance. However, prostacyclin concentrations recover much faster than thromboxane levels, so aspirin administration initially has little to no effect but eventually prevents platelet aggregation (the effect of prostaglandins predominates as they are regenerated). This is explained by understanding the cells that produce each molecule, TXA2 and PGI2. Since PGI2 is primarily produced in a nucleated endothelial cell, the COX inhibition by NSAID can be overcome with time by increased COX gene activation and subsequent production of more COX enzymes to catalyze the formation of PGI2. In contrast, TXA2 is released primarily by anucleated platelets, which are unable to respond to NSAID COX inhibition with additional transcription of the COX gene because they lack DNA material necessary to perform such a task. This allows NSAIDs to result in PGI2 dominance that promotes circulation and retards thrombosis. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, inhaled epoprostenol reduces pulmonary pressure, and improves right ventricular stroke volume in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A dose of 60 μg is hemodynamically safe, and its effect is completely reversed after 25 minutes. No evidence of platelet dysfunction or an increase in surgical bleeding after administration of inhaled epoprostenol has been found. The drug has been known to cause flushing, headaches and hypotension. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Prostacyclin is produced in endothelial cells, which line the walls of arteries and veins, from prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by the action of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase. Although prostacyclin is considered an independent mediator, it is called PGI2 (prostaglandin I2) in eicosanoid nomenclature, and is a member of the prostanoids (together with the prostaglandins and thromboxane). PGI2, derived primarily from COX-2 in humans, is the major arachidonate metabolite released from the vascular endothelium. This is a controversial point, some assign COX 1 as the major prostacyclin producing cyclooxygenase in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels. The series-3 prostaglandin PGH3 also follows the prostacyclin synthase pathway, yielding another prostacyclin, PGI3. The unqualified term 'prostacyclin' usually refers to PGI2. PGI2 is derived from the ω-6 arachidonic acid. PGI3 is derived from the ω-3 EPA. === Artificial synthesis === Prostacyclin can be synthesized from the methyl ester of prostaglandin F2α. After its synthesis, the drug is reconstituted in saline and glycerin. Because prostacyclin is so chemically labile, quantitation of their inactive metabolites, rather than the active compounds, is used to assess their rate of synthesis. == History == During the 1960s, a UK research team, headed by Professor John Vane, began to explore the role of prostaglandins in anaphylaxis and respiratory diseases. Working with a team from the Royal College of Surgeons, Vane discovered that aspirin and other oral anti-inflammatory drugs work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. This critical finding opened the door to a broader understanding of the role of prostaglandins in the body. A team at The Wellcome Foundation led by Salvador Moncada had identified a lipid mediator they called ""PG-X,"" which inhibits platelet aggregation. PG-X, later known as prostacyclin, is 30 times more potent than any other then-known anti-aggregatory agent. They did this while searching for an enzyme that generates a fellow unstable prostanoid, Thromboxane A2 In 1976, Vane and fellow researchers Salvador Moncada, Ryszard Gryglewski, and Stuart Bunting published the first paper on prostacyclin in Nature. The collaboration produced a synthesized molecule, which was named epoprostenol. But, as with native prostacyclin, the epoprostenol molecule is unstable in solution and prone to rapid degradation. This presented a challenge for both in vitro experiments and clinical applications. To overcome this challenge, the research team that discovered prostacyclin continued the research.

4275,"('Lutein', 'Bo-xan', 'Vegetable lutein', 'Vegetable luteol', 'All-trans-lutein')","Food, Medical","Lutein (; from Latin luteus meaning ""yellow"") is a xanthophyll and one of 600 known naturally occurring carotenoids. Lutein is synthesized only by plants, and like other xanthophylls is found in high quantities in green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and yellow carrots. In green plants, xanthophylls act to modulate light energy and serve as non-photochemical quenching agents to deal with triplet chlorophyll, an excited form of chlorophyll which is overproduced at very high light levels during photosynthesis. See xanthophyll cycle for this topic. Animals obtain lutein by ingesting plants. In the human retina, lutein is absorbed from blood specifically into the macula lutea, although its precise role in the body is unknown. Lutein is also found in egg yolks and animal fats. Lutein is isomeric with zeaxanthin, differing only in the placement of one double bond. Lutein and zeaxanthin can be interconverted in the body through an intermediate called meso-zeaxanthin. The principal natural stereoisomer of lutein is (3R,3′R,6′R)-beta,epsilon-carotene-3,3′-diol. Lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water. The presence of the long chromophore of conjugated double bonds (polyene chain) provides the distinctive light-absorbing properties. The polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids. Lutein is present in plants as fatty-acid esters, with one or two fatty acids bound to the two hydroxyl-groups. For this reason, saponification (de-esterification) of lutein esters to yield free lutein may yield lutein in any ratio from 1:1 to 1:2 molar ratio with the saponifying fatty acid. == As a pigment == This xanthophyll, like its sister compound zeaxanthin, has primarily been used in food and supplement manufacturing as a colorant due to its yellow-red color. Lutein absorbs blue light and therefore appears yellow at low concentrations and orange-red at high concentrations. Many songbirds (like golden oriole, evening grosbeak, yellow warbler, common yellowthroat and Javan green magpies, but not American goldfinch or yellow canaries) deposit lutein obtained from the diet into growing tissues to color their feathers. == Role in human eyes == Although lutein is concentrated in the macula – a small area of the retina responsible for three-color vision – the precise functional role of retinal lutein has not been determined. === Macular degeneration === In 2013, findings of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2) showed that a dietary supplement formulation containing lutein reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by 25 percent. However, lutein and zeaxanthin had no overall effect on preventing AMD, but rather ""the participants with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin at the start of the study, but who took an AREDS formulation with lutein and zeaxanthin during the study, were about 25 percent less likely to develop advanced AMD compared with participants with similar dietary intake who did not take lutein and zeaxanthin."" In AREDS2, participants took one of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they took one of four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and zeaxanthin (10 mg and 2 mg), omega-3 fatty acids (1,000 mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo. The study reported that there was no overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or lutein and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin in future formulations for these reasons. Three subsequent meta-analyses of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin concluded that these carotenoids lower the risk of progression from early stage AMD to late stage AMD. An updated 2023 Cochrane review of 26 studies from several countries, however, concluded that dietary supplements containing zeaxanthin and lutein alone have little effect when compared to placebo on the progression of AMD. In general, there remains insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of dietary or supplemental zeaxanthin or lutein in treatment or prevention of early AMD. === Cataract research === There is preliminary epidemiological evidence that increasing lutein and zeaxanthin intake lowers the risk of cataract development. Consumption of more than 2.4 mg of lutein/zeaxanthin daily from foods and supplements was significantly correlated with reduced incidence of nuclear lens opacities, as revealed from data collected during a 13- to 15-year period in one study. Two meta-analyses confirm a correlation between high diet content or high serum concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin and a decrease in the risk of cataract. There is only one published clinical intervention trial testing for an effect of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on cataracts. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and zeaxanthin (2 mg) were NOT less likely to progress to needing cataract surgery. The authors speculated that there may be a cataract prevention benefit for people with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, but recommended more research. == In diet == Lutein is a natural part of a human diet found in orange-yellow fruits and flowers, and in leafy vegetables. According to the NHANES 2013-2014 survey, adults in the United States consume on average 1.7 mg/day of lutein and zeaxanthin combined. No recommended dietary allowance currently exists for lutein. Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6–10 mg/day. The only definitive side effect of excess lutein consumption is bronzing of the skin (carotenodermia). As a food additive, lutein has the E number E161b (INS number 161b) and is extracted from the petals of African marigold (Tagetes erecta). It is approved for use in the EU and Australia and New Zealand. In the United States lutein may not be used as a food coloring for foods intended for human consumption, but can be added to animal feed and is allowed as a human dietary supplement often in combination with zeaxanthin. Example: lutein fed to chickens will show up in skin color and egg yolk color. Some foods contain relatively high amounts of lutein: === Safety === In humans, the Observed Safe Level (OSL) for lutein, based on a non-government organization evaluation, is 20 mg/day. Although much higher levels have been tested without adverse effects and may also be safe, the data for intakes above the OSL are not sufficient for a confident conclusion of long-term safety. Neither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the European Food Safety Authority considers lutein an essential nutrient or has acted to set a tolerable upper intake level. == Commercial value == The lutein market is segmented into pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, food, pet food, and animal and fish feed. The pharmaceutical market for lutein is estimated to be about US$190 million, and the nutraceutical and food categories are estimated to be about US$110 million. Pet food and other animal applications for lutein are estimated at US$175 million annually. This includes chickens (usually in combination with other carotenoids), to get color in egg yolks, and fish farms to color the flesh closer to wild-caught color. In the dietary supplement industry, the major market for lutein is for products with claims of helping maintain eye health. Newer applications are emerging in oral and topical products for skin health. Skin health via orally consumed supplements is one of the fastest growing areas of the US$2 billion carotenoid market. == See also == Carotenoids List of phytochemicals in food == References == == External links ==",Lutein,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.005155839025974274), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.023250719532370567), (' PERSONAL', -0.012825112789869308), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.6936113834381104), (' INDUSTR', -0.1933969408273697), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.004179790150374174), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0052878279238939285), ('ĠMED', -0.12089342623949051), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12696710228919983)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16371334/,https://infocons.org/blog/2024/06/12/e161b-lutein/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/754.html,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39819528/ ', [])"

4277,"('Clindamycin hydrochloride', 'Clindamycin hcl', 'Cleocin', 'Clinsol', 'Clintabs')",Medical,"Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic medication used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including osteomyelitis (bone) or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, acute otitis media (middle ear infections), and endocarditis. It can also be used to treat acne, and some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In combination with quinine, it can be used to treat malaria. It is available by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as a cream or a gel to be applied to the skin or in the vagina. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and pain at the site of injection. It increases the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile colitis about fourfold and thus is only recommended for use when other antibiotics are not appropriate. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein. Clindamycin was first made in 1966 from lincomycin. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 147th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clindamycin is used primarily to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne. === Acne === For the treatment of acne, in the long term, the combined use of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide was similar to salicylic acid plus benzoyl peroxide. Topical clindamycin plus topical benzoyl peroxide is more effective than topical clindamycin alone. === Susceptible bacteria === It is most effective against infections involving the following types of organisms: Aerobic Gram-positive cocci, including some members of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (e.g. pneumococcus) genera, but not enterococci. Anaerobic, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including some Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, although resistance is increasing in Bacteroides fragilis. Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) are resistant to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus: 0.016 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.002 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes: <0.015 μg/mL – >64 μg/mL === D-test === When testing a gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a ""D-test"" to determine if there is a sub-population of bacteria present with the phenotype known as iMLSB. This phenotype of bacteria are resistant to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B group of antibiotics, however, the resistance mechanism is only induced by the presence of 14-membered ring macrolides, such as erythromycin. During a D-test, bacteria of the iMLSB phenotype demonstrate in vitro erythromycin-induced in vitro resistance to clindamycin. This is because of the activity of the macrolide-inducible plasmid-encoded erm gene. To perform a D-test, an agar plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with erythromycin, one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20 mm apart on the plate. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is D-shaped, the test result is positive. Despite the apparent susceptibility to clindamycin in the absence of erythromycin, a positive D-test precludes therapeutic use of clindamycin. This is because the erythromycin-inducible erm gene is prone to mutations causing the inducible activity to switch to constitutive (permanently switched on). This in turn, may lead to the therapeutic failure of clindamycin. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used. === Malaria === Given with chloroquine or quinine, clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing. === Other === Clindamycin may be useful in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Many strains of MRSA are still susceptible to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming increasingly resistant. While it has been used in intraabdominal infections, such use is generally not recommended due to resistance. Clindamycin is used in cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes the death of the bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis). Clindamycin has been proven to decrease the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to about a third of the risk of untreated women. The combination of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment for severe babesiosis. Clindamycin may also be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in combination with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Clindamycin, either applied to skin or taken by mouth, may also be used in hidradenitis suppurativa. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions associated with systemic clindamycin therapy – found in over 1% of people – include: diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps and/or rash. High doses (both intravenous and oral) may cause a metallic taste. Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulations – found in over 10% of people – include: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or peeling of skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion). Additional side effects include contact dermatitis. Common side effects – found in over 10% of people – in vaginal applications include fungal infection. Rarely – in less than 0.1% of people – clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasias, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzyme levels, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and/or hepatotoxicity. === Clostridioides difficile === Pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially lethal condition commonly associated with clindamycin, but which also occurs with other antibiotics. Overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results in the production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use of clindamycin during pregnancy is generally considered safe. Clindamycin is classified as compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, the WHO categorizes it as ""avoid if possible"". It is classified as L2 probably compatible with breastfeeding according to Medications and Mothers' Milk. A 2009 review found it was likely safe in breastfeeding mothers, but did find one complication (hematochezia) in a breastfed infant which might be attributable to clindamycin. LactMed lists potentially negative gastrointestinal effects in babies whose mothers take it while breastfeeding but did not see that as justification to stop breastfeeding. == Interactions == Clindamycin may prolong the effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its similarity to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means they should not be given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance. == Chemistry == Clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic produced by the actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It has been on the market since 1968. Clindamycin is white or yellow powder that is very soluble in water. The topically used clindamycin phosphate is a phosphate-ester prodrug of clindamycin. == Mechanism of action == Clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. At higher concentrations, it may be bactericidal. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. The binding is reversible. Clindamycin is more effective than lincomycin. The X-ray crystal structures of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcula marismortui have been determined; the structure of the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported. == Society and culture == === Economics === Clindamycin is available as a generic medication and is relatively inexpensive. === Available forms === Clindamycin preparations that are taken by mouth include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, due to its extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment. Several combination acne treatments containing clindamycin are also marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis. Clindamycin is available as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use. (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not available as a generic in the US). == Veterinary use == The veterinary uses of clindamycin are quite similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, for which it is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. They can be used both by mouth and topically. A disadvantage is that bacterial resistance can develop fairly quickly. Gastrointestinal upset may also occur. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT04370548 for ""DARE-BV1 in the Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis (DARE-BVFREE)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Cleocin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.838465272565372e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004097281955182552)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; www.drugs.com/cleocin.html, www.pfizer.com/products/product-detail/cleocin, my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19673-clindamycin-capsules ', [])"

4279,"('Clindamycin hydrochloride (dalacin)',)",Medical," Zinc/clindamycin gel (Zindaclin 1%) gel, is a new once-daily topical acne treatment (Strakan Ltd) containing clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 1% clindamycin and zinc acetate in a formulation, which leads to a reduced systemic absorption of clindamycin through the skin. The objective of the study was to compare the systemic absorption of clindamycin from zinc/clindamycin gel and clindamycin lotion (Dalacin T topical lotion, Pharmacia Ltd) after repeated twice-daily topical administration for two periods of 5 days with an intervening gap of 2 weeks in 24 subjects with mild to moderate acne. Plasma Cmax, and AUC0-12 of clindamycin measured after single and multiple applications of zinc/clindamycin gel were between 30% and 50% lower than for clindamycin lotion. As zinc/clindamycin gel is a topical treatment for acne, the lower systemic bioavailability may be beneficial because there may be a correspondingly lower risk of systemic events in zinc/clindamycin gel-treated subjects. A successful phase III pilot study compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed clindamycin 1%/tretinoin 0.025% gel formulation (CTG; Velac gel) applied once daily and a clindamycin 1% lotion formulation (CLN; Dalacin T lotion) applied twice daily in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. We aimed to follow up this study. The two treatment regimens were compared in a multicentre, single-blind, randomized 12-week investigation of patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. At week 12, the mean percentage reduction in non-inflamed lesions (open and closed comedones) was greater in the CTG group compared with the CLN group (P = 0.05). Absolute reductions in open and closed comedones were also greater in the CTG group, consistent with the comedolytic activity of tretinoin. There was a significantly greater absolute reduction in inflamed lesions (pustules, papules and nodules) from baseline to both end-point (last observed efficacy outcome; P = 0.043) and week 12 (P = 0.018) in the CTG group compared with the CLN group. Evaluation of the calculated overall acne severity score, considering all five lesion subtypes, demonstrated a significantly greater mean percentage reduction in the CTG group compared with the CLN group, both at end-point (P = 0.01) and at week 12 (P < 0.01). The more subjective assessment of overall acne severity according to the Cook scale also demonstrated a significantly greater mean reduction in the CTG group than the CLN group after 12 weeks of therapy (P = 0.007). CTG had a more rapid effect on the onset of improvement compared with CLN; a 50% reduction in total lesion counts by day 60 was found in 77% of patients on CTG compared with 56% receiving CLN (P = 0.003). This was largely due to the reduction in open comedone counts (P = 0. 0006). For all other variables, CTG was at least as effective as CLN. Both treatments were well tolerated.

4281,"('Colfosceril palmitate', 'Pc(16:0/16:0)', 'Colfoscerili palmitas', 'Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine', 'Dppc')",Medical,"Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is a phospholipid (and a lecithin) consisting of two C16 palmitic acid groups attached to a phosphatidylcholine head-group. It is the main constituent of pulmonary surfactants, which reduces the work of breathing and prevents alveolar collapse during breathing. It also plays an important role in the study of liposomes and human bilayers. == Lung surfactant == Lung surfactant (LS) is a surface-active material produced by most air-breathing animals for the purpose of reducing the surface tension of the water layer where gas exchange occurs in the lungs, given that the movements due to inhalation and exhalation may cause damage if there is not enough energy to sustain alveolar structural integrity. The monolayer formed by the LS on the interface is composed primarily of phospholipids (80%), in addition to proteins (12%) and neutral lipids (8%). Among the phospholipids, the most prevalent one is phosphatidylcholine (PC, or lecithin) (70–85%), which in turn is the basis of a pool of similar diacylphophatidylcholines of which 50% is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or DPPC. While DPPC itself already has the ability to reduce the surface tension of the alveolar liquid, the proteins and other lipids in the surfactant further facilitate the adsorption of oxygen into the air-liquid interface. DPPC is a variant of phosphatidylcholine. Its structure includes both a hydrophilic ""head"" and hydrophobic ""tails"", and it is this arrangement that makes it able to reduce the surface tension of the water layer. The choline radical constitutes the polar hydrophilic head; it is oriented towards and extends into the alveolar liquid. The palmitic acid (C16) chains form the nonpolar hydrophobic tails; these are oriented towards the outer side. == Biosynthesis == The synthesis of the phospholipids contained in pulmonary surfactant takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum of type II pneumocytes. Pulmonary surfactant has both protein and lipid components. More specifically, it has been found that phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid (70%–85%), and that PC is primarily present as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). De novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in the lung arises primarily from cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline). The transformation of CDP-choline to phosphatidylcholine is effected by choline phosphate cytidyltransferase. Under certain conditions the enzymes choline kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and phosphatidate phosphatase may play regulatory roles. Of the total DPPC in the pulmonary surfactant, 45% comes from de novo biosynthesis. The rest is formed by transacylation mechanisms that exchange palmitoyl groups for the unsaturated acyl chains of other related diacylphosphatidylcholines. Removal of the acyl chains from these related compounds produces lysophosphatidylcholine; reacylation with palmitoyl-CoA is then facilitated by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase to form DPPC. == Characteristics == === Temperature === This phospholipid is found in a solid/gel phase at 37 °C (at the effective temperature of the human body). Its melting point is around 41.3 °C. Therefore, when the temperature is above 41 °C, DPPC is no longer found in a gel phase but in a liquid one. When in contact with silica surfaces, it has been demonstrated that DPPC bilayers have different properties depending on the temperature. Layer thickness remains the same at 25 °C and at 39 °C. However, when the temperature is further increased to 55 °C, the DPPC bilayer structure changes significantly, which causes a decrease in the layer thickness. The reason for this trait is that, in fact, at 55 °C DPPC is found in a disordered liquid state, whereas at a lower temperature it is found in a more-ordered gel state. Temperature affects the layer's roughness too, which starts to change slightly when temperature is lowered to 25 °C. Finally, the load-bearing capacity of the bilayer is higher when the temperature exceeds the phase transition temperature (due to its increased fluidity). When this molecule is found in a liquid state, where the fluidity is much higher, it is thought that the bilayer also develops a self-healing capacity. === Amphipathic behaviour === DPPC is an amphipathic lipid. This characteristic is due to its hydrophilic head, composed of the polar phosphatidylcholine group, and its hydrophobic tails, formed by two nonpolar palmitic acid (C16) chains. This trait allows DPPC to easily and spontaneously form micelles, monolayers, bilayers and liposomes when it is in contact with a polar solvent. === Surfactant === DPPC is the main phospholipid of pulmonary surfactant, and it is surface-active due to its amphipathic behaviour and its adsorption capacity. However, adsorption is not optimal at human body temperature for DPPC alone, because at 37 °C it is found in a gel phase. The presence of some unsaturated phospholipids (such as dioleoylphosphatidylcholine [DOPC] or phosphatidylglycerol) and cholesterol increases the surfactant's fluidity, so it can adsorb oxygen more efficiently. When this mixture contacts water, for example, it accumulates at the water-air interface and forms a thin superficial pellicule of surfactant. The polar heads of the molecules composing the surfactant are attracted by the polar molecules of the liquid (in this case, H2O molecules), causing a significant diminution of the water's surface tension. == Current uses == === Research uses === DPPC is usually used for research purposes, such as creating liposomes and bilayers which are involved in bigger studies. The Langmuir–Blodgett technique allows the synthesis of liposomal DPPC bilayers. Currently, these liposomes are used in the study of the properties of this phosphatidylcholine and of its use as a mechanism of drug delivery in the human body. Furthermore, because vesicle fusion dynamics are different for lipids in the gel phase versus the fluid phase, it allows scientists to use DPPC along with DOPC in Atomic Force Microscopy and Atomic Force Spectroscopy. === Pharmaceutical uses === Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is routinely used to formulate some medicines used for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in newborns. Current synthetic surfactants are combinations of DPPC along with other phospholipids, neutral lipids and lipoproteins. The treatment of preterm infants with RDS using surfactants was initially developed in the 1960s, and recent studies have demonstrated an improvement in clinical outcomes. The first treatment given to some newborns with RDS was surfactant phospholipids, specifically DPPC, by means of an aerosol (Robillard, 1964). This treatment proved ineffective because administration of DPPC alone did not provide any beneficial effects. Subsequently, studies were carried out to find more effective drugs for treatment of this disease. Pulmonary surfactants can be classified into three types: The first generation of protein-free synthetic surfactants contained only DPPC. The best known is colfosceril palmitate. The second generation of surfactants were of natural (animal) origin, and were obtained from the lungs of cattle or pigs. The surfactants extracted from bovine lungs were Infasurf and Alvofact, the porcine lung extracts included Curosurf, and those made from modified bovine lung extracts included Survanta or Beraksurf (Beractant). Unlike newborns with RDS that were administered first-generation drugs, those that were treated with these second-generation surfactants required less oxygen and ventilatory support within 72 hours of drug administration. The third generation of surfactants incorporates synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins. These use a mixture of different components. DPPC is the agent used to decrease surface tension, and the rest of the components help increase oxygen adsorption. The best known are Venicute and Surfaxin. These drugs are still under development, so there is as yet no evidence as to whether they possess advantages compared to the second-generation preparations. DPPC is also used to form liposomes that are used as components of drug delivery systems. == DPPC-related illnesses == Surfactant Dysfunction Disorder is a disease that affects newborn children whose pulmonary surfactant is insufficient for adequate breathing, resulting in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Despite DPPC being one of the major components of lung surfactant, most of the genetic errors that are linked with surfactant dysfunction disorder are not linked to DPPC. Rather, the main causes of this disease are differences in the production of surfactant proteins B and C due to genetic abnormalities. However, there is a genetic condition that is related to DPPC which causes a deficiency in the production of ABCA1 protein. This protein is crucial in the transport of phospholipids – and therefore DPPC – to the lamellar bodies of the alveolar cells, where DPPC interacts with surfactant proteins to form pulmonary surfactant. Current studies cannot find a correlation between the percentage of DPPC in lung surfactant and the age of gestation, although a proven relationship has been found between the percentage of DPPC and POPC (palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine) in babies with respiratory distress syndrome compared with babies without this condition. These connections suggest that a particular surfactant composition will lead to respiratory distress syndrome, regardless of gestational age. The correlation between DPPC percentage and respiratory distress syndrome is why DPPC is used to make drugs to treat newborn infants with the disease. In addition, DPPC has been shown to be related to infection of polarized cells by a specific kind of human adenovirus (HAdV-C2). Some studies have indicated that disaturated DPPC boosts infection of A59 cells with HAdV-C2 (possibly by permitting virus entry via the apical side of polarized cells). == References ==",Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.4749639332294464), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' END', -2.999452772201039e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.318681188422488e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.42548897862434387), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('OUS', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.0007591941393911839), ('ĠMED', -0.007165803108364344), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10027549415826797)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.0206720617134124e-05), (' MED', -0.009372105821967125), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ', [])"
4282,"('Syn-norgestimate', 'Anti-norgestimate', 'Dexnorgestrel', 'Norgestimate, z-')",Medical,"Norgestrel, sold under the brand name Opill among others, is a progestin which is used in birth control pills. It is often combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol, marketed as Ovral. It is also used in menopausal hormone therapy. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of norgestrel include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, and breast tenderness. The most common side effects of the norgestrel include irregular bleeding, headaches, dizziness, nausea, increased appetite, abdominal pain, cramps, or bloating. Norgestrel is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. Norgestrel was patented in 1961 and came into medical use, specifically in birth control pills, in 1966. It was subsequently introduced for use in menopausal hormone therapy as well. Norgestrel is sometimes referred to as a ""second-generation"" progestin. It is marketed widely throughout the world. Norgestrel is available as a generic medication. In 2022, the version with ethinylestradiol was the 264th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. In July 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved norgestrel for over-the-counter sale. == Medical uses == Norgestrel is used in combination with ethinylestradiol or quinestrol in combined birth control pills, alone in progestogen-only birth control pills, and in combination with estradiol or conjugated estrogens in menopausal hormone therapy. It has also been used as an emergency contraceptive in the Yuzpe regimen. == Side effects == == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Norgestrel is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptor. The biological activity of norgestrel lies in the levo enantiomer, levonorgestrel, whereas the dextro isomer is inactive. As such, norgestrel is identical in its hormonal activity to levonorgestrel except that it is half as potent by weight. Levonorgestrel, and by extension norgestrel, have some androgenic activity, but no estrogenic, antimineralocorticoid, or glucocorticoid activity. The ovulation-inhibiting dose of norgestrel appears to be greater than 75 μg/day, as ovulation occurred in 50 to 75% of cycles with this dosage of norgestrel in studies. The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of levonorgestrel, which is twice as potent as norgestrel, is approximately 50 to 60 μg/day. One review lists the ovulation-inhibiting dose of norgestrel as 100 μg/day. The endometrial transformation dose of norgestrel is listed as 12 mg per cycle and the menstrual delay test dose of norgestrel is listed as 0.5 to 2 mg/day. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of norgestrel have been reviewed. == Chemistry == Norgestrel, also known as rac-13-ethyl-17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as rac-13-ethyl-17α-ethynylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is a racemic mixture of stereoisomers dextronorgestrel (the C13α isomer; l-norgestrel, L-norgestrel, or (+)-norgestrel) and levonorgestrel (the C13β isomer; d-norgestrel, D-norgestrel, or (–)-norgestrel), the former of which is inactive (making norgestrel exactly half as potent as levonorgestrel). Norgestrel is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is a member of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of norgestrel have been published. == History == Norgestrel was first introduced, as a birth control pill in combination with ethinylestradiol, under the brand name Eugynon in Germany in 1966. It was subsequently marketed as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol in the United States under the brand name Ovral in 1968, and was marketed in many other countries as well. The contraceptive efficacy of norgestrel was established in the U.S. with the original approval for prescription use in 1973. In July 2023, the FDA approved norgestrel for over-the-counter sale. The FDA granted the approval to Laboratoire HRA Pharma which was acquired by Perrigo Company plc. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Norgestrel is the generic name of the drug and its international nonproprietary name, United States Adopted Name, United States Pharmacopeia, British Approved Name, Dénomination Commune Française, Denominazione Comune Italiana, and Japanese Accepted Name. It is also known as dl-norgestrel, DL-norgestrel, or (±)-norgestrel. === Brand names === Norgestrel is marketed under a variety of brand names including Cyclacur, Cryselle, Cyclo-Progynova, Duoluton, Elinest, Eugynon, Microgynon, Lo/Ovral, Low-Ogestrel, Logynon, Microlut, Minicon, Nordette, Neogest, Opill, Ogestrel, Ovral, Ovran, Ovranette, Ovrette, Planovar, Prempak, Progyluton, and Trinordiol among others. == References ==",Dexnorgestrel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003268616273999214), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00863721314817667)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007099286303855479), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09389,https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/3290/,https://www.glpbio.com/norgestimate.html ', [])"
4283,"('Nitrazepam', 'Benzalin', 'Neozepam', 'Imeson', 'Mogadon')",Medical,"Nitrazepam, sold under the brand name Mogadon among others, is a hypnotic drug of the benzodiazepine class used for short-term relief from severe, disabling anxiety and insomnia. It also has sedative (calming) properties, as well as amnestic (inducing forgetfulness), anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant effects. It was first synthesized in the late 1950s by a team of researchers at Hoffmann-La Roche in Switzerland. It was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1965. == Medical use == Nitrazepam is used to treat short-term sleeping problems (insomnia), namely difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakening, or a combination of each. Nitrazepam is sometimes tried to treat epilepsy when other medications fail. It has been found to be more effective than clonazepam in the treatment of West syndrome, which is an age-dependent epilepsy, affecting the very young. In uncontrolled studies, nitrazepam has shown effectiveness in infantile spasms and is sometimes considered when other anti-seizure drugs have failed. However, drowsiness, hypotonia, and most significantly tolerance to anti-seizure effects typically develop with long-term treatment, generally limiting Nitrazepam to acute seizure management. Nitrazepam can also mitigate effects of alcohol withdrawal. A light-activated derivative of nitrazepam (fulgazepam) has been developed for research purposes. == Side effects == === More common === More common side effects may include: central nervous system depression, including somnolence, dizziness, depressed mood, fatigue, ataxia, headache, vertigo, impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, a ""hungover"" feeling in the morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and inattention have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and rebound insomnia have also been reported. Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with an elimination half-life of 15–38 hours (mean elimination half-life 26 hours). Residual ""hangover"" effects after nighttime administration of nitrazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increases the risk of falls and hip fractures. === Less common === Less common side effects may include: Hypotension, faintness, palpitation, rash or pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, and changes in libido are less common. Very infrequently, paradoxical reactions may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia. Also, depressed or increased dreaming, disorientation, severe sedation, retrograde amnesia, headache, hypothermia, and delirium tremens are reported. Severe liver toxicity has also been reported. === Cancer === Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. However, conflicting evidence implies that further research is needed in order to conclude that products of this class really do induce cancer. === Mortality === Nitrazepam therapy, compared with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy in an analysis of 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children. === Liver === Nitrazepam has been associated with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, nimetazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions. === Other long-term effects === Long-term use of nitrazepam may carry mental and physical health risks, such as the development of cognitive deficits. These adverse effects show improvement after a period of abstinence. Some other sources however seem to indicate that there is no relation between the use of benzodiazepine medication and dementia. Further research is needed in order to assert that this class of medication does really induce cognitive decline. === Abuse potential === Recreational use of nitrazepam is common. A monograph for the drug says: ""Treatment with nitrazepam should usually not exceed seven to ten consecutive days. Use for more than two to three consecutive weeks requires complete re-evaluation of the patient. Prescriptions for nitrazepam should be written for short-term use (seven to ten days) and it should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply. Dependence can occur in as little as four weeks."" === Tolerance === Tolerance to nitrazepam's effects often appears with regular use. Increased levels of GABA in cerebral tissue and alterations in the activity state of the serotoninergic system occur as a result of nitrazepam tolerance. Tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects of nitrazepam can occur after about seven days; tolerance also frequently occurs to its anticonvulsant effects. However, other sources indicate that continuous use does not necessarily lead to reduced effectiveness, which implies that tolerance is not automatic and that not all patients exhibit tolerance to the same extent. ==== Dependence and withdrawal ==== Nitrazepam can cause dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from nitrazepam may lead to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. Common withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, concentration problems, and fatigue. Discontinuation of nitrazepam produced rebound insomnia after short-term single nightly dose therapy. == Special precautions == Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Caution should be exercised in prescribing nitrazepam to anyone who is of working age due to the significant impairment of psychomotor skills; this impairment is greater when the higher dosages are prescribed. Nitrazepam in doses of 5 mg or more causes significant deterioration in vigilance performance combined with increased feelings of sleepiness. Nitrazepam at doses of 5 mg or higher impairs driving skills and like other hypnotic drugs, it is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. In the elderly, nitrazepam is associated with an increased risk of falls and hip fractures due to impairments of body balance. The elimination half-life of nitrazepam is 40 hours in the elderly and 29 hours in younger adults. Nitrazepam is commonly taken in overdose by drug abusers or suicidal individuals, sometimes leading to death. Nitrazepam is teratogenic if taken in overdose during pregnancy with 30% of births showing congenital abnormalities. It is a popular drug of abuse in countries where it is available. Doses as low as 5 mg can impair driving skills. Therefore, people driving or conducting activities which require vigilance should exercise caution in using nitrazepam or possibly avoid it altogether. === Elderly === Nitrazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam has been found to be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthria, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5 mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5 mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration. === Children === Nitrazepam is not recommended for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with nitrazepam for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and ataxia were common side effects in children with tuberous sclerosis treated with nitrazepam. The side effects of nitrazepam may impair the development of motor and cognitive skills in children treated with nitrazepam. Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from nitrazepam appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking nitrazepam, but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic agents. Children being treated with nitrazepam have been recommended to be reviewed and have their nitrazepam gradually discontinued whenever appropriate. Excess sedation, hypersalivation, swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of aspiration pneumonia, as well as several deaths, have been associated with nitrazepam therapy in children. === Pregnancy === Nitrazepam is not recommended during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a neonatal withdrawal syndrome and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs should be included in drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity, and drug interactions was used to assess nitrazepam. A Dutch analysis using the system found nitrazepam to be unsuitable in drug-prescribing formularies. The use of nitrazepam during pregnancy can lead to intoxication of the newborn. A neonatal withdrawal syndrome can also occur if nitrazepam or other benzodiazepines are used during pregnancy with symptoms such as hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting) occurring. Breast feeding by mothers using nitrazepam is not recommended. Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a risk of drug accumulation, though no active metabolites are formed during metabolism. Accumulation can occur in various body organs, including the heart; accumulation is even greater in babies. Nitrazepam rapidly crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk in high quantities. Therefore, benzodiazepines including nitrazepam should be avoided during pregnancy. In early pregnancy, nitrazepam levels are lower in the baby than in the mother, and in the later stages of pregnancy, nitrazepam is found in equal levels in both the mother and the unborn child. Internationally benzodiazepines are known to cause harm when used during pregnancy and nitrazepam is a category D drug during pregnancy. Benzodiazepines are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly penetrate the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam in late pregnancy in especially high doses may result in floppy infant syndrome. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in the development of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, and reluctance to suckle, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms may persist for hours or months after birth. === Other precautions === ==== Caution in hypotension ==== Caution in those suffering from hypotension, nitrazepam may worsen hypotension. ==== Caution in hypothyroidism ==== Caution should be exercised by people who have hypothyroidism, as this condition may cause a long delay in the metabolism of nitrazepam leading to significant drug accumulation. == Contraindications == Nitrazepam should be avoided in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially during acute exacerbations of COPD, because serious respiratory depression may occur in patients receiving hypnotics. As with other hypnotic drugs, nitrazepam is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. Nitrazepam is recommended to be avoided in patients who drive or operate machinery. A study assessing driving skills of sedative hypnotic users found the users of nitrazepam to be significantly impaired up to 17 hours after dosing, whereas users of temazepam did not show significant impairments of driving ability. These results reflect the long-acting nature of nitrazepam. == Interactions == Nitrazepam interacts with the antibiotic erythromycin, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. Alone, this interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression were documented in a case report involving a patient undergoing treatment for acute pneumonia and renal failure. Following administration of nitrazepam, triazolam, and subsequently erythromycin, the patient experienced repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in persons with other, significant physical complications. Oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of nitrazepam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of nitrazepam and accumulation. Rifampin significantly increases the clearance of nitrazepam, while probenecid significantly decreases its clearance. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of nitrazepam, leading to more prolonged effects and increased risk of accumulation. Alcohol in combination with nitrazepam may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol. Benzodiazepines including nitrazepam may inhibit the glucuronidation of morphine, leading to increased levels and prolongation of the effects of morphine in rat experiments. == Pharmacology == Nitrazepam is a nitrobenzodiazepine. It is a 1,4 benzodiazepine, with the chemical name 1,3-Dihydro-7-nitro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one. It is long acting, lipophilic, and metabolised hepatically by oxidative pathways. It acts on benzodiazepine receptors in the brain which are associated with the GABA receptors, causing an enhanced binding of GABA to GABAA receptors. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, involved in inducing sleepiness, muscular relaxation, and control of anxiety and seizures, and slows down the central nervous system. Nitrazepam is similar in action to the z-drug zopiclone prescribed for insomnia. The anticonvulsant properties of nitrazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures. The muscle relaxant properties of nitrazepam are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. It is a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. The endogenous opioid system may play a role in some of the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam in rats. Nitrazepam causes a decrease in the cerebral contents of the amino acids glycine and alanine in the mouse brain. The decrease may be due to activation of benzodiazepine receptors. At high doses decreases in histamine turnover occur as a result of nitrazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brain. Nitrazepam has demonstrated cortisol-suppressing properties in humans. It is an agonist for both central benzodiazepine receptors and to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors found in rat neuroblastoma cells. == EEG and sleep == In sleep laboratory studies, nitrazepam decreased sleep onset latency. In psychogeriatric inpatients, it was found to be no more effective than placebo tablets in increasing total time spent asleep and to significantly impair trial subjects' abilities to move and carry out everyday activities the next day, and it should not be used as a sleep aid in psychogeriatric inpatients. The drug causes a delay in the onset, and decrease in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound has been reported in some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage. == Pharmacokinetics == Nitrazepam is largely bound to plasma proteins. Benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are lipid-soluble and have a high cerebral uptake. The time for nitrazepam to reach peak plasma concentrations following oral administration is about 2 hours (0.5 to 5 hours). The half-life of nitrazepam is between 16.5 and 48.3 hours. In young people, nitrazepam has a half-life of about 29 hours and a much longer half-life of 40 hours in the elderly. Both low dose (5 mg) and high dose (10 mg) of nitrazepam significantly increases growth hormone levels in humans. Nitrazepam's half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid, 68 hours, indicates that nitrazepam is eliminated extremely slowly from the cerebrospinal fluid. Concomitant food intake has no influence on the rate of absorption of nitrazepam nor on its bioavailability. Therefore, nitrazepam can be taken with or without food. == Overdose == Nitrazepam overdose may result in stereotypical symptoms of benzodiazepine overdose including intoxication, impaired balance and slurred speech. In cases of severe overdose this may progress to a comatose state with the possibility of death. The risk of nitrazepam overdose is increased significantly if nitrazepam is abused in conjunction with opioids, as was highlighted in a review of deaths of users of the opioid buprenorphine. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam can result in a severe neurological effects. Nitrazepam taken in overdose is associated with a high level of congenital abnormalities (30 percent of births). Most of the congentital abnormalities were mild deformities. Severe nitrazepam overdose resulting in coma causes the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation to be prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses therefore of nitrazepam cause prolonged CCT and IPLs. An alpha pattern coma can be a feature of nitrazepam overdose with alpha patterns being most prominent in the frontal and central regions of the brain. Benzodiazepines were implicated in 39% of suicides by drug poisoning in Sweden, with nitrazepam and flunitrazepam accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, in the elderly over a period of 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular nitrazepam and flunitrazepam should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a brain sample of a fatal nitrazepam poisoning high concentrations of nitrazepam and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person. In a retrospective study of deaths in Sweden, when benzodiazepines were implicated in the deaths, the benzodiazepines nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were the most common benzodiazepines involved. Benzodiazepines were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction in this study of causes of deaths. In Sweden, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death. In Australia, nitrazepam and temazepam were the benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose drug related deaths. In a third of cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death. Individuals with chronic illnesses are much more vulnerable to lethal overdose with nitrazepam, as fatal overdoses can occur at relatively low doses in these individuals. == Synthesis == Reaction of 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone (1) with bromoacetyl bromide forms the amide 2. Ring closure in liquid ammonia affords nitrazepam (3). More simply, diazepinone (4) can be nitrated directly at the more reactive C7 position with potassium nitrate in sulfuric acid. == See also == Benzodiazepine Benzodiazepine dependence Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome Long-term effects of benzodiazepines Nimetazepam — methylamino derivative of nitrazepam Flunitrazepam — fluorinated methylamino derivative Clonazepam — chlorinated derivative Fulgazepam - light-activated derivative of benzodiazepine based on photoisomerizable fulgimide == References == == External links == Patient information sheet 1 Patient information sheet 2 RxMed - Nitrazepam Inchem - Nitrazepam",Mogadon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.47952248173533e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015100754098966718)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrazepam?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Nitrazepam', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrazepam?utm_source=openai')])"

It improves the survival rate of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. The combination of mitoxantrone and prednisone is approved as a second-line treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This combination was once the first line of treatment; however, a combination of docetaxel and prednisone improves survival rates and lengthens the disease-free period. Mitoxantrone is also used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), most notably the subset of the disease known as secondary-progressive MS. In the absence of a cure, mitoxantrone is effective in slowing the progression of secondary-progressive MS and extending the time between relapses in both relapsing-remitting MS and progressive-relapsing MS. == Side effects == Mitoxantrone, as with other drugs in its class, may cause adverse reactions of varying severity, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, heart damage and immunosuppression, possibly with delayed onset. Cardiomyopathy is a particularly concerning effect as it is irreversible; thus regular monitoring with echocardiograms or MUGA scans is recommended for patients. Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, mitoxantrone carries a limit on the cumulative lifetime dose (based on body surface area) in MS patients. == Mechanism of action == Mitoxantrone is a type II topoisomerase inhibitor; it disrupts DNA synthesis and DNA repair in both healthy cells and cancer cells by intercalation between DNA bases.

4286,"('Thioridazine hydrochloride', 'Thioridazine hcl', 'Sonapax hydrochloride', 'Thioridazine chloride', 'Mellaril hydrochloride')",Medical,"Thioridazine (Mellaril or Melleril) is a first generation antipsychotic drug belonging to the phenothiazine drug group and was previously widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis. The branded product was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 because it caused severe cardiac arrhythmias. However, generic versions are still available in the US. == Indications == Thioridazine was voluntarily discontinued by its manufacturer, Novartis, worldwide because it caused severe cardiac arrhythmias. However, generics remain on the market in some countries. Its primary use in medicine is for the treatment of schizophrenia. It was also tried with some success as a treatment for various psychiatric symptoms seen in people with dementia, but chronic use of thioridazine and other anti-psychotics in people with dementia is not recommended. Generic forms of thioridazine remain on the market in a few countries, usually with restrictions due to the risk of arrhythmias. For example, in the US, it is restricted to patients who have taken at least 2 other antipsychotics that either failed or caused serious side effects. == Side effects == Thioridazine prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-dependent manner. It produces significantly less extrapyramidal side effects than most first-generation antipsychotics, likely due to its potent anticholinergic effect. Its use, along with the use of other typical antipsychotics, has been associated with degenerative retinopathies (specifically retinitis pigmentosa). It has a higher propensity for causing anticholinergic side effects coupled with a lower propensity for causing extrapyramidal side effects and sedation than chlorpromazine, but also has a higher incidence of hypotension and cardiotoxicity. It is also known to possess a relatively high liability for causing orthostatic hypotension compared to other antipsychotics. Similarly to other first-generation antipsychotics it has a relatively high liability for causing prolactin elevation. It is moderate risk for causing weight gain. As with all antipsychotics thioridazine has been linked to cases of tardive dyskinesia (an often permanent neurological disorder characterised by slow, repetitive, purposeless and involuntary movements, most often of the facial muscles, that is usually brought on by years of continued treatment with antipsychotics, especially the first-generation (or typical) antipsychotics such as thioridazine) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic treatment). Blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis, leukopenia and neutropenia are possible with thioridazine treatment. Thioridazine is also associated with abnormal retinal pigmentation after many years of use. Thioridazine has been correlated to rare instances of clinically apparent acute cholestatic liver injury. == Pharmacology == Thioridazine has the following binding profile: Note: The Binding affinities given are towards cloned human receptors unless otherwise specified Acronyms used HB – Human brain receptor RC – Cloned rat receptor ND – No data == Metabolism == Thioridazine is a racemic compound with two enantiomers, both of which are metabolized, according to Eap et al., by CYP2D6 into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-2-sulfoxide, better known as mesoridazine, and into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-5-sulfoxide. Mesoridazine is in turn metabolized into sulforidazine. Thioridazine is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. == History == The manufacturer Novartis/Sandoz/Wander of the brands of thioridazine, Mellaril in the US and Canada and Melleril in Europe, discontinued the drug worldwide in June 2005. Generic forms of thioridazine however remain on the market in a few countries usually with restrictions for example in the US its restricted to patients who have taken at least 2 other antipsychotics that either failed or caused serious side effects == Antibiotic activity == Thioridazine is known to kill extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and to make methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics. A possible mechanism of action for the drug's antibiotic activity is via the inhibition of bacterial secretion pumps. The β-lactam antibiotic resistance is due to the secretion β-lactamase, a protein that destroys antibiotics. If the bacteria cannot secrete the β-lactamase, then the antibiotic will be effective. The drug has been successfully used in the treatment of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis in conjunction with more conventional amoebicidal medications. == Synthesis == Note: Same sidechain used for mesoridazine and sulforidazine. The alkylation of 2-Picoline [109-06-8] (1) with formaldehyde gives 2-Pyridineethanol [103-74-2] (2). Forming the quat salt with methyl iodide [74-88-4] leads to 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methyl-pyridinium iodide [56622-15-2] (3). Catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of hydrochloric acid leads to 2-(2-Chloroethyl)-1-Methylpiperidine [50846-01-0] (4).

As with other β-blockers, it is generally a less preferred treatment for high blood pressure. It may be used by itself or with other blood pressure medication. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, nausea, and headaches. Serious side effects may include heart failure and bronchospasm. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and dilating blood vessels. Nebivolol was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1997. It is available as a generic medication in the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was the 173rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == It is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Nebivolol is used in the treatment of angina, to decrease the heart rate and contractile force. This is relevant in patients who need to decrease the oxygen demand of the heart so that the blood supplied from stenosed or constricted arteries is adequate. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics are generally preferred over beta blockers for the treatment of primary hypertension in the absence of co-morbidities. == Pharmacology and biochemistry == === β1-selectivity === Beta blockers help patients with cardiovascular disease by blocking β1 receptors, while many of the side-effects of these medications are caused by their blockade of β2 receptors. For this reason, beta blockers that selectively block β1 adrenergic receptors (termed cardioselective or β1-selective beta blockers) produce fewer adverse effects (for instance, bronchoconstriction) than those drugs that non-selectively block both β1 and β2 receptors. In a laboratory experiment conducted on biopsied heart tissue, nebivolol proved to be the most β1-selective of the β-blockers tested, being approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective than bisoprolol. However, the drug's receptor selectivity in humans is more complex and depends on the drug dose and the genetic profile of the patient taking the medication. The drug is highly cardioselective at 5 mg. In addition, at doses above 10 mg, nebivolol loses its cardioselectivity and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors, while the recommended starting dose of nebivolol is 5 mg, sufficient control of blood pressure may require doses up to 40 mg. Furthermore, nebivolol is also not cardioselective when taken by patients with a genetic makeup that makes them ""poor metabolizers"" of nebivolol (and other drugs) or with CYP2D6 inhibitors. As many as 1 in 10 Caucasian people and even more black people are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and therefore might benefit less from nebivolol's cardioselectivity although currently there are no directly comparable studies. Nebivolol while selectively blocking beta(1) receptor acts as a beta(3)-agonist. β3 receptors are found in the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and in brown adipose tissue. Their role in gallbladder physiology is unknown, but they are thought to play a role in lipolysis and thermogenesis in brown fat. In the urinary bladder it is thought to cause relaxation of the bladder and prevention of urination. Due to enzymatic inhibition, fluvoxamine increases the exposure to nebivolol and its active hydroxylated metabolite (4-OH-nebivolol) in healthy volunteers. === Vasodilator action === Nebivolol is unique as a beta-blocker. Unlike carvedilol, it has a nitric oxide (NO)-potentiating, vasodilatory effect via stimulation of β3 receptors. Nebivolol induces vasodilation by stimulating the production of nitric oxide, a natural blood vessel relaxant. This effect is achieved by activating the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) in the cells lining the blood vessels. Unlike traditional β-blockers, nebivolol's unique mechanism of action improves arterial flexibility and reduces peripheral resistance, making it beneficial for hypertensive patients with endothelial dysfunction. The drug's ability to increase NO production persists even after metabolism, offering long-lasting benefits. Nebivolol's distinct approach to promoting NO release has shown promising results in improving endothelial function and managing hypertension in clinical trials. Along with labetalol, celiprolol and carvedilol, it is one of four beta blockers to cause dilation of blood vessels in addition to effects on the heart. === Antihypertensive effect === Nebivolol lowers blood pressure (BP) by reducing peripheral vascular resistance, and significantly increases stroke volume with preservation of cardiac output. The net hemodynamic effect of nebivolol is the result of a balance between the depressant effects of beta-blockade and an action that maintains cardiac output. Antihypertensive responses were significantly higher with nebivolol than with placebo in trials enrolling patient groups considered representative of the U.S. hypertensive population, in black people, and in those receiving concurrent treatment with other antihypertensive drugs. === Pharmacokinetics === Nebivolol plasma protein binding is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin and its half-life of low doses is 12 hours in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers and 19 hours in poor metabolizers. == Contraindications == Severe bradycardia Heart block greater than first degree Patients with cardiogenic shock Decompensated cardiac failure Sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place) Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) Patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. == Side effects == Side effects might include headache, tiredness, dizziness, lightheadedness, reduced blood flow to extremities, bradycardia. == Controversies == === Pharmacology of side-effects === Several studies have suggested that nebivolol has reduced typical beta-blocker-related side effects, such as fatigue, clinical depression, bradycardia, or impotence. However, according to the FDABystolic is associated with a number of serious risks. Bystolic is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh > B) and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of the product. Bystolic therapy is also associated with warnings regarding abrupt cessation of therapy, cardiac failure, angina and acute myocardial infarction, bronchospastic diseases, anesthesia and major surgery, diabetes and hypoglycemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral vascular disease, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers use, as well as precautions regarding use with CYP2D6 inhibitors, impaired renal and hepatic function, and anaphylactic reactions. Finally, Bystolic is associated with other risks as described in the Adverse Reactions section of its PI. For example, a number of treatment-emergent adverse events with an incidence greater than or equal to 1 percent in Bystolic-treated patients and at a higher frequency than placebo-treated patients were identified in clinical studies, including headache, fatigue, and dizziness. === FDA warning letter about advertising claims === In August 2008, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to Forest Laboratories citing exaggerated and misleading claims in their launch journal ad, in particular over claims of superiority and novelty of action. == History == Mylan Laboratories licensed the US and Canadian rights to nebivolol from Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. in 2001. Nebivolol is already registered and successfully marketed in more than 50 countries, including the United States where it is marketed under the brand name Bystolic from Mylan Laboratories and Forest Laboratories.

It has been withdrawn from the market in the United States and Canada due to safety concerns. It is taken by mouth. The drug is a prodrug of methylergometrine (methylergonovine), which circulates at levels about 10 times higher than those of methysergide during treatment with methysergide. Whereas methysergide is a mixed agonist of some serotonin receptors (e.g., the 5-HT1 receptors) and antagonist of other serotonin receptors (e.g., the 5-HT2 receptors), methylergonovine is a non-selective agonist of most of the serotonin receptors, including of both the serotonin 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor subgroups. Methysergide and methylergometrine are ergolines and lysergamides and are related to the ergot alkaloids. Methysergide was first described in the literature by 1958. It is no longer recommended as a first-line therapy for migraines or cluster headaches. This is due to toxicity, such as cardiac valvulopathy, which was first reported with long-term use in the late 1960s. Ergot-based medications like methysergide fell out of favor for treatment of migraine with the introduction of the triptans in the 1980s. == Medical uses == Methysergide is used exclusively to treat episodic and chronic migraine and for episodic and chronic cluster headaches. Methysergide is one of the most effective medications for the prevention of migraine, but is not intended for the treatment of an acute attack, it is to be taken daily as a preventative medication. === Migraine and cluster headaches === Methysergide has been known as an effective treatment for migraine and cluster headache for over 50 years. A 2016 investigation by the European Medicines Agency due to long-held questions about safety concerns was performed. To assess the need for continuing availability of methysergide, the International Headache Society performed an electronic survey among their professional members. The survey revealed that 71.3% of all respondents had ever prescribed methysergide and 79.8% would prescribe it if it were to become available. Respondents used it more in cluster headache than migraine, and reserved it for use in refractory patients. The European Medicines Agency concluded ""that the vast majority of headache experts in this survey regarded methysergide a unique treatment option for specific populations for which there are no alternatives, with an urgent need to continue its availability."" This position was supported by the International Headache Society. Updated guidelines published by Britain's National Health Service Migraine Trust in 2014 recommended ""Methysergide medicines are now only to be used for preventing severe intractable migraine and cluster headache when standard medicines have failed"". === Other uses === Methysergide is also used in carcinoid syndrome to treat severe diarrhea. It may also be used in the treatment of serotonin syndrome. == Side effects == It has a known side effect, retroperitoneal fibrosis/retropulmonary fibrosis, which is severe, although uncommon. This side effect has been estimated to occur in 1/5000 patients. In addition, there is an increased risk of left-sided cardiac valve dysfunction. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Methysergide interacts with the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors and the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors. It does not have significant affinity for human 5-HT3, dopamine, α1-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, cannabinoid, or histamine receptors, nor for the monoamine transporters. Methysergide is an agonist of 5-HT1 receptors, including a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor, and is an antagonist at the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT7 receptors. Methysergide is metabolized into methylergometrine in humans, which in contrast to methysergide is a partial agonist of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors and also interacts with various other targets. Methysergide antagonizes the effects of serotonin in blood vessels and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but has few of the properties of other ergot alkaloids. It is thought that metabolism of methysergide into its active metabolite methylergonovine is responsible for the antimigraine effects of methysergide. Methylergonovine appears to be 10 times more potent than methysergide as an agonist of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors and has higher intrinsic efficacy in activating these receptors. Methysergide produces psychedelic effects at high doses (3.5–7.5 mg). Metabolism of methysergide into methylergonovine is considered to be responsible for the psychedelic effects of methysergide. The psychedelic effects can specifically be attributed to activation of the 5-HT2A receptor. The medication can activate the 5-HT2B receptor due to metabolism into methylergonovine and for this reason has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy. It is thought that the serotonin receptor antagonism of methysergide is not able to overcome the serotonin receptor agonism of methylergonovine due to the much higher levels of methylergonovine during methysergide therapy. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of methysergide is 13% due to high first-pass metabolism into methylergonovine. Methysergide produces methylergonovine as a major active metabolite. Levels of methylergonovine are about 10-fold higher than those of methysergide during methysergide therapy. As such, methysergide may be considered a prodrug of methylergonovine. The elimination half-life of methylergonovine is almost four times as long as that of methysergide. == Chemistry == Methysergide, also known as N-[(2S)-1-hydroxybutan-2-yl]-1,6-dimethyl-9,10-didehydroergoline-8α-carboxamide or N-(1-(hydroxymethyl)propyl)-1-methyl-D-lysergamide, is a derivative of the ergolines and lysergamides and is structurally related to other members of these families, for instance lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). == History == Harold Wolff's theory of vasodilation in migraine is well-known. Less known is his search for a perivascular factor that would damage local tissues and increase pain sensitivity during migraine attacks. Serotonin was found to be among the candidate agents to be included. In the same period, serotonin was isolated (1948) and, because of its actions, an anti-serotonin drug was needed. Methysergide was synthesized from lysergic acid by adding a methyl group and a butanolamid group. This resulted in a compound with selectivity and high potency as a serotonin (5-HT) inhibitor. Based on the possible involvement of serotonin in migraine attacks, it was introduced in 1959 by Sicuteri as a preventive drug for migraine. The clinical effect was often excellent, but 5 years later it was found to cause retroperitoneal fibrosis after chronic intake. Consequently, the use of the drug in migraine declined considerably, but it was still used as a 5-HT antagonist in experimental studies. In 1974 Saxena showed that methysergide had a selective vasoconstrictor effect in the carotid bed and in 1984 he found an atypical receptor. This finding provided an incentive for the development of sumatriptan. Novartis withdrew it from the U.S. market after taking over Sandoz, but currently lists it as a discontinued product. === Production and availability === US production of Methysergide, (Sansert), was discontinued on the manufacturer's own behalf in 2002. Sansert had previously been produced by Sandoz, which merged with Ciba-Geigy in 1996, and led to the creation of Novartis. In 2003 Novartis united its global generics businesses under a single global brand, with the Sandoz name and product line reviewed and reestablished. == Society and culture == === Controversy === Methysergide has been an effective treatment for migraine and cluster headache for over 50 years but has systematically been suppressed from the migraine and cluster headache marketplace for over 15 years due to unqualified risk benefit/ratio safety concerns. Many cite the potential side effects of retroperitoneal/retropulmonary fibrosis as the prime reason methysergide is no longer frequently prescribed, but retroperitoneal fibrosis, and retropulmonary fibrosis, were documented as side effects as early as 1966, and 1967, respectively. == References == == External links == Novartis Sansert site.

4289,"('Methysergide', 'Sansert', 'Methysergid', 'Desernil', 'Deseryl')",Medical,"Methysergide, sold under the brand names Deseril and Sansert, is a monoaminergic medication of the ergoline and lysergamide groups which is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of migraine and cluster headaches. It has been withdrawn from the market in the United States and Canada due to safety concerns. It is taken by mouth. The drug is a prodrug of methylergometrine (methylergonovine), which circulates at levels about 10 times higher than those of methysergide during treatment with methysergide. Whereas methysergide is a mixed agonist of some serotonin receptors (e.g., the 5-HT1 receptors) and antagonist of other serotonin receptors (e.g., the 5-HT2 receptors), methylergonovine is a non-selective agonist of most of the serotonin receptors, including of both the serotonin 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor subgroups. Methysergide and methylergometrine are ergolines and lysergamides and are related to the ergot alkaloids. Methysergide was first described in the literature by 1958. It is no longer recommended as a first-line therapy for migraines or cluster headaches. This is due to toxicity, such as cardiac valvulopathy, which was first reported with long-term use in the late 1960s. Ergot-based medications like methysergide fell out of favor for treatment of migraine with the introduction of the triptans in the 1980s. == Medical uses == Methysergide is used exclusively to treat episodic and chronic migraine and for episodic and chronic cluster headaches. Methysergide is one of the most effective medications for the prevention of migraine, but is not intended for the treatment of an acute attack, it is to be taken daily as a preventative medication. === Migraine and cluster headaches === Methysergide has been known as an effective treatment for migraine and cluster headache for over 50 years. A 2016 investigation by the European Medicines Agency due to long-held questions about safety concerns was performed. To assess the need for continuing availability of methysergide, the International Headache Society performed an electronic survey among their professional members. The survey revealed that 71.3% of all respondents had ever prescribed methysergide and 79.8% would prescribe it if it were to become available. Respondents used it more in cluster headache than migraine, and reserved it for use in refractory patients.

4290,"('Imitrex', 'Imigran', 'Suminat', 'Sumavel dosepro', 'Alsuma')",Medical,"Sumatriptan, sold under the brand name Imitrex among others, is a medication used to treat migraine headaches and cluster headaches. It is taken orally, intranasally, or by subcutaneous injection. Therapeutic effects generally occur within three hours. Its primary effect as a serotonin 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor agonist can create common side effects such as chest pressure, fatigue, vomiting, tingling, and vertigo. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, heart attack, stroke, and seizures. With excessive use, medication overuse headaches may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear. It is in the triptan class of medications. Sumatriptan was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 95th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. It is also available as the combination product sumatriptan/naproxen. == Medical uses == Sumatriptan is effective for ending or relieving the intensity of migraine and cluster headaches. It is most effective when taken early after the start of the pain. Injected sumatriptan is more effective than other formulations. Oral sumatriptan can be used also in the treatment of post-dural puncture headache. == Adverse effects == Overdose of sumatriptan can cause sulfhemoglobinemia, a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to green, due to the integration of sulfur into the hemoglobin molecule. If sumatriptan is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks. Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. There are reports of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and transient amnesia after sumatriptan use. The most common side effects reported by at least 2% of patients in controlled trials of sumatriptan (25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets) for migraine are atypical sensations (paresthesia and warm/cold sensations) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 5–6% in the sumatriptan groups, pain and other pressure sensations (including chest pain) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 6–8% in the sumatriptan groups, neurological events (vertigo) reported by less than 1% in the placebo group and less than 1% to 2% in the sumatriptan groups. Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2–3% of the sumatriptan groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the sumatriptan group. Sumatriptan has a low abuse potential; however overuse is associated with medication overuse headache. Moreover, prolonged sumatriptan use is associated with pronociceptive effects, resulting in allodynia. This effect's association with medication overuse headache, however, is controversial, due to the fact that animal-model studies are not consistent with typical presentation of this disorder. == Interactions == Concurrent use with other triptans or ergot-containing medications (e.g., ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) within 24 hours can result in additive vasoconstriction. Increased systemic exposure to sumatriptan can occur if used within 2 weeks after a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported with co-administration of triptans and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Sumatriptan is molecularly similar to serotonin (5-HT), and is a 5-HT receptor (types 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B) agonist. Sumatriptan's primary therapeutic effect is related in its inhibition of the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), likely through its 5-HT1D/1B receptor agonist action. This has been substantiated by the efficacy of more recently developed CGRP targeting drugs and antibodies developed for the preventive treatment of migraine. How agonism of the 5-HT1D/1B receptors inhibits CGRP release is not fully understood. CGRP is believed to cause sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, contributing to the pain experienced in migraine. Sumatriptan is also shown to decrease the activity of the trigeminal nerve, which presumably accounts for sumatriptan's efficacy in treating cluster headaches. The injectable form of the drug has been shown to abort a cluster headache within 30 minutes in 77% of cases. === Pharmacokinetics === Sumatriptan is administered in several forms: tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as succinate salt) has low bioavailability, partly due to presystemic metabolism—some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A rapid-release tablet formulation with the same bioavailability but a high concentration can achieve therapeutic effects on average 10–15 minutes earlier than other oral formulations. When injected, sumatriptan is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. There is no simple, direct relationship between sumatriptan concentration (pharmacokinetics) per se in the blood and its anti-migraine effect (pharmacodynamics). This paradox has, to some extent, been resolved by comparing the rates of absorption of the various sumatriptan formulations, rather than the absolute amounts of drug that they deliver. ==== Metabolism ==== Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into indol-3-yl-acetaldehyde and then into corresponding carboxylic acid. It is further modified by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase into a conjugate with glucuronic acid. Other pathways are mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which give an N-oxide derivative, and N-desmethyl and N,N-didesmethyl forms (the latter can be converted into the aldehyde by monoamine oxidase A). N-desmethyl derivative can also undergo a reaction with D-cysteine. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged. == History == In 1991, Glaxo received approval for sumatriptan, which was the first available triptan. In July 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a single-use jet injector formulation of sumatriptan. The device delivers a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan, without the use of a needle. Autoinjectors with needles have been previously available in Europe and North America. Phase III studies with an iontophoretic transdermal patch (Zelrix/Zecuity) started in July 2008. This patch uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of sumatriptan through the skin within 30 minutes. Zecuity was approved by the FDA in January 2013. Sales of Zecuity have been stopped following reports of skin burns and irritation. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In the United States, it is available only by medical prescription. It is available over the counter in many states in Australia. The product requires labelling by a pharmacist and is only available in packs of two without a medical prescription. However, it can be bought over the counter in the UK and Sweden. In Russia, versions of sumatriptan which are not registered in the State Register of Medicines may be regarded as narcotic drugs (derivatives of dimethyltryptamine). === Generics === Glaxo patents for sumatriptan expired in February 2009. At that time, Imitrex sold for about $25 a pill. Par Pharmaceutical then introduced generic versions of sumatriptan injection (sumatriptan succinate injection) 4- and 6-mg starter kits and 4- and 6-mg filled syringe cartridges, and 6-mg vials soon after. Mylan Laboratories Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis), Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and other companies have been producing generic versions of sumatriptan tablets in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg doses. Generic forms of the drug are available in U.S. and European markets after Glaxo's patent protections expired in the respective countries. A nasal spray form of sumatriptan known as AVP-825 has been developed by Avanir and is generically available in some countries. === Controversy === According to the American Headache Society, ""Patients frequently state that they have difficulty accessing triptans prescribed to them."" In the U.S. triptans cost from $12 to $120 each, and more than 80% of U.S. health insurance plans place a limit on the amount of pills available to a patient per month, which has been called ""arbitrary and unfair."" == References ==",Imigran,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5020257706055418e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004391897819004953)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4291,"('Secobarbital', 'Quinalbarbitone', 'Secobarbitone', 'Seconal', 'Meballymal')",Medical,"Secobarbital, sold under the brand name Seconal among others, is a short-acting barbiturate drug originally used for the treatment of insomnia. It was patented by Eli Lilly and Company in 1934 in the United States. It possesses anesthetic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic properties. In the United Kingdom, it was known as quinalbarbitone. Secobarbital is considered to be an obsolete sedative-hypnotic (sleeping pill) and has largely been replaced by the benzodiazepine family. It was widely abused, known on the street as ""red devils"" or ""reds."" Among barbiturates, secobarbital carries a particularly high risk of abuse and addiction, which is largely responsible for it falling out of use. == Uses == === Medical === Secobarbital is used for managing symptoms of epilepsy and for short-term treatment of insomnia. It is also used as a preoperative medication to produce anesthesia and anxiolysis for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. === Recreational and lethal use === Secobarbital was widely abused for recreational purposes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and accidental overdose was associated with the drug. Lilly's Seconal came in a bright orange/red bullet shaped capsule known as a Pulvule. Prescription use of secobarbital decreased beginning in the early 1980s by which time benzodiazepines had become increasingly common. Secobarbital has acquired many nicknames, the most common being ""reds,"" ""red devils,"" or ""red dillies"" (because of the color of the capsules). Other common nicknames are ""seccies,"" ""Cardinals,"" ""ruby slippers,"" and, according to the Wegman's School of Pharmacy curriculum, ""red hearts"". A less common nickname is ""dolls""; this was partly responsible for the title of Jacqueline Susann's novel Valley of the Dolls, whose main characters use secobarbital and other such drugs. Actresses Carole Landis, Judy Garland, playwright Tennessee Williams, and journalist Dorothy Kilgallen allegedly either died by suicide or of accidentally overdosing on secobarbital. Seconal was used to induce Fred Hampton into docility before he was then killed in his bed in the early hours of December 4, 1969. In 1978, 1,000 pills of Seconal were recovered in Jonestown, along with substantial quantities of Valium, Thorazine, Talwin, Demerol, and other sedatives, hypnotics, and analgesics. === Assisted dying === Human Secobarbital is used in assisted dying, either euthanasia or palliative sedation. In the Netherlands, individuals have two options for assisted dying: they can orally consume 100 mL of concentrated syrup containing either 15 grams of pentobarbital or 15 grams of secobarbital, or they can choose to have 2 grams of thiopental or 1 gram of propofol administered intravenously by a doctor, followed by a muscle relaxant. As of 2010, only 15% of those who died by physician-assisted suicide opted for orally consuming the lethal drug(s), the rest choosing to have the drugs administered intravenously by a doctor instead. In the United States, secobarbital and pentobarbital are the most common drugs prescribed under physician aid-in-dying laws in Oregon since 1998, Washington since 2008, and Vermont since 2013. Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited previously experienced various issues in their attempts to produce 100 mg secobarbital capsules. In 2017, secobarbital was made available for physician-assisted suicide in Canada. Animal It is a component in the veterinary drug Somulose, used for euthanasia of horses and cattle. The LD50 of secobarbital has been reported to be between 125 mg/kg (rat, oral) and 267 mg/kg (mouse, oral). == Adverse effects == Possible side effects of secobarbital include: Somnolence Dizziness Impaired motor functions Impaired coordination Impaired balance Anxiety Confusion Irritability Headache Increased appetite Nausea Vomiting Nightmares Increased sensitivity to pain Allergic reactions Difficulty breathing Edema Urticaria === Withdrawal === Secobarbital may produce psychological addiction and produces physical dependence if used for an extended period of time. Withdrawal symptoms may occur if long-term use is abruptly ended and can include: Anxiety Insomnia Decreased appetite Seizures Tremors Possible death as a result of withdrawal == Availability == Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, an India-based company now predominantly owned by the Japanese company Daiichi Sankyo, obtained the rights to market and to use the trade name Seconal from Eli Lilly in 1998 and did so until September 2008. The actual manufacturer of Seconal subsequent to the time Eli Lilly manufactured the drug was Ohm Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ranbaxy. The rights to market Seconal were then sold to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which became the marketer and trade-name holder. At the time Marathon Pharmaceuticals obtained ownership of the brand name, the retail price for one 100 mg capsule (depending upon prescription size and pharmacy) averaged about one U.S. dollar. During the time Marathon owned the brand name, the company greatly increased the price of the drug. By February 2015, when Marathon sold the rights to Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the average retail price per 100 mg capsule had risen to over thirty dollars. Since its acquisition of the trade name, Valeant Pharmaceuticals made little, if any, change to the pricing of Seconal. Despite the price increases implemented by Marathon Pharmaceuticals, Seconal was still manufactured by Ohm. In the United States, Seconal is available only in 100 mg capsules, as a sodium salt. The salt is a white hygroscopic powder that is soluble in water and ethanol. While generic versions of the drug were in existence after Eli Lilly's patent on Seconal expired, currently there are no companies that manufacture the drug generically in the United States. Until 2020, Valeant was the sole marketer of Seconal in the United States. As of 2021, Valeant discontinued the product, and Bausch Health became the sole supplier of Seconal.

4292,"('Terbuclomine', 'Penbutolol (sulfate)')",Medical," The effect of ultrasound and chemical penetration enhancers on transcutaneous flux of penbutolol sulfate across split-thickness porcine skin was investigated. Penbutolol sulfate is a potent, noncardioselective beta-blocker, which is used for the management of hypertension. The drug is one of the most lipid soluble of the β-adrenoceptor antagonists used clinically. It has an n-octanol/pH 7.4 buffer partition coefficient of 179 compared to a value of 22 for propranolol. The amount of penbutolol sulfate transported across the skin is low. In this project, we studied the effect of sonophoresis and chemical penetration enhancers on transdermal delivery of penbutolol sulfate. Low-frequency sonophoresis at a frequency of 20 kHz increased transcutaneous flux of penbutolol sulfate by 3.5-fold (27.37 ± μg cm Iontophoretic transport of penbutolol sulfate across porcine ear skin was studied. Passive transdermal flux of the drug in phosphate-buffered saline was 7.65 microg/cm(2) hr. There was statistically significant flux enhancement when direct current iontophoresis was applied. Iontophoresis (0.11 mA/cm(2), 0.17 mA/cm(2), and 0.22 mA/cm(2)) for 6 hr, resulted in net transport of 87.36 microg/cm(2), 137.51 microg/cm(2), and 201.12 microg/cm(2) of penbutolol sulfate, respectively. After 24 hr, cumulative amount of penbutolol transported were 201.63, 300.76, and 359.98 microg/cm(2), respectively. There was a 2.20- (0.11 mA/cm(2)), 3.26- (0.17 m/Acm(2)), and 4.28-fold (0.22 mA/cm(2)) enhancement in transcutaneous steady-state flux values compared to passive delivery. Steady-state fluxes of penbutolol sulfate also increased proportionally to current density. Steady-state fluxes calculated from the linear portion of the cumulative amount versus time curves for penbutolol sulfate were 16.68, 24.97, and 32.76 microg/cm(2)/hr at current densities of 0.11, 0.17, and 0.22 mA/cm(2).

4293,"('Loxuran', 'Dicarocide', 'Caritrol', 'Diethylcarbamazine (citrate)', 'Eosinopin')","Food, Medical"," Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a vector-borne neglected tropical disease, causing permanent disability. The disease is debilitating and widespread, leading to tremendous productivity and economic loss. The Government of India (GOI) prioritized the elimination of LF through the annual mass drug administration (MDA) programme in 2004 and continued with a single dose of diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC), 6 mg/kg of body weight, plus albendazole annually over a period of 5-6 years. The GOI had set the target to achieve LF elimination by 2015 and now by 2030. The progress so far has been suboptimal. Much remains to be done as about 84 per cent of the total 328 endemic districts are still under MDA. The major challenge in implementing MDA is poor compliance. It is necessary to have a feasible alternative strategy addressing the above challenge to achieve the desired goal of LF elimination. At this juncture, a well-researched approach, i.e. the use of DEC-fortified salt, also advocated by the World Health Organization, as a unique form of MDA, is proposed. As per this strategy, a low dose of DEC (0.2% w/w) is added to the cooking salt at the manufacturing facility of iodized salt and consumed by the LF-endemic communities for about two years. Many examples of successful use of this strategy for LF elimination in small- and large-scale trials have been documented in India and several other endemic countries in the world. Implementing DEC-iodine-fortified salt is a safe, less expensive, more efficient and prompt approach for achieving the elimination of LF in India. Adverse effects are none or minor and self-limiting. The DEC-fortified salt strategy can easily piggyback on the existing countrywide deployment of iodized salt under the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP), which has achieved a great success in reducing iodine-deficiency disorders such as hypothyroidism. This existing robust programme can be leveraged to launch DEC-fortified salt for the community. If implemented appropriately, this strategy will ensure the complete cessation of LF transmission within two years from its introduction. If the said strategy is implemented in 2022, it is expected that India will be able to achieve the LF elimination by 2024, much before the global target of 2030.",Diethylcarbamazine (citrate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005435658385977149), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6933082342147827)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ', [])"
4294,"('Amitriptyline hydrochloride', 'Amitriptyline hcl', 'Annoyltin', 'Tryptizol', 'Domical')",Medical,"Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, and a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches. Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a second-line therapy for these indications. The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain. Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects. Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another, and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects. Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache. It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed. === Depression === Amitriptyline is effective for depression, but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments. For treatment-resistant adolescent depression or for cancer-related depression amitriptyline is no better than placebo; however, the number of treated patients in both studies was small. It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease, but supporting evidence for that is lacking. === Pain === Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy. It is recommended by a variety of guidelines as a first or second-line treatment. It is as effective for this indication as gabapentin or pregabalin but less well tolerated. Amitriptyline is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine. Combination treatment of amitriptyline and pregabalin offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is usually safe. Amitriptyline in certain formulations may also induce the level of sciatic-nerve blockade needed for local anesthesia therein. Here, it has been demonstrated to be of superior potency to bupivacaine, a customary long-acting local anesthetic. Low doses of amitriptyline moderately improve sleep disturbances and reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. It is recommended for fibromyalgia accompanied by depression by Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and as a second-line option for fibromyalgia, with exercise being the first line option, by European League Against Rheumatism. Combinations of amitriptyline and fluoxetine or melatonin may reduce fibromyalgia pain better than either medication alone. There is some (low-quality) evidence that amitriptyline may reduce pain in cancer patients. It is recommended only as a second-line therapy for non-chemotherapy-induced neuropathic or mixed neuropathic pain if opioids did not provide the desired effect. Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy. In multiple sclerosis, it is frequently used to treat painful paresthesias in the arms and legs (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains) caused by damage to the pain-regulating pathways of the brain and spinal cord. === Headache === Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow for minimization of side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children. Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine. === Other indications === Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, because of its side effects, it should be reserved for select patients for whom other agents do not work. There is insufficient evidence to support its use for abdominal pain in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes. Amitriptyline, as the most commonly used of them, is recommended as a first-line agent for its therapy. Amitriptyline may improve pain and urgency intensity associated with bladder pain syndrome and can be used in the management of this syndrome. Amitriptyline can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children. However, its effect is not sustained after the treatment ends. Alarm therapy gives better short- and long-term results. In the US, amitriptyline is commonly used in children with ADHD as an adjunct to stimulant medications without any evidence or guideline supporting this practice. Many physicians in the UK (and the US also) commonly prescribe amitriptyline for insomnia; however, Cochrane reviewers were not able to find any randomized controlled studies that would support or refute this practice. Similarly, a major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of amitriptyline for insomnia. The well-known sedating effects of amitriptyline, however, bear understanding on and arguable justification for this practice. It may function similarly to doxepin in this regard, although the evidence for doxepin is more robust. Trimipramine may be a more novel alternative given its tendency to not suppress but brighten R.E.M. sleep. == Contraindications and precautions == The known contraindications of amitriptyline are: Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia. It may precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation when SSRIs have been shown not to work. == Side effects == The most frequent side effects, occurring in 20% or more of users, are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain (on average 1.8 kg). Other common side effects are headache problems (amblyopia, blurred vision), tachycardia, increased appetite, tremor, fatigue/asthenia/feeling slowed down, and dyspepsia. A less common side effect of amitriptyline is urination problems (8.7%). Amitriptyline can increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 24 and the US FDA required a boxed warning to be added to the prescription label. Amitriptyline-associated sexual dysfunction (occurring at a frequency of 6.9%) seems to be mostly confined to males with depression and is expressed predominantly as erectile dysfunction and low libido disorder, with lesser frequency of ejaculatory and orgasmic problems. The rate of sexual dysfunction in males treated for indications other than depression and in females is not significantly different from placebo. Liver test abnormalities occur in 10–12% of patients on amitriptyline, but are usually mild, asymptomatic, and transient, with consistently elevated alanine transaminase in 3% of all patients. The increases of the enzymes above the 3-fold threshold of liver toxicity are uncommon, and cases of clinically apparent liver toxicity are rare; nevertheless, amitriptyline is placed in the group of antidepressants with greater risks of hepatic toxicity. Amitriptyline prolongs the QT interval. This prolongation is relatively small at therapeutic doses but becomes severe in overdose. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Benzodiazepines are recommended to control seizures. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline. == Interactions == Since amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline are primarily metabolized by cytochromes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (see its pharmacology), the inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic interactions with amitriptyline. According to the prescribing information, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the plasma level of amitriptyline. However, the results in the other literature are inconsistent: the co-administration of amitriptyline with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine does increase the plasma levels of amitriptyline two-fold and of the main active metabolite nortriptyline 1.5-fold, but combination with less potent CYP2D6 inhibitors thioridazine or levomepromazine does not affect the levels of amitriptyline and increases nortriptyline by about 1.5-fold; A case of clinically significant interaction with potent CYP2D6 inhibitor terbinafine has been reported. A potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes fluvoxamine increases the level of amitriptyline two-fold while slightly decreasing the level of nortriptyline. Similar changes occur with a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes cimetidine: amitriptyline level increases by about 70%, while nortriptyline decreases by 50%. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole elevates amitriptyline level by about a quarter. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 inducers such as carbamazepine and St. John's Wort decrease the levels of both amitriptyline and nortriptyline Oral contraceptives may increase the blood level of amitriptyline by as high as 90%. Valproate moderately increases the levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline through an unclear mechanism. The prescribing information warns that the combination of amitriptyline with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome; however, this has been disputed. The prescribing information cautions that some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate. However, other literature states that there is little or no interaction: in a pharmacokinetic study topiramate only increased the level of amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 33%. Amitriptyline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see table in this section). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see table in this section). Amitriptyline is a non-selective blocker of multiple ion channels, in particular, voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.2/ Kv7.3, Kv7.1, Kv7.1/KCNE1, and hERG. === Mechanism of action === Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters by amitriptyline results in interference with neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Since the reuptake process is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity, this action may potentiate or prolong the activity of serotonergic and adrenergic neurons and is believed to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord appears to be mostly responsible for the analgesic action of amitriptyline. Increased level of norepinephrine increases the basal activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which mediate an analgesic effect by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission among spinal interneurons. The blocking effect of amitriptyline on sodium channels may also contribute to its efficacy in pain conditions. === Pharmacokinetics === Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (90–95%). Absorption is gradual with the peak concentration in blood plasma reached after about 4 hours. Extensive metabolism on the first pass through the liver leads to average bioavailability of about 50% (45%-53%). Amitriptyline is metabolized mostly by CYP2C19 into nortriptyline and by CYP2D6 leading to a variety of hydroxylated metabolites, with the principal one among them being (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline (see metabolism scheme), and to a lesser degree, by CYP3A4. Nortriptyline, the main active metabolite of amitriptyline, is an antidepressant on its own right. Nortriptyline reaches 10% higher level in the blood plasma than the parent drug amitriptyline and 40% greater area under the curve, and its action is an important part of the overall action of amitriptyline. Another active metabolite is (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline, which is a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor four times weaker than nortriptyline. (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline blood level is comparable to that of nortriptyline, but its cerebrospinal fluid level, which is a close proxy of the brain concentration of a drug, is twice higher than nortriptyline's. Based on this, (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline was suggested to significantly contribute to the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline. Blood levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline and pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline in general, with clearance difference of up to 10-fold, vary widely between individuals. Variability of the area under the curve in steady state is also high, which makes a slow upward titration of the dose necessary. In the blood, amitriptyline is 96% bound to plasma proteins; nortriptyline is 93–95% bound, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline is about 60% bound. Amitriptyline has an elimination half life of 21 hours, nortriptyline – 23–31 hours, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline − 8–10 hours. Within 48 hours, 12−80% of amitriptyline is eliminated in the urine, mostly as metabolites. 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Elimination in the feces, apparently, have not been studied. Therapeutic levels of amitriptyline range from 75 to 175 ng/mL (270–631 nM), or 80–250 ng/mL of both amitriptyline and its metabolite nortriptyline. === Pharmacogenetics === Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If the use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. == Chemistry == Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having an octanol-water partition coefficient (pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility of the free base amitriptyline in water is 14 mg/L. Amitriptyline is prepared by reacting dibenzosuberane with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride and then heating the resulting intermediate product with hydrochloric acid to eliminate water. == History == Amitriptyline was first developed by the American pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1950s. In 1958, Merck approached several clinical investigators proposing to conduct clinical trials of amitriptyline for schizophrenia. One of these researchers, Frank Ayd, instead, suggested using amitriptyline for depression. Ayd treated 130 patients and, in 1960, reported that amitriptyline had antidepressant properties similar to another, and the only known at the time, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Following this, the US Food and Drug Administration approved amitriptyline for depression in 1961. In Europe, due to a quirk of the patent law at the time allowing patents only on the chemical synthesis but not on the drug itself, Roche and Lundbeck were able to independently develop and market amitriptyline in the early 1960s. According to research by a historian of psychopharmacology David Healy, amitriptyline became a much bigger selling drug than its precursor imipramine because of two factors. First, amitriptyline has a much stronger anxiolytic effect. Second, Merck conducted a marketing campaign raising clinicians' awareness of depression as a clinical entity. == Society and culture == In the 2021 film The Many Saints of Newark, amitriptyline (referred to by the brand name Elavil) is part of the plot line of the movie. === Names === Amitriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while amitriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are amitriptilina, in German is Amitriptylin, and in Latin is amitriptylinum. The embonate salt is known as amitriptyline embonate, which is its BANM, or as amitriptyline pamoate unofficially. === Prescription trends === Between 1998 and 2017, along with imipramine, amitriptyline was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for children aged 5–11 years in England. It was also the most prescribed antidepressant (along with fluoxetine) for 12- to 17-year-olds. == Research == The few randomized controlled trials investigating amitriptyline efficacy in eating disorder have been discouraging. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == Further reading == Dean L (March 2017).

4297,"('Imatinib mesylate', 'Gleevec', 'Glivec', 'Imatinib mesilate', 'Imatinib mesylate (sti571)')",Medical,"Imatinib, sold under the brand names Gleevec and Glivec (both marketed worldwide by Novartis) among others, is an oral targeted therapy medication used to treat cancer. Imatinib is a small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases such as CSF1R, ABL, c-KIT, FLT3, and PDGFR-β. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and rash. Severe side effects may include fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, bone marrow suppression, liver problems, and heart failure. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Imatinib works by stopping the Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase. This can slow growth or result in programmed cell death of certain types of cancer cells. Imatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. A generic version became available in the UK as of 2017. == Medical uses == Imatinib is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies. In 2006 the FDA expanded approved use to include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD), and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM). Imatinib is considered to be a very effective treatment for CML, and has been shown to improve outcomes for people with this type of leukemia. It can also be used to treat some types of ALL, but is not considered a standard of care for ALL. In many cases, Imatinib can induce a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) and many patients can have a long-term remission. It is also used to maintain remission in chronic phase CML patients. While Imatinib is a very effective treatment for CML and some types of ALL, it is not a cure for leukemia. Instead, it is a 'chronic therapy' that helps to control the disease and prevent it from progressing. Some patients may need to continue taking Imatinib for an extended period of time to maintain remission, and some patients may eventually require additional treatment options. === Chronic myelogenous leukemia === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, both in adults and children. The drug is approved in multiple contexts of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, including after stem cell transplant, in blast crisis, and newly diagnosed. Due in part to the development of imatinib and related drugs, the five-year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia increased from 31% in 1993, to 59% in 2009, to 70% in 2016. By 2023, the five year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia had risen to 90%. Starting from 2011, it became clear that CML patients who continue to respond to imatinib have the same or almost the same life expectancy as the general population. === Gastrointestinal stromal tumors === The FDA first granted approval for advanced GIST patients in 2002. On 1 February 2012, imatinib was approved for use after the surgical removal of KIT-positive tumors to help prevent recurrence. The drug is also approved in unresectable KIT-positive GISTs. === Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) === The FDA granted approval for the treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) patients in 2006. Specifically adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Prior to approval DFSP was considered unresponsive to chemotherapy treatments. === Other === The FDA has approved imatinib for use in adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL. For treatment of progressive plexiform neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type I, early research has shown potential for using the c-KIT tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib. There have been several phase 2 trials of imatinib for aggressive fibromatosis. == Contraindications and cautions == The only known contraindication to imatinib is hypersensitivity to imatinib. Cautions include: Hepatic impairment Risk of severe CHF or left ventricular dysfunction, especially in patients with comorbidities Pregnancy, risk of embryo-fetal toxicity Risk of fluid retention Risk of growth stunting in children or adolescents == Side effects == The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, leg aches/cramps, fluid retention, visual disturbances, itchy rash, lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weight gain, reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and edema. === Cardiotoxicity === In some individuals, imatinib use was reported to be associated with left ventricular dysfunction which sometimes progressed to congestive cardiac failure despite an absence of prior heart disease. Clinical trials of imatinib did not report cardiac adverse effects, but had reported a notably high incidence of peripheral oedema, with some cases classified as severe. Patient biopsies as well as mice treated with large doses of imatinib exhibited cellular signs of cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxic effects appeared to mediated by inhibition of cytoplasmic ABL1 tyrosine kinase. === Childhood growth inhibition === Multiple human and animal studies suggest that if imatinib is used in prepubescent children, it may delay normal growth (more specifically bone elongation), although some may experience at least partial catch-up growth during puberty. The reason for this side effect is unclear; interference with a growth hormone (GH)-related pathway may be involved (prepubertal growth is GH-dependent, whereas pubertal growth is synergystically promoted by both GH and sex hormones). === Pigmentation changes === Imatinib use may cause lightening/depigmentation or darkening/repigmentation of hair (as is the case with some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and/or skin as well as hyperpigmentation of the gingiva. The median onset of hair color change is 4 weeks after initiation of therapy (but may occur over a year after initiation), is dose-dependent, and is reversible upon treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. C-kit receptors - one of the biological target of imatinib - are expressed by melanocytes. == Overdose == Medical experience with imatinib overdose is limited. Treatment is supportive. Imatinib is highly plasma protein-bound: dialysis is unlikely to be helpful removing imatinib. == Interactions == Its use is advised against in people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, ritonavir and nefazodone due to its reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates of any of these enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism. As with other immunosuppressants, application of live vaccines is contraindicated because the microorganisms in the vaccine could multiply and infect the patient. Inactivated and toxoid vaccines do not hold this risk, but may not be effective under imatinib therapy. Eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice are strongly discouraged as it increases the concentration of imatinib in the blood. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Imatinib is a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the TK active site, leading to a decrease in activity. There are a large number of TK enzymes in the body, including the insulin receptor. Imatinib is specific for the TK domain in abl (the Abelson proto-oncogene), c-kit and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of abl with bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed bcr-abl. As this is now a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease bcr-abl activity. The active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of bcr-abl, locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation. Imatinib is quite selective for bcr-abl, though it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), as well as ABL2 (ARG) and DDR1 tyrosine kinases and NQO2 – an oxidoreductase. Imatinib also inhibits the abl protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on bcr-abl. Inhibition of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death. ==== Other pathways affected ==== The Bcr-Abl pathway has many downstream pathways including the Ras/MapK pathway, which leads to increased proliferation due to increased growth factor-independent cell growth. It also affects the Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway. This affects the cytoskeleton, which leads to increased cell motility and decreased adhesion. The PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway is also affected. BCL-2 is responsible for keeping the mitochondria stable; this suppresses cell death by apoptosis and increases survival. The last pathway that Bcr-Abl affects is the JAK/STAT pathway, which is responsible for proliferation. === Pharmacokinetics === Imatinib is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly bioavailable: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib occurs in the liver and is mediated by several isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The main metabolite, N-demethylated piperazine derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; only a small portion of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites; only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The half-lives of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 h and 40 h, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Imatinib was invented in the late 1990s by scientists at Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz in 1996 to become Novartis), in a team led by the British biochemist Nicholas Lydon and that included Elisabeth Buchdunger and Jürg Zimmermann, and its use to treat CML was driven by oncologist Brian Druker of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Other major contributions to imatinib development were made by biologist Anthony R. Hunter at Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, a physician, scientist, and hematologist at the University of Milano Bicocca, Italy, John Goldman at Hammersmith Hospital in London, and later on by Charles Sawyers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Imatinib was developed by rational drug design. After the Philadelphia chromosome mutation and hyperactive bcr-abl protein were discovered, the investigators screened chemical libraries to find a drug that would inhibit that protein. With high-throughput screening, they identified 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib. When Novartis tested imatinib in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys in 1996, it was found to have several toxic effects; in particular, results indicating liver damage in dogs nearly stopped drug development completely. However, favorable results in studies with monkeys and in vitro human cells allowed testing to continue in humans. The first clinical trial of Gleevec took place in 1998, after Novartis reluctantly synthesized and released a few grams of the drug for Druker, enough for him to run a trial using a hundred or so patients. Mel Mann, who entered the clinical trial in August 1998, is the longest living person to be treated with the drug. The drug received FDA approval in May 2001, only two and a half years after the new drug application was submitted. On the same month it made the cover of TIME magazine as a ""bullet"" to be used against cancer. Druker, Lydon and Sawyers received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2009 for ""converting a fatal cancer into a manageable chronic condition"". During the FDA review, the tradename of the drug for the US market was changed from ""Glivec"" to ""Gleevec"" at the request of the FDA, to avoid confusion with Glyset, a diabetes drug. A Swiss patent application was filed on imatinib and various salts on in April 1992, which was then filed in the EU, the US, and other countries in March and April 1993. and in 1996 United States and European patent offices issued patents listing Jürg Zimmermann as the inventor. In July 1997, Novartis filed a new patent application in Switzerland on the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate (the mesylate salt of imatinib). The ""beta crystalline form"" of the molecule is a specific polymorph of imatinib mesylate; a specific way that the individual molecules pack together to form a solid. This is the actual form of the drug sold as Gleevec/Glivec; a salt (imatinib mesylate) as opposed to a free base, and the beta crystalline form as opposed to the alpha or other form.: 3 and 4 In 1998, Novartis filed international patent applications claiming priority to the 1997 filing. A United States patent was granted in 2005. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2013, more than 100 cancer specialists published a letter in Blood saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, are so high that people in the United States could not afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at $30,000 (equivalent to $53,274 in 2024) a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to $92,000 (equivalent to $126,005 in 2024) per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. Other physicians have complained about the cost. Druker, who led the clinical studies, never received any royalties or profits from the success of the drug. By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to $120,000 (equivalent to $157,221 in 2024) a year, according to an analysis prepared for The Washington Post by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them. A 2012 economic analysis funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb estimated that the discovery and development of imatinib and related drugs had created $143 billion in societal value at a cost to consumers of approximately $14 billion. The $143 billion figure was based on an estimated 7.5 to 17.5 year survival advantage conferred by imatinib treatment, and included the value (discounted at 3% per annum) of ongoing benefits to society after the imatinib patent expiration. Prices for a 100 mg pill of Gleevec internationally range from $20 to $30, although generic imatinib is cheaper, as low as $2 per pill. === Controversies === ==== Patent litigation in India ==== Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent Gleevec in India, and took the case all the way to the Indian Supreme Court. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the World Trade Organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the TRIPS agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law, the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis' patent application waited in a ""mailbox"" with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect. The patent application claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate).: 3 In 1993, during the time India did not allow patents on products, Novartis had patented imatinib, with salts vaguely specified, in many countries but could not patent it in India. The key differences between the two patent applications, were that 1998 patent application specified the counterion (Gleevec is a specific salt – imatinib mesylate) while the 1993 patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate, and the 1998 patent application specified the solid form of Gleevec – the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured (this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules) – while the 1993 patent application did not. The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline. As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003. Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India. When examination of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if ""they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy."" At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Section 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal. Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India's Supreme Court, which took the case. The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Section 3d. The Supreme Court issued its decision in 2013, ruling that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts. == Research == One study demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was effective in patients with systemic mastocytosis, including those who had the D816V mutation in c-KIT. However, since imatinib binds to tyrosine kinases when they are in the inactive configuration and the D816V mutant of c-KIT is constitutively active, imatinib does not inhibit the kinase activity of the D816V mutant of c-KIT. Experience has shown, however, that imatinib is much less effective in patients with this mutation, and patients with the mutation comprise nearly 90% of cases of mastocytosis. Imatinib was initially thought to have a potential role in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end. In systemic sclerosis, the drug has been tested for potential use in slowing down pulmonary fibrosis. In laboratory settings, imatinib is being used as an experimental agent to suppress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by inhibiting its receptor (PDGF-Rβ). One of its effects is delaying atherosclerosis in mice without or with diabetes. Mouse animal studies have suggested that imatinib and related drugs may be useful in treating smallpox, should an outbreak ever occur. In vitro studies identified that a modified version of imatinib can bind to gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP). GSAP selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques, which suggests that molecules which target GSAP and are able to cross blood–brain barrier are potential therapeutic agents for treating Alzheimer's disease. Another study suggests that imatinib may not need to cross the blood–brain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer's, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain. It is not known whether reduction of beta-amyloid is a feasible way of treating Alzheimer's, as an anti-beta-amyloid vaccine has been shown to clear the brain of plaques without having any effect on Alzheimer symptoms. A formulation of imatinib with a cyclodextrin (Captisol) as a carrier to overcome the blood–brain barrier has shown reversal of opioid tolerance in a 2012 study in rats. Imatinib is an experimental drug in the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis. == Etymology == The -tinib word stem makes reference to the drug's action as a tyrosine kinase (TYK) inhibitor. == References == == External links == ""Imatinib mesylate"".

4298,"('Thiram', 'Tetramethylthiuram disulfide', 'Thiuram', 'Pomarsol', 'Rezifilm')",Medical,"Thiuram disulfides are a class of organosulfur compounds with the formula (R2NCSS)2. Many examples are known, but popular ones include R = Me and R = Et. They are disulfides obtained by oxidation of the dithiocarbamates. These compounds are used in sulfur vulcanization of rubber as well as in the manufacture of pesticides and drugs. They are typically white or pale yellow solids that are soluble in organic solvents. == Preparation, structure, reactions == Thiuram disulfides are prepared by oxidizing the salts of the corresponding dithiocarbamates (e.g. sodium diethyldithiocarbamate). Typical oxidants employed include chlorine and hydrogen peroxide: 2 R2NCS−2Na+ + Cl2 → (R2NC(S)S)2 + 2 NaCl Thiuram disulfides react with Grignard reagents to give esters of dithiocarbamic acid, as in the preparation of methyl dimethyldithiocarbamate: [Me2NC(S)S]2 + MeMgX → Me2NC(S)SMe + Me2NCS2MgX The compounds feature planar dithiocarbamate subunits and are linked by an S−S bond of 2.00 Å. The C(S)−N bond is short (1.33 Å), indicative of multiple bonding. The dihedral angle between the two dithiocarbamate subunits approaches 90°. Thiuram disulfides are weak oxidants. They can be reduced to dithiocarbamates. Treatment of a thiuram disulfide with triphenylphosphine, or with cyanide salts, yields the corresponding thiuram sulfide: (R2NC(S)S)2 + PPh3 → (R2NCS)2S + S=PPh3 Chlorination of thiuram disulfide affords the thiocarbamoyl chloride. == Applications == The tetramethyl derivative, known as thiram, is a widely used fungicide. The tetraethyl derivative, known as disulfiram, is commonly used to treat chronic alcoholism. It produces an acute sensitivity to alcohol ingestion by blocking metabolism of acetaldehyde by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to a higher concentration of the aldehyde in the blood, which in turn produces symptoms of a severe hangover. == Safety == In 2005–06, thiuram mix was the 13th most prevalent allergen in patch tests (3.9%). == References ==",Thiuram,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IND', -0.38772985339164734), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -1.676292231422849e-05), (' MED', -0.011174675077199936), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.006137452553957701), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.000747758662328124), ('ĠMED', -0.0004917366313748062), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005284981802105904)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiram,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5673089/,https://www.altmeyers.org/en/allergology/thiurame-132938 ', [])"

At higher doses, it may produce various additional effects including stimulant, appetite suppressant, and performance-enhancing effects. In relation to this, non-medical use of pseudoephedrine has been encountered. The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of pseudoephedrine include insomnia, elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, restlessness, dizziness, anxiety, and dry mouth, among others. Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been associated with serious cardiovascular complications like heart attack and hemorrhagic stroke. Some people may be more sensitive to its cardiovascular effects. Pseudoephedrine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Pseudoephedrine significantly crosses into the brain, but has some peripheral selectivity due to its hydrophilicity. Chemically, pseudoephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and amphetamine. It is the (1S,2S)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine. Along with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine occurs naturally in ephedra, which has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It was first isolated from ephedra in 1889. Subsequent to its synthesis in the 1920s, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is widely available over-the-counter (OTC) in both single-drug and combination preparations. Availability of pseudoephedrine has been restricted starting in 2005 as it can be used to synthesize methamphetamine. Phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many over-the-counter oral decongestant products. However, oral phenylephrine appears to be ineffective as a decongestant. In 2022, the combination with brompheniramine and dextromethorphan was the 265th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with loratadine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Nasal congestion === Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic and is well-known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as topical decongestant. Due to its stimulating qualities, however, the oral preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an antitussive drug (suppression of cough). Pseudoephedrine is indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion, sinus congestion, and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis. === Other uses === Amphetamine-type stimulants and other catecholaminergic agents are known to have wakefulness-promoting effects and are used in the treatment of hypersomnia and narcolepsy. Pseudoephedrine at therapeutic doses does not appear to improve or worsen daytime sleepiness, daytime fatigue, or sleep quality in people with allergic rhinitis. Likewise, somnolence was not lower in children with the common cold treated with pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion. In any case, insomnia is a known side effect of pseudoephedrine, although the incidence is low. In addition, doses of pseudoephedrine above the normal therapeutic range have been reported to produce stimulant effects including insomnia and fatigue resistance. There has been interest in pseudoephedrine as an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity. However, due to lack of clinical data and potential cardiovascular side effects, this use is not recommended. Only a single placebo-controlled study of pseudoephedrine for weight loss exists (120 mg/day slow-release for 12 weeks) and found no significant difference in weight lost compared to placebo (-4.6 kg vs. -4.5 kg). This was in contrast to phenylpropanolamine, which has been found to be more effective at promoting weight loss compared to placebo and has been more widely studied and used in the treatment of obesity. Pseudoephedrine has been used limitedly in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance including orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). However, its effectiveness in the treatment of POTS is controversial. Pseudoephedrine has also been used limitedly in the treatment of refractory hypotension in intensive care units. However, data on this use are limited to case reports and case series. Pseudoephedrine is also used as a first-line prophylactic for recurrent priapism. Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Data for this use are however anecdotal and effectiveness has been described as variable. Treatment of urinary incontinence is an off-label use for pseudoephedrine and related medications. === Available forms === Pseudoephedrine is available by itself over-the-counter in the form of 30 and 60 mg immediate-release and 120 and 240 mg extended-release oral tablets in the United States. Pseudoephedrine is also available over-the-counter and prescription-only in combination with numerous other drugs, including antihistamines (acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, triprolidine), analgesics (acetaminophen, codeine, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, naproxen), cough suppressants (dextromethorphan), and expectorants (guaifenesin). Pseudoephedrine has been used in the form of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts and in a polistirex form. The drug has been used in more than 135 over-the-counter and prescription formulations. Many prescription formulations containing pseudoephedrine have been discontinued over time. == Contraindications == Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, or by pregnant women. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear. == Side effects == Common side effects with pseudoephedrine therapy may include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, insomnia, restlessness, excitability, dizziness, and anxiety. Infrequent side effects include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures, and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also play a role in the precipitation of episodes of psychosis. It has also been reported that pseudoephedrine, among other sympathomimetic agents, may be associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its sympathomimetic effects, pseudoephedrine is a vasoconstrictor and pressor agent (increases blood pressure), a positive chronotrope (increases heart rate), and a positive inotrope (increases force of heart contractions). The influence of pseudoephedrine on blood pressure at clinical doses is controversial. A closely related sympathomimetic and decongestant, phenylpropanolamine, was withdrawn due to associations with markedly increased blood pressure and incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. There has been concern that pseudoephedrine may likewise dangerously increase blood pressure and thereby increase the risk of stroke, whereas others have contended that the risks are exaggerated. Besides hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary vasospasm, and sudden death have also rarely been reported with sympathomimetic ephedra compounds like pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. A 2005 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at recommended doses had no meaningful effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure in healthy individuals or people with controlled hypertension. Systolic blood pressure was found to slightly increase by 0.99 mm Hg on average and heart rate was found to slightly increase by 2.83 bpm on average. Conversely, there was no significant influence on diastolic blood pressure, which increased by 0.63 mg Hg. In people with controlled hypertension, systolic hypertension increased by a similar degree of 1.20 mm Hg. Immediate-release preparations, higher doses, being male, and shorter duration of use were all associated with greater cardiovascular effects. A small subset of individuals with autonomic instability, perhaps in turn resulting in greater adrenergic receptor sensitivity, may be substantially more sensitive to the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics. Subsequent to the 2005 meta-analysis, a 2015 systematic review and a 2018 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at high doses (>170 mg) could increase heart rate and physical performance with larger effect sizes than lower doses. A 2007 Cochrane review assessed the side effects of short-term use of pseudoephedrine at recommended doses as a nasal decongestant. It found that pseudoephedrine had a small risk of insomnia and this was the only side effect that occurred at rates significantly different from placebo. Insomnia occurred at a rate of 5% and had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.18. Other side effects, including headache and hypertension, occurred at rates of less than 4% and were not different from placebo. Tachyphylaxis is known to develop with prolonged use of pseudoephedrine, especially when it is re-administered at short intervals. There is a case report of temporary depressive symptoms upon discontinuation and withdrawal from pseudoephedrine. The withdrawal symptoms included worsened mood and sadness, profoundly decreased energy, a worsened view of oneself, decreased concentration, psychomotor retardation, increased appetite, and increased need for sleep. Pseudoephedrine has psychostimulant effects at high doses and is a positive reinforcer with amphetamine-like effects in animals including rats and monkeys. However, it is substantially less potent than methamphetamine or cocaine. == Overdose == The maximum total daily dose of pseudoephedrine is 240 mg. Symptoms of overdose may include sedation, apnea, impaired concentration, cyanosis, coma, circulatory collapse, insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions, headache, dizziness, anxiety, euphoria, tinnitus, blurred vision, ataxia, chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, thirstiness, sweating, difficulty with urination, nausea, and vomiting. In children, symptoms have more often included dry mouth, pupil dilation, hot flashes, fever, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pseudoephedrine may produce toxic effects both with use of supratherapeutic doses but also in people who are more sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetics. Misuse of the drug has been reported in one case at massive doses of 3,000 to 4,500 mg (100–150 × 30-mg tablets) per day, with the doses gradually increased over time by this individual. No fatalities due to pseudoephedrine misuse have been reported as of 2021. However, death with pseudoephedrine has been reported generally. == Interactions == Concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use can lead to hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crisis, and should be avoided. Clinical studies have found minimal or no influence of certain MAOIs like the weak non-selective MAOI linezolid and the potent selective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (as a transdermal patch) on the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. This is in accordance with the fact that pseudoephedrine is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, pseudoephedrine induces the release of norepinephrine, which MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of, and as such, MAOIs can still potentiate the effects of pseudoephedrine. No significant pharmacodynamic interactions have been found with selegiline, but linezolid potentiated blood pressure increases with pseudoephedrine. However, this was deemed to be without clinical significance in the case of linezolid, though it was noted that some individuals may be more sensitive to the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine and related agents. Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated with MAOIs like phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, and moclobemide due to the potential for synergistic sympathomimetic effects and hypertensive crisis. It is also considered to be contraindicated with linezolid and selegiline as some individuals may react more sensitively to coadministration. Concomitant use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors, including ergot alkaloids like ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, linezolid, oxytocin, ephedrine, phenylephrine, and bromocriptine, among others, is not recommended due to the possibility of greater increases in blood pressure and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Sympathomimetic effects and cardiovascular risks of pseudoephedrine may also be increased with digitalis glycosides, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants, and inhalational anesthetics. Likewise, greater sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine may occur when it is combined with other sympathomimetic agents. Rare but serious cardiovascular complications have been reported with the combination of pseudoephedrine and bupropion. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, guanethidine, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics like pseudoepehdrine. Beta blockers like labetalol may reduce the effects of pseudoephedrine. Urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including pseudoephedrine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent which acts primarily or exclusively by inducing the release of norepinephrine. Hence, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Some sources state that pseudoephedrine has a mixed mechanism of action consisting of both indirect and direct effects by binding to and acting as an agonist of adrenergic receptors. However, the affinity of pseudoephedrine for adrenergic receptors is described as very low or negligible. Animal studies suggest that the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine are exclusively due to norepinephrine release. Pseudoephedrine induces monoamine release in vitro with an EC50Tooltip half maximal effective concentration of 224 nM for norepinephrine and 1,988 nM for dopamine, whereas it is inactive for serotonin. As such, it is about 9-fold selective for induction of norepinephrine release over dopamine release. The drug has negligible agonistic activity at the α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors (Kact >10,000 nM). At the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, it acts as a partial agonist with relatively low affinity (β1 = Kact = 309 μM, IATooltip intrinsic activity = 53%; β2 = 10 μM; IA = 47%). It was an antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the β3-adrenergic receptor (Kact = ND; IA = 7%). It is about 30,000 to 40,000 times less potent as a β-adrenergic receptor agonist than (–)-isoproterenol. Pseudoephedrine's principal mechanism of action relies on its action on the adrenergic system. The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an α-adrenergic receptor response. Pseudoephedrine acts on α- and β2-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively. α-Adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the bronchi, causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing. Pseudoephedrine is less potent as a sympathomimetic and psychostimulant than ephedrine. Clinical studies have found that pseudoephedrine is about 3.5- to 4-fold less potent than ephedrine as a sympathomimetic agent in terms of blood pressure increases and 3.5- to 7.2-fold or more less potent as a bronchodilator. Pseudoephedrine is also said to have much less central effect than ephedrine and to be only a weak psychostimulant. Blood vessels in the nose are around five times more sensitive than the heart to the actions of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline), which may help to explain how pseudoephedrine at the low doses used in over-the-counter products can produce nasal decongestion with minimal effects on the heart. Compared to dextroamphetamine, pseudoephedrine is about 30 to 35 times less potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent and 80 to 350 times less potent as a dopamine releasing agent in vitro. Pseudoephedrine is a very weak reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro, including both MAO-A and MAO-B (Ki = 1,000–5,800 μM). It is far less potent in this action than other agents like dextroamphetamine and moclobemide. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Pseudoephedrine is orally active and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. The drug reaches peak concentrations after 1 to 4 hours (mean 1.9 hours) in the case of the immediate-release formulation and after 2 to 6 hours in the case of the extended-release formulation. The onset of action of pseudoephedrine is 30 minutes. ==== Distribution ==== Pseudoephedrine, due to its lack of polar phenolic groups, is relatively lipophilic. This is a property it shares with related sympathomimetic and decongestant agents like ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. These agents are widely distributed throughout the body and cross the blood–brain barrier. However, it is said that pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine cross the blood-brain barrier only to some extent and that pseudoephedrine has limited central nervous system activity, suggesting that it is partially peripherally selective. The blood-brain barrier permeability of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine is reduced compared to other amphetamines due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the β carbon which decreases their lipophilicity. As such, they have a greater ratio of peripheral cardiovascular to central psychostimulant effect. Besides entering the brain, these substances also cross the placenta and enter breast milk. The plasma protein binding of pseudoephedrine has been reported to be approximately 21 to 29%. It is bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and albumin (HSA). ==== Metabolism ==== Pseudoephedrine is not extensively metabolized and is subjected to minimal first-pass metabolism with oral administration. Due to its methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., it is an amphetamine), pseudoephedrine is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. It is also not metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). Pseudoephedrine is demethylated into the metabolite norpseudoephedrine to a small extent. Similarly to pseudoephedrine, this metabolite is active and shows amphetamine-like effects. Approximately 1 to 6% of pseudoephedrine is metabolized in the liver via N-demethylation to form norpseudoephedrine. ==== Elimination ==== Pseudoephedrine is excreted primarily via the kidneys in urine. Its urinary excretion is highly influenced by urinary pH and is increased when the urine is acidic and is decreased when it is alkaline. The elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine on average is 5.4 hours and ranges from 3 to 16 hours depending on urinary pH. At a pH of 5.6 to 6.0, the elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine was 5.2 to 8.0 hours. In one study, a more acidic pH of 5.0 resulted in a half-life of 3.0 to 6.4 hours, whereas a more alkaline pH of 8.0 resulted in a half-life of 9.2 to 16.0 hours. Substances that influence urinary acidity and are known to affect the excretion of amphetamine derivatives include urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride as well as urinary alkalinizing agents like acetazolamide. A majority of an oral dose of pseudoephedrine is excreted unchanged in urine within 24 hours of administration. This has been found to range from 43 to 96%. The amount excreted unchanged is dependent on urinary pH similarly to the drug's half-life, as a longer half-life and duration in the body allows more time for the drug to be metabolized. The duration of action of pseudoephedrine, which is dependent on its elimination, is 4 to 12 hours. Pseudoephedrine has been reported to accumulate in people with renal impairment. == Chemistry == Pseudoephedrine, also known structurally as (1S,2S)-α,N-dimethyl-β-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1S,2S)-N-methyl-β-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine, amphetamine, and β-hydroxyamphetamine derivative. It is a diastereomer of ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C10H15NO and a molecular weight of 165.23 g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.89, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to pseudoephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7). Pseudoephedrine is readily reduced into methamphetamine or oxidized into methcathinone. === Nomenclatures === The dextrorotary (+)- or d- enantiomer is (1S,2S)-pseudoephedrine, whereas the levorotating (−)- or l- form is (1R,2R)-pseudoephedrine. In the outdated D/L system (+)-pseudoephedrine is also referred to as L-pseudoephedrine and (−)-pseudoephedrine as D-pseudoephedrine (in the Fisher projection then the phenyl ring is drawn at bottom). Often the D/L system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine is wrongly named D-pseudoephedrine and the levorotary l-ephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly L-ephedrine. The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1S,2S)- respectively (1R,2R)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Synonyms for both are psi-ephedrine and threo-ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of the (+)-form, when used as pharmaceutical substance. === Detection in body fluids === Pseudoephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor any possible performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Some commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50 to 300 μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500 to 3,000 μg/L in people with substance use disorder involving pseudoephedrine or poisoned patients, and 10 to 70 mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdose. == Manufacturing == Although pseudoephedrine occurs naturally as an alkaloid in certain plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the Ephedra species, also known as ma huang, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose in the presence of benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment, the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination. The bulk of pseudoephedrine is produced by commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers in India and China, where economic and industrial conditions favor its mass production for export. == History == Pseudoephedrine, along with ephedrine, occurs naturally in ephedra. This herb has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. Pseudoephedrine was first isolated and characterized in 1889 by the German chemists Ladenburg and Oelschlägel, who used a sample that had been isolated from Ephedra vulgaris by the Merck pharmaceutical corporation of Darmstadt, Germany. It was first synthesized in the 1920s in Japan. Subsequently, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Pseudoephedrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while pseudoéphédrine is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and pseudoefedrina is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt; pseudoephedrine sulfate is its USAN in the case of the sulfate salt; pseudoephedrine polistirex its USAN in the case of the polistirex form; and d-isoephedrine sulfate is its JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name in the case of the sulfate salt. Pseudoephedrine is also known as Ψ-ephedrine and isoephedrine. === Brand names === The following is a list of consumer medicines that either contain pseudoephedrine or have switched to a less-regulated alternative such as phenylephrine.

Six case reports and one case series of pseudoephedrine misuse have been published as of 2021. There is a case report of self-medication with pseudoephedrine in massive doses for treatment of depression. === Use in exercise and sports === Pseudoephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports due to its sympathomimetic and stimulant effects. Because of these effects, pseudoephedrine can increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, improve mental energy, and reduce fatigue, among other performance-enhancing effects. A 2015 systematic review found that pseudoephedrine lacked performance-enhancing effects at therapeutic doses (60–120 mg) but significantly enhanced athletic performance at supratherapeutic doses (≥180 mg). A subsequent 2018 meta-analysis, which included seven additional studies, found that pseudoephedrine had a small positive effect on heart rate (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = 0.43) but insignificant effects on time trials, perceived exertion ratings, blood glucose levels, and blood lactate levels. However, subgroup analyses revealed that effect sizes were larger for heart rate increases and quicker time trials in well-trained athletes and younger participants, for shorter exercise sessions with pseudoephedrine administered within 90 minutes beforehand, and with higher doses of pseudoephedrine. A dose–response relationship was established, with larger doses (>170 mg) showing greater increases in heart rate and faster time trials than with smaller doses (≤170 mg) (SMD = 0.85 for heart rate and SMD = -0.24 for time trials, respectively). In any case, the meta-analysis concluded that the performance-enhancing effects of pseudoephedrine were marginal to small and likely to be lower in magnitude than with caffeine. It is relevant in this regard that caffeine is a permitted stimulant in competitive sports. Pseudoephedrine was on the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) banned substances list until 2004 when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list replaced the IOC list. Although WADA initially only monitored pseudoephedrine, it went back onto the ""banned"" list on 1 January 2010. Pseudoephedrine is excreted through urine, and the concentration in urine of this drug shows a large inter-individual spread; that is, the same dose can give a vast difference in urine concentration for different individuals. Pseudoephedrine is approved to be taken up to 240 mg per day. In seven healthy male subjects, this dose yielded a urine concentration range of 62.8 to 294.4 microgram per milliliter (μg/mL) with mean ± standard deviation 149 ± 72 μg/mL. Thus, normal dosage of 240 mg pseudoephedrine per day can result in urine concentration levels exceeding the limit of 150 μg/mL set by WADA for about half of all users. Furthermore, hydration status does not affect the urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine. ==== List of doping cases ==== Canadian rower Silken Laumann was stripped of her 1995 Pan American Games team gold medal after testing positive for pseudoephedrine. In February 2000, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won gold at the 2000 European Figure Skating Championships but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification. Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan was stripped of her gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games after testing positive. She took two pills given to her by the team coach for a cold. Although she was stripped of the overall gold medal, she kept her other medals, and, unlike in most other doping cases, was not banned from competing again; only the team doctor was banned for a number of years. Ion Țiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, resigned over the scandal. In the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, the IOC issued a reprimand against the Slovak ice hockey player Lubomir Visnovsky for usage of pseudoephedrine. In the 2014 Winter Olympic Games Team Sweden and Washington Capitals ice hockey player Nicklas Bäckström was prevented from playing in the final for usage of pseudoephedrine. Bäckström claimed he was using it as allergy medication. In March 2014, the IOC Disciplinary Commission decided that Bäckström would be awarded the silver medal. In January 2015 Bäckström, the IOC, WADA and the IIHF agreed to a settlement in which he accepted a reprimand but was cleared of attempting to enhance his performance. === Manufacture of amphetamines === Its membership in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As a result of the increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, pharmaceutical firms have reformulated medications to use alternative compounds, particularly phenylephrine, even though its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from placebo. In the United States, federal laws control the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Retailers in the US have created corporate policies restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Their policies restrict sales by limiting purchase quantities and requiring a minimum age and government issued photographic identification. These requirements are similar to and sometimes more stringent than existing law. Internationally, pseudoephedrine is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. === Legal status === ==== Australia ==== Illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine in Australia has caused significant changes to the way the products are regulated. As of 2006, all products containing pseudoephedrine have been rescheduled as either ""Pharmacist Only Medicines"" (Schedule 3) or ""Prescription Only Medicines"" (Schedule 4), depending on the amount of pseudoephedrine in the product. A Pharmacist Only Medicine may only be sold to the public if a pharmacist is directly involved in the transaction. These medicines must be kept behind the counter, away from public access. Pharmacists are also encouraged (and in some states required) to log purchases with the online database Project STOP. As a result, some pharmacies no longer stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a phenylephrine product that has not been proven effective in clinical trials. ==== Belgium ==== Until 2024, several formulations of pseudoephedrine were available over-the-counter in Belgium. However, new legislation came into effect in November 2024, banning the over-the-counter sale of all medicines containing pseudoephedrine. ==== Canada ==== Health Canada has investigated the risks and benefits of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine/Ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may have strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine. Products whose only medicinal ingredient is pseudoephedrine must be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing pseudoephedrine along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present. ==== Colombia ==== The Colombian government prohibited the trade of pseudoephedrine in 2010. ==== Estonia ==== Pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter drug in Estonia. ==== Finland ==== Pseudoephedrine medicines can only be obtained with a prescription in Finland. ==== France ==== Pseudoephedrine-containing combination products are available over the counter from pharmacies, most commonly with Paracetamol under the brand name ""Dolihrume"". Products combining pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen or certain antihistamines are also available. However, products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not sold. In October 2023, the French health department officially warned against the usage of pseudoephedrine for patients with a cold. It also suggested the substance's availability could be restricted in the future, pending its pharmaceutical re-evaluation on EU level. In December 2024, the government announced pseudoephedrine medicines would henceforth only be obtainable with a prescription. ==== Germany ==== Various pseudoephedrine-containing products in combination with ibuprofen, aspirin, or antihistamines can be obtained without a prescription upon request at a pharmacy. Common names include Aspirin Complex, Reactine Duo, and RhinoPront. Products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not available. ==== Japan ==== Medications that contain more than 10% pseudoephedrine are prohibited under the Stimulants Control Law in Japan. ==== Mexico ==== On 23 November 2007, the use and trade of pseudoephedrine in Mexico was made illegal as it was argued that it was extremely popular as a precursor in the synthesis of methamphetamine. ==== Netherlands ==== Pseudoephedrine was withdrawn from sale in 1989 due to concerns about adverse cardiac side effects. ==== New Zealand ==== Since April 2024, pseudoephedrine has been classified as a restricted (pharmacist-only) drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 which allows the purchase of medicines containing pseudoephedrine from a pharmacist without a prescription. Pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and any product containing these substances, e.g. cold and flu medicines, were first classified in October 2004 as Class C Part III (partially exempted) controlled drugs, due to being the principal ingredient in methamphetamine. New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold and flu tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011. On 24 November 2023, the recently formed National-led coalition government announced that the sale of cold medication containing pseudoephedrine would be allowed (as part of the coalition agreement between the National and ACT parties). ==== Switzerland ==== Pseudoephedrine is available without a prescription in combination (with aspirin) under the brand name ""Aspirin Complex"". There is also a preparation consisting of a single ingredient 120 mg extended-release tablet that can be obtained at pharmacies with a prescription or after consultation with a pharmacist. ==== Turkey ==== In Turkey, medications containing pseudoephedrine are available by prescription only. ==== United Kingdom ==== In the UK, pseudoephedrine is available over the counter under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the MHRA reacted to concerns over the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over-the-counter sales to one box containing no more than 720 mg of pseudoephedrine in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008. No form of ID is required. ==== United States ==== ===== Federal ===== The United States Congress has recognized that pseudoephedrine is used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. In 2005, the Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony concerning education programs and state legislation designed to curb this illegal practice. Attempts to control the sale of the drug date back to 1986, when federal officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator Bob Dole, that would have placed several chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed. Before the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became increasingly regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in its attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did the number of people in rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. This reduction in purity was usually short-lived, however, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations. Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) as an amendment to the renewal of the USA Patriot Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on 6 March 2006, the act amended 21 U.S.C. § 830, concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by 8 April 2006, and the second to be completed by 30 September 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on the amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping. Though the law was mainly directed at pseudoephedrine products it also applies to all over-the-counter products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, their salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers. Pseudoephedrine was defined as a ""scheduled listed chemical product"" under 21 U.S.C. § 802(45(A)). The act included the following requirements for merchants (""regulated sellers"") who sell such products: Required a retrievable record of all purchases, identifying the name and address of each party, to be kept for two years Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information Required reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products Required training of employees with regard to the requirements of the CMEA. Retailers must self-certify as to training and compliance. The non-liquid dose form of regulated products may only be sold in unit dose blister packs Regulated products must be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict public access Sales limits (per customer): Daily sales limit—must not exceed 3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine base without regard to the number of transactions 30-day (not monthly) sales limit—must not exceed 7.5 grams of pseudoephedrine base if sold by mail order or ""mobile retail vendor"" 30-day purchase limit—must not exceed 9 grams of pseudoephedrine base. (A misdemeanor possession offense under 21 U.S.C. § 844a for the person who buys it.) The requirements were revised in the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2008 to require that a regulated seller of scheduled listed chemical products may not sell such a product unless the purchaser: Presents a government-issued photographic identification; and Signs the written logbook with name, address, and time and date of the sale ===== State ===== Most states also have laws regulating pseudoephedrine. The states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii (as of May 1, 2009) Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana (as of August 15, 2009), Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have laws requiring pharmacies to sell pseudoephedrine ""behind the counter"". Though the drug can be purchased without a prescription, states can limit the number of units sold and can collect personal information from purchasers. The states of Oregon and Mississippi previously required a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine. However, as of 1 January 2022, these restrictions have been repealed. The state of Oregon reduced the number of methamphetamine lab seizures from 448 in 2004 (the final full year before implementation of the prescription only law) to a new low of 13 in 2009. The decrease in meth lab incidents in Oregon occurred largely before the prescription-only law took effect, according to a NAMSDL report titled Pseudoephedrine Prescription Laws in Oregon and Mississippi. The report posits that the decline in meth lab incidents in both states may be due to other factors: ""Mexican traffickers may have contributed to the decline in meth labs in Mississippi and Oregon (and surrounding states) as they were able to provide ample supply of equal or greater quality meth at competitive prices"". Additionally, similar decreases in meth lab incidents were seen in surrounding states, according to the report, and meth-related deaths in Oregon have dramatically risen since 2007. Some municipalities in Missouri have enacted similar ordinances, including Washington, Union, New Haven, Cape Girardeau and Ozark. Certain pharmacies in Terre Haute, Indiana do so as well. Another approach to controlling the drug on the state level mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of electronic tracking systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. Thirty-two states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Before the implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004 but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009. Kentucky's program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased. Oklahoma initially experienced success with its tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. In 2008, however, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009. NPLEx appears to be successful by requiring the real-time submission of transactions, thereby enabling the relevant laws to be enforced at the point of sale. By creating a multi-state database and the ability to compare all transactions quickly, NPLEx enables pharmacies to deny purchases that would be illegal based on gram limits, age, or even to convicted meth offenders in some states. NPLEx also enforces the federal gram limits across state lines, which was impossible with state-operated systems. Access to the records is by law enforcement agencies only, through an online secure portal. == Research == Pseudoephedrine has been studied in the treatment of snoring. However, data are inadequate to support this use. A study has found that pseudoephedrine can reduce milk production in breastfeeding women. This might have been due to suppression of prolactin secretion. Pseudoephedrine might be useful for lactation suppression. == References ==",Pseudoephedrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.246537173457909e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.932505594799295e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31327760219573975)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoephedrine ', [])"

More specifically, it is a racemic mixture of (1R,2S)- and (1S,2R)-enantiomers. Conversely, ephedrine is the enantiopure (1R,2S)-enantiomer. Racephedrine has been marketed for medical use in Italy. Like ephedrine, racephedrine is a releasing agent of norepinephrine and to a much lesser extent of dopamine. Both ephedrine enantiomers are active in this regard, but ephedrine ((1R,2S)-ephedrine) has greater potency than (1S,2R)-ephedrine. Racephedrine has been used in a variety of combination drugs with other agents, including theophylline, aminophylline, oxtriphylline, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, pyrilamine, phenacetin, salicylamide, ascorbic acid, and opium, among others. Brand names of these combination preparations have included Amiphedrin, Amodrine, Amodrine E C, Asphamal-D, Asthmadrin, Cenamal, Cholarace, Phedrahist, Respirol, Salidin, Synate-M, and Synophedal. == See also == Hydroxymethylamphetamine == References ==",Racephedrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.868777513271198e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006744122598320246)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0024756586644798517)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racephedrine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Racephedrine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racephedrine?utm_source=openai')])"
4302,"('Racephedrine hydrochloride', 'Eperisone hydrochloride', 'Racephedrine hcl', '(1s,2s)-pseudoephedrine hydrochloride', 'Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride')",Medical,"Pseudoephedrine, sold under the brand name Sudafed among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used as a decongestant to treat nasal congestion. It has also been used off-label for certain other indications, like treatment of low blood pressure. At higher doses, it may produce various additional effects including stimulant, appetite suppressant, and performance-enhancing effects. In relation to this, non-medical use of pseudoephedrine has been encountered. The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of pseudoephedrine include insomnia, elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, restlessness, dizziness, anxiety, and dry mouth, among others. Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been associated with serious cardiovascular complications like heart attack and hemorrhagic stroke. Some people may be more sensitive to its cardiovascular effects. Pseudoephedrine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Pseudoephedrine significantly crosses into the brain, but has some peripheral selectivity due to its hydrophilicity. Chemically, pseudoephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and amphetamine. It is the (1S,2S)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine. Along with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine occurs naturally in ephedra, which has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It was first isolated from ephedra in 1889. Subsequent to its synthesis in the 1920s, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is widely available over-the-counter (OTC) in both single-drug and combination preparations. Availability of pseudoephedrine has been restricted starting in 2005 as it can be used to synthesize methamphetamine. Phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many over-the-counter oral decongestant products. However, oral phenylephrine appears to be ineffective as a decongestant. In 2022, the combination with brompheniramine and dextromethorphan was the 265th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with loratadine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Nasal congestion === Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic and is well-known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as topical decongestant. Due to its stimulating qualities, however, the oral preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an antitussive drug (suppression of cough). Pseudoephedrine is indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion, sinus congestion, and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis. === Other uses === Amphetamine-type stimulants and other catecholaminergic agents are known to have wakefulness-promoting effects and are used in the treatment of hypersomnia and narcolepsy. Pseudoephedrine at therapeutic doses does not appear to improve or worsen daytime sleepiness, daytime fatigue, or sleep quality in people with allergic rhinitis. Likewise, somnolence was not lower in children with the common cold treated with pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion. In any case, insomnia is a known side effect of pseudoephedrine, although the incidence is low. In addition, doses of pseudoephedrine above the normal therapeutic range have been reported to produce stimulant effects including insomnia and fatigue resistance. There has been interest in pseudoephedrine as an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity. However, due to lack of clinical data and potential cardiovascular side effects, this use is not recommended. Only a single placebo-controlled study of pseudoephedrine for weight loss exists (120 mg/day slow-release for 12 weeks) and found no significant difference in weight lost compared to placebo (-4.6 kg vs. -4.5 kg). This was in contrast to phenylpropanolamine, which has been found to be more effective at promoting weight loss compared to placebo and has been more widely studied and used in the treatment of obesity. Pseudoephedrine has been used limitedly in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance including orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). However, its effectiveness in the treatment of POTS is controversial. Pseudoephedrine has also been used limitedly in the treatment of refractory hypotension in intensive care units. However, data on this use are limited to case reports and case series. Pseudoephedrine is also used as a first-line prophylactic for recurrent priapism. Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Data for this use are however anecdotal and effectiveness has been described as variable. Treatment of urinary incontinence is an off-label use for pseudoephedrine and related medications. === Available forms === Pseudoephedrine is available by itself over-the-counter in the form of 30 and 60 mg immediate-release and 120 and 240 mg extended-release oral tablets in the United States. Pseudoephedrine is also available over-the-counter and prescription-only in combination with numerous other drugs, including antihistamines (acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, triprolidine), analgesics (acetaminophen, codeine, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, naproxen), cough suppressants (dextromethorphan), and expectorants (guaifenesin). Pseudoephedrine has been used in the form of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts and in a polistirex form. The drug has been used in more than 135 over-the-counter and prescription formulations. Many prescription formulations containing pseudoephedrine have been discontinued over time. == Contraindications == Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, or by pregnant women. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear. == Side effects == Common side effects with pseudoephedrine therapy may include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, insomnia, restlessness, excitability, dizziness, and anxiety. Infrequent side effects include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures, and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also play a role in the precipitation of episodes of psychosis. It has also been reported that pseudoephedrine, among other sympathomimetic agents, may be associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its sympathomimetic effects, pseudoephedrine is a vasoconstrictor and pressor agent (increases blood pressure), a positive chronotrope (increases heart rate), and a positive inotrope (increases force of heart contractions). The influence of pseudoephedrine on blood pressure at clinical doses is controversial. A closely related sympathomimetic and decongestant, phenylpropanolamine, was withdrawn due to associations with markedly increased blood pressure and incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. There has been concern that pseudoephedrine may likewise dangerously increase blood pressure and thereby increase the risk of stroke, whereas others have contended that the risks are exaggerated. Besides hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary vasospasm, and sudden death have also rarely been reported with sympathomimetic ephedra compounds like pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. A 2005 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at recommended doses had no meaningful effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure in healthy individuals or people with controlled hypertension. Systolic blood pressure was found to slightly increase by 0.99 mm Hg on average and heart rate was found to slightly increase by 2.83 bpm on average. Conversely, there was no significant influence on diastolic blood pressure, which increased by 0.63 mg Hg. In people with controlled hypertension, systolic hypertension increased by a similar degree of 1.20 mm Hg. Immediate-release preparations, higher doses, being male, and shorter duration of use were all associated with greater cardiovascular effects. A small subset of individuals with autonomic instability, perhaps in turn resulting in greater adrenergic receptor sensitivity, may be substantially more sensitive to the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics. Subsequent to the 2005 meta-analysis, a 2015 systematic review and a 2018 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at high doses (>170 mg) could increase heart rate and physical performance with larger effect sizes than lower doses. A 2007 Cochrane review assessed the side effects of short-term use of pseudoephedrine at recommended doses as a nasal decongestant. It found that pseudoephedrine had a small risk of insomnia and this was the only side effect that occurred at rates significantly different from placebo. Insomnia occurred at a rate of 5% and had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.18. Other side effects, including headache and hypertension, occurred at rates of less than 4% and were not different from placebo. Tachyphylaxis is known to develop with prolonged use of pseudoephedrine, especially when it is re-administered at short intervals. There is a case report of temporary depressive symptoms upon discontinuation and withdrawal from pseudoephedrine. The withdrawal symptoms included worsened mood and sadness, profoundly decreased energy, a worsened view of oneself, decreased concentration, psychomotor retardation, increased appetite, and increased need for sleep. Pseudoephedrine has psychostimulant effects at high doses and is a positive reinforcer with amphetamine-like effects in animals including rats and monkeys. However, it is substantially less potent than methamphetamine or cocaine. == Overdose == The maximum total daily dose of pseudoephedrine is 240 mg. Symptoms of overdose may include sedation, apnea, impaired concentration, cyanosis, coma, circulatory collapse, insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions, headache, dizziness, anxiety, euphoria, tinnitus, blurred vision, ataxia, chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, thirstiness, sweating, difficulty with urination, nausea, and vomiting. In children, symptoms have more often included dry mouth, pupil dilation, hot flashes, fever, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pseudoephedrine may produce toxic effects both with use of supratherapeutic doses but also in people who are more sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetics. Misuse of the drug has been reported in one case at massive doses of 3,000 to 4,500 mg (100–150 × 30-mg tablets) per day, with the doses gradually increased over time by this individual. No fatalities due to pseudoephedrine misuse have been reported as of 2021. However, death with pseudoephedrine has been reported generally. == Interactions == Concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use can lead to hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crisis, and should be avoided. Clinical studies have found minimal or no influence of certain MAOIs like the weak non-selective MAOI linezolid and the potent selective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (as a transdermal patch) on the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. This is in accordance with the fact that pseudoephedrine is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, pseudoephedrine induces the release of norepinephrine, which MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of, and as such, MAOIs can still potentiate the effects of pseudoephedrine. No significant pharmacodynamic interactions have been found with selegiline, but linezolid potentiated blood pressure increases with pseudoephedrine. However, this was deemed to be without clinical significance in the case of linezolid, though it was noted that some individuals may be more sensitive to the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine and related agents. Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated with MAOIs like phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, and moclobemide due to the potential for synergistic sympathomimetic effects and hypertensive crisis. It is also considered to be contraindicated with linezolid and selegiline as some individuals may react more sensitively to coadministration. Concomitant use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors, including ergot alkaloids like ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, linezolid, oxytocin, ephedrine, phenylephrine, and bromocriptine, among others, is not recommended due to the possibility of greater increases in blood pressure and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Sympathomimetic effects and cardiovascular risks of pseudoephedrine may also be increased with digitalis glycosides, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants, and inhalational anesthetics. Likewise, greater sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine may occur when it is combined with other sympathomimetic agents. Rare but serious cardiovascular complications have been reported with the combination of pseudoephedrine and bupropion. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, guanethidine, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics like pseudoepehdrine. Beta blockers like labetalol may reduce the effects of pseudoephedrine. Urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including pseudoephedrine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent which acts primarily or exclusively by inducing the release of norepinephrine. Hence, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Some sources state that pseudoephedrine has a mixed mechanism of action consisting of both indirect and direct effects by binding to and acting as an agonist of adrenergic receptors. However, the affinity of pseudoephedrine for adrenergic receptors is described as very low or negligible. Animal studies suggest that the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine are exclusively due to norepinephrine release. Pseudoephedrine induces monoamine release in vitro with an EC50Tooltip half maximal effective concentration of 224 nM for norepinephrine and 1,988 nM for dopamine, whereas it is inactive for serotonin. As such, it is about 9-fold selective for induction of norepinephrine release over dopamine release. The drug has negligible agonistic activity at the α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors (Kact >10,000 nM). At the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, it acts as a partial agonist with relatively low affinity (β1 = Kact = 309 μM, IATooltip intrinsic activity = 53%; β2 = 10 μM; IA = 47%). It was an antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the β3-adrenergic receptor (Kact = ND; IA = 7%). It is about 30,000 to 40,000 times less potent as a β-adrenergic receptor agonist than (–)-isoproterenol. Pseudoephedrine's principal mechanism of action relies on its action on the adrenergic system. The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an α-adrenergic receptor response. Pseudoephedrine acts on α- and β2-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively. α-Adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the bronchi, causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing. Pseudoephedrine is less potent as a sympathomimetic and psychostimulant than ephedrine. Clinical studies have found that pseudoephedrine is about 3.5- to 4-fold less potent than ephedrine as a sympathomimetic agent in terms of blood pressure increases and 3.5- to 7.2-fold or more less potent as a bronchodilator. Pseudoephedrine is also said to have much less central effect than ephedrine and to be only a weak psychostimulant. Blood vessels in the nose are around five times more sensitive than the heart to the actions of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline), which may help to explain how pseudoephedrine at the low doses used in over-the-counter products can produce nasal decongestion with minimal effects on the heart. Compared to dextroamphetamine, pseudoephedrine is about 30 to 35 times less potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent and 80 to 350 times less potent as a dopamine releasing agent in vitro. Pseudoephedrine is a very weak reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro, including both MAO-A and MAO-B (Ki = 1,000–5,800 μM). It is far less potent in this action than other agents like dextroamphetamine and moclobemide. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Pseudoephedrine is orally active and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. The drug reaches peak concentrations after 1 to 4 hours (mean 1.9 hours) in the case of the immediate-release formulation and after 2 to 6 hours in the case of the extended-release formulation. The onset of action of pseudoephedrine is 30 minutes. ==== Distribution ==== Pseudoephedrine, due to its lack of polar phenolic groups, is relatively lipophilic. This is a property it shares with related sympathomimetic and decongestant agents like ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. These agents are widely distributed throughout the body and cross the blood–brain barrier. However, it is said that pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine cross the blood-brain barrier only to some extent and that pseudoephedrine has limited central nervous system activity, suggesting that it is partially peripherally selective. The blood-brain barrier permeability of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine is reduced compared to other amphetamines due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the β carbon which decreases their lipophilicity. As such, they have a greater ratio of peripheral cardiovascular to central psychostimulant effect. Besides entering the brain, these substances also cross the placenta and enter breast milk. The plasma protein binding of pseudoephedrine has been reported to be approximately 21 to 29%. It is bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and albumin (HSA). ==== Metabolism ==== Pseudoephedrine is not extensively metabolized and is subjected to minimal first-pass metabolism with oral administration. Due to its methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., it is an amphetamine), pseudoephedrine is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. It is also not metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). Pseudoephedrine is demethylated into the metabolite norpseudoephedrine to a small extent. Similarly to pseudoephedrine, this metabolite is active and shows amphetamine-like effects. Approximately 1 to 6% of pseudoephedrine is metabolized in the liver via N-demethylation to form norpseudoephedrine. ==== Elimination ==== Pseudoephedrine is excreted primarily via the kidneys in urine. Its urinary excretion is highly influenced by urinary pH and is increased when the urine is acidic and is decreased when it is alkaline. The elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine on average is 5.4 hours and ranges from 3 to 16 hours depending on urinary pH. At a pH of 5.6 to 6.0, the elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine was 5.2 to 8.0 hours. In one study, a more acidic pH of 5.0 resulted in a half-life of 3.0 to 6.4 hours, whereas a more alkaline pH of 8.0 resulted in a half-life of 9.2 to 16.0 hours. Substances that influence urinary acidity and are known to affect the excretion of amphetamine derivatives include urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride as well as urinary alkalinizing agents like acetazolamide. A majority of an oral dose of pseudoephedrine is excreted unchanged in urine within 24 hours of administration. This has been found to range from 43 to 96%. The amount excreted unchanged is dependent on urinary pH similarly to the drug's half-life, as a longer half-life and duration in the body allows more time for the drug to be metabolized. The duration of action of pseudoephedrine, which is dependent on its elimination, is 4 to 12 hours. Pseudoephedrine has been reported to accumulate in people with renal impairment. == Chemistry == Pseudoephedrine, also known structurally as (1S,2S)-α,N-dimethyl-β-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1S,2S)-N-methyl-β-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine, amphetamine, and β-hydroxyamphetamine derivative. It is a diastereomer of ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C10H15NO and a molecular weight of 165.23 g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.89, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to pseudoephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7). Pseudoephedrine is readily reduced into methamphetamine or oxidized into methcathinone. === Nomenclatures === The dextrorotary (+)- or d- enantiomer is (1S,2S)-pseudoephedrine, whereas the levorotating (−)- or l- form is (1R,2R)-pseudoephedrine. In the outdated D/L system (+)-pseudoephedrine is also referred to as L-pseudoephedrine and (−)-pseudoephedrine as D-pseudoephedrine (in the Fisher projection then the phenyl ring is drawn at bottom). Often the D/L system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine is wrongly named D-pseudoephedrine and the levorotary l-ephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly L-ephedrine. The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1S,2S)- respectively (1R,2R)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Synonyms for both are psi-ephedrine and threo-ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of the (+)-form, when used as pharmaceutical substance. === Detection in body fluids === Pseudoephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor any possible performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Some commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50 to 300 μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500 to 3,000 μg/L in people with substance use disorder involving pseudoephedrine or poisoned patients, and 10 to 70 mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdose. == Manufacturing == Although pseudoephedrine occurs naturally as an alkaloid in certain plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the Ephedra species, also known as ma huang, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose in the presence of benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment, the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination. The bulk of pseudoephedrine is produced by commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers in India and China, where economic and industrial conditions favor its mass production for export. == History == Pseudoephedrine, along with ephedrine, occurs naturally in ephedra. This herb has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. Pseudoephedrine was first isolated and characterized in 1889 by the German chemists Ladenburg and Oelschlägel, who used a sample that had been isolated from Ephedra vulgaris by the Merck pharmaceutical corporation of Darmstadt, Germany. It was first synthesized in the 1920s in Japan. Subsequently, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Pseudoephedrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while pseudoéphédrine is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and pseudoefedrina is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt; pseudoephedrine sulfate is its USAN in the case of the sulfate salt; pseudoephedrine polistirex its USAN in the case of the polistirex form; and d-isoephedrine sulfate is its JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name in the case of the sulfate salt. Pseudoephedrine is also known as Ψ-ephedrine and isoephedrine. === Brand names === The following is a list of consumer medicines that either contain pseudoephedrine or have switched to a less-regulated alternative such as phenylephrine.

Six case reports and one case series of pseudoephedrine misuse have been published as of 2021. There is a case report of self-medication with pseudoephedrine in massive doses for treatment of depression. === Use in exercise and sports === Pseudoephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports due to its sympathomimetic and stimulant effects. Because of these effects, pseudoephedrine can increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, improve mental energy, and reduce fatigue, among other performance-enhancing effects. A 2015 systematic review found that pseudoephedrine lacked performance-enhancing effects at therapeutic doses (60–120 mg) but significantly enhanced athletic performance at supratherapeutic doses (≥180 mg). A subsequent 2018 meta-analysis, which included seven additional studies, found that pseudoephedrine had a small positive effect on heart rate (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = 0.43) but insignificant effects on time trials, perceived exertion ratings, blood glucose levels, and blood lactate levels. However, subgroup analyses revealed that effect sizes were larger for heart rate increases and quicker time trials in well-trained athletes and younger participants, for shorter exercise sessions with pseudoephedrine administered within 90 minutes beforehand, and with higher doses of pseudoephedrine. A dose–response relationship was established, with larger doses (>170 mg) showing greater increases in heart rate and faster time trials than with smaller doses (≤170 mg) (SMD = 0.85 for heart rate and SMD = -0.24 for time trials, respectively). In any case, the meta-analysis concluded that the performance-enhancing effects of pseudoephedrine were marginal to small and likely to be lower in magnitude than with caffeine. It is relevant in this regard that caffeine is a permitted stimulant in competitive sports. Pseudoephedrine was on the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) banned substances list until 2004 when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list replaced the IOC list. Although WADA initially only monitored pseudoephedrine, it went back onto the ""banned"" list on 1 January 2010. Pseudoephedrine is excreted through urine, and the concentration in urine of this drug shows a large inter-individual spread; that is, the same dose can give a vast difference in urine concentration for different individuals. Pseudoephedrine is approved to be taken up to 240 mg per day. In seven healthy male subjects, this dose yielded a urine concentration range of 62.8 to 294.4 microgram per milliliter (μg/mL) with mean ± standard deviation 149 ± 72 μg/mL. Thus, normal dosage of 240 mg pseudoephedrine per day can result in urine concentration levels exceeding the limit of 150 μg/mL set by WADA for about half of all users. Furthermore, hydration status does not affect the urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine. ==== List of doping cases ==== Canadian rower Silken Laumann was stripped of her 1995 Pan American Games team gold medal after testing positive for pseudoephedrine. In February 2000, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won gold at the 2000 European Figure Skating Championships but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification. Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan was stripped of her gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games after testing positive. She took two pills given to her by the team coach for a cold. Although she was stripped of the overall gold medal, she kept her other medals, and, unlike in most other doping cases, was not banned from competing again; only the team doctor was banned for a number of years. Ion Țiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, resigned over the scandal. In the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, the IOC issued a reprimand against the Slovak ice hockey player Lubomir Visnovsky for usage of pseudoephedrine. In the 2014 Winter Olympic Games Team Sweden and Washington Capitals ice hockey player Nicklas Bäckström was prevented from playing in the final for usage of pseudoephedrine. Bäckström claimed he was using it as allergy medication. In March 2014, the IOC Disciplinary Commission decided that Bäckström would be awarded the silver medal. In January 2015 Bäckström, the IOC, WADA and the IIHF agreed to a settlement in which he accepted a reprimand but was cleared of attempting to enhance his performance. === Manufacture of amphetamines === Its membership in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As a result of the increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, pharmaceutical firms have reformulated medications to use alternative compounds, particularly phenylephrine, even though its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from placebo. In the United States, federal laws control the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Retailers in the US have created corporate policies restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Their policies restrict sales by limiting purchase quantities and requiring a minimum age and government issued photographic identification. These requirements are similar to and sometimes more stringent than existing law. Internationally, pseudoephedrine is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. === Legal status === ==== Australia ==== Illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine in Australia has caused significant changes to the way the products are regulated. As of 2006, all products containing pseudoephedrine have been rescheduled as either ""Pharmacist Only Medicines"" (Schedule 3) or ""Prescription Only Medicines"" (Schedule 4), depending on the amount of pseudoephedrine in the product. A Pharmacist Only Medicine may only be sold to the public if a pharmacist is directly involved in the transaction. These medicines must be kept behind the counter, away from public access. Pharmacists are also encouraged (and in some states required) to log purchases with the online database Project STOP. As a result, some pharmacies no longer stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a phenylephrine product that has not been proven effective in clinical trials. ==== Belgium ==== Until 2024, several formulations of pseudoephedrine were available over-the-counter in Belgium. However, new legislation came into effect in November 2024, banning the over-the-counter sale of all medicines containing pseudoephedrine. ==== Canada ==== Health Canada has investigated the risks and benefits of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine/Ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may have strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine. Products whose only medicinal ingredient is pseudoephedrine must be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing pseudoephedrine along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present. ==== Colombia ==== The Colombian government prohibited the trade of pseudoephedrine in 2010. ==== Estonia ==== Pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter drug in Estonia. ==== Finland ==== Pseudoephedrine medicines can only be obtained with a prescription in Finland. ==== France ==== Pseudoephedrine-containing combination products are available over the counter from pharmacies, most commonly with Paracetamol under the brand name ""Dolihrume"". Products combining pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen or certain antihistamines are also available. However, products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not sold. In October 2023, the French health department officially warned against the usage of pseudoephedrine for patients with a cold. It also suggested the substance's availability could be restricted in the future, pending its pharmaceutical re-evaluation on EU level. In December 2024, the government announced pseudoephedrine medicines would henceforth only be obtainable with a prescription. ==== Germany ==== Various pseudoephedrine-containing products in combination with ibuprofen, aspirin, or antihistamines can be obtained without a prescription upon request at a pharmacy. Common names include Aspirin Complex, Reactine Duo, and RhinoPront. Products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not available. ==== Japan ==== Medications that contain more than 10% pseudoephedrine are prohibited under the Stimulants Control Law in Japan. ==== Mexico ==== On 23 November 2007, the use and trade of pseudoephedrine in Mexico was made illegal as it was argued that it was extremely popular as a precursor in the synthesis of methamphetamine. ==== Netherlands ==== Pseudoephedrine was withdrawn from sale in 1989 due to concerns about adverse cardiac side effects. ==== New Zealand ==== Since April 2024, pseudoephedrine has been classified as a restricted (pharmacist-only) drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 which allows the purchase of medicines containing pseudoephedrine from a pharmacist without a prescription. Pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and any product containing these substances, e.g. cold and flu medicines, were first classified in October 2004 as Class C Part III (partially exempted) controlled drugs, due to being the principal ingredient in methamphetamine. New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold and flu tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011. On 24 November 2023, the recently formed National-led coalition government announced that the sale of cold medication containing pseudoephedrine would be allowed (as part of the coalition agreement between the National and ACT parties). ==== Switzerland ==== Pseudoephedrine is available without a prescription in combination (with aspirin) under the brand name ""Aspirin Complex"". There is also a preparation consisting of a single ingredient 120 mg extended-release tablet that can be obtained at pharmacies with a prescription or after consultation with a pharmacist. ==== Turkey ==== In Turkey, medications containing pseudoephedrine are available by prescription only. ==== United Kingdom ==== In the UK, pseudoephedrine is available over the counter under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the MHRA reacted to concerns over the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over-the-counter sales to one box containing no more than 720 mg of pseudoephedrine in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008. No form of ID is required. ==== United States ==== ===== Federal ===== The United States Congress has recognized that pseudoephedrine is used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. In 2005, the Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony concerning education programs and state legislation designed to curb this illegal practice. Attempts to control the sale of the drug date back to 1986, when federal officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator Bob Dole, that would have placed several chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed. Before the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became increasingly regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in its attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did the number of people in rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. This reduction in purity was usually short-lived, however, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations. Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) as an amendment to the renewal of the USA Patriot Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on 6 March 2006, the act amended 21 U.S.C. § 830, concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by 8 April 2006, and the second to be completed by 30 September 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on the amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping. Though the law was mainly directed at pseudoephedrine products it also applies to all over-the-counter products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, their salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers. Pseudoephedrine was defined as a ""scheduled listed chemical product"" under 21 U.S.C. § 802(45(A)). The act included the following requirements for merchants (""regulated sellers"") who sell such products: Required a retrievable record of all purchases, identifying the name and address of each party, to be kept for two years Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information Required reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products Required training of employees with regard to the requirements of the CMEA. Retailers must self-certify as to training and compliance. The non-liquid dose form of regulated products may only be sold in unit dose blister packs Regulated products must be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict public access Sales limits (per customer): Daily sales limit—must not exceed 3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine base without regard to the number of transactions 30-day (not monthly) sales limit—must not exceed 7.5 grams of pseudoephedrine base if sold by mail order or ""mobile retail vendor"" 30-day purchase limit—must not exceed 9 grams of pseudoephedrine base. (A misdemeanor possession offense under 21 U.S.C. § 844a for the person who buys it.) The requirements were revised in the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2008 to require that a regulated seller of scheduled listed chemical products may not sell such a product unless the purchaser: Presents a government-issued photographic identification; and Signs the written logbook with name, address, and time and date of the sale ===== State ===== Most states also have laws regulating pseudoephedrine. The states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii (as of May 1, 2009) Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana (as of August 15, 2009), Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have laws requiring pharmacies to sell pseudoephedrine ""behind the counter"". Though the drug can be purchased without a prescription, states can limit the number of units sold and can collect personal information from purchasers. The states of Oregon and Mississippi previously required a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine. However, as of 1 January 2022, these restrictions have been repealed. The state of Oregon reduced the number of methamphetamine lab seizures from 448 in 2004 (the final full year before implementation of the prescription only law) to a new low of 13 in 2009. The decrease in meth lab incidents in Oregon occurred largely before the prescription-only law took effect, according to a NAMSDL report titled Pseudoephedrine Prescription Laws in Oregon and Mississippi. The report posits that the decline in meth lab incidents in both states may be due to other factors: ""Mexican traffickers may have contributed to the decline in meth labs in Mississippi and Oregon (and surrounding states) as they were able to provide ample supply of equal or greater quality meth at competitive prices"". Additionally, similar decreases in meth lab incidents were seen in surrounding states, according to the report, and meth-related deaths in Oregon have dramatically risen since 2007. Some municipalities in Missouri have enacted similar ordinances, including Washington, Union, New Haven, Cape Girardeau and Ozark. Certain pharmacies in Terre Haute, Indiana do so as well. Another approach to controlling the drug on the state level mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of electronic tracking systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. Thirty-two states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Before the implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004 but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009. Kentucky's program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased. Oklahoma initially experienced success with its tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. In 2008, however, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009. NPLEx appears to be successful by requiring the real-time submission of transactions, thereby enabling the relevant laws to be enforced at the point of sale. By creating a multi-state database and the ability to compare all transactions quickly, NPLEx enables pharmacies to deny purchases that would be illegal based on gram limits, age, or even to convicted meth offenders in some states. NPLEx also enforces the federal gram limits across state lines, which was impossible with state-operated systems. Access to the records is by law enforcement agencies only, through an online secure portal. == Research == Pseudoephedrine has been studied in the treatment of snoring. However, data are inadequate to support this use. A study has found that pseudoephedrine can reduce milk production in breastfeeding women. This might have been due to suppression of prolactin secretion. Pseudoephedrine might be useful for lactation suppression. == References ==",Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.292907877039397e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.755022044060752e-05), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38688769936561584)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682619.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Pseudoephedrine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682619.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4303,"('Pseudoephedrine', 'Isoephedrine', 'Sudafed', 'Trans-ephedrine', 'Psi-ephedrin')",Medical,"Pseudoephedrine, sold under the brand name Sudafed among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used as a decongestant to treat nasal congestion. It has also been used off-label for certain other indications, like treatment of low blood pressure. At higher doses, it may produce various additional effects including stimulant, appetite suppressant, and performance-enhancing effects. In relation to this, non-medical use of pseudoephedrine has been encountered. The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of pseudoephedrine include insomnia, elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure, restlessness, dizziness, anxiety, and dry mouth, among others. Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been associated with serious cardiovascular complications like heart attack and hemorrhagic stroke. Some people may be more sensitive to its cardiovascular effects. Pseudoephedrine acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Pseudoephedrine significantly crosses into the brain, but has some peripheral selectivity due to its hydrophilicity. Chemically, pseudoephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, and amphetamine. It is the (1S,2S)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine. Along with ephedrine, pseudoephedrine occurs naturally in ephedra, which has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It was first isolated from ephedra in 1889. Subsequent to its synthesis in the 1920s, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is widely available over-the-counter (OTC) in both single-drug and combination preparations. Availability of pseudoephedrine has been restricted starting in 2005 as it can be used to synthesize methamphetamine. Phenylephrine has replaced pseudoephedrine in many over-the-counter oral decongestant products. However, oral phenylephrine appears to be ineffective as a decongestant. In 2022, the combination with brompheniramine and dextromethorphan was the 265th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with loratadine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Nasal congestion === Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic and is well-known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a decongestant. It reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion commonly associated with colds or allergies. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of sinus secretions, and opening of obstructed Eustachian tubes. The same vasoconstriction action can also result in hypertension, which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as topical decongestant. Due to its stimulating qualities, however, the oral preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including urinary retention. According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an antitussive drug (suppression of cough). Pseudoephedrine is indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion, sinus congestion, and Eustachian tube congestion. Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for vasomotor rhinitis and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of allergic rhinitis, croup, sinusitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis. === Other uses === Amphetamine-type stimulants and other catecholaminergic agents are known to have wakefulness-promoting effects and are used in the treatment of hypersomnia and narcolepsy. Pseudoephedrine at therapeutic doses does not appear to improve or worsen daytime sleepiness, daytime fatigue, or sleep quality in people with allergic rhinitis. Likewise, somnolence was not lower in children with the common cold treated with pseudoephedrine for nasal congestion. In any case, insomnia is a known side effect of pseudoephedrine, although the incidence is low. In addition, doses of pseudoephedrine above the normal therapeutic range have been reported to produce stimulant effects including insomnia and fatigue resistance. There has been interest in pseudoephedrine as an appetite suppressant for the treatment of obesity. However, due to lack of clinical data and potential cardiovascular side effects, this use is not recommended. Only a single placebo-controlled study of pseudoephedrine for weight loss exists (120 mg/day slow-release for 12 weeks) and found no significant difference in weight lost compared to placebo (-4.6 kg vs. -4.5 kg). This was in contrast to phenylpropanolamine, which has been found to be more effective at promoting weight loss compared to placebo and has been more widely studied and used in the treatment of obesity. Pseudoephedrine has been used limitedly in the treatment of orthostatic intolerance including orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). However, its effectiveness in the treatment of POTS is controversial. Pseudoephedrine has also been used limitedly in the treatment of refractory hypotension in intensive care units. However, data on this use are limited to case reports and case series. Pseudoephedrine is also used as a first-line prophylactic for recurrent priapism. Erection is largely a parasympathetic response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Data for this use are however anecdotal and effectiveness has been described as variable. Treatment of urinary incontinence is an off-label use for pseudoephedrine and related medications. === Available forms === Pseudoephedrine is available by itself over-the-counter in the form of 30 and 60 mg immediate-release and 120 and 240 mg extended-release oral tablets in the United States. Pseudoephedrine is also available over-the-counter and prescription-only in combination with numerous other drugs, including antihistamines (acrivastine, azatadine, brompheniramine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, desloratadine, dexbrompheniramine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, triprolidine), analgesics (acetaminophen, codeine, hydrocodone, ibuprofen, naproxen), cough suppressants (dextromethorphan), and expectorants (guaifenesin). Pseudoephedrine has been used in the form of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts and in a polistirex form. The drug has been used in more than 135 over-the-counter and prescription formulations. Many prescription formulations containing pseudoephedrine have been discontinued over time. == Contraindications == Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, severe or uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, or by pregnant women. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear. == Side effects == Common side effects with pseudoephedrine therapy may include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, insomnia, restlessness, excitability, dizziness, and anxiety. Infrequent side effects include tachycardia or palpitations. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with mydriasis (dilated pupils), hallucinations, arrhythmias, hypertension, seizures, and ischemic colitis; as well as severe skin reactions known as recurrent pseudo-scarlatina, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption. Pseudoephedrine, particularly when combined with other drugs including narcotics, may also play a role in the precipitation of episodes of psychosis. It has also been reported that pseudoephedrine, among other sympathomimetic agents, may be associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its sympathomimetic effects, pseudoephedrine is a vasoconstrictor and pressor agent (increases blood pressure), a positive chronotrope (increases heart rate), and a positive inotrope (increases force of heart contractions). The influence of pseudoephedrine on blood pressure at clinical doses is controversial. A closely related sympathomimetic and decongestant, phenylpropanolamine, was withdrawn due to associations with markedly increased blood pressure and incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. There has been concern that pseudoephedrine may likewise dangerously increase blood pressure and thereby increase the risk of stroke, whereas others have contended that the risks are exaggerated. Besides hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary vasospasm, and sudden death have also rarely been reported with sympathomimetic ephedra compounds like pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. A 2005 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at recommended doses had no meaningful effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure in healthy individuals or people with controlled hypertension. Systolic blood pressure was found to slightly increase by 0.99 mm Hg on average and heart rate was found to slightly increase by 2.83 bpm on average. Conversely, there was no significant influence on diastolic blood pressure, which increased by 0.63 mg Hg. In people with controlled hypertension, systolic hypertension increased by a similar degree of 1.20 mm Hg. Immediate-release preparations, higher doses, being male, and shorter duration of use were all associated with greater cardiovascular effects. A small subset of individuals with autonomic instability, perhaps in turn resulting in greater adrenergic receptor sensitivity, may be substantially more sensitive to the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics. Subsequent to the 2005 meta-analysis, a 2015 systematic review and a 2018 meta-analysis found that pseudoephedrine at high doses (>170 mg) could increase heart rate and physical performance with larger effect sizes than lower doses. A 2007 Cochrane review assessed the side effects of short-term use of pseudoephedrine at recommended doses as a nasal decongestant. It found that pseudoephedrine had a small risk of insomnia and this was the only side effect that occurred at rates significantly different from placebo. Insomnia occurred at a rate of 5% and had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.18. Other side effects, including headache and hypertension, occurred at rates of less than 4% and were not different from placebo. Tachyphylaxis is known to develop with prolonged use of pseudoephedrine, especially when it is re-administered at short intervals. There is a case report of temporary depressive symptoms upon discontinuation and withdrawal from pseudoephedrine. The withdrawal symptoms included worsened mood and sadness, profoundly decreased energy, a worsened view of oneself, decreased concentration, psychomotor retardation, increased appetite, and increased need for sleep. Pseudoephedrine has psychostimulant effects at high doses and is a positive reinforcer with amphetamine-like effects in animals including rats and monkeys. However, it is substantially less potent than methamphetamine or cocaine. == Overdose == The maximum total daily dose of pseudoephedrine is 240 mg. Symptoms of overdose may include sedation, apnea, impaired concentration, cyanosis, coma, circulatory collapse, insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions, headache, dizziness, anxiety, euphoria, tinnitus, blurred vision, ataxia, chest pain, tachycardia, palpitations, increased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure, thirstiness, sweating, difficulty with urination, nausea, and vomiting. In children, symptoms have more often included dry mouth, pupil dilation, hot flashes, fever, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pseudoephedrine may produce toxic effects both with use of supratherapeutic doses but also in people who are more sensitive to the effects of sympathomimetics. Misuse of the drug has been reported in one case at massive doses of 3,000 to 4,500 mg (100–150 × 30-mg tablets) per day, with the doses gradually increased over time by this individual. No fatalities due to pseudoephedrine misuse have been reported as of 2021. However, death with pseudoephedrine has been reported generally. == Interactions == Concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use can lead to hypertensive reactions, including hypertensive crisis, and should be avoided. Clinical studies have found minimal or no influence of certain MAOIs like the weak non-selective MAOI linezolid and the potent selective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (as a transdermal patch) on the pharmacokinetics of pseudoephedrine. This is in accordance with the fact that pseudoephedrine is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). However, pseudoephedrine induces the release of norepinephrine, which MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of, and as such, MAOIs can still potentiate the effects of pseudoephedrine. No significant pharmacodynamic interactions have been found with selegiline, but linezolid potentiated blood pressure increases with pseudoephedrine. However, this was deemed to be without clinical significance in the case of linezolid, though it was noted that some individuals may be more sensitive to the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine and related agents. Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated with MAOIs like phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, and moclobemide due to the potential for synergistic sympathomimetic effects and hypertensive crisis. It is also considered to be contraindicated with linezolid and selegiline as some individuals may react more sensitively to coadministration. Concomitant use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors, including ergot alkaloids like ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, linezolid, oxytocin, ephedrine, phenylephrine, and bromocriptine, among others, is not recommended due to the possibility of greater increases in blood pressure and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Sympathomimetic effects and cardiovascular risks of pseudoephedrine may also be increased with digitalis glycosides, tricyclic antidepressants, appetite suppressants, and inhalational anesthetics. Likewise, greater sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine may occur when it is combined with other sympathomimetic agents. Rare but serious cardiovascular complications have been reported with the combination of pseudoephedrine and bupropion. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with digitalis. The antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, guanethidine, mecamylamine, reserpine, and veratrum alkaloids may be reduced by sympathomimetics like pseudoepehdrine. Beta blockers like labetalol may reduce the effects of pseudoephedrine. Urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including pseudoephedrine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent which acts primarily or exclusively by inducing the release of norepinephrine. Hence, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Some sources state that pseudoephedrine has a mixed mechanism of action consisting of both indirect and direct effects by binding to and acting as an agonist of adrenergic receptors. However, the affinity of pseudoephedrine for adrenergic receptors is described as very low or negligible. Animal studies suggest that the sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine are exclusively due to norepinephrine release. Pseudoephedrine induces monoamine release in vitro with an EC50Tooltip half maximal effective concentration of 224 nM for norepinephrine and 1,988 nM for dopamine, whereas it is inactive for serotonin. As such, it is about 9-fold selective for induction of norepinephrine release over dopamine release. The drug has negligible agonistic activity at the α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors (Kact >10,000 nM). At the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, it acts as a partial agonist with relatively low affinity (β1 = Kact = 309 μM, IATooltip intrinsic activity = 53%; β2 = 10 μM; IA = 47%). It was an antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the β3-adrenergic receptor (Kact = ND; IA = 7%). It is about 30,000 to 40,000 times less potent as a β-adrenergic receptor agonist than (–)-isoproterenol. Pseudoephedrine's principal mechanism of action relies on its action on the adrenergic system. The vasoconstriction that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an α-adrenergic receptor response. Pseudoephedrine acts on α- and β2-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively. α-Adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of the smooth muscle of the bronchi, causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing. Pseudoephedrine is less potent as a sympathomimetic and psychostimulant than ephedrine. Clinical studies have found that pseudoephedrine is about 3.5- to 4-fold less potent than ephedrine as a sympathomimetic agent in terms of blood pressure increases and 3.5- to 7.2-fold or more less potent as a bronchodilator. Pseudoephedrine is also said to have much less central effect than ephedrine and to be only a weak psychostimulant. Blood vessels in the nose are around five times more sensitive than the heart to the actions of circulating epinephrine (adrenaline), which may help to explain how pseudoephedrine at the low doses used in over-the-counter products can produce nasal decongestion with minimal effects on the heart. Compared to dextroamphetamine, pseudoephedrine is about 30 to 35 times less potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent and 80 to 350 times less potent as a dopamine releasing agent in vitro. Pseudoephedrine is a very weak reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro, including both MAO-A and MAO-B (Ki = 1,000–5,800 μM). It is far less potent in this action than other agents like dextroamphetamine and moclobemide. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Pseudoephedrine is orally active and is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. The drug reaches peak concentrations after 1 to 4 hours (mean 1.9 hours) in the case of the immediate-release formulation and after 2 to 6 hours in the case of the extended-release formulation. The onset of action of pseudoephedrine is 30 minutes. ==== Distribution ==== Pseudoephedrine, due to its lack of polar phenolic groups, is relatively lipophilic. This is a property it shares with related sympathomimetic and decongestant agents like ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. These agents are widely distributed throughout the body and cross the blood–brain barrier. However, it is said that pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine cross the blood-brain barrier only to some extent and that pseudoephedrine has limited central nervous system activity, suggesting that it is partially peripherally selective. The blood-brain barrier permeability of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine is reduced compared to other amphetamines due to the presence of a hydroxyl group at the β carbon which decreases their lipophilicity. As such, they have a greater ratio of peripheral cardiovascular to central psychostimulant effect. Besides entering the brain, these substances also cross the placenta and enter breast milk. The plasma protein binding of pseudoephedrine has been reported to be approximately 21 to 29%. It is bound to α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and albumin (HSA). ==== Metabolism ==== Pseudoephedrine is not extensively metabolized and is subjected to minimal first-pass metabolism with oral administration. Due to its methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., it is an amphetamine), pseudoephedrine is not a substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. It is also not metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). Pseudoephedrine is demethylated into the metabolite norpseudoephedrine to a small extent. Similarly to pseudoephedrine, this metabolite is active and shows amphetamine-like effects. Approximately 1 to 6% of pseudoephedrine is metabolized in the liver via N-demethylation to form norpseudoephedrine. ==== Elimination ==== Pseudoephedrine is excreted primarily via the kidneys in urine. Its urinary excretion is highly influenced by urinary pH and is increased when the urine is acidic and is decreased when it is alkaline. The elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine on average is 5.4 hours and ranges from 3 to 16 hours depending on urinary pH. At a pH of 5.6 to 6.0, the elimination half-life of pseudoephedrine was 5.2 to 8.0 hours. In one study, a more acidic pH of 5.0 resulted in a half-life of 3.0 to 6.4 hours, whereas a more alkaline pH of 8.0 resulted in a half-life of 9.2 to 16.0 hours. Substances that influence urinary acidity and are known to affect the excretion of amphetamine derivatives include urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride as well as urinary alkalinizing agents like acetazolamide. A majority of an oral dose of pseudoephedrine is excreted unchanged in urine within 24 hours of administration. This has been found to range from 43 to 96%. The amount excreted unchanged is dependent on urinary pH similarly to the drug's half-life, as a longer half-life and duration in the body allows more time for the drug to be metabolized. The duration of action of pseudoephedrine, which is dependent on its elimination, is 4 to 12 hours. Pseudoephedrine has been reported to accumulate in people with renal impairment. == Chemistry == Pseudoephedrine, also known structurally as (1S,2S)-α,N-dimethyl-β-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1S,2S)-N-methyl-β-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine, amphetamine, and β-hydroxyamphetamine derivative. It is a diastereomer of ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C10H15NO and a molecular weight of 165.23 g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.89, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to pseudoephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7). Pseudoephedrine is readily reduced into methamphetamine or oxidized into methcathinone. === Nomenclatures === The dextrorotary (+)- or d- enantiomer is (1S,2S)-pseudoephedrine, whereas the levorotating (−)- or l- form is (1R,2R)-pseudoephedrine. In the outdated D/L system (+)-pseudoephedrine is also referred to as L-pseudoephedrine and (−)-pseudoephedrine as D-pseudoephedrine (in the Fisher projection then the phenyl ring is drawn at bottom). Often the D/L system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine is wrongly named D-pseudoephedrine and the levorotary l-ephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly L-ephedrine. The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1S,2S)- respectively (1R,2R)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Synonyms for both are psi-ephedrine and threo-ephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of the (+)-form, when used as pharmaceutical substance. === Detection in body fluids === Pseudoephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor any possible performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Some commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50 to 300 μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500 to 3,000 μg/L in people with substance use disorder involving pseudoephedrine or poisoned patients, and 10 to 70 mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdose. == Manufacturing == Although pseudoephedrine occurs naturally as an alkaloid in certain plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the Ephedra species, also known as ma huang, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose in the presence of benzaldehyde. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment, the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination. The bulk of pseudoephedrine is produced by commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers in India and China, where economic and industrial conditions favor its mass production for export. == History == Pseudoephedrine, along with ephedrine, occurs naturally in ephedra. This herb has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. Pseudoephedrine was first isolated and characterized in 1889 by the German chemists Ladenburg and Oelschlägel, who used a sample that had been isolated from Ephedra vulgaris by the Merck pharmaceutical corporation of Darmstadt, Germany. It was first synthesized in the 1920s in Japan. Subsequently, pseudoephedrine was introduced for medical use as a decongestant. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Pseudoephedrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while pseudoéphédrine is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and pseudoefedrina is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt; pseudoephedrine sulfate is its USAN in the case of the sulfate salt; pseudoephedrine polistirex its USAN in the case of the polistirex form; and d-isoephedrine sulfate is its JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name in the case of the sulfate salt. Pseudoephedrine is also known as Ψ-ephedrine and isoephedrine. === Brand names === The following is a list of consumer medicines that either contain pseudoephedrine or have switched to a less-regulated alternative such as phenylephrine.

There is a case report of self-medication with pseudoephedrine in massive doses for treatment of depression. === Use in exercise and sports === Pseudoephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports due to its sympathomimetic and stimulant effects. Because of these effects, pseudoephedrine can increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, improve mental energy, and reduce fatigue, among other performance-enhancing effects. A 2015 systematic review found that pseudoephedrine lacked performance-enhancing effects at therapeutic doses (60–120 mg) but significantly enhanced athletic performance at supratherapeutic doses (≥180 mg). A subsequent 2018 meta-analysis, which included seven additional studies, found that pseudoephedrine had a small positive effect on heart rate (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = 0.43) but insignificant effects on time trials, perceived exertion ratings, blood glucose levels, and blood lactate levels. However, subgroup analyses revealed that effect sizes were larger for heart rate increases and quicker time trials in well-trained athletes and younger participants, for shorter exercise sessions with pseudoephedrine administered within 90 minutes beforehand, and with higher doses of pseudoephedrine. A dose–response relationship was established, with larger doses (>170 mg) showing greater increases in heart rate and faster time trials than with smaller doses (≤170 mg) (SMD = 0.85 for heart rate and SMD = -0.24 for time trials, respectively). In any case, the meta-analysis concluded that the performance-enhancing effects of pseudoephedrine were marginal to small and likely to be lower in magnitude than with caffeine. It is relevant in this regard that caffeine is a permitted stimulant in competitive sports. Pseudoephedrine was on the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) banned substances list until 2004 when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list replaced the IOC list. Although WADA initially only monitored pseudoephedrine, it went back onto the ""banned"" list on 1 January 2010. Pseudoephedrine is excreted through urine, and the concentration in urine of this drug shows a large inter-individual spread; that is, the same dose can give a vast difference in urine concentration for different individuals. Pseudoephedrine is approved to be taken up to 240 mg per day. In seven healthy male subjects, this dose yielded a urine concentration range of 62.8 to 294.4 microgram per milliliter (μg/mL) with mean ± standard deviation 149 ± 72 μg/mL. Thus, normal dosage of 240 mg pseudoephedrine per day can result in urine concentration levels exceeding the limit of 150 μg/mL set by WADA for about half of all users. Furthermore, hydration status does not affect the urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine. ==== List of doping cases ==== Canadian rower Silken Laumann was stripped of her 1995 Pan American Games team gold medal after testing positive for pseudoephedrine. In February 2000, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won gold at the 2000 European Figure Skating Championships but were stripped of their medals after Berezhnaya tested positive. This resulted in a three-month disqualification from the date of the test, and the medal being stripped. She stated that she had taken cold medication approved by a doctor but had failed to inform the ISU as required. The pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification. Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan was stripped of her gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games after testing positive. She took two pills given to her by the team coach for a cold. Although she was stripped of the overall gold medal, she kept her other medals, and, unlike in most other doping cases, was not banned from competing again; only the team doctor was banned for a number of years. Ion Țiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, resigned over the scandal. In the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, the IOC issued a reprimand against the Slovak ice hockey player Lubomir Visnovsky for usage of pseudoephedrine. In the 2014 Winter Olympic Games Team Sweden and Washington Capitals ice hockey player Nicklas Bäckström was prevented from playing in the final for usage of pseudoephedrine. Bäckström claimed he was using it as allergy medication. In March 2014, the IOC Disciplinary Commission decided that Bäckström would be awarded the silver medal. In January 2015 Bäckström, the IOC, WADA and the IIHF agreed to a settlement in which he accepted a reprimand but was cleared of attempting to enhance his performance. === Manufacture of amphetamines === Its membership in the amphetamine class has made pseudoephedrine a sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine and methcathinone. As a result of the increasing regulatory restrictions on the sale and distribution of pseudoephedrine, pharmaceutical firms have reformulated medications to use alternative compounds, particularly phenylephrine, even though its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from placebo. In the United States, federal laws control the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Retailers in the US have created corporate policies restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. Their policies restrict sales by limiting purchase quantities and requiring a minimum age and government issued photographic identification. These requirements are similar to and sometimes more stringent than existing law. Internationally, pseudoephedrine is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. === Legal status === ==== Australia ==== Illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine in Australia has caused significant changes to the way the products are regulated. As of 2006, all products containing pseudoephedrine have been rescheduled as either ""Pharmacist Only Medicines"" (Schedule 3) or ""Prescription Only Medicines"" (Schedule 4), depending on the amount of pseudoephedrine in the product. A Pharmacist Only Medicine may only be sold to the public if a pharmacist is directly involved in the transaction. These medicines must be kept behind the counter, away from public access. Pharmacists are also encouraged (and in some states required) to log purchases with the online database Project STOP. As a result, some pharmacies no longer stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a phenylephrine product that has not been proven effective in clinical trials. ==== Belgium ==== Until 2024, several formulations of pseudoephedrine were available over-the-counter in Belgium. However, new legislation came into effect in November 2024, banning the over-the-counter sale of all medicines containing pseudoephedrine. ==== Canada ==== Health Canada has investigated the risks and benefits of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine/Ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may have strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephedrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine. Products whose only medicinal ingredient is pseudoephedrine must be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing pseudoephedrine along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present. ==== Colombia ==== The Colombian government prohibited the trade of pseudoephedrine in 2010. ==== Estonia ==== Pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter drug in Estonia. ==== Finland ==== Pseudoephedrine medicines can only be obtained with a prescription in Finland. ==== France ==== Pseudoephedrine-containing combination products are available over the counter from pharmacies, most commonly with Paracetamol under the brand name ""Dolihrume"". Products combining pseudoephedrine and ibuprofen or certain antihistamines are also available. However, products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not sold. In October 2023, the French health department officially warned against the usage of pseudoephedrine for patients with a cold. It also suggested the substance's availability could be restricted in the future, pending its pharmaceutical re-evaluation on EU level. In December 2024, the government announced pseudoephedrine medicines would henceforth only be obtainable with a prescription. ==== Germany ==== Various pseudoephedrine-containing products in combination with ibuprofen, aspirin, or antihistamines can be obtained without a prescription upon request at a pharmacy. Common names include Aspirin Complex, Reactine Duo, and RhinoPront. Products containing pseudoephedrine as a single ingredient are not available. ==== Japan ==== Medications that contain more than 10% pseudoephedrine are prohibited under the Stimulants Control Law in Japan. ==== Mexico ==== On 23 November 2007, the use and trade of pseudoephedrine in Mexico was made illegal as it was argued that it was extremely popular as a precursor in the synthesis of methamphetamine. ==== Netherlands ==== Pseudoephedrine was withdrawn from sale in 1989 due to concerns about adverse cardiac side effects. ==== New Zealand ==== Since April 2024, pseudoephedrine has been classified as a restricted (pharmacist-only) drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 which allows the purchase of medicines containing pseudoephedrine from a pharmacist without a prescription. Pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and any product containing these substances, e.g. cold and flu medicines, were first classified in October 2004 as Class C Part III (partially exempted) controlled drugs, due to being the principal ingredient in methamphetamine. New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold and flu tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011. On 24 November 2023, the recently formed National-led coalition government announced that the sale of cold medication containing pseudoephedrine would be allowed (as part of the coalition agreement between the National and ACT parties). ==== Switzerland ==== Pseudoephedrine is available without a prescription in combination (with aspirin) under the brand name ""Aspirin Complex"". There is also a preparation consisting of a single ingredient 120 mg extended-release tablet that can be obtained at pharmacies with a prescription or after consultation with a pharmacist. ==== Turkey ==== In Turkey, medications containing pseudoephedrine are available by prescription only. ==== United Kingdom ==== In the UK, pseudoephedrine is available over the counter under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the MHRA reacted to concerns over the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over-the-counter sales to one box containing no more than 720 mg of pseudoephedrine in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008. No form of ID is required. ==== United States ==== ===== Federal ===== The United States Congress has recognized that pseudoephedrine is used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. In 2005, the Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony concerning education programs and state legislation designed to curb this illegal practice. Attempts to control the sale of the drug date back to 1986, when federal officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator Bob Dole, that would have placed several chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed. Before the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became increasingly regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in its attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did the number of people in rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. This reduction in purity was usually short-lived, however, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations. Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) as an amendment to the renewal of the USA Patriot Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on 6 March 2006, the act amended 21 U.S.C. § 830, concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by 8 April 2006, and the second to be completed by 30 September 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on the amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping. Though the law was mainly directed at pseudoephedrine products it also applies to all over-the-counter products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, their salts, optical isomers, and salts of optical isomers. Pseudoephedrine was defined as a ""scheduled listed chemical product"" under 21 U.S.C. § 802(45(A)). The act included the following requirements for merchants (""regulated sellers"") who sell such products: Required a retrievable record of all purchases, identifying the name and address of each party, to be kept for two years Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information Required reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products Required training of employees with regard to the requirements of the CMEA. Retailers must self-certify as to training and compliance. The non-liquid dose form of regulated products may only be sold in unit dose blister packs Regulated products must be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict public access Sales limits (per customer): Daily sales limit—must not exceed 3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine base without regard to the number of transactions 30-day (not monthly) sales limit—must not exceed 7.5 grams of pseudoephedrine base if sold by mail order or ""mobile retail vendor"" 30-day purchase limit—must not exceed 9 grams of pseudoephedrine base. (A misdemeanor possession offense under 21 U.S.C. § 844a for the person who buys it.) The requirements were revised in the Methamphetamine Production Prevention Act of 2008 to require that a regulated seller of scheduled listed chemical products may not sell such a product unless the purchaser: Presents a government-issued photographic identification; and Signs the written logbook with name, address, and time and date of the sale ===== State ===== Most states also have laws regulating pseudoephedrine. The states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii (as of May 1, 2009) Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana (as of August 15, 2009), Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have laws requiring pharmacies to sell pseudoephedrine ""behind the counter"". Though the drug can be purchased without a prescription, states can limit the number of units sold and can collect personal information from purchasers. The states of Oregon and Mississippi previously required a prescription for the purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine. However, as of 1 January 2022, these restrictions have been repealed. The state of Oregon reduced the number of methamphetamine lab seizures from 448 in 2004 (the final full year before implementation of the prescription only law) to a new low of 13 in 2009. The decrease in meth lab incidents in Oregon occurred largely before the prescription-only law took effect, according to a NAMSDL report titled Pseudoephedrine Prescription Laws in Oregon and Mississippi. The report posits that the decline in meth lab incidents in both states may be due to other factors: ""Mexican traffickers may have contributed to the decline in meth labs in Mississippi and Oregon (and surrounding states) as they were able to provide ample supply of equal or greater quality meth at competitive prices"". Additionally, similar decreases in meth lab incidents were seen in surrounding states, according to the report, and meth-related deaths in Oregon have dramatically risen since 2007. Some municipalities in Missouri have enacted similar ordinances, including Washington, Union, New Haven, Cape Girardeau and Ozark. Certain pharmacies in Terre Haute, Indiana do so as well. Another approach to controlling the drug on the state level mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of electronic tracking systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. Thirty-two states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Before the implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004 but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009. Kentucky's program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased. Oklahoma initially experienced success with its tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. In 2008, however, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009. NPLEx appears to be successful by requiring the real-time submission of transactions, thereby enabling the relevant laws to be enforced at the point of sale. By creating a multi-state database and the ability to compare all transactions quickly, NPLEx enables pharmacies to deny purchases that would be illegal based on gram limits, age, or even to convicted meth offenders in some states. NPLEx also enforces the federal gram limits across state lines, which was impossible with state-operated systems. Access to the records is by law enforcement agencies only, through an online secure portal. == Research == Pseudoephedrine has been studied in the treatment of snoring. However, data are inadequate to support this use. A study has found that pseudoephedrine can reduce milk production in breastfeeding women. This might have been due to suppression of prolactin secretion. Pseudoephedrine might be useful for lactation suppression. == References ==",Sudafed,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.47413957118988037), (' FOOD', -0.004604811314493418)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.521823135903105e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06197332963347435)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.sudafed.com/know-your-congestion/what-is-pseudoephedrine,https://www.sudafed.com/regulations,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682619.html ', [])"
4304,"('Ephedrine', 'Ephedrin', 'Ephedrol', 'Mandrin', 'Sanedrine')",Medical,"Ephedrine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and sympathomimetic agent that is often used to prevent low blood pressure during anesthesia. It has also been used for asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity but is not the preferred treatment. It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin. Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20 minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect. When given by injection, it lasts about an hour, and when taken by mouth, it can last up to four hours. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, anxiety, headache, hallucinations, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, loss of appetite, and urinary retention. Serious side effects include stroke and heart attack. While probably safe in pregnancy, its use in this population is poorly studied. Use during breastfeeding is not recommended. Ephedrine works by inducing the release of norepinephrine and hence indirectly activating the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Chemically, ephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is the (1R,2S)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine. Ephedrine was first isolated in 1885 and came into commercial use in 1926. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It can normally be found in plants of the Ephedra genus. Over-the-counter dietary supplements containing ephedrine are illegal in the United States, with the exception of those used in traditional Chinese medicine, where its presence is noted by má huáng. == Medical uses == Ephedrine is a non-catecholamine sympathomimetic with cardiovascular effects similar to those of adrenaline (epinephrine): increased blood pressure, heart rate, and contractility. Like pseudoephedrine, it is a bronchodilator, with pseudoephedrine having considerably less effect. Ephedrine may decrease motion sickness, but it has mainly been used to decrease the sedating effects of other medications used for motion sickness. Ephedrine is also found to have quick and long-lasting responsiveness in congenital myasthenic syndrome in early childhood and also even in adults with a novel COLQ mutation. Ephedrine is administered by intravenous boluses. Redosing usually requires increased doses to offset the development of tachyphylaxis, which is attributed to the depletion of catecholamine stores. === Weight loss === Ephedrine promotes modest short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss, but its long-term effects are unknown. In mice, ephedrine is known to stimulate thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue, but because adult humans have only small amounts of brown fat, thermogenesis is assumed to take place mostly in the skeletal muscle. Ephedrine also decreases gastric emptying. Methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline have a synergistic effect with ephedrine for weight loss. This led to the creation and marketing of compound products. One of them, known as the ECA stack, contains ephedrine with caffeine and aspirin. It is a popular supplement taken by bodybuilders seeking to cut body fat before a competition. A 2021 systematic review found that ephedrine led to a 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) weight loss greater than placebo, raised heart rate, and reduced LDL and raised HDL, with no statistically significant difference in blood pressure. === Available forms === Ephedrine is available as a prescription-only pharmaceutical drug in the form of an intravenous solution, under brand names including Akovaz, Corphedra, Emerphed, and Rezipres as well as in generic forms, in the United States. It is also available over-the-counter in the form of 12.5 and 25 mg oral tablets for use as a bronchodilator and as a 0.5% concentration nasal spray for use as a decongestant. The drug is additionally available in combination with guaifenesin in the form of oral tablets and liquids. Ephedrine is provided as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt in pharmaceutical formulations. == Contraindications == Ephedrine should not be used in conjunction with certain antidepressants, namely norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), as this increases the risk of symptoms due to excessive serum levels of norepinephrine. Bupropion is an example of an antidepressant with an amphetamine-like structure similar to ephedrine, and it is an NDRI. Its action bears more resemblance to amphetamine than to fluoxetine in that its primary mode of therapeutic action involves norepinephrine and to a lesser degree dopamine, but it also releases some serotonin from presynaptic clefts. It should not be used with ephedrine, as it may increase the likelihood of side effects. Ephedrine should be used with caution in patients with inadequate fluid replacement, impaired adrenal function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, during delivery if maternal blood pressure is >130/80 mmHg, and during lactation. Contraindications for the use of ephedrine include: closed-angle glaucoma, phaeochromocytoma, asymmetric septal hypertrophy (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, general anesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbons (particularly halothane), tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation, or hypersensitivity to ephedrine or other stimulants. Ephedrine should not be used at any time during pregnancy unless specifically indicated by a qualified physician and only when other options are unavailable. == Side effects == Ephedrine is a potentially dangerous natural compound; as of 2004 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had received over 18,000 reports of adverse effects in people using it. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are more common with systemic administration (e.g. injection or oral administration) compared to topical administration (e.g. nasal instillations). ADRs associated with ephedrine therapy include Cardiovascular: tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, vasoconstriction with hypertension Dermatological: flushing, sweating, acne vulgaris Gastrointestinal: nausea Genitourinary: decreased urination due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries, difficulty urinating is not uncommon, as alpha-agonists such as ephedrine constrict the internal urethral sphincter, mimicking the effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation Nervous system: restlessness, confusion, insomnia, mild euphoria, mania/hallucinations (rare except in previously existing psychiatric conditions), delusions, formication (may be possible, but lacks documented evidence) paranoia, hostility, panic, agitation Respiratory: dyspnea, pulmonary edema Miscellaneous: dizziness, headache, tremor, hyperglycemic reactions, dry mouth == Overdose == Overdose of ephedrine may result in sympathomimetic symptoms like tachycardia and hypertension. == Interactions == Ephedrine with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine and tranylcypromine can result in hypertensive crisis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts on part of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The principal mechanism of action relies on its indirect stimulation of the adrenergic receptor system by increasing activation of α- and β-adrenergic receptors via induction of norepinephrine release. The presence of direct interactions with α-adrenergic receptors is unlikely but still controversial. L-ephedrine, and particularly its stereoisomer norpseudoephedrine (which is also present in Catha edulis) has indirect sympathomimetic effects and due to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, it is a CNS stimulant similar to amphetamines, but less pronounced, as it releases norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of ephedrine is 88%. The onset of action of ephedrine orally is 15 to 60 minutes, via intramuscular injection is 10 to 20 minutes, and via intravenous infusion is within seconds. ==== Distribution ==== Its plasma protein binding is approximately 24 to 29%, with 5 to 10% bound to albumin. ==== Metabolism ==== Ephedrine is largely not metabolized. Norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) is an active metabolite of ephedrine formed via N-demethylation. About 8 to 20% of an oral dose of ephedrine is demethylated into norephedrine, about 4 to 13% is oxidatively deaminated into benzoic acid, and a small fraction is converted into 1,2-dihydroxy-1-phenylpropane. ==== Elimination ==== Ephedrine is eliminated mainly in urine, with 60% (range 53–79%) excreted unchanged. The elimination half-life of ephedrine is 6 hours. Its duration of action orally is 2 to 4 hours and via intravenous or intramuscular injection is 60 minutes. The elimination of ephedrine is dependent on urinary pH. == Chemistry == Ephedrine, or (−)-(1R,2S)-ephedrine, also known as (1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N-methyl-α-methyl-β-phenethylamine or as (1R,2S)-β-hydroxy-N-methylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is similar in chemical structure to phenylpropanolamine, methamphetamine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). It differs from methamphetamine only by the presence of a hydroxyl group (–OH). Chemically, ephedrine is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt. It has an experimental log P of 1.13, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to ephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of pseudoephedrine is 0.89, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7). Ephedrine hydrochloride has a melting point of 187−188 °C. The racemic form of ephedrine is racephedrine ((±)-ephedrine; dl-ephedrine; (1RS,2SR)-ephedrine). A stereoisomer of ephedrine is pseudoephedrine. Derivatives of ephedrine include methylephedrine (N-methylephedrine), etafedrine (N-ethylephedrine), cinnamedrine (N-cinnamylephedrine), and oxilofrine (4-hydroxyephedrine). Analogues of ephedrine include phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) and metaraminol (3-hydroxynorephedrine). The presence of an N-methyl group decreases binding affinities at α-adrenergic receptors, compared with norephedrine. Ephedrine, though, binds better than N-methylephedrine, which has an additional methyl group at the nitrogen atom. Also, the steric orientation of the hydroxyl group is important for receptor binding and functional activity. === Nomenclature === Ephedrine exhibits optical isomerism and has two chiral centres, giving rise to four stereoisomers. By convention, the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1R,2S) and (1S,2R) is designated ephedrine, while the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1R,2R) and (1S,2S) is called pseudoephedrine. The isomer which is marketed is (−)-(1R,2S)-ephedrine. In the outdated D/L system (+)-ephedrine is also referred to as D-ephedrine and (−)-ephedrine as L-ephedrine (in which case, in the Fisher projection, the phenyl ring is drawn at the bottom). Often, the D/L system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the levorotary l-ephedrine is wrongly named L-ephedrine and the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly D-pseudoephedrine. The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1R,2S)- respectively (1S,2R)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. A synonym is erythro-ephedrine. === Detection in body fluids === Ephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor possible abuse by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with ephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish ephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma ephedrine concentrations are typically in the 20–200 μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 300–3000 μg/L in abusers or poisoned patients, and 3–20 mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdosage. The current World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) limit for ephedrine in an athlete's urine is 10 μg/mL. == History == === Asia === Ephedrine in its natural form, known as máhuáng (麻黄) in traditional Chinese medicine, has been documented in China since the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. In traditional Chinese medicine, máhuáng has been used as a treatment for asthma and bronchitis for centuries. In 1885, the chemical synthesis of ephedrine was first accomplished by Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi based on his research on traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines. The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports from China to the West grew from 4 to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928. === Western medicine === Ephedrine was first introduced for medical use in the United States in 1926. It was introduced in 1948 in Vicks Vatronol nose drops (now discontinued) which contained ephedrine sulfate as the active ingredient for rapid nasal decongestion. == Society and culture == === Names === Ephedrine is the generic name of the drug and its BANTooltip British Approved Name. Its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française is ephédrine while its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana is efedrina. In the case of the hydrochloride salt, its generic name is ephedrine hydrochloride and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. In the case of the sulfate salt, its generic name is ephedrine sulfate or ephedrine sulphate and the former is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name while the latter is its BANMTooltip British Approved Name. A synonym of ephedrine sulfate is isofedrol. These names all refer to the (1R,2R)-enantiomer of ephedrine. The racemic form of ephedrine is known as racephedrine and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while the hydrochloride salt of the racemic form is racephedrine hydrochloride and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. === Recreational use === As a phenethylamine, ephedrine has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analog having the methamphetamine structure with a hydroxyl group at the β position. Because of ephedrine's structural similarity to methamphetamine, it can be used to create methamphetamine using chemical reduction in which ephedrine's hydroxyl group is removed; this has made ephedrine a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. The most popular method for reducing ephedrine to methamphetamine is similar to the Birch reduction, in that it uses anhydrous ammonia and lithium metal in the reaction. The second-most popular method uses red phosphorus and iodine in the reaction with ephedrine. Moreover, ephedrine can be synthesized into methcathinone via simple oxidation. As such, ephedrine is listed as a table-I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. === Use in exercise and sports === Ephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports. It can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility as well as act as a psychostimulant. Ephedrine is often used in combination with caffeine for performance-enhancing purposes. === Other uses === In chemical synthesis, ephedrine is used in bulk quantities as a chiral auxiliary group. In saquinavir synthesis, the half-acid is resolved as its salt with l-ephedrine. === Legal status === ==== Canada ==== In January 2002, Health Canada issued a voluntary recall of all ephedrine products containing more than 8 mg per dose, all combinations of ephedrine with other stimulants such as caffeine, and all ephedrine products marketed for weight-loss or bodybuilding indications, citing a serious risk to health. Ephedrine is still sold as an oral nasal decongestant in 8 mg pills as a natural health product, with a limit of 0.4 g (400 mg) per package, the limit established by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as it is considered as Class A Precursor. ==== United States ==== In 1997, the FDA proposed a regulation on ephedra (the herb from which ephedrine is obtained), which limited an ephedra dose to 8 mg (of active ephedrine) with no more than 24 mg per day. This proposed rule was withdrawn, in part, in 2000 because of ""concerns regarding the agency's basis for proposing a certain dietary ingredient level and a duration of use limit for these products."" In 2004, the FDA created a ban on ephedrine alkaloids marketed for reasons other than asthma, colds, allergies, other disease, or traditional Asian use. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah ruled the FDA did not have proper evidence that low dosages of ephedrine alkaloids are actually unsafe, but on August 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver upheld the FDA's final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated, and therefore illegal for marketing in the United States. Furthermore, ephedrine is banned by the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and PGA. Ephedrine is, however, still legal in many applications outside of dietary supplements. Purchasing is currently limited and monitored, with specifics varying from state to state. The House passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 as an amendment to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on March 6, 2006, the act amended the US Code (21 USC 830) concerning the sale of products containing ephedrine and the closely related drug pseudoephedrine. Both substances are used as precursors in the illicit production of methamphetamine, and to discourage that use the federal statute included the following requirements for merchants who sell these products: A retrievable record of all purchases identifying the name and address of each party to be kept for two years Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information Reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products Non-liquid dose form of regulated product may only be sold in unit-dose blister packs Regulated products are to be sold behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict access Daily sales of regulated products not to exceed 3.6 g to a single purchaser, without regard to the number of transactions Monthly sales to a single purchaser not to exceed 9 g of pseudoephedrine base in regulated products The law gives similar regulations to mail-order purchases, except the monthly sales limit is 7.5 g. As a pure herb or tea, má huáng, containing ephedrine, is still sold legally in the US. The law restricts/prohibits its being sold as a dietary supplement (pill) or as an ingredient/additive to other products, like diet pills. ==== Australia ==== Ephedrine and all Ephedra species that contain it are considered Schedule 4 substances under the Poisons Standard. A Schedule 4 drug is considered a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription under the Poisons Standard. ==== South Africa ==== In South Africa, ephedrine was moved to schedule 6 on 27 May 2008, which makes pure ephedrine tablets prescription only. Pills containing ephedrine up to 30 mg per tablet in combination with other medications are still available OTC, schedule 1 and 2, for sinus, head colds, and influenza. ==== Germany ==== Ephedrine was freely available in pharmacies in Germany until 2001. Afterward, access was restricted since it was mostly bought for unindicated uses. Similarly, ephedra can only be bought with a prescription. Since April 2006, all products, including plant parts, that contain ephedrine are only available with a prescription. == Sources == === Agricultural === Ephedrine is obtained from the plant Ephedra sinica and other members of the genus Ephedra, from which the name of the substance is derived. Raw materials for the manufacture of ephedrine and traditional Chinese medicines are produced in China on a large scale. As of 2007, companies produced for export US$13 million worth of ephedrine from 30,000 tons of ephedra annually, or about ten times the amount used in traditional Chinese medicine. === Synthetic === Most of the l-ephedrine produced today for official medical use is made synthetically as the extraction and isolation process from E. sinica is tedious and no longer cost-effective. === Biosynthetic === Ephedrine was long thought to come from modifying the amino acid L-phenylalanine. L-Phenylalanine would be decarboxylated and subsequently attacked with ω-aminoacetophenone. Methylation of this product would then produce ephedrine. This pathway has since been disproven. A new pathway proposed suggests that phenylalanine first forms cinnamoyl-CoA via the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and acyl CoA ligase. The cinnamoyl-CoA is then reacted with a hydratase to attach the alcohol functional group. The product is then reacted with a retro-aldolase, forming benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde reacts with pyruvic acid to attach a 2-carbon unit. This product then undergoes transamination and methylation to form ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine. == References == == External links ==",Ephedrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -5.228561349213123e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.03806169703602791), (' FOOD', -0.02429027296602726)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -6.639736966462806e-05), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.2519564628601074), ('ĠEND', -0.6354569792747498), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.576029896736145), ('ĠFOOD', -0.21184800565242767), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10044531524181366)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.001170225441455841), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.029753148555755615), (' FOOD', -2.999452772201039e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://www.britannica.com/science/ephedrine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine,https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/health-and-medicine/ephedrine ', [])"
4305,"('Betaine', 'Glycine betaine', 'Oxyneurine', 'Lycine', 'Trimethylglycine')","Endogenous, Medical","Trimethylglycine is an amino acid derivative with the formula (CH3)3N+CH2CO−2. A colorless, water-soluble solid, it occurs in plants. Trimethylglycine is a zwitterion: the molecule contains both a quaternary ammonium group and a carboxylate group. Trimethylglycine was the first betaine discovered; originally it was simply called betaine because it was discovered in sugar beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris). Several other betaines are now known. == Medical uses == Betaine, sold under the brand name Cystadane is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of homocystinuria, involving deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), or cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl). The most common side effect is elevated levels of methionine in the blood. The EU has authorized the health claim that betaine ""contributes to normal homocysteine metabolism."". == Biological function == === Biosynthesis === In most organisms, glycine betaine is biosynthesized by oxidation of choline. The intermediate, betaine aldehyde, is generated by the action of the enzyme mitochondrial choline oxidase (choline dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.99.1). In mice, betaine aldehyde is further oxidised in the mitochondria by the enzyme betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8). In humans betaine aldehyde activity is performed by a nonspecific cystosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme (EC 1.2.1.3) Trimethylglycine is produced by some cyanobacteria, as established by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. It is proposed to protect for some enzymes, against inhibition by NaCl and KCl. ==== Osmolyte ==== Trimethylglycine is an osmolyte, a water-soluble salt-like substance. Sugar beet was cultivated from sea beet, which requires osmolytes in order to survive the salty soils of coastal areas. Trimethylglycine also occurs in high concentrations (~10 mM) in many marine invertebrates, such as crustaceans and molluscs. It serves as a appetitive attractant to generalist carnivores such as the predatory sea slug Pleurobranchaea californica. ==== Methyl donor ==== Trimethylglycine is a cofactor in methylation, a process that occurs in all mammals. These processes include the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. Methylation is also required for the biosynthesis of melatonin and the electron transport chain constituent coenzyme Q10, as well as the methylation of DNA for epigenetics. One step in the methylation cycle is the remethylation of homocysteine, a compound which is naturally generated during demethylation of the essential amino acid methionine. Despite its natural formation, homocysteine has been linked to inflammation, depression, specific forms of dementia, and various types of vascular disease. The remethylation process that detoxifies homocysteine and converts it back to methionine can occur via either of two pathways. The pathway present in virtually all cells involves the enzyme methionine synthase (MS), which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor, and also depends indirectly on folate and other B vitamins. The second pathway (restricted to liver and kidney in most mammals) involves betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and requires trimethylglycine as a cofactor. During normal physiological conditions, the two pathways contribute equally to removal of homocysteine in the body. Further degradation of betaine, via the enzyme dimethylglycine dehydrogenase produces folate, thus contributing back to methionine synthase. Betaine is thus involved in the synthesis of many biologically important molecules, and may be even more important in situations where the major pathway for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine has been compromised by genetic polymorphisms such as mutations in the MS gene. == Agriculture and aquaculture == Trimethylglycine is used as a supplement for both animals and plants. Processing sucrose from sugar beets yields glycine betaine as a byproduct. The economic significance of trimethylglycine is comparable to that of sugar in sugar beets. Salmon farms apply trimethylglycine to relieve the osmotic pressure on the fishes' cells when workers transfer the fish from freshwater to saltwater. Trimethylglycine supplementation decreases the amount of adipose tissue in pigs; however, research in human subjects has shown no effect on body weight, body composition, or resting energy expenditure. == Nutrition == Nutritionally, betaine is not needed when sufficient dietary choline is present for synthesis. When insufficient betaine is available, elevated homocysteine levels and decreased SAM levels in blood occur. Supplementation of betaine in this situation would resolve these blood marker issues, but not compensate for other functions of choline. === Dietary supplement === Trimethylglycine supplementation decreases the amount of adipose tissue in pigs, and new research on human subjects has shown a statistically significant effect on body fat reduction when used in conjunction with a low calorie diet. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved betaine trimethylglycine (also known by the brand name Cystadane) for the treatment of homocystinuria, a disease caused by abnormally high homocysteine levels at birth. Trimethylglycine is also used as the hydrochloride salt (marketed as betaine hydrochloride or betaine HCl). Betaine hydrochloride was sold over-the-counter (OTC) as a purported gastric aid in the United States. US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Section 310.540, which became effective in November 1993, banned the marketing of betaine hydrochloride as a digestive aid due to insufficient evidence to classify it as ""generally recognized as safe and effective"" for that specified use. ==== Side effects ==== Trimethylglycine supplementation may cause diarrhea, bloating, cramps, dyspepsia, nausea or vomiting. Although rare, it can also causes excessive increases in serum methionine concentrations in the brain, which may lead to cerebral edema, a life-threatening condition. Trimethylglycine supplementation lowers homocysteine but also raises (given in high doses of 6g/day) LDL-cholesterol in obese individuals and renal patients. == References == == External links == USDA Database for the Choline Content of Common Foods – including the data on choline metabolites, such as betaine, in 434 food items.",Trimethylglycine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.059139542281627655), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.20145924389362335), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.4868770196917467e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -7.941850526549388e-06), (' FOOD', -1.0280383548888494e-06), (',', -0.3870062232017517), (' INDUSTR', -0.20147201418876648), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.04543665051460266), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -1.4543427823809907e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.07922404259443283), (',', -0.07891926914453506), ('ĠEND', -0.20268654823303223), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02976326085627079)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.07889155298471451), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -6.2729995988775045e-06)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD;  ', [])"
4306,"('Amfetamine', 'Amphetamine', 'Desoxynorephedrine', 'Alpha-methylphenethylamine', 'Benzedrine')",Medical,"Amphetamine (contracted from alpha-methylphenethylamine) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity; it is also used to treat binge eating disorder in the form of its inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine was discovered as a chemical in 1887 by Lazăr Edeleanu, and then as a drug in the late 1920s. It exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers in their pure amine forms. The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use. The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine, a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, dextroamphetamine, or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems. At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time, fatigue resistance, decreased appetite, elevated heart rate, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects. Amphetamine belongs to the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, MDMA, and methamphetamine. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulators, specifically phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while N-methylphenethylamine is a positional isomer of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the methyl group. == Uses == === Medical === Amphetamine is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, obesity, and, in the form of lisdexamfetamine, binge eating disorder. It is sometimes prescribed off-label for its past medical indications, particularly for depression and chronic pain. ==== ADHD ==== Long-term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage, but, in humans with ADHD, long-term use of pharmaceutical amphetamines at therapeutic doses appears to improve brain development and nerve growth. Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia. Reviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long-term continuous amphetamine use for the treatment of ADHD. Randomized controlled trials of continuous stimulant therapy for the treatment of ADHD spanning 2 years have demonstrated treatment effectiveness and safety. Two reviews have indicated that long-term continuous stimulant therapy for ADHD is effective for reducing the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e., hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity), enhancing quality of life and academic achievement, and producing improvements in a large number of functional outcomes across 9 categories of outcomes related to academics, antisocial behavior, driving, non-medicinal drug use, obesity, occupation, self-esteem, service use (i.e., academic, occupational, health, financial, and legal services), and social function. Additionally, a 2024 meta-analytic systematic review reported moderate improvements in quality of life when amphetamine treatment is used for ADHD. One review highlighted a nine-month randomized controlled trial of amphetamine treatment for ADHD in children that found an average increase of 4.5 IQ points, continued increases in attention, and continued decreases in disruptive behaviors and hyperactivity. Another review indicated that, based upon the longest follow-up studies conducted to date, lifetime stimulant therapy that begins during childhood is continuously effective for controlling ADHD symptoms and reduces the risk of developing a substance use disorder as an adult. A 2025 meta-analytic systematic review of 113 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that stimulant medications significantly improved core ADHD symptoms in adults over a three-month period, with good acceptability compared to other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems; these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus to the prefrontal cortex. Stimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately 80% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. The Cochrane reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that short-term studies have demonstrated that these drugs decrease the severity of symptoms, but they have higher discontinuation rates than non-stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects. A Cochrane review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse, but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals. ==== Binge eating disorder ==== Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent and persistent episodes of compulsive binge eating. These episodes are often accompanied by marked distress and a feeling of loss of control over eating. The pathophysiology of BED is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve dysfunctional dopaminergic reward circuitry along the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical loop. As of July 2024, lisdexamfetamine is the only USFDA- and TGA-approved pharmacotherapy for BED. Evidence suggests that lisdexamfetamine's treatment efficacy in BED is underpinned at least in part by a psychopathological overlap between BED and ADHD, with the latter conceptualized as a cognitive control disorder that also benefits from treatment with lisdexamfetamine. Lisdexamfetamine's therapeutic effects for BED primarily involve direct action in the central nervous system after conversion to its pharmacologically active metabolite, dextroamphetamine. Centrally, dextroamphetamine increases neurotransmitter activity of dopamine and norepinephrine in prefrontal cortical regions that regulate cognitive control of behavior. Similar to its therapeutic effect in ADHD, dextroamphetamine enhances cognitive control and may reduce impulsivity in patients with BED by enhancing the cognitive processes responsible for overriding prepotent feeding responses that precede binge eating episodes. In addition, dextroamphetamine's actions outside of the central nervous system may also contribute to its treatment effects in BED. Peripherally, dextroamphetamine triggers lipolysis through noradrenergic signaling in adipose fat cells, leading to the release of triglycerides into blood plasma to be utilized as a fuel substrate. Dextroamphetamine also activates TAAR1 in peripheral organs along the gastrointestinal tract that are involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Together, these actions confer an anorexigenic effect that promotes satiety in response to feeding and may decrease binge eating as a secondary effect. While lisdexamfetamine's anorexigenic effects contribute to its efficacy in BED, evidence indicates that the enhancement of cognitive control is necessary and sufficient for addressing the disorder's underlying psychopathology. This view is supported by the failure of anti-obesity medications and other appetite suppressants to significantly reduce BED symptom severity, despite their capacity to induce weight loss. Medical reviews of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that lisdexamfetamine, at doses between 50–70 mg, is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults. These reviews suggest that lisdexamfetamine is persistently effective at treating BED and is associated with significant reductions in the number of binge eating days and binge eating episodes per week. Furthermore, a meta-analytic systematic review highlighted an open-label, 12-month extension safety and tolerability study that reported lisdexamfetamine remained effective at reducing the number of binge eating days for the duration of the study. In addition, both a review and a meta-analytic systematic review found lisdexamfetamine to be superior to placebo in several secondary outcome measures, including persistent binge eating cessation, reduction of obsessive-compulsive related binge eating symptoms, reduction of body-weight, and reduction of triglycerides. Lisdexamfetamine, like all pharmaceutical amphetamines, has direct appetite suppressant effects that may be therapeutically useful in both BED and its comorbidities. Based on reviews of neuroimaging studies involving BED-diagnosed participants, therapeautic neuroplasticity in dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways from long-term use of lisdexamfetamine may be implicated in lasting improvements in the regulation of eating behaviors that are observed. ==== Narcolepsy ==== Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep-wake disorder that is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis. Patients with narcolepsy are diagnosed as either type 1 or type 2, with only the former presenting cataplexy symptoms. Type 1 narcolepsy results from the loss of approximately 70,000 orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, leading to significantly reduced cerebrospinal orexin levels; this reduction is a diagnostic biomarker for type 1 narcolepsy. Lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons innervate every component of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which includes noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic nuclei that promote wakefulness. Amphetamine’s therapeutic mode of action in narcolepsy primarily involves increasing monoamine neurotransmitter activity in the ARAS. This includes noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Dextroamphetamine, the more dopaminergic enantiomer of amphetamine, is particularly effective at promoting wakefulness because dopamine release has the greatest influence on cortical activation and cognitive arousal, relative to other monoamines. In contrast, levoamphetamine may have a greater effect on cataplexy, a symptom more sensitive to the effects of norepinephrine and serotonin. Noradrenergic and serotonergic nuclei in the ARAS are involved in the regulation of the REM sleep cycle and function as ""REM-off"" cells, with amphetamine's effect on norepinephrine and serotonin contributing to the suppression of REM sleep and a possible reduction of cataplexy at high doses. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) 2021 clinical practice guideline conditionally recommends dextroamphetamine for the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy. Treatment with pharmaceutical amphetamines is generally less preferred relative to other stimulants (e.g., modafinil) and is considered a third-line treatment option. Medical reviews indicate that amphetamine is safe and effective for the treatment of narcolepsy. Amphetamine appears to be most effective at improving symptoms associated with hypersomnolence, with three reviews finding clinically significant reductions in daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. Additionally, these reviews suggest that amphetamine may dose-dependently improve cataplexy symptoms. However, the quality of evidence for these findings is low and is consequently reflected in the AASM's conditional recommendation for dextroamphetamine as a treatment option for narcolepsy. === Enhancing performance === ==== Cognitive performance ==== In 2015, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of high quality clinical trials found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, long-term episodic memory, inhibitory control, and some aspects of attention, in normal healthy adults; these cognition-enhancing effects of amphetamine are known to be partially mediated through the indirect activation of both dopamine D1 receptor and α2-adrenergic receptor in the prefrontal cortex. A systematic review from 2014 found that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation, in turn leading to improved recall of information. Therapeutic doses of amphetamine also enhance cortical network efficiency, an effect which mediates improvements in working memory in all individuals. Amphetamine and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increase arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior. Stimulants such as amphetamine can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid. Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, 5–35% of college students use diverted ADHD stimulants, which are primarily used for enhancement of academic performance rather than as recreational drugs. However, high amphetamine doses that are above the therapeutic range can interfere with working memory and other aspects of cognitive control. ==== Physical performance ==== Amphetamine is used by some athletes for its psychological and athletic performance-enhancing effects, such as increased endurance and alertness; however, non-medical amphetamine use is prohibited at sporting events that are regulated by collegiate, national, and international anti-doping agencies. In healthy people at oral therapeutic doses, amphetamine has been shown to increase muscle strength, acceleration, athletic performance in anaerobic conditions, and endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of fatigue), while improving reaction time. Amphetamine improves endurance and reaction time primarily through reuptake inhibition and release of dopamine in the central nervous system. Amphetamine and other dopaminergic drugs also increase power output at fixed levels of perceived exertion by overriding a ""safety switch"", allowing the core temperature limit to increase in order to access a reserve capacity that is normally off-limits. At therapeutic doses, the adverse effects of amphetamine do not impede athletic performance; however, at much higher doses, amphetamine can induce effects that severely impair performance, such as rapid muscle breakdown and elevated body temperature. === Recreational === Amphetamine, specifically the more dopaminergic dextrorotatory enantiomer (dextroamphetamine), is also used recreationally as a euphoriant and aphrodisiac, and like other amphetamines; is used as a club drug for its energetic and euphoric high. Dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine) is considered to have a high potential for misuse in a recreational manner since individuals typically report feeling euphoric, more alert, and more energetic after taking the drug. A notable part of the 1960s mod subculture in the UK was recreational amphetamine use, which was used to fuel all-night dances at clubs like Manchester's Twisted Wheel. Newspaper reports described dancers emerging from clubs at 5 a.m. with dilated pupils. Mods used the drug for stimulation and alertness, which they viewed as different from the intoxication caused by alcohol and other drugs. Dr. Andrew Wilson argues that for a significant minority, ""amphetamines symbolised the smart, on-the-ball, cool image"" and that they sought ""stimulation not intoxication [...] greater awareness, not escape"" and ""confidence and articulacy"" rather than the ""drunken rowdiness of previous generations."" Dextroamphetamine's dopaminergic (rewarding) properties affect the mesocorticolimbic circuit; a group of neural structures responsible for incentive salience (i.e., ""wanting""; desire or craving for a reward and motivation), positive reinforcement and positively-valenced emotions, particularly ones involving pleasure. Large recreational doses of dextroamphetamine may produce symptoms of dextroamphetamine overdose. Recreational users sometimes open dexedrine capsules and crush the contents in order to insufflate (snort) it or subsequently dissolve it in water and inject it. Immediate-release formulations have higher potential for abuse via insufflation (snorting) or intravenous injection due to a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile and easy crushability (especially tablets). Injection into the bloodstream can be dangerous because insoluble fillers within the tablets can block small blood vessels. Chronic overuse of dextroamphetamine can lead to severe drug dependence, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when drug use stops. == Contraindications == According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), amphetamine is contraindicated in people with a history of drug abuse, cardiovascular disease, severe agitation, or severe anxiety. It is also contraindicated in individuals with advanced arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), glaucoma (increased eye pressure), hyperthyroidism (excessive production of thyroid hormone), or moderate to severe hypertension. These agencies indicate that people who have experienced allergic reactions to other stimulants or who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) should not take amphetamine, although safe concurrent use of amphetamine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been documented. These agencies also state that anyone with anorexia nervosa, bipolar disorder, depression, hypertension, liver or kidney problems, mania, psychosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, seizures, thyroid problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome should monitor their symptoms while taking amphetamine. Evidence from human studies indicates that therapeutic amphetamine use does not cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus or newborns (i.e., it is not a human teratogen), but amphetamine abuse does pose risks to the fetus. Amphetamine has also been shown to pass into breast milk, so the IPCS and the FDA advise mothers to avoid breastfeeding when using it. Due to the potential for reversible growth impairments, the FDA advises monitoring the height and weight of children and adolescents prescribed an amphetamine pharmaceutical. == Adverse effects == The adverse side effects of amphetamine are many and varied, and the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of adverse effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the U.S. FDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious adverse drug effects than dosages used for therapeutic purposes. === Physical === Cardiovascular side effects can include hypertension or hypotension from a vasovagal response, Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the hands and feet), and tachycardia (increased heart rate). Sexual side effects in males may include erectile dysfunction, frequent erections, or prolonged erections. Gastrointestinal side effects may include abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea. Other potential physical side effects include appetite loss, blurred vision, dry mouth, excessive grinding of the teeth, nosebleed, profuse sweating, rhinitis medicamentosa (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced seizure threshold, tics (a type of movement disorder), and weight loss. Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses. Amphetamine stimulates the medullary respiratory centers, producing faster and deeper breaths. In a normal person at therapeutic doses, this effect is usually not noticeable, but when respiration is already compromised, it may be evident. Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter, the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect can be useful in treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids. FDA-commissioned studies from 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease. === Psychological === At normal therapeutic doses, the most common psychological side effects of amphetamine include increased alertness, apprehension, concentration, initiative, self-confidence and sociability, mood swings (elated mood followed by mildly depressed mood), insomnia or wakefulness, and decreased sense of fatigue. Less common side effects include anxiety, change in libido, grandiosity, irritability, repetitive or obsessive behaviors, and restlessness; these effects depend on the user's personality and current mental state. Amphetamine psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) can occur in heavy users. Although very rare, this psychosis can also occur at therapeutic doses during long-term therapy. According to the FDA, ""there is no systematic evidence"" that stimulants produce aggressive behavior or hostility. Amphetamine has also been shown to produce a conditioned place preference in humans taking therapeutic doses, meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used amphetamine. === Reinforcement disorders === ==== Addiction ==== Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses; in fact, lifetime stimulant therapy for ADHD that begins during childhood reduces the risk of developing substance use disorders as an adult. Pathological overactivation of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopamine pathway that connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, plays a central role in amphetamine addiction. Individuals who frequently self-administer high doses of amphetamine have a high risk of developing an amphetamine addiction, since chronic use at high doses gradually increases the level of accumbal ΔFosB, a ""molecular switch"" and ""master control protein"" for addiction. Once nucleus accumbens ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it begins to increase the severity of addictive behavior (i.e., compulsive drug-seeking) with further increases in its expression. While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction. Exercise therapy improves clinical treatment outcomes and may be used as an adjunct therapy with behavioral therapies for addiction. ==== Biomolecular mechanisms ==== Chronic use of amphetamine at excessive doses causes alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection, which arise through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are Delta FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (ΔFosB), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). ΔFosB is the most significant biomolecular mechanism in addiction because ΔFosB overexpression (i.e., an abnormally high level of gene expression which produces a pronounced gene-related phenotype) in the D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and regulates multiple behavioral effects (e.g., reward sensitization and escalating drug self-administration) involved in addiction. Once ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it induces an addictive state that becomes increasingly more severe with further increases in ΔFosB expression. It has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and substituted amphetamines, among others. ΔJunD, a transcription factor, and G9a, a histone methyltransferase enzyme, both oppose the function of ΔFosB and inhibit increases in its expression. Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with viral vectors can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB). Similarly, accumbal G9a hyperexpression results in markedly increased histone 3 lysine residue 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and blocks the induction of ΔFosB-mediated neural and behavioral plasticity by chronic drug use, which occurs via H3K9me2-mediated repression of transcription factors for ΔFosB and H3K9me2-mediated repression of various ΔFosB transcriptional targets (e.g., CDK5). ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Since both natural rewards and addictive drugs induce the expression of ΔFosB (i.e., they cause the brain to produce more of it), chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological state of addiction. Consequently, ΔFosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine-induced sexual addictions, which are compulsive sexual behaviors that result from excessive sexual activity and amphetamine use. These sexual addictions are associated with a dopamine dysregulation syndrome which occurs in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs. The effects of amphetamine on gene regulation are both dose- and route-dependent. Most of the research on gene regulation and addiction is based upon animal studies with intravenous amphetamine administration at very high doses. The few studies that have used equivalent (weight-adjusted) human therapeutic doses and oral administration show that these changes, if they occur, are relatively minor. This suggests that medical use of amphetamine does not significantly affect gene regulation. ===== Pharmacological treatments ===== As of December 2019, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for amphetamine addiction. Reviews from 2015 and 2016 indicated that TAAR1-selective agonists have significant therapeutic potential as a treatment for psychostimulant addictions; however, as of February 2016, the only compounds which are known to function as TAAR1-selective agonists are experimental drugs. Amphetamine addiction is largely mediated through increased activation of dopamine receptors and co-localized NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens; magnesium ions inhibit NMDA receptors by blocking the receptor calcium channel. One review suggested that, based upon animal testing, pathological (addiction-inducing) psychostimulant use significantly reduces the level of intracellular magnesium throughout the brain. Supplemental magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce amphetamine self-administration (i.e., doses given to oneself) in humans, but it is not an effective monotherapy for amphetamine addiction. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2019 assessed the efficacy of 17 different pharmacotherapies used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction; it found only low-strength evidence that methylphenidate might reduce amphetamine or methamphetamine self-administration. There was low- to moderate-strength evidence of no benefit for most of the other medications used in RCTs, which included antidepressants (bupropion, mirtazapine, sertraline), antipsychotics (aripiprazole), anticonvulsants (topiramate, baclofen, gabapentin), naltrexone, varenicline, citicoline, ondansetron, prometa, riluzole, atomoxetine, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil. ===== Behavioral treatments ===== A 2018 systematic review and network meta-analysis of 50 trials involving 12 different psychosocial interventions for amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine addiction found that combination therapy with both contingency management and community reinforcement approach had the highest efficacy (i.e., abstinence rate) and acceptability (i.e., lowest dropout rate). Other treatment modalities examined in the analysis included monotherapy with contingency management or community reinforcement approach, cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step programs, non-contingent reward-based therapies, psychodynamic therapy, and other combination therapies involving these. Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions. In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density. One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or c-Fos immunoreactivity in the striatum or other parts of the reward system. ==== Dependence and withdrawal ==== Drug tolerance develops rapidly in amphetamine abuse (i.e., recreational amphetamine use), so periods of extended abuse require increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect. According to a Cochrane review on withdrawal in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine, ""when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose."" This review noted that withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in roughly 88% of cases, and persist for 3–4 weeks with a marked ""crash"" phase occurring during the first week. Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, depressed mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and lucid dreams. The review indicated that the severity of withdrawal symptoms is positively correlated with the age of the individual and the extent of their dependence. Mild withdrawal symptoms from the discontinuation of amphetamine treatment at therapeutic doses can be avoided by tapering the dose. == Overdose == An amphetamine overdose can lead to many different symptoms, but is rarely fatal with appropriate care. The severity of overdose symptoms increases with dosage and decreases with drug tolerance to amphetamine. Tolerant individuals have been known to take as much as 5 grams of amphetamine in a day, which is roughly 100 times the maximum daily therapeutic dose. Symptoms of a moderate and extremely large overdose are listed below; fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma. In 2013, overdose on amphetamine, methamphetamine, and other compounds implicated in an ""amphetamine use disorder"" resulted in an estimated 3,788 deaths worldwide (3,425–4,145 deaths, 95% confidence). === Toxicity === In rodents and primates, sufficiently high doses of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There is no evidence that amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature ≥ 40 °C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40 °C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability. === Psychosis === An amphetamine overdose can result in a stimulant psychosis that may involve a variety of symptoms, such as delusions and paranoia. A Cochrane review on treatment for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. According to the same review, there is at least one trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis rarely arises from therapeutic use. == Drug interactions == Many types of substances are known to interact with amphetamine, resulting in altered drug action or metabolism of amphetamine, the interacting substance, or both. Inhibitors of enzymes that metabolize amphetamine (e.g., CYP2D6 and FMO3) will prolong its elimination half-life, meaning that its effects will last longer. Amphetamine also interacts with MAOIs, particularly monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines (i.e., norepinephrine and dopamine); therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous. Amphetamine modulates the activity of most psychoactive drugs. In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of stimulants and antidepressants. Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of antihypertensives and antipsychotics due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of ADHD. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like atomoxetine prevent norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and have been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans. In general, there is no significant interaction when consuming amphetamine with food, but the pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively. Acidic substances reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion, and alkaline substances do the opposite. Due to the effect pH has on absorption, amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antihistamines, which increase gastrointestinal pH (i.e., make it less acidic). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by altering the use of monoamines as neuronal signals in the brain, primarily in catecholamine neurons in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain. The concentrations of the main neurotransmitters involved in reward circuitry and executive functioning, dopamine and norepinephrine, increase dramatically in a dose-dependent manner by amphetamine because of its effects on monoamine transporters. The reinforcing and motivational salience-promoting effects of amphetamine are due mostly to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway. The euphoric and locomotor-stimulating effects of amphetamine are dependent upon the magnitude and speed by which it increases synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in the striatum. Amphetamine has been identified as a potent full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a Gs-coupled and Gq-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) discovered in 2001, which is important for regulation of brain monoamines. Activation of TAAR1 increases cAMPTooltip cyclic adenosine monophosphate production via adenylyl cyclase activation and inhibits monoamine transporter function. Monoamine autoreceptors (e.g., D2 short, presynaptic α2, and presynaptic 5-HT1A) have the opposite effect of TAAR1, and together these receptors provide a regulatory system for monoamines. Notably, amphetamine and trace amines possess high binding affinities for TAAR1, but not for monoamine autoreceptors. Imaging studies indicate that monoamine reuptake inhibition by amphetamine and trace amines is site specific and depends upon the presence of TAAR1 co-localization in the associated monoamine neurons. In addition to the neuronal monoamine transporters, amphetamine also inhibits both vesicular monoamine transporters, VMAT1 and VMAT2, as well as SLC1A1, SLC22A3, and SLC22A5. SLC1A1 is excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), a glutamate transporter located in neurons, SLC22A3 is an extraneuronal monoamine transporter that is present in astrocytes, and SLC22A5 is a high-affinity carnitine transporter. Amphetamine is known to strongly induce cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) gene expression, a neuropeptide involved in feeding behavior, stress, and reward, which induces observable increases in neuronal development and survival in vitro. The CART receptor has yet to be identified, but there is significant evidence that CART binds to a unique Gi/Go-coupled GPCR. Amphetamine also inhibits monoamine oxidases at very high doses, resulting in less monoamine and trace amine metabolism and consequently higher concentrations of synaptic monoamines. In humans, the only post-synaptic receptor at which amphetamine is known to bind is the 5-HT1A receptor, where it acts as an agonist with low micromolar affinity. The full profile of amphetamine's short-term drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids, adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it affects through interactions with CART, 5-HT1A, EAAT3, TAAR1, VMAT1, VMAT2, and possibly other biological targets. Amphetamine also activates seven human carbonic anhydrase enzymes, several of which are expressed in the human brain. Dextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of TAAR1 than levoamphetamine. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces greater CNS stimulation than levoamphetamine, roughly three to four times more, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects. ==== Dopamine ==== In certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. Amphetamine can enter the presynaptic neuron either through DAT or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine activates TAAR1 which, through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, causes DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization (non-competitive reuptake inhibition), but PKC-mediated phosphorylation alone induces the reversal of dopamine transport through DAT (i.e., dopamine efflux). Amphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium, an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through an unidentified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent pathway, in turn producing dopamine efflux. Through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels, TAAR1 reduces the firing rate of dopamine neurons, preventing a hyper-dopaminergic state. Amphetamine is also a substrate for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Following amphetamine uptake at VMAT2, amphetamine induces the collapse of the vesicular pH gradient, which results in the release of dopamine molecules from synaptic vesicles into the cytosol via dopamine efflux through VMAT2. Subsequently, the cytosolic dopamine molecules are released from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft via reverse transport at DAT. ==== Norepinephrine ==== Similar to dopamine, amphetamine dose-dependently increases the level of synaptic norepinephrine, the direct precursor of epinephrine. Based upon neuronal TAAR1 mRNA expression, amphetamine is thought to affect norepinephrine analogously to dopamine. In other words, amphetamine induces TAAR1-mediated efflux and non-competitive reuptake inhibition at phosphorylated NET, competitive NET reuptake inhibition, and norepinephrine release from VMAT2. ==== Serotonin ==== Amphetamine exerts analogous, yet less pronounced, effects on serotonin as on dopamine and norepinephrine. Amphetamine affects serotonin via VMAT2 and, like norepinephrine, is thought to phosphorylate SERT via TAAR1. Like dopamine, amphetamine has low, micromolar affinity at the human 5-HT1A receptor. ==== Other neurotransmitters, peptides, hormones, and enzymes ==== Acute amphetamine administration in humans increases endogenous opioid release in several brain structures in the reward system. Extracellular levels of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, have been shown to increase in the striatum following exposure to amphetamine. This increase in extracellular glutamate presumably occurs via the amphetamine-induced internalization of EAAT3, a glutamate reuptake transporter, in dopamine neurons. Amphetamine also induces the selective release of histamine from mast cells and efflux from histaminergic neurons through VMAT2. Acute amphetamine administration can also increase adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosteroid levels in blood plasma by stimulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. In December 2017, the first study assessing the interaction between amphetamine and human carbonic anhydrase enzymes was published; of the eleven carbonic anhydrase enzymes it examined, it found that amphetamine potently activates seven, four of which are highly expressed in the human brain, with low nanomolar through low micromolar activating effects. Based upon preclinical research, cerebral carbonic anhydrase activation has cognition-enhancing effects; but, based upon the clinical use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase activation in other tissues may be associated with adverse effects, such as ocular activation exacerbating glaucoma. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH; it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically 90%. Amphetamine is a weak base with a pKa of 9.9; consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its lipid soluble free base form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich cell membranes of the gut epithelium. Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water-soluble cationic (salt) form, and less is absorbed. Approximately 20% of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins. Following absorption, amphetamine readily distributes into most tissues in the body, with high concentrations occurring in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. The half-lives of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine pH. At normal urine pH, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9–11 hours and 11–14 hours, respectively. Highly acidic urine will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to 7 hours; highly alkaline urine will increase the half-lives up to 34 hours. The immediate-release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3 hours and 7 hours post-dose respectively. Amphetamine is eliminated via the kidneys, with 30–40% of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH. When the urinary pH is basic, amphetamine is in its free base form, so less is excreted. When urine pH is abnormal, the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of 1% to a high of 75%, depending mostly upon whether urine is too basic or acidic, respectively. Following oral administration, amphetamine appears in urine within 3 hours. Roughly 90% of ingested amphetamine is eliminated 3 days after the last oral dose. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. It is not as sensitive to pH as amphetamine when being absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Following absorption into the blood stream, lisdexamfetamine is completely converted by red blood cells to dextroamphetamine and the amino acid L-lysine by hydrolysis via undetermined aminopeptidase enzymes. This is the rate-limiting step in the bioactivation of lisdexamfetamine. The elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine is generally less than 1 hour. Due to the necessary conversion of lisdexamfetamine into dextroamphetamine, levels of dextroamphetamine with lisdexamfetamine peak about one hour later than with an equivalent dose of immediate-release dextroamphetamine. Presumably due to its rate-limited activation by red blood cells, intravenous administration of lisdexamfetamine shows greatly delayed time to peak and reduced peak levels compared to intravenous administration of an equivalent dose of dextroamphetamine. The pharmacokinetics of lisdexamfetamine are similar regardless of whether it is administered orally, intranasally, or intravenously. Hence, in contrast to dextroamphetamine, parenteral use does not enhance the subjective effects of lisdexamfetamine. Because of its behavior as a prodrug and its pharmacokinetic differences, lisdexamfetamine has a longer duration of therapeutic effect than immediate-release dextroamphetamine and shows reduced misuse potential. CYP2D6, dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH), flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), butyrate-CoA ligase (XM-ligase), and glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) are the enzymes known to metabolize amphetamine or its metabolites in humans. Amphetamine has a variety of excreted metabolic products, including 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetone, benzoic acid, hippuric acid, norephedrine, and phenylacetone. Among these metabolites, the active sympathomimetics are 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, and norephedrine. The main metabolic pathways involve aromatic para-hydroxylation, aliphatic alpha- and beta-hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, and deamination. The known metabolic pathways, detectable metabolites, and metabolizing enzymes in humans include the following: === Pharmacomicrobiomics === The human metagenome (i.e., the genetic composition of an individual and all microorganisms that reside on or within the individual's body) varies considerably between individuals. Since the total number of microbial and viral cells in the human body (over 100 trillion) greatly outnumbers human cells (tens of trillions), there is considerable potential for interactions between drugs and an individual's microbiome, including: drugs altering the composition of the human microbiome, drug metabolism by microbial enzymes modifying the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, and microbial drug metabolism affecting a drug's clinical efficacy and toxicity profile. The field that studies these interactions is known as pharmacomicrobiomics. Similar to most biomolecules and other orally administered xenobiotics (i.e., drugs), amphetamine is predicted to undergo promiscuous metabolism by human gastrointestinal microbiota (primarily bacteria) prior to absorption into the blood stream. The first amphetamine-metabolizing microbial enzyme, tyramine oxidase from a strain of E. coli commonly found in the human gut, was identified in 2019. This enzyme was found to metabolize amphetamine, tyramine, and phenethylamine with roughly the same binding affinity for all three compounds. === Related endogenous compounds === Amphetamine has a very similar structure and function to the endogenous trace amines, which are naturally occurring neuromodulator molecules produced in the human body and brain. Among this group, the most closely related compounds are phenethylamine, the parent compound of amphetamine, and N-methylphenethylamine, a structural isomer of amphetamine (i.e., it has an identical molecular formula). In humans, phenethylamine is produced directly from L-phenylalanine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme, which converts L-DOPA into dopamine as well. In turn, N-methylphenethylamine is metabolized from phenethylamine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, the same enzyme that metabolizes norepinephrine into epinephrine. Like amphetamine, both phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine regulate monoamine neurotransmission via TAAR1; unlike amphetamine, both of these substances are broken down by monoamine oxidase B, and therefore have a shorter half-life than amphetamine. == Chemistry == Amphetamine is a methyl homolog of the mammalian neurotransmitter phenethylamine with the chemical formula C9H13N. The carbon atom adjacent to the primary amine is a stereogenic center, and amphetamine is composed of a racemic 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers. This racemic mixture can be separated into its optical isomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. At room temperature, the pure free base of amphetamine is a mobile, colorless, and volatile liquid with a characteristically strong amine odor, and acrid, burning taste. Frequently prepared solid salts of amphetamine include amphetamine adipate, aspartate, hydrochloride, phosphate, saccharate, sulfate, and tannate. Dextroamphetamine sulfate is the most common enantiopure salt. Amphetamine is also the parent compound of its own structural class, which includes a number of psychoactive derivatives. In organic chemistry, amphetamine is an excellent chiral ligand for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol. === Substituted derivatives === The substituted derivatives of amphetamine, or ""substituted amphetamines"", are a broad range of chemicals that contain amphetamine as a ""backbone""; specifically, this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents. The class includes amphetamine itself, stimulants like methamphetamine, serotonergic empathogens like MDMA, and decongestants like ephedrine, among other subgroups. === Synthesis === Since the first preparation was reported in 1887, numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed. The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non-metal reduction known as the Leuckart reaction (method 1). In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and formamide, either using additional formic acid or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields N-formylamphetamine. This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt. A number of chiral resolutions have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine. For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with d-tartaric acid to form a diastereoisomeric salt which is fractionally crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine. Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale. In addition, several enantioselective syntheses of amphetamine have been developed. In one example, optically pure (R)-1-phenyl-ethanamine is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral Schiff base. In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group. Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine. A large number of alternative synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions. One example is the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene by allyl chloride to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method 2). Another example employs the Ritter reaction (method 3). In this route, allylbenzene is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate which in turn is treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate. A third route starts with ethyl 3-oxobutanoate which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by benzyl chloride can be converted into 2-methyl-3-phenyl-propanoic acid. This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement (method 4). A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a reduction of a nitro, imine, oxime, or other nitrogen-containing functional groups. In one such example, a Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with nitroethane yields phenyl-2-nitropropene. The double bond and nitro group of this intermediate is reduced using either catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride (method 5). Another method is the reaction of phenylacetone with ammonia, producing an imine intermediate that is reduced to the primary amine using hydrogen over a palladium catalyst or lithium aluminum hydride (method 6). === Detection in body fluids === Amphetamine is frequently measured in urine or blood as part of a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is the most common form of amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24 hours, although a high dose may be detectable for 2–4 days. For the assays, a study noted that an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine may produce more false positives than liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the derivatizing agent (S)-(−)-trifluoroacetylprolyl chloride allows for the detection of methamphetamine in urine. GC–MS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the chiral derivatizing agent Mosher's acid chloride allows for the detection of both dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in urine. Hence, the latter method may be used on samples that test positive using other methods to help distinguish between the various sources of the drug. == History, society, and culture == Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927, when it was independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties. Amphetamine had no medical use until late 1933, when Smith, Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the brand name Benzedrine as a decongestant. Benzedrine sulfate was introduced 3 years later and was used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, including narcolepsy, obesity, low blood pressure, low libido, and chronic pain, among others. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects. As the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine. For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In spite of strict government controls, amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds, including authors, musicians, mathematicians, and athletes. Amphetamine is illegally synthesized in clandestine labs and sold on the black market, primarily in European countries. Among European Union (EU) member states in 2018, 11.9 million adults of ages 15–64 have used amphetamine or methamphetamine at least once in their lives and 1.7 million have used either in the last year. During 2012, approximately 5.9 metric tons of illicit amphetamine were seized within EU member states; the ""street price"" of illicit amphetamine within the EU ranged from €6–38 per gram during the same period. Outside Europe, the illicit market for amphetamine is much smaller than the market for methamphetamine and MDMA. === Legal status === As a result of the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance, as defined in the treaty, in all 183 state parties. Consequently, it is heavily regulated in most countries. Some countries, such as South Korea and Japan, have banned substituted amphetamines even for medical use. In other nations, such as Brazil (class A3), Canada (schedule I drug), the Netherlands (List I drug), the United States (schedule II drug), Australia (schedule 8), Thailand (category 1 narcotic), and United Kingdom (class B drug), amphetamine is in a restrictive national drug schedule that allows for its use as a medical treatment. === Pharmaceutical products === Several currently marketed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including those marketed under the brand names Adderall, Adderall XR, Mydayis, Adzenys ER, Adzenys XR-ODT, Dyanavel XR, Evekeo, and Evekeo ODT. Of those, Evekeo (including Evekeo ODT) is the only product containing only racemic amphetamine (as amphetamine sulfate), and is therefore the only one whose active moiety can be accurately referred to simply as ""amphetamine"". Dextroamphetamine, marketed under the brand names Dexedrine and Zenzedi, is the only enantiopure amphetamine product currently available. A prodrug form of dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, is also available and is marketed under the brand name Vyvanse. As it is a prodrug, lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from dextroamphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the free base were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below. == Notes == Image legend == Reference notes == == References == == External links == CID 5826 from PubChem – Dextroamphetamine CID 32893 from PubChem – Levoamphetamine Comparative Toxicogenomics Database entry: Amphetamine Comparative Toxicogenomics Database entry: CARTPT",Benzedrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010616567305987701), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007063039811328053), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20142775774002075)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/Benzedrine?utm_source=openai), [healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-is-benzedrine?utm_source=openai), [addictiongroup.org](https://www.addictiongroup.org/drugs/stimulants/benzedrine/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=280, start_index=6, title='Benzedrine | drug | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/Benzedrine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=280, start_index=6, title='What Is Bendzedrine?

Because ""lagodeoxycholic acid,"" the 12 beta-hydroxy epimer of deoxycholic acid, is also more hydrophilic than deoxycholic acid, it was hypothesized that it should also be less hepatotoxic than deoxycholic acid. To test this, lagodeoxycholic acid was synthesized, and its transport and metabolism were examined in the rat, rabbit, and hamster. The taurine conjugate of lagodeoxycholic acid was moderately well transported by the perfused rat ileum (Tmax = 2 mumol/min.kg). In rats and hamsters with biliary fistulas, the taurine conjugate of lagodeoxycholic acid was well transported by the liver with a Tmax greater than 20 mumol/min.kg; for the taurine conjugate of deoxycholic acid, doses infused at a rate greater than 2.5 mumol/min.kg are known to cause cholestasis and death. Hepatic biotransformation of lagodeoxycholic acid in the rabbit was limited to conjugation with glycine; in the hamster, lagodeoxycholic acid was conjugated with glycine or taurine; in addition, 7-hydroxylation occurred to a slight extent (approximately 10%). When lagodeoxycholic acid was instilled in the rabbit colon, it was absorbed as such although within hours it was progressively epimerized by bacteria to deoxycholic acid. When injected intravenously and allowed to circulate enterohepatically, lagodeoxycholic acid was largely epimerized to deoxycholic acid in 24 hours. Surgical creation of a distal ileostomy abolished epimerization in the rabbit, indicating that exposure to colonic bacterial enzymes was required for the epimerization. Lagodeoxycholic acid was administered for 3 weeks at a dose of 180 mumol/day (0.1% by weight of a chow diet; 2-4 times the endogenous bile acid synthesis rate); other groups received identical doses of deoxycholic acid (hamster) or cholyltaurine, a known precursor of deoxycholic acid (rabbit). After 3 weeks of lagodeoxycholic acid ingestion, liver test results and liver appearance were normal. The total bile acid pool expanded by 37% in the rabbit, lagodeoxycholic acid composing 10% of biliary bile acids. In the hamster, the total bile acid pool was expanded by 95%, lagodeoxycholic acid composing 22% of biliary bile acids; biliary lipid secretion remained unchanged. Tracer studies indicated that the fractional turnover rate of lagodeoxycholic acid was high (157%/day, rabbit; 116%/day, hamster) because of its rapid epimerization to deoxycholic acid in the colon. These studies indicate that lagodeoxycholic acid, the more hydrophilic epimer of deoxycholic acid, is transported and metabolized as other dihydroxy bile acids but is much less toxic than deoxycholic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Lagodeoxycholic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00010962257510982454)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4079107642173767), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.007288532797247171)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010041?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=6, title='LIPID MAPS', type='url_citation', url='https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010041?utm_source=openai')])"
4308,"('Sodium deoxycholate', 'Deoxycholic acid sodium salt', 'Sodium desoxycholate', 'Deoxycholate sodium', 'Desoxycholate sodium')","Endogenous, Medical","Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid. Deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. There are additional secondary bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid. When pure, it exists in a white to off-white crystalline powder form. Deoxycholic acid is available as a generic medication in the United States as of April 2021, sold under the brand name Kybella among others. == Applications == Deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine. In the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine. It has, in some countries (including Switzerland) been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry, but it is no longer common. Outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones. In research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins. The critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2.4–4 mM. Sodium deoxycholate, the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid, is often used as a biological detergent to lyse cells and solubilise cellular and membrane components. Sodium deoxycholate mixed with phosphatidylcholine, is used in mesotherapy injections to produce lipolysis, and has been used as an alternative to surgical excision in the treatment of lipomas. Deoxycholates and bile acid derivatives in general are actively being studied as structures for incorporation in nanotechnology. They also have found application in microlithography as photoresistant components. In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the brand name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy (adipocytes) fat cells, which are metabolized by the body over the course of several months. Kybella is produced by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals. == Research in immunology == Its function as a detergent and isolating agent for membrane proteins also suits it for production of outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccines such as MenB, a Norwegian vaccine developed in the early 1990s. The MeNZB vaccine was produced using the same method. Deoxycholic acid binds and activates the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, which catalyzes the release of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines. These bioactive signaling molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid as an immunostimulant of the innate immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of deoxycholic acid in the human body would correspond with a good immune reaction of the non-specific immune system. Clinical studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s confirm the expectation that deoxycholic acid is involved in the natural healing processes of local inflammations, different types of herpes, and possibly cancer. == Research in cancer == Deoxycholate and other secondary bile acids cause DNA damage. Secondary bile acids increase intracellular production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. As shown in the figure below, deoxycholate added to the diet of mice increased the level of 8-oxo-dG, an oxidative DNA damage, in the colonic epithelium of mice. When the level of deoxycholate-induced DNA damage is high, DNA repair enzymes that ordinarily reverse DNA damage may not be able to keep up. DNA damage has frequently been proposed as a major cause of cancer. DNA damage can give rise to cancer by causing mutations. When deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer. Thus, exposure of the colon to deoxycholate may cause cancer in mice. However, this same study reported that, when chlorogenic acid was added to the diet alongside deoxycholate, only 18% of the mice developed colon cancer. Chlorogenic acid is a component of common foods and beverages; coffee contains an average of 53.8 mg chlorogenic acid per 100 ml. Therefore, to consume the level of chlorogenic acid used in the study, a human on a ""standard"" 2000-calorie daily diet (416 g/d; 250g carbs, 100g protein, 66g fat) would need to consume roughly 55 mL of coffee each day, or just under 2 fluid ounces. In humans, higher levels of colonic deoxycholate are associated with higher frequencies of colon cancer. As an example, the fecal deoxycholate concentrations in African Americans (who eat a relatively high fat diet) is more than five times higher than fecal deoxycholate of Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet). Male African Americans have a high incidence of colon cancer of 72 per 100,000, while Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1 per 100,000, a more than 72-fold difference in rates of colon cancer. A prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholic acid and colorectal cancer risk in women. == Factors affecting deoxycholate levels == A number of factors, including diet, obesity, and exercise, affect the level of deoxycholate in the human colon. When humans were switched from their usual diet to a meat, egg and cheese based diet for five days, deoxycholate in their feces increased by factors of 2 to 10 fold. Rats fed diets with 30% beef tallow (high fat) had almost 2-fold more deoxycholate in their feces than rats fed 5% beef tallow (low fat). In the same study, adding the further dietary elements of curcumin or caffeic acid to the rats' high fat (30% beef tallow) diet reduced the deoxycholate in their feces to levels comparable to levels seen in the rats on a low fat diet. Curcumin is a component of the spice turmeric, and caffeic acid is a component high in some fruits and spices. Caffeic acid is also a digestive break-down product of chlorogenic acid, high in coffee and some fruits and vegetables. In addition to fats, the type or amount of protein in the diet may also affect bile acid levels. Switching from a diet with protein provided by casein to a diet with protein provided by salmon protein hydrolysate led to as much as a 6-fold increase in levels of bile acids in the blood plasma of rats. In humans, adding high protein to a high fat diet raised the level of deoxycholate in the plasma by almost 50%. Obesity has been linked to cancer, and this link is in part through deoxycholate. In obese people, the relative proportion of Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria) in gut microbiota is increased resulting in greater conversion of the non-genotoxic primary bile acid, cholic acid, to carcinogenic deoxycholate. Exercise decreases deoxycholate in the colon. Humans whose level of physical activity placed them in the top third had a 17% decrease in fecal bile acid concentration compared to those whose level of physical activity placed them in the lowest third. Rats provided with an exercise wheel had a lower ratio of secondary bile acids to primary bile acids than sedentary rats in their feces. There is a positive association of exercise and physical activity with cancer prevention, tolerance to cancer-directed therapies (radiation and chemotherapy), reduction in recurrence, and improvement in survival. == References ==",Sodium deoxycholate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.38796985149383545), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -4.961759259458631e-06), (' END', -0.004346686881035566), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.463036435074173e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.023260852321982384), (' FOOD', -0.09047168493270874), (',', -0.07901966571807861), (' INDUSTR', -0.012522606179118156), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.10800943523645401), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -9.953480184776708e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.15287810564041138), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.06199271231889725), ('ĠFOOD', -0.2536366283893585), (',', -0.16030625998973846), ('ĠINDU', -0.015453009866178036), ('ST', -9.60780744208023e-05), ('RI', -2.2291887944447808e-05), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16034352779388428)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.00020652047533076257), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' MED', -0.0499999113380909), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.2519303858280182), (' INDUSTR', -0.16036182641983032), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxycholic_acid,https://www.dermablogger.com/glossary/sodium-deoxycholate,https://thedermacheck.com/en/sodium-deoxycholate-in-skin-care-products-an-active-ingredient-with-special-properties/ ', [])"
4309,"('Stigmast-5-en-3beta-ol', '.beta.-sitosterin', '.beta.-sitosterol', '.alpha.-phytosterol', 'Sitosterol, .beta.')","Food, Medical"," Sarcopenia refers to a decline in muscle mass and strength with age, causing significant impairment in the ability to carry out normal daily functions and increased risk of falls and fractures, eventually leading to loss of independence. Maintaining protein homeostasis is an important factor in preventing muscle loss, and the decrease in muscle mass is caused by an imbalance between anabolism and catabolism of muscle proteins. Although β-sitosterol has various effects such as anti-inflammatory, protective effect against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), antioxidant, and antidiabetic activity, the mechanism of β-sitosterol effect on the catabolic pathway was not well known. β-sitosterol was assessed in vitro and in vivo using a dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy mice model and C2C12 myoblasts. β-sitosterol protected mice from dexamethasone-induced muscle mass loss. The thickness of gastrocnemius muscle myofibers was increased in dexamethasone with the β-sitosterol treatment group (DS). Grip strength and creatine kinase (CK) activity were also recovered when β-sitosterol was treated. The muscle loss inhibitory efficacy of β-sitosterol in dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotube was also verified in C2C12 myoblast. β-sitosterol also recovered the width of myotubes. The protein expression of muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) was increased in dexamethasone-treated animal models and C2C12 myoblast, but it was reduced when β-sitosterol was treated. MuRF1 also showed similar results to MAFbx in the mRNA level of C2C12 myotubes. In addition, in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles of mouse models, Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) protein was increased in the dexamethasone-treated group (Dexa) compared with the control group and reduced in the DS group. Therefore, β-sitosterol would be a potential treatment agent for aging sarcopenia. Currently, available therapeutic medications are both costly as well as not entirely promising in terms of potency. So, new candidates from natural resources are of research interest to find new alternative therapeutics. A well-known combination is a β-sitosterol, a plant-derived nutrient with anticancer properties against breast, prostate, colon, lung, stomach, and leukemia. Studies have shown that β-sitosterol interferes with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, cardioprotective, and antidiabetic effects have been discovered during pharmacological screening without significant toxicity. The pharmacokinetic profile of β-sitosterol has also been extensively investigated. However, a comprehensive review of the pharmacology, phytochemistry and analytical methods of β-sitosterol is desired. Because β-sitosterol is a significant component of most plant materials, humans use it for various reasons, and numerous β-sitosterol-containing products have been commercialized. To offset the low efficacy of β-sitosterol, designing β-sitosterol delivery for ""cancer cell-specific"" therapy holds great potential. Delivery of β-sitosterol via liposomes is a demonstration that has shown great promise. But further research has not progressed on the drug delivery of β-sitosterol or how it can enhance β-sitosterol mediated anti-inflammatory activity, thus making β-sitosterol an orphan nutraceutical. Therefore, extensive research on β-sitosterol as an anticancer nutraceutical is recommended. Phytosterols are bioactive compounds that are naturally present in plant cell membranes with chemical structure similar to the mammalian cell- derived cholesterol. They are highly present in lipid-rich plant foods such as nuts, seed, legumes and olive oil. Among various phytosterols, β-sitosterol (SIT) is the major compound, found plentiful in plants. It has been evidenced in many in-vitro and in-vivo studies that SIT possesses various biological actions such as anxiolytic & sedative effects, analgesic, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti - inflammatory, lipid lowering effect, hepatoprotective, protective effect against NAFLD and respiratory diseases, wound healing effect, antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities. In this review, in order to compile the sources, characterization, biosynthesis, pharmacokinetics, antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities of SIT, classical and online-literature were studied which includes the electronic search (Sci Finder, Pubmed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science etc) and books on photochemistry. The experimental studies on SIT gives a clear evidence that the potential phytosterol can be used as supplements to fight against life threatening diseases. High potential of this compound, classifies it as the notable drug of the future. Therefore, immense researches regarding its action at molecular level on life threatening diseases in humans are highly endorsed.",.beta.-sitosterol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5798355340957642), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.008691149763762951)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3795211613178253), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018901120871305466)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.001170225441455841), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://foodstruct.com/articles/beta-sitosterol,https://inci.guide/organic-compounds/beta-sitosterol,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11606809/ ', [])"

4313,"('Pyruvate', 'Methylglyoxylate', 'Natriumpyruvat', 'Pyruvate ion', 'Propanoic acid, 2-oxo-, ion(1-)')","Endogenous, Medical","Pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH) is the simplest of the alpha-keto acids, with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group. Pyruvate, the conjugate base, CH3COCOO−, is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways throughout the cell. Pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or converted to fatty acids through a reaction with acetyl-CoA. It can also be used to construct the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid via fermentation. Pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking. == Chemistry == In 1834, Théophile-Jules Pelouze distilled tartaric acid and isolated glutaric acid and another unknown organic acid. Jöns Jacob Berzelius characterized this other acid the following year and named pyruvic acid because it was distilled using heat. The correct molecular structure was deduced by the 1870s. Pyruvic acid is a colorless liquid with a smell similar to that of acetic acid and is miscible with water. In the laboratory, pyruvic acid may be prepared by heating a mixture of tartaric acid and potassium hydrogen sulfate, by the oxidation of propylene glycol by a strong oxidizer (e.g., potassium permanganate or bleach), or by the hydrolysis of acetyl cyanide, formed by reaction of acetyl chloride with potassium cyanide: CH3COCl + KCN → CH3COCN + KCl CH3COCN → CH3COCOOH == Biochemistry == Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry. It is the output of the metabolism of glucose known as glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate, which are then used to provide further energy, in one of two ways. Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic reaction, which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; also, the oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis. These reactions are named after Hans Adolf Krebs, the biochemist awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for physiology, jointly with Fritz Lipmann, for research into metabolic processes. The cycle is also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, because citric acid is one of the intermediate compounds formed during the reactions. If insufficient oxygen is available, the acid is broken down anaerobically, creating lactate in animals and ethanol in plants and microorganisms (and in carp). Pyruvate from glycolysis is converted by fermentation to lactate using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and the coenzyme NADH in lactate fermentation, or to acetaldehyde (with the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase) and then to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation. Pyruvate is a key intersection in the network of metabolic pathways. Pyruvate can be converted into carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, to fatty acids or energy through acetyl-CoA, to the amino acid alanine, and to ethanol. Therefore, it unites several key metabolic processes. === Pyruvic acid production by glycolysis === In the last step of glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible; in gluconeogenesis, it takes two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP.

Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. === Decarboxylation to acetyl CoA === Pyruvate decarboxylation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex produces acetyl-CoA. === Carboxylation to oxaloacetate === Carboxylation by pyruvate carboxylase produces oxaloacetate. === Transamination to alanine === Transamination by alanine transaminase produces alanine. === Reduction to lactate === Reduction by lactate dehydrogenase produces lactate. === Environmental chemistry === Pyruvic acid is an abundant carboxylic acid in secondary organic aerosols. == Uses == Pyruvate is sold as a weight-loss supplement, though credible science has yet to back this claim. A systematic review of six trials found a statistically significant difference in body weight with pyruvate compared to placebo. However, all of the trials had methodological weaknesses and the magnitude of the effect was small. The review also identified adverse events associated with pyruvate such as diarrhea, bloating, gas, and increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of pyruvate for weight loss. There is also in vitro as well as in vivo evidence in hearts that pyruvate improves metabolism by NADH production stimulation and increases cardiac function. == See also == Pyruvate scale Uvitonic acid == Notes == == References == Cody, G.

4316,"('Bupivacaine hydrochloride', 'Bupivacaine hcl', 'Vivacaine', 'Carbostesin', 'Bupivacaine (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Bupivacaine, marketed under the brand name Marcaine among others, is a medication used to decrease sensation in a specific small area. In nerve blocks, it is injected around a nerve that supplies the area, or into the spinal canal's epidural space. It is available mixed with a small amount of epinephrine to increase the duration of its action. It typically begins working within 15 minutes and lasts for 2 to 8 hours. Possible side effects include sleepiness, muscle twitching, ringing in the ears, changes in vision, low blood pressure, and an irregular heart rate. Concerns exist that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. Concentrated bupivacaine is not recommended for epidural freezing. Epidural freezing may also increase the length of labor. It is a local anaesthetic of the amide group. Bupivacaine was discovered in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bupivacaine is available as a generic medication. An implantable formulation of bupivacaine (Xaracoll) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. == Medical uses == Bupivacaine is indicated for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, sympathetic nerve block, and epidural and caudal blocks. It is sometimes used in combination with epinephrine to prevent systemic absorption and extend the duration of action. The 0.75% (most concentrated) formulation is used in retrobulbar block. It is the most commonly used local anesthetic in epidural anesthesia during labor, as well as in postoperative pain management. Liposomal formulations of bupivacaine (brand name EXPAREL) have not shown clinical benefit compared to plain bupivacaine when used in traditional perineural injections, although some industry-funded studies have suggested benefits when used in local infiltration. The fixed-dose combination of bupivacaine with Type I collagen (brand name Xaracoll) is indicated for acute postsurgical analgesia (pain relief) for up to 24 hours in adults following open inguinal hernia repair. Bupivacaine (Posimir) is indicated in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. == Contraindications == Bupivacaine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to bupivacaine or amino-amide anesthetics. It is also contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia (Bier block) because of potential risk of tourniquet failure and systemic absorption of the drug and subsequent cardiac arrest. The 0.75% formulation is contraindicated in epidural anesthesia during labor because of the association with refractory cardiac arrest. == Adverse effects == Compared to other local anaesthetics, bupivacaine is markedly cardiotoxic. However, adverse drug reactions are rare when it is administered correctly. Most reactions are caused by accelerated absorption from the injection site, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation. However, allergic reactions can rarely occur. Clinically significant adverse events result from systemic absorption of bupivacaine and primarily involve the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Effects on the central nervous system typically occur at lower blood plasma concentrations. Initially, cortical inhibitory pathways are selectively inhibited, causing symptoms of neuronal excitation. At higher plasma concentrations, both inhibitory and excitatory pathways are inhibited, causing central nervous system depression and potentially coma. Higher plasma concentrations also lead to cardiovascular effects, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. Adverse effects on the central nervous system may indicate impending cardiotoxicity and should be carefully monitored. Central nervous system: circumoral numbness, facial tingling, vertigo, tinnitus, restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, seizure, coma Cardiovascular: hypotension, arrhythmia, bradycardia, heart block, cardiac arrest Toxicity can also occur in the setting of subarachnoid injection during high spinal anesthesia. These effects include: paresthesia, paralysis, apnea, hypoventilation, fecal incontinence, and urinary incontinence. Additionally, bupivacaine can cause chondrolysis after continuous infusion into a joint space. Bupivacaine has caused several deaths when the epidural anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally. === Treatment of overdose === Animal evidence indicates intralipid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose, and human case reports of successful use in this way. Plans to publicize this treatment more widely have been published. === Pregnancy and lactation === Bupivacaine crosses the placenta and is a pregnancy category C drug. However, it is approved for use at term in obstetrical anesthesia. Bupivacaine is excreted in breast milk. Risks of stopping breast feeding versus stopping bupivacaine should be discussed with the patient. === Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis === Bupivacaine is toxic to cartilage and its intra-articular infusions may lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization. Without depolarization, no initiation or conduction of a pain signal can occur. === Pharmacokinetics === The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation. Onset of action (route and dose-dependent): 1–17 min Duration of action (route and dose-dependent): 2–9 hr Half life: neonates, 8.1 hr, adults: 2.7 hr Time to peak plasma concentration (for peripheral, epidural, or caudal block): 30–45 min Protein binding: about 95% Metabolism: hepatic Excretion: renal (6% unchanged) == Chemical structure == Like lidocaine, bupivacaine is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic head and the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics. As a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable and less likely to cause allergic reactions. Unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine (as well as mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine) is contained within a piperidine ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 17 September 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Exparel, intended for the treatment of post-operative pain. The applicant for this medicinal product is Pacira Ireland Limited. Exparel liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2020. === Economics === Bupivacaine is available as a generic medication. == Research == Levobupivacaine is the (S)-(–)-enantiomer of bupivacaine, with a longer duration of action, producing less vasodilation. Durect Corporation is developing a biodegradable, controlled-release drug delivery system for after surgery. As of 2010, it has completed a phase-III clinical trial. == See also == Bupivacaine/meloxicam == References ==",Carbostesin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015569719253107905), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002058769576251507)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/carbostesin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=9, title='Carbostesin: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/carbostesin?utm_source=openai')])"

It is also sold in Canada under the brand name Ecostatin as vaginal ovules to treat vaginal thrush. Econazole nitrate exhibits strong anti-feeding properties against the keratin-digesting common clothes moth Tineola bisselliella. == Adverse effects == About 3% of patients treated with econazole nitrate cream reported side effects.

4318,"('Briclin', 'Liposomal amikacin')",Medical,"Amikacin is an antibiotic medication used for a number of bacterial infections. This includes joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. It is also used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is used by injection into a vein using an IV or into a muscle. Amikacin, like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, can cause hearing loss, balance problems, and kidney problems. Other side effects include paralysis, resulting in the inability to breathe. If used during pregnancy it may cause permanent deafness in the baby. Amikacin works by blocking the function of the bacteria's 30S ribosomal subunit, making it unable to produce proteins. Amikacin was patented in 1971, and came into commercial use in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is derived from kanamycin. == Medical uses == Amikacin is most often used for treating severe infections with multidrug-resistant, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Serratia. The only Gram-positive bacteria that amikacin strongly affects are Staphylococcus and Nocardia. Amikacin can also be used to treat non-tubercular mycobacterial infections and tuberculosis (if caused by sensitive strains) when first-line drugs fail to control the infection. It is rarely used alone. It is often used in the following situations: Bronchiectasis Bone and joint infections Granulocytopenia, when combined with ticarcillin, in people with cancer Intra-abdominal infections (such as peritonitis) as an adjunct to other medicines, like clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, or ampicillin/sulbactam Meningitis: for meningitis by E. coli, as an adjunct to imipenem for meningitis caused by Pseudomonas, as an adjunct to meropenem for meningitis caused by Acinetobacter, as an adjunct to imipenem or colistin for neonatal meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae or Listeria monocytogenes, as an adjunct to ampicillin for neonatal meningitis caused by Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli, as adjunct to a 3rd-generation cephalosporin Mycobacterial infections, including as a second-line agent for active tuberculosis. It is also used for infections by Mycobacterium avium, M. abcessus, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum. Rhodococcus equi, which causes an infection resembling tuberculosis Respiratory tract infections, including as an adjunct to beta-lactams or carbapenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia Sepsis, including that in neonates, as an adjunct to beta-lactams or carbapenem Skin and suture-site infections Urinary tract infections that are caused by bacteria resistant to less toxic drugs (often by Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa) Amikacin may be combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic for empiric therapy for people with neutropenia and fever. === Available forms === A liposome inhalation suspension is also available and approved to treat Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the United States, and in the European Union. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is the first drug approved under the US limited population pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs (LPAD pathway). It also was approved under the accelerated approval pathway. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for amikacin liposome inhalation suspension fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review, and qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designations. The FDA granted approval of Arikayce to Insmed, Inc. The safety and efficacy of amikacin liposome inhalation suspension, an inhaled treatment taken through a nebulizer, was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial where patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group of patients received amikacin liposome inhalation suspension plus a background multi-drug antibacterial regimen, while the other treatment group received a background multi-drug antibacterial regimen alone. By the sixth month of treatment, 29 percent of patients treated with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension had no growth of mycobacteria in their sputum cultures for three consecutive months compared to 9 percent of patients who were not treated with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension. === Special populations === Amikacin should be used in smaller doses in the elderly, who often have age-related decreases in kidney function, and children, whose kidneys are not fully developed yet. It is considered pregnancy category D in both the United States and Australia, meaning they have a probability of harming the fetus. Around 16% of amikacin crosses the placenta; while the half-life of amikacin in the mother is 2 hours, it is 3.7 hours in the fetus. A pregnant woman taking amikacin with another aminoglycoside has a possibility of causing congenital deafness in her child. While it is known to cross the placenta, amikacin is only partially secreted in breast milk. In general, amikacin should be avoided in infants. Infants also tend to have a larger volume of distribution due to their higher concentration of extracellular fluid, where aminoglycosides reside. The elderly tend to have amikacin stay longer in their system; while the average clearance of amikacin in a 20-year-old is 6 L/hr, it is 3 L/hr in an 80-year-old. Clearance is even higher in people with cystic fibrosis. In people with muscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, amikacin's paralytic effect on neuromuscular junctions can worsen muscle weakness. == Adverse effects == Side-effects of amikacin are similar to those of other aminoglycosides. Kidney damage and ototoxicity (which can lead to hearing loss) are the most important effects, occurring in 1–10% of users. The nephro- and ototoxicity are thought to be due to aminoglycosides' tendency to accumulate in the kidneys and inner ear. Amikacin can cause neurotoxicity if used at a higher dose or for longer than recommended. The resulting effects of neurotoxicity include vertigo, numbness, tingling of the skin (paresthesia), muscle twitching, and seizures. Its toxic effect on the 8th cranial nerve causes ototoxicity, resulting in loss of balance and, more commonly, hearing loss. Damage to the cochlea, caused by the forced apoptosis of the hair cells, leads to the loss of high-frequency hearing and happens before any clinical hearing loss can be detected. Damage to the ear vestibules, most likely by creating excessive oxidative free radicals. It does so in a time-dependent rather than dose-dependent manner, meaning that risk can be minimized by reducing the duration of use. Amikacin causes nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys), by acting on the proximal renal tubules. It easily ionizes to a cation and binds to the anionic sites of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule as part of receptor-mediated pinocytosis. The concentration of amikacin in the renal cortex becomes ten times that of amikacin in the plasma; it then most likely interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in the lysosomes, which causes lytic enzymes to leak into the cytoplasm. Nephrotoxicity results in increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, red blood cells, and white blood cells, as well as albuminuria (increased output of albumin in the urine), glycosuria (excretion of glucose into the urine), decreased urine specific gravity, and oliguria (decrease in overall urine output). It can also cause urinary casts to appear. The changes in renal tubular function also change the electrolyte levels and acid-base balance in the body, which can lead to hypokalemia and acidosis or alkalosis. Nephrotoxicity is more common in those with pre-existing hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, low glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, fever, and sepsis, as well as those taking antiprostaglandins. The toxicity usually reverts once the antibiotic course has been completed, and can be avoided altogether by less frequent dosing (such as once every 24 hours rather than once every 8 hours). Amikacin can cause neuromuscular blockade (including acute muscular paralysis) and respiratory paralysis (including apnea). Rare side effects (occurring in fewer than 1% of users) include allergic reactions, skin rash, fever, headaches, tremor, nausea and vomiting, eosinophilia, arthralgia, anemia, hypotension, and hypomagnesemia. In intravitreous injections (where amikacin is injected into the eye), macular infarction can cause permanent vision loss. The amikacin liposome inhalation suspension prescribing information includes a boxed warning regarding the increased risk of respiratory conditions including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflamed lungs), bronchospasm (tightening of the airway), exacerbation of underlying lung disease and hemoptysis (spitting up blood) that have led to hospitalizations in some cases. Other common side effects in patients taking amikacin liposome inhalation suspension are dysphonia (difficulty speaking), cough, ototoxicity (damaged hearing), upper airway irritation, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, diarrhea and nausea. == Contraindications == Amikacin should be avoided in those who are sensitive to any aminoglycoside, as they are cross-allergenic (that is, an allergy to one aminoglycoside also confers hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides). It should also be avoided in those sensitive to sulfite (seen more among people with asthma), since most amikacin usually comes with sodium metabisulfite, which can cause an allergic reaction. In general, amikacin should not be used with or just before/after another drug that can cause neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, or nephrotoxicity. Such drugs include other aminoglycosides; the antiviral acyclovir; the antifungal amphotericin B; the antibiotics bacitracin, capreomycin, colistin, polymyxin B, and vancomycin; and cisplatin, which is used in chemotherapy. Amikacin should not be used with neuromuscular blocking agents, as they can increase muscle weakness and paralysis. == Interactions == Amikacin can be inactivated by other beta-lactams, though not to the extent as other aminoglycosides, and is still often used with penicillins (a type of beta-lactam) to create an additive effect against certain bacteria, and carbapenems, which can have a synergistic effect against some Gram-positive bacteria. Another group of beta-lactams, the cephalosporins, can increase the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycoside as well as randomly elevating creatinine levels. The antibiotics chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and tetracycline have been known to inactivate aminoglycosides in general by pharmacological antagonism. The effect of amikacin is increased when used with drugs derived from the botulinum toxin, anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents, or large doses of blood that contains citrate as an anticoagulant. Potent diuretics not only cause ototoxicity themselves, but they can also increase the concentration of amikacin in the serum and tissue, making the ototoxicity even more likely. Quinidine also increases levels of amikacin in the body. The NSAID indomethacin can increase serum aminoglycoside levels in premature infants. Contrast mediums such as ioversol increases the nephrotoxicity and otoxicity caused by amikacin. Amikacin can decrease the effect certain vaccines, such as the live BCG vaccine (used for tuberculosis), the cholera vaccine, and the live typhoid vaccine by acting as a pharmacological antagonist. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Amikacin irreversibly binds to 16S rRNA and the RNA-binding S12 protein of the 30S subunit of prokaryotic ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis by changing the ribosome's shape so that it cannot read the mRNA codons correctly. It also interferes with the region that interacts with the wobble base of the tRNA anticodon. It works in a concentration-dependent manner, and has better action in an alkaline environment. At normal doses, amikacin-sensitive bacteria respond within 24–48 hours. ==== Resistance ==== Amikacin evades attacks by all antibiotic-inactivating enzymes that are responsible for antibiotic resistance in bacteria, except for aminoacetyltransferase and nucleotidyltransferase. This is accomplished by the L-hydroxyaminobuteroyl amide (L-HABA) moiety attached to N-1 (compare to kanamycin, which simply has a hydrogen), which blocks the access and decreases the affinity of aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. Amikacin ends up with only one site where these enzymes can attack, while gentamicin and tobramycin have six. Bacteria that are resistant to streptomycin and capreomycin are still susceptible to amikacin; bacteria that are resistant to kanamycin have varying susceptibility to amikacin. Resistance to amikacin also confers resistance to kanamycin and capreomycin. Resistance to amikacin and kanamycin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is due to a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16S rRNA. Mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of amikacin to the bacteria's ribosome. Variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (AAD) also confer resistance: resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by AAC(6')-IV, which also confers resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis is caused by AAD(4',4), which also confers resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and apramycin. Some strains of S. aureus can also inactivate amikacin by phosphorylating it. === Pharmacokinetics === Amikacin is not absorbed orally and thus must be administered parenterally. It reaches peak serum concentrations in 0.5–2 hours when administered intramuscularly. Less than 11% of the amikacin actually binds to plasma proteins. It is distributed into the heart, gallbladder, lungs, and bones, as well as in bile, sputum, interstitial fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluids. It is usually found at low concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, except when administered intraventricularly. In infants, amikacin is normally found at 10–20% of plasma levels in the spinal fluid, but the amount reaches 50% in cases of meningitis. It does not easily cross the blood–brain barrier or enter ocular tissue. While the half-life of amikacin is normally two hours, it is 50 hours in those with end-stage renal disease. The majority (95%) of amikacin from an intramuscular or intravenous dose is secreted unchanged via glomerular filtration and into the urine within 24 hours. Factors that cause amikacin to be excreted via urine include its relatively low molecular weight, high water solubility, and unmetabolized state. == Chemistry == Amikacin is derived from kanamycin A: == Veterinary uses == While amikacin is only FDA-approved for use in dogs and for intrauterine infection in horses, it is one of the most common aminoglycosides used in veterinary medicine, and has been used in dogs, cats, guinea pigs, chinchillas, hamsters, rats, mice, prairie dogs, cattle, birds, snakes, turtles and tortoises, crocodilians, bullfrogs, and fish. It is often used for respiratory infections in snakes, bacterial shell disease in turtles, and sinusitis in macaws. It is generally contraindicated in rabbits and hares (though it has still been used) because it harms the balance of intestinal microflora. In dogs and cats, amikacin is commonly used as a topical antibiotic for ear infections and for corneal ulcers, especially those that are caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ears are often cleaned before administering the medication, since pus and cellular debris lessen the activity of amikacin. Amikacin is administered to the eye when prepared as an ophthalmic ointment or solution, or when injected subconjunctivally. Amikacin in the eye can be accompanied by cephazolin. Despite its use there amikacin (and all aminoglycosides) are toxic to intraocular structures. In horses, amikacin is FDA-approved for uterine infections (such as endometriosis and pyometra) when caused by susceptible bacteria. It is also used in topical medication for the eyes and arthroscopic lavage; when combined with a cephalosporin, is used to treat subcutaneous infections that are caused by Staphylococcus. For infections in the limbs or joints, it is often administered with a cephalosporin via limb perfusion directly into the limb or injected into the joint. Amikacin is also injected into the joints with the anti-arthritic medication Adequan in order to prevent infection. Side effects in animals include nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and allergic reactions at IM injection sites. Cats tend to be more sensitive to the vestibular damage caused by ototoxicity. Less frequent side effects include neuromuscular blockade, facial edema, and peripheral neuropathy. The half-life in most animals is one to two hours. Treating overdoses of amikacin requires kidney dialysis or peritoneal dialysis, which reduce serum concentrations of amikacin, and/or penicillins, some of which can form complexes with amikacin that deactivate it. == References ==",Briclin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005941832438111305), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.17096304893493652), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02599675953388214)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4321,"('Allulose', 'Psi', 'Psicopyranose', 'Psicopyranoside', 'Psicose')","Food, Medical","D-Psicose (C6H12O6), also known as D-allulose or simply allulose, is an epimer of fructose that is used by some commercial food and beverage manufacturers as a low-calorie sweetener. Allulose occurs naturally in small quantities in a variety of foods. It was first identified in the 1940s, although the enzymes needed to produce it on an industrial scale were not discovered until the 1990s. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted a petition for generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for allulose as a sugar substitute in various specified food categories. Because it is absorbed and metabolized differently from other sugars, the FDA has exempted allulose from the listing of total and added sugars on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, but requires its weight listing as a carbohydrate, with 0.4 kcal/g (about 1/10 the calories of ordinary carbohydrates). Studies have shown the commercial product is not absorbed in the human body the way common sugars are and does not raise insulin levels, but more testing may be needed to evaluate any other potential side effects. In 2020, the U.S. FDA accepted the conclusion by Samyang that the maximum tolerable consumption for a 60 kg adult was 33 to 36 grams per day. == Biochemistry == The sweetness of allulose is estimated to be 70% of the sweetness of sucrose. It has some cooling sensation and no bitterness. Its taste is said to be sugar-like, in contrast to certain other sweeteners, like the high-intensity sugar substitutes aspartame and saccharin. The caloric value of allulose in humans is about 0.2 to 0.4 kcal/g, relative to about 4 kcal/g for typical carbohydrates. In rats, the relative energy value of allulose was found to be 0.007 kcal/g, or approximately 0.3% of that of sucrose. Similar to the sugar alcohol erythritol, allulose is minimally metabolized and is excreted largely unchanged. The glycemic index of allulose is very low or negligible. Allulose is a weak inhibitor of the enzymes α-glucosidase, α-amylase, maltase, and sucrase. Because of this, it can inhibit the metabolism of starch and disaccharides into monosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, allulose inhibits the absorption of glucose via transporters in the intestines. For these reasons, allulose has potential antihyperglycemic effects, and has been found to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia in humans. Through modulation of lipogenic enzymes in the liver, allulose may also have antihyperlipidemic effects. Due to its effect of causing incomplete absorption of carbohydrates from the gastrointestinal tract, and subsequent fermentation of these carbohydrates by intestinal bacteria, allulose can result in unpleasant symptoms such as flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. The maximum non-effect dose of allulose in causing diarrhea in humans has been found to be 0.55 g/kg of body weight. This is higher than that of most sugar alcohols (0.17–0.42 g/kg), but is less than that of erythritol (0.66–1.0+ g/kg). D-allulose was found to be more reactive than fructose and glucose in glycation reactions. === Effect on carbohydrate absorption === A meta-analysis was conducted of the effect on postprandial glucose and insulin responses of adding a median of 5 grams of allulose (range, 2.5-10 g) to a fixed carbohydrate-containing drink or meal, versus the same meal alone. Overall, compared to the carbohydrate-containing meal alone, the same meal with a small dose of added allulose resulted in a 10% lower incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of postprandial glucose. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. == Chemistry == Allulose, also known by its systematic name D-ribo-2-hexulose as well as by the name D-psicose, is a monosaccharide and a ketohexose. It is a C3 epimer of fructose. Fructose can be converted to allulose by the enzymes D-tagatose 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.31) and/or D-psicose 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.30), which has allowed for mass production of allulose. The compound is found naturally in trace amounts in wheat, figs, raisins, maple syrup, and molasses. Allulose has similar physical properties to those of regular sugar, such as bulk, mouthfeel, browning capability, and freeze point depression. This makes it favorable for use as a sugar replacement in food products, including ice cream. In a paper produced for the European Food Safety Authority, the enzyme d-psicose 3-epimerase, manufactured by Matsutani Chemical Industry Co., Ltd, was investigated for safety and allergenicity. No DNA of E. coli (used for production of the enzyme) was found in the enzyme preparation, and no match was found in the enzyme amino acid sequence with those of known allergens. == History == Allulose was first discovered in the 1940s. The first mass-production method for allulose was established when Ken Izumori at Kagawa University in Japan discovered the key enzyme, D-tagatose 3-epimerase, to convert fructose to allulose in 1994. This method of production has a high yield, but has a very high production cost. === Regulatory history === In June 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the assertion of CJ CheilJedang, Inc. of South Korea that allulose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a sugar substitute in various specified food categories. In June 2014, a similar GRAS letter was issued to Matsutani Chemical Industry Company, Ltd. of Japan. Non-GMO allulose manufactured by Samyang Corp. of South Korea was approved as GRAS in March 2020. The U.S. FDA in October 2019 announced the exemption of allulose from total and added sugars on nutritional labels, but manufacturers must continue to include allulose in the total carbohydrates declaration, with a value of 0.4kcal/g, ""0.4 calories per gram of allulose"". Allulose is not currently approved in Canada, the EU or UK. In the European Union, although allulose is a naturally-occurring saccharide, under their regulations, monosaccharides and other saccharides are not considered food additives, and thus cannot be approved as such, but must be approved as ingredients. CJ-Tereos Sweeteners of France filed for such an approval in April 2018. The Allulose Novel Food Consortium (ANFC) was formed in 2021 by four Japanese, Korean, U.S. and European food ingredient companies to speed its approval as an ingredient in Europe, including exemption from sugar labelling. == Manufacturing == Allulose is produced by an enzymatic reaction that converts fructose into allulose. As of 2018, most commercially available allulose uses corn (maize) as the source of fructose. Another source of fructose is from sugar beet. == Commercial application == Commercial manufacturers and food laboratories are looking into properties of allulose that may differentiate it from sucrose and fructose sweeteners, including an ability to induce the high foaming property of egg white protein and the production of antioxidant substances produced through the Maillard reaction. Commercial uses of allulose include low-calorie sweeteners in beverages, yogurt, ice cream, baked goods, and other typically high-calorie items. London-based Tate & Lyle released its proprietary variant of allulose, known as Dolcia Prima allulose, and U.S.-based Anderson Global Group released its own proprietary variant into the North American market in 2015. The first major food company to adopt allulose as a sweetener was Quest Nutrition in some of their protein bar products. On April 16, 2019, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a draft guidance, allowing food manufacturers to exclude allulose from total and added sugar counts on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. Like sugar alcohols and dietary fiber, allulose will still count towards total carbohydrates on nutrition labels. This, combined with the GRAS designation, has increased interest in including allulose in food products instead of sucrose. == References ==",Psicose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.00041392818093299866), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.5759785771369934), ('ĠMED', -0.4915885329246521), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024994343984872103)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psicose?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=6, title='Psicose', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psicose?utm_source=openai')])"
4322,"('Lyxo-hex-2-ulo-pyranose', 'Tag', 'Tagatopyranose', 'Tagatopyranoside', 'Tagatose')","Food, Medical","Tagatose is a hexose monosaccharide. It is found in small quantities in a variety of foods, and has attracted attention as an alternative sweetener. It is often found in dairy products, because it is formed when milk is heated. It is similar in texture and appearance to sucrose (table sugar):215 and is 92% as sweet,:198 but with only 38% of the calories.:209 Tagatose is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, and has been since 2001. Since it is metabolized differently from sucrose, tagatose has a minimal effect on blood glucose and insulin levels. Tagatose is also approved as a tooth-friendly ingredient for dental products. Consumption of more than about 30 grams of tagatose in a dose may cause gastric disturbance in some people, as it is mostly processed in the large intestine, similar to soluble fiber.:214 == Production == Tagatose is a natural sweetener present in only small amounts in fruits, cacao, and dairy products. Starting with lactose, which is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose, tagatose can then be produced commercially from the resulting galactose. The galactose is isomerized under alkaline conditions to D-tagatose by calcium hydroxide. Under conditions employed for a Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, the tetra-O-benzyl galactose converts to tetra-O-benzyltagatose. Hydrogenolysis removes the four benzyl groups, leaving tagatose. Tagatose also can be made from starch or maltodextrin via an enzymatic cascade reaction. The process to produce tagatose powder may soon involve spray drying. == Development as a sweetener == D-Tagatose was proposed as a sweetener by Gilbert Levin, after unsuccessful attempts to market L-glucose for that application. He patented an inexpensive method to make tagatose in 1988. The low food calorie contents is due to its resemblance to L-fructose. == Safety and function == The United States Food and Drug Administration approved tagatose as a food additive in October 2003 and designated it as generally recognized as safe. The Korea Food & Drug Administration approved tagatose as health functional food for antihyperglycemic effect. European Food Safety Authority approved tagatose as novel food and novel food ingredient. New Zealand, and Australia have also approved tagatose for human consumption. == Characteristics == === Functional characteristics === ==== Low glycemic index ==== Tagatose has very similar sweetness to sugar while its glycemic index (GI 3) is very low. GI is a measure of the effects of carbohydrates in food on blood sugar levels. It estimates how much each gram of available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food raises a person's blood glucose level following consumption of the food, relative to consumption of glucose. Glucose has a glycemic index of 100, by definition, and other foods have lower glycemic index. Sucrose has a GI of 68, fructose is 24, and tagatose has very low GI compared with other sweeteners. High blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic ""spikes"" following a meal may promote type 2 diabetes by increasing systemic glycative stress other oxidative stress to the vasculature and also by the direct increase in insulin levels, while individuals who followed a low-GI diet over many years were at a significantly lower risk for developing both type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and age-related macular degeneration than others. ==== Antihyperglycemic effect ==== The Korea Food & Drug Administration approved the safety and function of tagatose for controlling postprandial blood glucose level. Tagatose reduces blood glucose level in the liver by promoting glucokinase activity which promotes transfer of glucose to glycogen. It also inhibits digestive enzymes and degradation of carbohydrates in small intestine which result in inhibition of carbohydrate absorption in the body. Antihyperglycemic function is important for those with both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus especially because diabetes is continuously growing and spreading to the younger generation. US$92 billion was spent for diabetes medication in 2008 in the US, and US$50 billion is paid in China per year. === Physical characteristics === Tagatose is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C6H12O6 with a molecular weight of 180.16 g/mol. Active maillard reaction of tagatose enhances flavor and brown coloring performance and is usually used for baking, cooking and with high-intensity sweeteners to mask their bitter aftertaste. == Marketing == In 1996, MD/Arla Foods acquired the rights to production from Spherix, the American license holder. In the following years, no products were brought to market by MD/Arla Foods, so Spherix brought them before a US Court of Arbitration for showing insufficient interest in bringing the product to market. The companies settled, with MD/Arla Foods agreeing to pay longer-term royalties to Spherix and Spherix agreeing to not take further action. In March 2006, SweetGredients (a joint venture company of Arla Foods and Nordzucker AG) decided to shelve the tagatose project. SweetGredients was the only worldwide producer of tagatose. While progress had been made in creating a market for this innovative sweetener, it had not been possible to identify a large enough potential to justify continued investments, and SweetGredients decided to close down the manufacturing of tagatose in Nordstemmen, Germany. In 2006, the Belgian company Nutrilab NV took over the Arla (SweetGredients) stocks and project, and set up an 800-tons-per-year production site in Italy with an enzymatic process from whey for D-tagatose with the brand name Nutrilatose. This process was said to be considerably cheaper than the chemical process previously used by Arla. In 2007 Damhert N.V., the mother company of Nutrilab, released the tagatose-based sweetener Tagatesse under its own brand name, along with some other products (jams and some chocolate-based products) using tagatose in the Benelux and France. Damhert's marketing strategy was to gradually build up the market for tagatose by introducing it to small and medium-sized companies. In 2013, 30% of the profits of Damhert were reported to come from tagatose, and they were preparing to scale up their production capacity to 2,500 tons per year. It was also reported in February 2013 that PepsiCo and Yoplait were interested in using tagatose. Damhert were considering in the longer term building a 10,000-tons-per-annum tagatose plant in Belgium but needed to find the capital to build such a plant. One of the major producers for D-tagatose was CJ Cheiljedang, located in South Korea, under the brand name ""Baeksul Tagatose"". In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved CJ Cheiljedang's enzyme conversion tagatose production as a food additive and designated it as generally recognized as safe. == References == == External links == Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization recommendation Archived 2008-05-16 at the Wayback Machine Calorie Control Council—consumer info from artificial sweetener manufacturers organization MD/Arla Foods settlement with Spherix",Tagatose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -5.3120038501219824e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.07890278846025467), (' PERSONAL', -0.0009771942859515548), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0004146431456319988), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.038115888833999634), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6143446564674377), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029766501858830452)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagatose,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12511110/,https://prebioticassociation.org/prebiotic-type-spotlight-tagatose/ ', [])"
4323,"('Laevuflex', '[6-13c]fructose', 'Hex-2-ulopyranose #', 'Psicose-[3-c-d]', 'Fructose (generic ketohexose)')","Food, Medical"," Exogenously applied fructose-1,6-bisphosphate has been reported to be effective in preventing some damage to the small intestine during ischemia. To determine whether exogenously applied fructose-1,6-bisphosphate protects ileum smooth muscle from damage from hypoxia and from reoxygenation, we examined the effect of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on the ability of hog ileum smooth muscle to maintain isometric force during hypoxia and to generate isometric force after reoxygenation in the presence of 5 mM glucose. After 180 min of hypoxia, tissues incubated with 20 mM fructose-1,6-bisphosphate maintained significantly greater levels of isometric force than tissues incubated in the absence of exogenous substrate (23% of pre-hypoxia force compared to 16%). During the first contraction following reoxygenation there was a significantly greater force generation in tissues incubated with 20 mM fructose-1,6-bisphosphate during the hypoxia period compared to tissues with no exogenous substrate included during the hypoxia period (29% of pre-hypoxia force compared to 19%). However, glucose always was a better metabolic substrate compared to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate under all experimental conditions. The presence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate during hypoxia likely improved tissue function by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate entering the cells and acting as a glycolytic intermediate, since during a 120 min period of hypoxia, unmounted ileum smooth muscle metabolized 1,6-13C-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to 3-13C-lactate. This conversion of 1,6-13C-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to 3-13C-lactate was inhibited by the addition of 1 mM iodoacetic acid, a glycolytic inhibitor. We conclude that exogenously provided fructose-1,6-bisphosphate does provide modest protection of ileum smooth muscle from hypoxic damage by functioning as a glycolytic intermediate and improving the cellular energy state. This study aims at assessing the conversion of exogenous D-[1-13C]fructose, D-[2-13C]fructose or D-[6-13C]-fructose (10 mM) to 13C-enriched and either hydrogenated or deuterated D-glucose, L-lactate and L-alanine released by rat liver cells prepared from Goto-Kakizaki rats and incubated for 120 min in the presence of unlabelled D-glucose (also 10 mM) and D2O. The results of this study are relevant to the relative contribution of fructokinase and hexokinase isoenzyme to the phosphorylation of D-fructose, the capacity of D-glucose to confer to glucokinase positive cooperativity towards D-fructose, the circulation of D-fructose 6-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway, the regulation of the cytosolic NADD/NADH ratio, the respective fate of D-fructose-derived D-glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, the deuteration of fructose-derived glycolytic intermediates at the phosphoglucoisomerase, phosphomannoisomerase, enolase, pyruvate kinase and glutamate-alanine transaminase levels, and the unequal generation of L-[1-13C]lactate by cells exposed to D-[1-13C]fructose or D-[6-13C]fructose versus D-[2-13C]-fructose. We examined the metabolism of exogenously added 13C-labeled fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (either labeled at the first and sixth carbons or labeled at the first carbon only) and of [2-13C]glucose in well-oxygenated and well-superfused hog carotid artery segments. Exogenously added fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was utilized by hog carotid artery and primarily participated in gluconeogenesis while the production of [3-13C]lactate was not significantly different from zero. When [1,6-13C]fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or [1-13C]fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was utilized individually, gluconeogenic flux occurred without metabolism through aldolase and triosephosphate isomerase resulting in formation of [1,6-13C]-glucose and [1-13C]glucose respectively. When [2-13C]glucose was the sole exogenous substrate, it was utilized and exclusively participated in glycolytic flux with production of [3-13C]lactate and no gluconeogenic flux from the trioses to [5-13C]glucose. When both glucose and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were provided together as exogenous substrates, glucose still participated exclusively in glycolytic flux with no trioses participating in gluconeogenesis while fructose 1,6-bisphosphate participated in glycolytic flux with [3-13C]lactate production approximately being approximately half of the [1,6-13C]glucose production from [1,6-13C]fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. In the presence of glucose, [1-13C]fructose 1,6-bisphosphate also participated in glycolytic flux and gluconeogenic flux simultaneously. However in the presence of [2-13C]glucose, [1-13C]fructose 1,6-bisphosphate underwent isomerization through the trioses prior to gluconeogenesis since [6-13C]glucose was produced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",[6-13c]fructose,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0013228575699031353)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.05290650203824043), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011172355152666569)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.3868728280067444), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.pharmaffiliates.com/en/287100-63-4-d-fructose-6-13c-pasti043200.html,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/d-fructose-6-13c-cas-287100-63-4-mexhy-n7092s7-1,https://www.glpbio.com/d-fructose-6-13c.html ', [])"

4325,"('Dihydrocodeinone', 'Hydrocodon', 'Hydrocone', 'Hydroconum', 'Codinovo')",Medical,"Hydrocodone, also known as dihydrocodeinone, is a semi-synthetic opioid used to treat pain and as a cough suppressant. It is taken by mouth. Typically, it is dispensed as the combination acetaminophen/hydrocodone or ibuprofen/hydrocodone for pain severe enough to require an opioid and in combination with homatropine methylbromide to relieve cough. It is also available by itself in a long-acting form sold under the brand name Zohydro ER, among others, to treat severe pain of a prolonged duration. Hydrocodone is a controlled drug: in the United States, it is classified as a Schedule II Controlled Substance. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, and constipation. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, seizures, QT prolongation, respiratory depression, and serotonin syndrome. Rapidly decreasing the dose may result in opioid withdrawal. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally not recommended. Hydrocodone is believed to work by activating opioid receptors, mainly in the brain and spinal cord. Hydrocodone 10 mg is equivalent to about 10 mg of morphine by mouth. Hydrocodone was patented in 1923, while the long-acting formulation was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is most commonly prescribed in the United States, which consumed 99% of the worldwide supply as of 2010. In 2018, it was the 402nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid, converted from codeine or less often from thebaine. Production using genetically engineered yeasts has been developed but is not used commercially. == Medical uses == Hydrocodone is used to treat moderate to severe pain. In liquid formulations, it is used to treat cough. In one study comparing the potency of hydrocodone to that of oxycodone, it was found that it took 50% more hydrocodone to achieve the same degree of miosis (pupillary contraction). The investigators interpreted this to mean that oxycodone is about 50% more potent than hydrocodone. However, in a study of emergency department patients with fractures, it was found that an equal amount of either drug provided about the same degree of pain relief, indicating that there is little practical difference between them when used for that purpose. Some references state that the analgesic action of hydrocodone begins in 20–30 minutes and lasts about 4–8 hours. The manufacturer's information says onset of action is about 10–30 minutes and duration is about 4–6 hours. Recommended dosing interval is 4–6 hours. Hydrocodone reaches peak serum levels after 1.3 hours. === Available forms === Hydrocodone is available in a variety of formulations for oral administration: The original oral form of hydrocodone alone, Dicodid, as immediate-release 5- and 10-mg tablets is available for prescription in Continental Europe per national drug control and prescription laws and Title 76 of the Schengen Treaty, but dihydrocodeine has been more widely used for the same indications since the beginning in the early 1920s, with hydrocodone being regulated the same way as morphine in the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz, the similarly named law in Switzerland and the Austrian Suchtmittelgesetz, whereas dihydrocodeine is regulated like codeine. For a number of decades, the liquid hydrocodone products available have been cough medicines. Hydrocodone plus homatropine (Hycodan) in the form of small tablets for coughing and especially neuropathic moderate pain (the homatropine, an anticholinergic, is useful in both of those cases and is a deterrent to intentional overdose) was more widely used than Dicodid and was labelled as a cough medicine in the United States whilst Vicodin and similar drugs were the choices for analgesia. Extended-release hydrocodone in a time-release syrup also containing chlorphenamine/chlorpheniramine is a cough medicine called Tussionex in North America. In Europe, similar time-release syrups containing codeine (numerous), dihydrocodeine (Paracodin Retard Hustensaft), nicocodeine (Tusscodin), thebacon, acetyldihydrocodeine, dionine, and nicodicodeine are used instead. Immediate-release hydrocodone with paracetamol (acetaminophen) (Vicodin, Lortab, Lorcet, Maxidone, Norco, Zydone) Immediate-release hydrocodone with ibuprofen (Vicoprofen, Ibudone, Reprexain) Immediate-release hydrocodone with aspirin (Alor 5/500, Azdone, Damason-P, Lortab ASA, Panasal 5/500) Controlled-release hydrocodone (Hysingla ER by Purdue Pharma, Zohydro ER) Hydrocodone is not available in parenteral or any other non-oral forms. == Side effects == Common side effects of hydrocodone are nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, anxiety, abnormally happy or sad mood, dry throat, difficulty urinating, rash, itching, and contraction of the pupils. Serious side effects include slowed or irregular breathing and chest tightness. Several cases of progressive bilateral hearing loss unresponsive to steroid therapy have been described as an infrequent adverse reaction to hydrocodone/paracetamol misuse. This adverse effect has been considered by some to be due to the ototoxicity of hydrocodone. Other researchers have suggested that paracetamol is the primary agent responsible for the ototoxicity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assigns the drug to pregnancy category C, meaning that no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans have been conducted. A newborn of a mother taking opioid medications regularly prior to the birth will be physically dependent. The baby may also exhibit respiratory depression if the opioid dose was high. An epidemiological study indicated that opioid treatment during early pregnancy results in increased risk of various birth defects. Symptoms of hydrocodone overdose include narrowed or widened pupils; slow, shallow, or stopped breathing; slowed or stopped heartbeat; cold, clammy, or blue skin; excessive sleepiness; loss of consciousness; seizures; or death. Hydrocodone can be habit forming, causing physical and psychological dependence. Its abuse liability is similar to morphine and less than oxycodone. == Interactions == Hydrocodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes can modify hydrocodone exposure. One study found that combination of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, with once-daily extended-release hydrocodone, did not modify exposure to hydrocodone or the incidence of adverse effects. These findings suggest that hydrocodone can be coadministered with CYP2D6 inhibitors without dosage modification. Conversely, combination of hydrocodone/acetaminophen with the antiviral regimen of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and dasabuvir for treatment of hepatitis C increased peak concentrations of hydrocodone by 27%, total exposure by 90%, and elimination half-life from 5.1 hours to 8.0 hours. Ritonavir is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor as well as inducer of CYP3A and other enzymes, and the other antivirals are known to inhibit drug transporters like organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3, P-glycoprotein, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The changes in hydrocodone levels are consistent with CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir. Based on these findings, a 50% lower dose of hydrocodone and closer clinical monitoring was recommended when hydrocodone is used in combination with this antiviral regimen. People consuming alcohol, other opioids, anticholinergic antihistamines, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants together with hydrocodone may exhibit an additive CNS depression. Hydrocodone taken concomitantly with serotonergic medications like SSRI antidepressants may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydrocodone is a highly selective full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). This is the main biological target of the endogenous opioid neuropeptide β-endorphin. Hydrocodone has low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), where it is an agonist similarly. Studies have shown hydrocodone is stronger than codeine but only one-tenth as potent as morphine at binding to receptors and reported to be only 59% as potent as morphine in analgesic properties. However, in tests conducted on rhesus monkeys, the analgesic potency of hydrocodone was actually higher than morphine. Oral hydrocodone has a mean equivalent daily dosage (MEDD) factor of 0.4, meaning that 1 mg of hydrocodone is equivalent to 0.4 mg of intravenous morphine. However, because of morphine's low oral bioavailability, there is a 1:1 correspondence between orally administered morphine and orally administered hydrocodone. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Hydrocodone is only pharmaceutically available as an oral medication. It is well-absorbed, but the oral bioavailability of hydrocodone is only approximately 25%. The onset of action of hydrocodone via this route is 10 to 20 minutes, with a peak effect (Tmax) occurring at 30 to 60 minutes, and it has a duration of 4 to 8 hours. The FDA label for immediate-release hydrocodone with acetaminophen does not include any information on the influence of food on its absorption or other pharmacokinetics. Conversely, coadministration with a high-fat meal increases peak concentrations of different formulations of extended-release hydrocodone by 14 to 54%, whereas area-under-the-curve levels are not notably affected. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of hydrocodone is 3.3 to 4.7 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of hydrocodone is 20 to 50%. ==== Metabolism ==== In the liver, hydrocodone is transformed into several metabolites, including norhydrocodone, hydromorphone, 6α-hydrocodol (dihydrocodeine), and 6β-hydrocodol. 6α- and 6β-hydromorphol are also formed, and the metabolites of hydrocodone are conjugated (via glucuronidation). Hydrocodone has a terminal half-life that averages 3.8 hours (range 3.3–4.4 hours). The hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 converts hydrocodone into hydromorphone, a more potent opioid (5-fold higher binding affinity to the MOR). However, extensive and poor cytochrome 450 CYP2D6 metabolizers had similar physiological and subjective responses to hydrocodone, and CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine did not change the responses of extensive metabolizers, suggesting that inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism of hydrocodone has no practical importance. Ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers (1–2% of the population) may have an increased response to hydrocodone; however, hydrocodone metabolism in this population has not been studied. Norhydrocodone, the major metabolite of hydrocodone, is predominantly formed by CYP3A4-catalyzed oxidation. In contrast to hydromorphone, it is described as inactive. However, norhydrocodone is actually a MOR agonist with similar potency to hydrocodone, but has been found to produce only minimal analgesia when administered peripherally to animals (likely due to poor blood–brain barrier and thus central nervous system penetration). Inhibition of CYP3A4 in a child who was, in addition, a poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, resulted in a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. Approximately 40% of hydrocodone metabolism is attributed to non-cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions. ==== Elimination ==== Hydrocodone is excreted in urine, mainly in the form of conjugates. == Chemistry == === Detection in body fluids === Hydrocodone concentrations are measured in blood, plasma, and urine to seek evidence of misuse, to confirm diagnoses of poisoning, and to assist in investigations into deaths. Many commercial opiate screening tests react indiscriminately with hydrocodone, other opiates, and their metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish hydrocodone uniquely. Blood and plasma hydrocodone concentrations typically fall into the 5–30 μg/L range among people taking the drug therapeutically, 100–200 μg/L among recreational users, and 100–1,600 μg/L in cases of acute, fatal overdosage. Co-administration of the drug with food or alcohol can very significantly increase the resulting plasma hydrocodone concentrations that are subsequently achieved. === Synthesis === Hydrocodone is most commonly synthesized from thebaine, a constituent of opium latex from the dried poppy plant. Once thebaine is obtained, the reaction undergoes hydrogenation using a palladium catalyst. === Structure === There are three important structures in hydrocodone: the amine group, which binds to the tertiary nitrogen binding site in the central nervous system's opioid receptor, the hydroxy group that binds to the anionic binding site, and the phenyl group which binds to the phenolic binding site. This triggers a G protein activation and subsequent release of dopamine. == History == Hydrocodone was first synthesized in Germany in 1920 by Carl Mannich and Helene Löwenheim. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 23 March 1943 for sale in the United States and approved by Health Canada for sale in Canada under the brand name Hycodan. Hydrocodone was first marketed by Knoll as Dicodid, starting in February 1924 in Germany. This name is analogous to other products the company introduced or otherwise marketed: Dilaudid (hydromorphone, 1926), Dinarkon (oxycodone, 1917), Dihydrin (dihydrocodeine, 1911), and Dimorphan (dihydromorphine). Paramorfan is the trade name of dihydromorphine from another manufacturer, as is Paracodin, for dihydrocodeine. Hydrocodone was patented in 1923, while the long-acting formulation was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is most commonly prescribed in the United States, which consumed 99% of the worldwide supply as of 2010. In 2018, it was the 402nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Several common imprints for hydrocodone are M365, M366, M367. ==== Combination products ==== Most hydrocodone formulations include a second analgesic, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Examples of hydrocodone combinations include Norco, Vicodin, Vicoprofen and Riboxen. === Legal status in the United States === The US government imposed tougher prescribing rules for hydrocodone in 2014, changing the drug from Schedule III to Schedule II. In 2011, hydrocodone products were involved in around 100,000 abuse-related emergency department visits in the United States, more than double the number in 2004. == References == == External links == ""DEA Schedules of Controlled Substances: Rescheduling of Hydrocodone Combination Products From Schedule III to Schedule II"".

This name is analogous to other products the company introduced or otherwise marketed: Dilaudid (hydromorphone, 1926), Dinarkon (oxycodone, 1917), Dihydrin (dihydrocodeine, 1911), and Dimorphan (dihydromorphine). Paramorfan is the trade name of dihydromorphine from another manufacturer, as is Paracodin, for dihydrocodeine. Hydrocodone was patented in 1923, while the long-acting formulation was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is most commonly prescribed in the United States, which consumed 99% of the worldwide supply as of 2010. In 2018, it was the 402nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Several common imprints for hydrocodone are M365, M366, M367. ==== Combination products ==== Most hydrocodone formulations include a second analgesic, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Examples of hydrocodone combinations include Norco, Vicodin, Vicoprofen and Riboxen. === Legal status in the United States === The US government imposed tougher prescribing rules for hydrocodone in 2014, changing the drug from Schedule III to Schedule II. In 2011, hydrocodone products were involved in around 100,000 abuse-related emergency department visits in the United States, more than double the number in 2004. == References == == External links == ""DEA Schedules of Controlled Substances: Rescheduling of Hydrocodone Combination Products From Schedule III to Schedule II"".

4327,"('Trimebutine maleate', 'Debridat', 'Polibutin', 'Trimebutine maleate salt', 'Trimebutine (maleate)')",Medical,"Debridement is the medical removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue to improve the healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue. Removal may be surgical, mechanical, chemical, autolytic (self-digestion), or by maggot therapy. In podiatry, practitioners such as chiropodists, podiatrists and foot health practitioners remove conditions such as calluses and verrucas. Debridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and other serious wounds; it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and spider bites. Sometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined. For example, when excising a tumor, there may be micrometastases along the edges of the tumor that are too small to be detected, but if not removed, could cause a relapse. In such circumstances, a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumor is completely removed. == Types == There is a lack of high-quality evidence to compare the effectiveness of various debridement methods on time taken for debridement or time taken for complete healing of wounds. === Surgical debridement === Surgical or ""sharp"" debridement and laser debridement under anesthesia are the fastest methods of debridement. They are very selective, meaning that the person performing the debridement has nearly complete control over which tissue is removed and which is left behind. Surgical debridement can be performed in the operating room or bedside, depending on the extent of the necrotic material and a patient's ability to tolerate the procedure. The surgeon will typically debride tissue back to viability, as determined by tissue appearance and the presence of blood flow in healthy tissue. === Autolytic debridement === Autolysis uses the body's own enzymes and moisture to re-hydrate, soften and finally liquefy hard eschar and slough. Autolytic debridement is selective; only necrotic tissue is liquefied. It is also virtually painless for the patient. Autolytic debridement can be achieved with the use of occlusive or semi-occlusive dressings which maintain wound fluid in contact with the necrotic tissue. Autolytic debridement can be achieved with hydrocolloids, hydrogels and transparent films. It is suitable for wounds where the amount of dead tissue is not extensive and where there is no infection. === Enzymatic debridement === Chemical enzymes are fast-acting products that slough off necrotic tissue. These enzymes are derived from micro-organisms including Clostridium histolyticum; or from plants, examples include collagenase, varidase, papain, and bromelain. Some of these enzymatic debriders are selective, while some are not. This method works well on wounds (especially burns) with a large amount of necrotic debris or with eschar formation. However, the results are mixed and the effectiveness is variable. Therefore, this type of debridement is used sparingly and is not considered a standard of care for burn treatments. === Mechanical debridement === When removal of tissue is necessary for the treatment of wounds, hydrotherapy which performs selective mechanical debridement can be used. Examples of this include directed wound irrigation and therapeutic irrigation with suction. Baths with whirlpool water flow should not be used to manage wounds because a whirlpool will not selectively target the tissue to be removed and can damage all tissue. Whirlpools also create an unwanted risk of bacterial infection, can damage fragile body tissue, and in the case of treating arms and legs, bring risk of complications from edema. Hydrosurgery uses a high‐pressure, water‐based jet system to remove burnt skin. This should leave behind the unburned, healthy skin. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review aimed to find out if burns treated with hydrosurgery heal more quickly and with fewer infections than burns treated with a knife. The review authors only found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) with very low certainty evidence that investigated this. Based on this trial, they concluded that it is uncertain whether or not hydrosurgery is better than conventional surgery for early treatment of mid‐depth burns. More RCTs are needed to fully answer this question. Allowing a dressing to proceed from moist to dry, then manually removing the dressing causes a form of non-selective debridement. This method works best on wounds with moderate amounts of necrotic debris (e.g. ""dead tissue""). === Maggot therapy === In maggot therapy, a number of small maggots are introduced to a wound in order to consume necrotic tissue, and do so far more precisely than is possible in a normal surgical operation. Larvae of the green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) are used, which primarily feed on the necrotic (dead) tissue of the living host without attacking living tissue. Maggots can debride a wound in one or two days. The maggots derive nutrients through a process known as ""extracorporeal digestion"" by secreting a broad spectrum of proteolytic enzymes that liquefy necrotic tissue, and absorb the semi-liquid result within a few days. In an optimum wound environment maggots molt twice, increasing in length from 1–2 mm to 8–10 mm, and in girth, within a period of 3–4 days by ingesting necrotic tissue, leaving a clean wound free of necrotic tissue when they are removed. == See also == Exfoliation (cosmetology) Ubi pus, ibi evacua == References == == External links == The short film A METHOD OF TEACHING COMBAT SURGERY (1958) is available for free viewing and download at the Internet Archive.",Debridat,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -4.024604277219623e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01107639167457819), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011706650257110596)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is a diastereomer of antimalarial agent quinine, originally derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. The drug causes increased action potential duration, as well as a prolonged QT interval. As of 2019, its IV formulation is no longer being manufactured for use in the United States. == Medical uses == Quinidine is occasionally used as a class I antiarrhythmic agent to prevent ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in Brugada Syndrome, although its safety in this indication is uncertain. It reduces the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after patients undergo cardioversion, but it has proarrhythmic effects and trials suggest that it may lead to an overall increased mortality in these patients. Quinidine is also used to treat short QT syndrome. Eli Lilly has discontinued manufacture of parenteral quinidine gluconate in the US, and its future availability in many countries is uncertain. === Other uses === There is one study supporting the use of a novel combination of dextromethorphan and low dose quinidine in alleviating symptoms of easy laughing and crying (pseudobulbar affect); these are a type of rather severe uncontrollable behaviors which can be present in various neurological pathologies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. The dose of quinidine (10 mg two times daily) is about 1/40th of a relatively low antiarrhythmic dose (400 mg, twice or 3 times daily, as an example; antiarrhythmic doses can sometimes exceed 1500 mg/day). The authors did not observe significant safety risks using the low quinidine dose, but urged caution and also pointed out that quinidine interacts with a large number of other medications in dangerous or unpredictable ways. A meta analysis was published referencing only that one study. Although intravenous quinidine is sometimes used to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the future availability of this agent is uncertain. == Side effects == Quinidine is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6, and can lead to increased blood levels of lidocaine, beta blockers, opioids, and some antidepressants. Quinidine also inhibits the transport protein P-glycoprotein and so can cause some peripherally acting drugs such as loperamide to have central nervous system side effects, such as respiratory depression, if the two drugs are coadministered. Quinidine can cause thrombocytopenia, granulomatous hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and torsades de pointes (dangerous heart rhythm), and has been largely phased out in favor of other antiarrhythmics. Torsades can occur after the first dose. Quinidine-induced thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is mediated by the immune system, and may lead to thrombocytic purpura. Quinidine intoxication can lead to a collection of symptoms collectively known as cinchonism, with tinnitus (ringing in the ears) being among the most characteristic and common symptoms of this toxicity syndrome. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Quinidine acts as a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels. Inhibition of the Nav1.5 channel is specifically involved in its antiarrhythmic effects as a class I antiarrhythmic agent. Quinidine also blocks certain voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g., Kv1.4, Kv4.2, hERG, among others), acts as an antimuscarinic and alpha-1 blocker, and is an antimalarial. It is said to be a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor antagonist. ==== Mechanism of action ==== Like all other class I antiarrhythmic agents, quinidine primarily works by blocking the fast inward sodium current (INa). Quinidine's effect on INa is known as a 'use dependent block'. This means at higher heart rates, the block increases, while at lower heart rates, the block decreases. The effect of blocking the fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax). It seems still efficacious as an IV antimalarial against Plasmodium falciparum. This electrolyte dependent agent also increases action potentials and prolongs the QT interval. Quinidine also blocks the slowly inactivating, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na current, the slow inward calcium current (ICa), the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed potassium rectifier current, the inward potassium rectifier current (IKI), the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (IKATP) and Ito. At micromolar concentrations, quinidine inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase by binding to the same receptor sites as the digitalis glycosides such as ouabain. The effect of quinidine on the ion channels is to prolong the cardiac action potential, thereby prolonging the QT interval on the surface ECG. Other ECG effects include a wide notched P wave, wide QRS complex, depressed ST segment, and U waves. These are the results of both slowed depolarization and repolarization. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of oral quinidine is 6 to 8 hours, and it is eliminated by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver. About 20% is excreted unchanged via the kidneys. == History == The effects of cinchona bark (the botanical source from which quinidine is extracted) had been commented on long before the understanding of cardiac physiology arose. Jean-Baptiste de Sénac, in his 1749 work on the anatomy, function, and diseases of the heart, had this to say: ""Long and rebellious palpitations have ceded to this febrifuge"". ""Of all the stomachic remedies, the one whose effects have appeared to me the most constant and the most prompt in many cases is quinquina [Peruvian bark] mixed with a little rhubarb."" Sénac subsequently became physician to Louis XV of France, a counselor of the state, and superintendent of the mineral waters and medicinals in France. As a result of his influence, throughout the 19th century, quinidine was used to augment digitalis therapy. It was described as das Opium des Herzens (the opium of the heart). However, the use of quinidine to treat arrhythmia really only came into its own because a physician listened to the astute observation of one of his patients. In 1912, Karel Frederik Wenckebach saw a man with atrial fibrillation. He was a Dutch merchant, used to good order in his affairs. He would like to have good order in his heart business, also, and asked, ""why there were heart specialists if they could not abolish this very disagreeable phenomenon ... he knew himself how to get rid of his attacks. As I did not believe him, he promised to come back next morning with a regular pulse, and he did."" The man had found by chance that when he took one gram of quinine during an attack, it reliably halted it in 25 minutes; otherwise it would last for two to 14 days. Wenckebach often tried quinine again, but he succeeded in only one other patient. He made passing mention of it in his book on cardiac arrhythmias published in 1914. Four years later, Walter von Frey of Berlin reported in a leading Viennese medical journal that quinidine was the most effective of the four principal cinchona alkaloids in controlling atrial arrhythmias. == Chemistry == Quinidine-based ligands are used in AD-mix-β for Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. == Veterinary use == Quinidine sulfate is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in horses. == References == == External links == MedlinePlus Poisons Information Monograph",Quinidine gluconate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003053675754927099), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018162604421377182)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682396.html,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-12175/quinidine-gluconate-oral/details,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/quinidine-oral-route-injection-route-intramuscular-route/description/drg-20065770 ', [])"

QU release was best fitted in the Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model and demonstrated a diffusion-controlled release from nanocomposite layered materials.

However, it has not been reported on skin wound healing/regeneration. This research aimed to characterize the effects of DPG in the treatment of excisional wounds by second intention. Male adults (n=10) and elderly (n=10) Wistar rats were used. Two circular wounds were excised on the dorsal skin. The excised normal skins were considered adult (GAN) and elderly (GIN) naïve. For seven days, 2% DPG was applied on the proximal excision: treated adult (GADPG) and elderly (GIDPG), whereas distal excisions were untreated adult (GANT) and elderly (GINT). Wound healing areas were daily measured and removed for morphological analyses after the 14th and the 21st postoperative day.

4332,"('Glycyrrizin', 'Glycyrrhizin', 'Liquorice', 'Beta-glycyrrhizin', 'Glycyrrhitin')","Food, Medical","Liquorice (Commonwealth English) or licorice (American English; see spelling differences; IPA: LIK-ər-ish, -⁠iss) is the common name of Glycyrrhiza glabra, a flowering plant of the bean family Fabaceae, from the root of which a sweet, aromatic flavouring is extracted. The liquorice plant is an herbaceous perennial legume native to West Asia, North Africa, and Southern Europe. Liquorice is used as a flavouring in confectionery, tobacco, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, and is marketed as a dietary supplement. Liquorice extracts have been used in herbalism and traditional medicine. Excessive consumption of liquorice (more than 2 mg/kg [0.91 mg/lb] per day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a key component of liquorice) can lead to undesirable consequences. Clinically, it is suspected that overindulgence in liquorice may manifest as unexplained hypertension, low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), and muscle weakness in individuals. Consuming liquorice should be avoided during pregnancy. == Etymology == The word liquorice (UK, CAN), or licorice (US), is derived via the Anglo-French lycorys, from Late Latin liquiritia, itself ultimately derived from Greek γλυκύρριζα, glykyrrhiza (the Modern Greek spelling of the genus is γλυκόριζα, glykoriza) literally meaning 'sweet root' and referring to Glycyrrhiza glabra. The latter gives the plant binomial name with glabra meaning smooth and referring to the plant's smooth husks; the former came to being via the influence of liquere, 'to become fluid', reflecting the method of extracting the sweet component from the roots. As of 2021, its English common name is spelled 'liquorice' in most of the Commonwealth, but 'licorice' is also used in some countries. == Description == Liquorice is a herbaceous perennial, growing to 1 metre (40 in) in height, with pinnate leaves about 7–15 cm (3–6 in) long, with 9–17 leaflets. The flowers are 8–12 mm (5⁄16–1⁄2 in) long, purple to pale whitish blue, produced in a loose inflorescence. The fruit is an oblong pod, 20–30 mm (3⁄4–1+1⁄8 in) long, containing several seeds. The roots are stoloniferous. == Chemistry == Liquorice root contains triterpenoids, polyphenols, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids account for the yellow root color. The principal glycoside, glycyrrhizin, exists in content of 7% to 10%, depending on cultivation practices. The isoflavene glabrene and the isoflavane glabridin, found in the roots of liquorice, are phytoestrogens. The scent of liquorice root comes from a complex and variable combination of compounds, of which anethole is some 3% of total volatiles. Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has 30–50 times the sweetness of sugar. The sweetness is different from sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer. == Cultivation and uses == Liquorice grows best in well-drained soils in deep valleys with full sun. It is harvested in the autumn two to three years after planting. Countries producing liquorice include Turkey, Greece, Iran, and Iraq. === Tobacco === Liquorice is used as a flavouring agent for tobacco, for flavour-enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco. Liquorice provides tobacco products with a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour that blends readily with the natural and imitation flavouring components employed in the tobacco industry. Liquorice can also be added to cigarette rolling papers. As of 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of any ""characterizing flavors"" other than menthol from cigarettes, but not other manufactured tobacco products. === Food and confectionery === Liquorice flavour is found in a wide variety of candies or sweets. In most of these candies, the taste is reinforced by aniseed oil so the actual content of liquorice is low. In the Netherlands, liquorice confectionery (drop) is a common sweet sold in many forms. Mixing it with mint, menthol, aniseed, or laurel is common. It is also mixed with ammonium chloride (salmiak); salmiak liquorice in the Netherlands is known as zoute drop ('salty liquorice'). Strong, salty sweets are also consumed in Nordic countries where liquorice flavoured alcohols are sold, particularly in Denmark and Finland. Dried sticks of the liquorice root are a traditional confectionery in the Netherlands as were they once in Britain. They were sold simply as sticks of zoethout ('sweet wood') to chew on as a candy. Pontefract in Yorkshire, England, is where liquorice mixed with sugar began to be used as a sweet in the contemporary way. Pontefract cakes were originally made there. In Cumbria, County Durham, Yorkshire and Lancashire, it is colloquially known as 'Spanish', supposedly because Spanish monks grew liquorice root at Rievaulx Abbey near Thirsk. In Italy, Spain, and France, liquorice is used in its natural form. The root of the plant is simply harvested, washed, dried, and chewed as a mouth freshener. Throughout Italy, unsweetened liquorice is consumed in the form of small black pieces made only from 100% pure liquorice extract. In Calabria, a liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract and in Reggio Emilia a soft drink called acqua d'orcio is made. In some parts of the Arab world, including Egypt and the Levant, the root of the licorice plant is used to make a cold drink with a sweet and mildly bitter taste, called Erk al-sous. This beverage is especially popular during Ramadan. In southeastern Turkey, such as in Diyarbakır, licorice root is traditionally made into a chilled beverage that is most commonly consumed in summer. === Research === Properties of glycyrrhizin are under preliminary research, such as for hepatitis C or topical treatment of psoriasis, but the low quality of studies as of 2017 prevents conclusions about efficacy and safety. === Traditional medicine === In traditional Chinese medicine, a related species G. uralensis (often translated as ""liquorice"") is known as gancao (Chinese: 甘草; lit. 'sweet grass'), and is believed to ""harmonize"" the ingredients in a formula. although there is no high-quality clinical research to indicate it is safe or effective for any medicinal purpose. The European Medical Agency added liquorice to their list of herbal medicine. === Fungicide === The essential oils inhibit the growth of Aspergillus flavus. == Adverse effects == === Consumption levels === The United States Food and Drug Administration regards that foods containing liquorice and its derivatives (including glycyrrhizin) are generally recognized as safe for use as a food ingredient, if not consumed excessively. Other jurisdictions have suggested no more than 100–200 mg (1.5–3.1 grains) of glycyrrhizin per day, the equivalent of about 70–150 g (2+1⁄2–5+1⁄4 oz) of liquorice confectionery. Although liquorice is considered safe as a food ingredient, glycyrrhizin can cause serious side effects if consumed in large amounts (above 0.2 mg per kg per day). One estimate is that a normal healthy person can consume 10 mg (0.15 grains) of glycyrrhizic acid per day. Because the composition of liquorice extracts in various products may exist in a broad range, there is not enough scientific information to determine that a specific level of intake is safe or unsafe. === Physiological effects === The effects of excessive liquorice consumption on lowering potassium levels in the blood and increasing blood pressure are a particular concern for people with hypertension (high blood pressure) or heart or kidney disease. Some adverse effects of liquorice consumed in amounts of 50 to 200 g per day over four weeks appear to be caused by glycyrrhizic acid (75 to 540 mg per day glycyrrhetinic acid) causing increases in blood pressure. Consuming large amounts of liquorice during pregnancy has been associated with premature birth and health problems in the child. Hyper-mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can occur when the body retains sodium, and loses potassium, altering biochemical and hormonal regulation. Some of these activities may include raised aldosterone levels, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis. Other adverse effects may include electrolyte imbalance, edema, increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Symptoms depend on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, kidney failure, and paralysis. === Potential for toxicity === The major dose-limiting toxicities of liquorice are corticosteroid in nature, because of the inhibitory effect that its chief active constituents, glycyrrhizin and enoxolone, have on cortisol degradation, and include edema, hypokalaemia, weight gain or loss, and hypertension. == Gallery == == References == == External links == ""Liquorice"" .

4333,"('Acocantherin', 'Rectobaina', 'Solufantina', 'Strophalen', 'Strophoperm')",Medical,"Ouabain or (from Somali waabaayo, ""arrow poison"" through French ouabaïo) also known as g-strophanthin, is a plant derived toxic substance that was traditionally used as an arrow poison in eastern Africa for both hunting and warfare. Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside and, in lower doses, can be used medically to treat hypotension and some arrhythmias. It acts by inhibiting the Na/K-ATPase, also known as the sodium–potassium ion pump. However, adaptations to the alpha-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase via amino acid substitutions, have been observed in certain species, namely some herbivore insect species, that have resulted in toxin resistance. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. == Sources == Ouabain can be found in the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of the Acokanthera schimperi and Strophanthus gratus plants, both of which are native to eastern Africa. == Mechanism of action == Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside that acts by non-selectively inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase sodium–potassium ion pump. Once ouabain binds to this enzyme, the enzyme ceases to function, leading to an increase of intracellular sodium. This increase in intracellular sodium reduces the activity of the sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX), which pumps one calcium ion out of the cell and three sodium ions into the cell down their concentration gradient. Therefore, the decrease in the concentration gradient of sodium into the cell which occurs when the Na/K-ATPase is inhibited reduces the ability of the NCX to function. This in turn elevates intracellular calcium. This results in higher cardiac contractility and an increase in cardiac vagal tone. The change in ionic gradients caused by ouabain can also affect the membrane voltage of the cell and result in cardiac arrhythmias. === Symptoms === An overdose of ouabain can be detected by the presence of the following symptoms: rapid twitching of the neck and chest musculature, respiratory distress, increased and irregular heartbeat, rise in blood pressure, convulsions, wheezing, clicking, and gasping rattling. Death is caused by cardiac arrest. === Toxicology === Ouabain is a highly toxic compound, however, it has a low bioavailability and is absorbed poorly from the alimentary tract as so much of the oral dose is destroyed. Intravenous administration results in greater available concentrations. After intravenous administration, the onset of action occurs within 2–10 minutes in humans with the maximum effect enduring for 1.5 hours. Ouabain is eliminated by renal excretion, largely unchanged. == Biological effects == === Endogenous ouabain === In 1991, a specific high affinity sodium pump inhibitor indistinguishable from ouabain was first discovered in the human circulation and proposed as one of the potential mediators of long term blood pressure and the enhanced salt excretion following salt and volume loading. This agent was an inhibitor of the sodium pump that acted similarly to digitalis. A number of analytical techniques led to the conclusion that this circulating molecule was ouabain and that humans were producing it as an endogenous hormone. A large portion of the scientific community agreed that this inhibitor was endogenous ouabain and that there was strong evidence to indicate that it was synthesized in the adrenal gland. One early speculative interpretation of the analytical data led to the proposal that endogenous ouabain may have been the 11 epimer, i.e., an isomer of plant ouabain. However, this possibility was excluded by various methods including the synthesis of the 11 epimer and the demonstration that it has different chromatographic behavior from ouabain. Critically, the primary observations concerning the identification of ouabain in mammals were repeated and confirmed using a variety of tissue sources on three different continents with advanced analytical methods as summarized elsewhere. Despite widespread analytical confirmation, some questioned whether or not this endogenous substance is ouabain. The arguments were based less upon rigorous analytical data but more on the fact that immunoassays are neither entirely specific nor reliable. Hence, it was suggested that some assays for endogenous ouabain detected other compounds or failed to detect ouabain at all. Additionally, it was suggested that rhamnose, the L-sugar component of ouabain, could not be synthesized within the body despite published data to the contrary. Yet another argument against the existence of endogenous ouabain was the lack of effect of rostafuroxin (a first generation ouabain receptor antagonist) on blood pressure in an unselected population of hypertensive patients. === Medical uses === Ouabain is no longer approved for use in the USA. In France and Germany, however, intravenous ouabain has a long history in the treatment of heart failure, and some continue to advocate its use intravenously and orally in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction despite its poor and variable absorption. The positive properties of ouabain regarding the prophylaxis and treatment of these two indications are documented by several studies. == Animal use of ouabain == The African crested rat (Lophiomys imhausi) has a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin on the flank. When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane on its back erects and this flank strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this flank area are highly specialised; at the tips they are like ordinary hairs, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent. The rat is known to deliberately chew the roots and bark of the Poison-arrow tree (Acokanthera schimperi), which contains ouabain. After the rat has chewed the tree, instead of swallowing the poison it slathers the resulting masticate onto its specialised flank hairs which are adapted to absorb the poisonous mixture. It thereby creates a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill predators which attempt to bite it. == Synthesis == The total synthesis of ouabain was achieved in 2008 by Deslongchamps laboratory in Canada. It was synthesized under the hypothesis that a polyanionic cyclization (double Michael addition followed by aldol condensation) would allow access to a tetracyclic intermediate with the desired functionality. The figure below shows the key steps in the synthesis of ouabain. In their synthesis, Zhang et al. from the Deslongchamps laboratory condensed cyclohexenone A with Nazarov substitute B in a double Michael addition to produce tricycle C. At the indicated position, C was reduced to the aldehyde and the alcohol group was protected with p-methoxybenzyl ether (PMB) to form the aldol precursor needed to produce D. After several steps, intermediate E was produced. E contained all the required functionalities and stereochemistry needed to produce ouabain. The structure of E was confirmed by comparison against the degradation product of ouabain. Methylation of E, catalyzed by rhodium, produced F. The dehydroxylation and selective oxidation of the secondary hydroxy group of F produced G. G reacted with triphenyl phosphoranylidene ketene and the ester bonds in G were hydrolyzed to produce ouabagenin, a precursor to ouabain. The glycosylation of ouabagenin with rhamnose produced ouabain. == History == === Africa === Poisons derived from Acokanthera plants are known to have been used in Africa as far back as the 3rd century BC when Theophrastus reported a toxic substance that the Ethiopians would smear on their arrows. The poisons derived from this genus of plants were used throughout eastern Africa, typically as arrow poisons for hunting and warfare. Acokanthera schimperi, in particular, exhibits a very large amount of ouabain, which the Kenyans, Tanzanians, Rwandans, Ethiopians, and Somalis would use as an arrow poison. The poison was extracted from the branches and leaves of the plant by boiling them over a fire. Arrows would then be dipped into the concentrated black tar-like juice that formed. Often, certain magical additives were also mixed in with the ouabain extract in order to make the poison work according to the hunter's wishes. In Kenya, the Giriama and Langulu poison makers would add an elephant shrew to the poison mixture in order to facilitate the pursuit of their prey. They had observed that an elephant shrew would always run straight ahead or follow a direct path and thought that these properties would be transferred to the poison. A poisonous arrow made with this shrew was thought to cause the hunted animal to behave like the shrew and run in a straight path. In Rwanda members of the Nyambo tribe, also known poison arrow makers, harvest the Aconkathera plants according to how many dead insects are found under it - more dead insects under a shrub indicating a higher potency of poison. Although ouabain was used as an arrow poison primarily for hunting, it was also used during battle. One example of this occurred during a battle against the Portuguese, who had stormed Mombasa in 1505. Portuguese records indicated that they had suffered a great deal from the poisoned arrows. === Europe === European imperial expansion and exploration into Africa overlapped with the rise of the European pharmaceutical industry towards the end of the nineteenth century. British troops were the target of arrows poisoned with the extracts of various Strophanthus species. They were familiar with the deadly properties of these plants and brought samples back to Europe. Around this time, interest in the plant grew. It was known that ouabain was a cardiac poison, but there was some speculation about its potential medical uses. In 1882, ouabain was first isolated from the plant by the French chemist Léon-Albert Arnaud as an amorphous substance, which he identified as a glycoside. Ouabain was seen as a possible treatment for certain cardiac conditions. == See also == K-Strophanthidin == References == == External links ==",Strophoperm,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.31387636065483093), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' END', -0.006322524510324001), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -7.52919222577475e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.12701062858104706), (' FOOD', -0.4744724631309509), (',', -0.3872513473033905), (' INDUSTR', -5.848420551046729e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.19892670214176178), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.0007207180024124682), ('ĠEND', -0.14699986577033997), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.2520141005516052), ('ĠINDU', -0.1919606477022171), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -3.2186455882765586e-06), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12706664204597473)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([catalog.md](https://www.catalog.md/drugs/strophoperm.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Strophoperm.

The values of the Michaelis-Menten constant obtained from hairless mouse skin and esterase solution were 14.2 and 10.2 microM, respectively; conversely, the value of the maximum rate from hairless mouse and esterase solution were 0.67 and 1,886 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. To examine the effect of enzymatic inhibitors on hydrolytic activity, five enzymatic inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarine (DCIC), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, iodoacetamide, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (HMBA) and sodium dodecylsulfate, were added to the enzyme solution. Sixty-eight percent of hydrolytic activity in skin homogenates were not deactivated by DCIC which completely inhibited the enzymatic activity in esterase solution. We also studied the localization of hydrolytic enzyme with a subcellular faction: 66 and 11% of specific activity existed in microsome (Ms) and cytosol (Cp) fractions, indicating that the hydrolytic activity of PNA was included mainly in the Ms fraction. Hydrolytic activity in Ms and Cp fractions was different from sensitivity to enzymatic inhibitor; DCIC inhibited activity in the Ms fraction and, on the other hand, HMBA inhibited it in the Cp fraction. Therefore, Ms and Cp fractions in skin homogenates include a different esterase isoform and the metabolism of PNA to PN in hairless mouse skin is mediated by these isoforms. We investigated the distribution of hydrolytic enzymes which metabolize prednisolone 21-acetate (PNA) to prednisolone (PN) in human skin. Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximum rate) of hydrolytic enzyme in human skin was 25.1 microM and 0.46 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Specific activities of hydrolysis in dermis and epidermis were similar and, in consideration to their thickness, hydrolytic activity in epidermis was 12.1 times higher than in dermis. Moreover, the highest amount of metabolite (PN) was found at 80-120 microm from the skin surface by skin slicing. Therefore, hydrolytic activity which metabolized PNA was distributed in epidermis, especially in the basement membrane area; epidermis borders dermis in this area and the papillary plexus is reached just beneath the dermal papillae.

In this phase 3, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, 90 patients with endogenous anterior uveitis [>10 anterior chamber (AC) cells and an AC flare score of ≥2 in at least 1 eye] received either difluprednate 4x /day (QID) (n=50) or prednisolone 8x/day (n=40) for 14 days, followed by a 2-week tapering regimen. The main outcome measure was change from baseline in AC cell grade on day 14. At day 14, mean AC cell grade improvement for difluprednate-treated patients was similar to prednisolone-treated patients (2.1 vs. 1.9, respectively), proving noninferiority. At day 14, 68.8% of difluprednate patients had AC cell clearing (grade 0:≥ 1cell) compared with 61.5% of prednisolone patients. In the prednisolone-treated group, 12.5% of patients were withdrawn because of investigator-determined lack of efficacy; no difluprednate-treated patients were withdrawn for this reason (P=0.01).

4337,"('Fenoterol hydrobromide', 'Fenoterol hbr', 'Fenoterol (hydrobromide)', 'Phenoterol hydrobromide', 'Fenoterol bromide')",Medical," Fenoterol HBr is a bronchodilator known to be subject to first pass effect after oral administration. The aim of this study was to prepare and evaluate fenoterol HBr suppositories. Suppositories were prepared by a fusion method using different fatty bases, viz. Witepsol H15, Witepsol E75, Suppocire AP, and Suppocire BM, as well as different hydrophilic bases, viz. polyethylene glycol and poloxamer bases. In vitro release studies revealed a greater release of the drug from hydrophilic bases than from fatty bases. The effect of incorporating different types and concentrations of non-ionic surfactants (Tween 60 and Span 20) on the release rate of the drug from Witepsol H15, as a model fatty base, was investigated. Results showed an enhanced release at low surfactant concentrations. A very fast 100% drug release was achieved when the drug was incorporated as an aqueous solution in Witepsol H15 (F17). This formula was selected to test the effect of fenoterol HBr suppositories on histamine-induced bronchospasms in Guinea pigs. No dyspnea of the animals was recorded for up to 30 min. In addition, thermogel liquid suppositories of different poloxamer 188 and poloxamer 407 proportions in the presence of sodium alginate as a mucoadhesive polymer were prepared. The different formulations behaved similarly concerning sustainment of drug release, however, only the formula containing 15% poloxamer 188 and 25% poloxamer 407 (F20) showed optimal gelation at body temperature. In conclusion, among the studied suppository bases there are bases suitable for fast release of the drug like F17 and hydrophilic bases especially polyethylene glycol, as well as other bases for sustained release applications of fenoterol HBr like fatty and thermogel bases. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be effectively treated by the use of bronchodilator therapies delivered by inhalation. Berodual is a fixed combination of the anticholinergic agent ipratropium bromide (IB) and the beta2-adrenergic agonist fenoterol hydrobromide (FEN). IB/FEN has been available for the treatment of asthma and COPD in a pressurised metered dose inhaler (MDI) [pMDI] formulation for many years. The pMDI is the most widely used device for the delivery of inhaled medications, such as IB/FEN. However, most conventional pMDIs contain chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants, which are currently being withdrawn because of their detrimental effects on the environment. This has resulted in alternative methods of drug delivery being developed. Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler (SMI) is a new generation, propellant-free inhaler that generates a fine, slow-moving cloud (the Soft Mist) which can be easily inhaled. Scintigraphic studies have shown that this improves deposition of drugs in the lung and results in less oropharyngeal deposition than the CFC-MDI. A clinical development programme has been conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of IB/FEN delivered via Respimat SMI with that of IB/FEN via CFC-MDI in the treatment of patients with asthma or COPD. Five clinical studies (two phase II and three phase III) investigated dosages of IB/FEN 5/12.5 microg to 320/800 microg via Respimat SMI in single and multiple dose administration regimens. Four of the trials were conducted in patients with asthma (three in adults and one in children), while one phase III trial was conducted in patients with COPD. In phase III, 2058 patients participated, with a total of 1112 patients treated with IB/FEN via Respimat SMI. In the phase III studies, each dose from Respimat SMI was given in one actuation compared with two actuations with the CFC-MDI. In the paediatric asthma phase III study, all CFC-MDI doses were delivered via a spacer device. The results of the trials demonstrated that IB/FEN via Respimat SMI allows a reduction in the nominal dose of IB/FEN, while offering similar therapeutic efficacy and safety to a CFC-MDI. In children, Respimat SMI obviates the need for a spacer. The main objective of the study was to compare the long-term safety and tolerability of fenoterol hydrobromide delivered using a metered-dose inhaler formulated with the alternative propellant, hydrofluoroalkane 134a (HFA-MDI), with delivery using the currently available chlorofluorocarbon MDI (CFC-MDI; Berotec 100). A further objective was to compare the efficacy of fenoterol HFA-MDI with fenoterol CFC-MDI, using the pulmonary function parameters of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Following a 2-week run-in phase, a 12-week, double-blind parallel group comparison was undertaken in 290 patients randomized on a 2:1 basis to two puffs of 100 microg fenoterol four times a day (HFA-MDI=197 patients; CFC-MDI=93 patients). A total of 236 patients in this multi-centre study completed the trial as planned. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in both groups (29.9% of HFA-MDI patients and 28% of CFC-MDI patients). Reports of respiratory disorder AEs were also comparable (21.8% HFA-MDI; 22.6% CFCMDI). End of study laboratory tests, ECG, pulse, blood pressure and physical examination showed no significant differences from pre-study baselines in either group and both treatments appeared to be well tolerated. Pre-dose FEV1 measurements taken at the three clinic visits were constant and increase in FEV1 at 5 and 30 min post-dose demonstrated equivalent efficacy for the two formulations. No difference between the two groups was observed in PEF or in the use of rescue medication. We conclude from these findings that the long-term safety and efficacy profile of fenoterol HFA-MDI is comparable to that of the fenoterol CFC-MDI.",Fenoterol hydrobromide,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.891343557275832e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006726124323904514)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D01428?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=72, start_index=9, title='KEGG DRUG: Fenoterol hydrobromide', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D01428?utm_source=openai')])"
4338,"('Amoxicillin (amoxycillin)',)",Medical," A review of the published literature detailing the clinical use of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid spanning the period 1979 to 1992 was undertaken to assess the clinical efficacy of the product and to determine whether any changes had occurred during this time. In the 415 publications meeting the selection criteria a total of over 38,500 patients were treated with amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. Analysis of the data confirms the efficacy of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid over a wide range of clinical indications and annual and triennial groupings of publications suggests that there has been little change in the clinical effectiveness of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. Clinical efficacy rates (cure or improved) with amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were 88% and 92% in comparative and uncontrolled trials, respectively. Gastro-intestinal side effects are the most common adverse event but have been relatively infrequent. Amoxycillin/clavulanic acid should continue to be a useful antibiotic for upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin structure infections, dental, head and neck infections, and selected urinary tract infections. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor produced from Streptomyces clavuligerus, which when combined with certain beta-lactam antibiotics extends their activity against bacteria which owe their resistance to the production of beta-lacatamases. In combination with amoxycillin it extends the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin to include beta-lactamase-producing strains, which are otherwise resistant, as well as amoxycillin-resistant species such as Bacteroides fragilis. The addition of clavulanic acid to amoxycillin occasionally extends (but does not decrease) the susceptibility of amoxycillin-sensitive bacteria. Clavulanic acid is adequately absorbed after oral administration and its basic pharmacokinetic characteristics are similar to those of amoxycillin. Preliminary therapeutic trials suggest that amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid is effective in urinary tract infections caused by amoxycillin-resistant organisms and in lower respiratory tract infections unresponsive to previous routine antibiotic therapy, in hospitalised patients. It is generally well tolerated; nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and skin rash being the most frequently reported adverse effects.",Amoxicillin (amoxycillin),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.829164365422912e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005254269111901522)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Amoxicillin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin?utm_source=openai')])"
4339,"('Amoxicillin (trihydrate)', 'Amoxycillin (trihydrate)', 'Moxacin', 'Histocillin', 'Amoclen')",Medical,"Amoxicillin is an antibiotic medication belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family. The drug is used to treat bacterial infections such as middle ear infection, strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, odontogenic infections, and urinary tract infections. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth), or less commonly by either intramuscular injection or by an IV bolus injection, which is a relatively quick intravenous injection lasting from a couple of seconds to a few minutes. Common adverse effects include nausea and rash. It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea. It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin. While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful. Amoxicillin is in the β-lactam family of antibiotics. Amoxicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972. Amoxil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974, and in the United Kingdom in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children. Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 26th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 20 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections. === Acute otitis media === Children with acute otitis media who are younger than six months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotics. Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotics, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage. In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice. There is now evidence that two-times daily dosing or once-daily dosing has similar effectiveness. === Respiratory infections === Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective, and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects. Amoxicillin is considered the first-line empirical treatment for most cases of uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis in children and adults when culture data is unavailable. Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a macrolide. Research suggests that is as effective as co-amoxiclav (a broad-spectrum antibiotic) for people admitted to hospital with pneumonia, regardless of its severity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not ""severe"". Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis. === H. pylori === It is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for the treatment of stomach infections of Helicobacter pylori. It is typically combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (such as omeprazole) and a macrolide antibiotic (such as clarithromycin); other drug combinations are also effective. === Lyme borreliosis === Amoxicillin is effective for the treatment of early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis; the effectiveness and safety of oral amoxicillin is neither better nor worse than common alternatively-used antibiotics. === Odontogenic infections === Amoxicillin is used to treat odontogenic infections, infections of the tongue, lips, and other oral tissues. It may be prescribed following a tooth extraction, particularly in those with compromised immune systems. === Skin infections === Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections, such as acne vulgaris. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline. === Infections in infants in resource-limited settings === Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with gentamicin is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option. === Prevention of bacterial endocarditis === It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis and as a pain-reliever in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax. The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis. === Combination treatment === Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it may be combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav. === Spectrum of activity === It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, β-lactam antibiotic in the aminopenicillin family used to treat susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. In general, Streptococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, Haemophilus, Helicobacter, and Moraxella are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to it. Some E. coli and most clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics, including nausea, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Diarrhea (loose bowel movements) may also occur. Rarer adverse effects include mental and behavioral changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, hyperactivity, agitation, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these adverse effects. Similarly to other penicillins, amoxicillin has been associated with an increased risk of seizures. Amoxicillin-induced neurotoxicity has been especially associated with concentrations of greater than 110 mg/L. The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in the fingertips and around the groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously. However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased. For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the adverse effects can be fatal due to anaphylaxis. Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused a drug-induced immunoallergic-type hepatitis in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested lethargy, vomiting, and renal dysfunction. There is poor reporting of adverse effects of amoxicillin from clinical trials. For this reason, the severity and frequency of adverse effects from amoxicillin are probably higher than reported in clinical trials. === Nonallergic rash === Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or ampicillin) show a late-developing (>72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the ""amoxicillin rash"". The rash can also occur in adults and may rarely be a component of the DRESS syndrome. The rash is described as maculopapular or morbilliform (measles-like; therefore, in medical literature, it is called ""amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash"".). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two. A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. Some studies indicate about 80–90% of patients with acute Epstein–Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash. == Interactions == Amoxicillin may interact with these drugs: Anticoagulants (dabigatran, warfarin). Methotrexate (chemotherapy and immunosuppressant). Typhoid, Cholera and BCG vaccines. Probenecid reduces renal excretion and increases blood levels of amoxicillin. Oral contraceptives potentially become less effective. Allopurinol (gout treatment). Mycophenolate (immunosuppressant) When given intravenously or intramuscularly: It should not be mixed with blood products, or proteinaceous fluids (including protein hydrolysates) or with intravenous lipid emulsions aminoglycoside should be injected at a separate site from amoxicillin if the patient is prescribed both medications at the same time. Neither drug should be mixed in a syringe. Neither should they be mixed in an intravenous fluid container or giving set because of loss of activity of the aminoglycoside under these conditions. ciprofloxacin should not be mixed with amoxicillin. Infusions containing dextran or bicarbonate should not be mixed with amoxicillin solutions. == Pharmacology == Amoxicillin (α-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin with a structure similar to ampicillin but with better absorption when taken by mouth, thus yielding higher concentrations in blood and in urine. Amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is metabolized by the liver and excreted into the urine. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults. Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It is effective against streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Helicobacter pylori. As a derivative of ampicillin, amoxicillin is a member of the penicillin family and, like penicillins, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the bacterial cell wall. It has two ionizable groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group). == Chemistry == Amoxicillin is a β-lactam and aminopenicillin antibiotic in terms of chemical structure. It is structurally related to ampicillin. The experimental log P of amoxicillin is 0.87. It is described as an ""ambiphilic""—between hydrophilic and lipophilic—antibiotic. == History == Amoxicillin was one of several semisynthetic derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) developed by the Beecham Group in the 1960s. It was invented by Anthony Alfred Walter Long and John Herbert Charles Nayler, two British scientists. It became available in 1972 and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market (after ampicillin in 1961). Co-amoxiclav became available in 1981. == Society and culture == === Economics === Amoxicillin is relatively inexpensive. In 2022, a survey of eight generic antibiotics commonly prescribed in the United States found their average cost to be about $42.67, while amoxicillin was sold for $12.14 on average. === Modes of delivery === Pharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in trihydrate form, for oral use available as capsules, regular, chewable and dispersible tablets, syrup and pediatric suspension for oral use, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration. An extended-release is available. The intravenous form of amoxicillin is not sold in the United States. When an intravenous aminopenicillin is required in the United States, ampicillin is typically used. When there is an adequate response to ampicillin, the course of antibiotic therapy may often be completed with oral amoxicillin. Research with mice indicated successful delivery using intraperitoneally injected amoxicillin-bearing microparticles. === Names === Amoxicillin is the international nonproprietary name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and United States Adopted Name (USAN), while amoxycillin is the Australian Approved Name (AAN). Amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by the former pharmaceutical company Beecham Group. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under various brand names across the world. == Veterinary uses == Amoxicillin is also sometimes used as an antibiotic for animals. The use of amoxicillin for animals intended for human consumption (chickens, cattle, and swine for example) has been approved. == References == == Further reading == Neal MJ (2002).

4340,"('Digoxin', 'Lanoxin', 'Dilanacin', 'Lanoxicaps', 'Rougoxin')",Medical,"Digoxin (better known as digitalis), sold under the brand name Lanoxin among others, is a medication used to treat various heart conditions. Most frequently it is used for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and heart failure. Digoxin is one of the oldest medications used in the field of cardiology. It works by increasing myocardial contractility, increasing stroke volume and blood pressure, reducing heart rate, and somewhat extending the time frame of the contraction. Digoxin is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Digoxin has a half life of approximately 36 hours given at average doses in patients with normal renal function. It is excreted mostly unchanged in the urine. Common side effects include breast enlargement with other side effects generally due to an excessive dose. These side effects may include loss of appetite, nausea, trouble seeing, confusion, and an irregular heartbeat. Greater care is required in older people and those with poor kidney function. It is unclear whether use during pregnancy is safe. Digoxin is in the cardiac glycoside family of medications. It was first isolated in 1930 from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 241st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Irregular heartbeat === The most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, especially in older or less active patients, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers may be preferred in some patients, such as younger more active ones, or those without heart failure or hemodynamic instability. Early observational studies showed an increased risk of death in patients taking digoxin, despite an attempt to allow for other risk factors for death (so-called propensity score matching). However, systematic reviews focusing on randomised controlled trials of digoxin (which ensured similarity between patients on digoxin, and those not on it) showed no difference in mortality. Evidence suggested the increased mortality in patients taking digoxin was due to their having worse heart disease than those not taking it. Cardiac arrhythmias may also occur when patients are prescribed digoxin alongside thiazides and loop diuretics. === Heart failure === Digitalis (i.e. extracts, including digoxin, from the plant genus Digitalis) was the first drug used to treat dropsy (swollen ankles—a symptom of heart failure) following its discovery by William Withering. Alongside diuretics, it was the mainstay of treatment for heart failure for over a century. Since the introduction of other drugs with better outcomes and fewer adverse effects, it is generally now only used where heart failure is associated with atrial fibrillation and or a rapid ventricular rate. In certain circumstances it may be used under specialist guidance in addition to, or instead of, the recommended first-line treatments of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, and SGLT-2 inhibitor, where they are not effective or not tolerated. === Abortion === Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during abortions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise (measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration. == Side effects == The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal as of 2005. The combination of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular (AV) conduction (for example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block – so-called ""PAT with block"") is said to be pathognomonic (that is, diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin can lead to cardiac arrhythmias when given with thiazides and loop diuretics. This is because co-administration of digoxin with drugs such as thiazides and loop diuretics which can cause hypokalemia, low serum levels of potassium in the blood. This exacerbates the potential for cardiac arrhythmias because the low levels of potassium reduces the amount of K+ at the ATPase pump and increase calcium levels too much which leads to these arrhythmias. It can also cause visual disturbances as well as dizziness or fainting. Several other drugs associated with adverse drug reactions in concomitant use include verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, tetracycline, and erythromycin. == Overdose == In overdose, the usual supportive measures are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis of the cell membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab). The mechanism of action for drugs such as Digibind and Digifab, used when adverse events occur with the use of digoxin, is that the FAB regions on the antibodies created against digoxin expedite the excretion of the drug into urine. Therefore, the amount of digoxin in the body decreases quickly as it gets excreted rapidly. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Digoxin's primary mechanism of action involves inhibition of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase), mainly in the myocardium. This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium levels, resulting in decreased activity of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which normally imports three extracellular sodium ions into the cell and transports one intracellular calcium ion out of the cell. The reversal of this exchanger, triggered by the increase in intracellular sodium, results in an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. The increased calcium concentrations lead to the binding of more calcium to troponin C, which results in increased inotropy. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential. This leads to increased contractility (the force of contraction) of the heart without increasing heart energy expenditure. The inhibition of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in heart failure and may explain some of the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node. While it does increase the magnitude of myocardial contractility, the duration of the contraction is only slightly increased. Its use as an antiarrhythmic drug, then, comes from its direct and indirect parasympathetic stimulating properties. Vagus nerve stimulation slows down conduction at the AV node by increasing the refractory period of cardiac myocytes. The slowed AV node gives the ventricles more time to fill before contracting. This negative chronotropic effect is synergistic with the direct effect on cardiac pacemaker cells. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves, owing to improved filling. Overall, the heart rate is decreased while stroke volume is increased, resulting in a net increase in blood pressure, leading to increased tissue perfusion. This causes the myocardium to work more efficiently, with optimized hemodynamics and an improved ventricular function curve. Other electrical effects include a brief initial increase in action potential, followed by a decrease as the K+ conductance increases due to increased intracellular amounts of Ca2+ ions. The refractory period of the atria and ventricles is decreased, while it increases in the sinoatrial and AV nodes. A less negative resting membrane potential is made, leading to increased irritability. The conduction velocity increases in the atria, but decreases in the AV node. The effect upon Purkinje fibers and ventricles is negligible. Automaticity is also increased in the atria, AV node, Purkinje fibers, and ventricles. ECG changes seen in people taking digoxin include increased PR interval (due to decreased AV conduction) and a shortened QT interval. Also, the T wave may be inverted and accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV junctional rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Digoxin is also an M2 receptor muscarinic agonist. === Pharmacokinetics === Digoxin is usually given orally, but can also be given by IV injection in urgent situations (the IV injection should be slow, and heart rhythm should be monitored). While IV therapy may be better tolerated (less nausea), digoxin has a very long distribution half-life into the cardiac tissue, which will delay its onset of action by a number of hours. The half-life is about 36 hours for patients with normal renal function, digoxin is given once daily, usually in 125 μg or 250 μg doses. Digoxin elimination is mainly by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, which leads to significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs. Examples commonly used in patients with heart problems include spironolactone, verapamil and amiodarone. In patients with decreased kidney function the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd (volume of distribution), calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different glycoside, such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days and is eliminated by the liver. Effective plasma levels vary depending on the medical indication. For congestive heart failure, levels between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL are recommended. This recommendation is based on post hoc analysis of prospective trials, suggesting higher levels may be associated with increased mortality rates. For heart rate control (atrial fibrillation), plasma levels are less defined and are generally titrated to a goal heart rate. Typically, digoxin levels are considered therapeutic for heart rate control between 0.5 and 2.0 ng/mL (or 0.6 and 2.6 nmol/L). In suspected toxicity or ineffectiveness, digoxin levels should be monitored. Plasma potassium levels also need to be closely controlled (see side effects, below). Quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone increase plasma levels of digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully when coadministered. A study which looked to see if digoxin affected men and women differently found that digoxin did not reduce deaths overall, but did result in less hospitalization. Women who took digoxin died ""more frequently"" (33%) than women who took placebo (29%). Digoxin increased the risk of death in women by 23%. There was no difference in the death rate for men in the study. Digoxin is also used as a standard control substance to test for P-glycoprotein inhibition. Digoxin appears to be a peripherally selective drug due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. === Pharmacomicrobiomics === The bacteria Eggerthella lenta has been linked to a decrease in the toxicity of digoxin. These effects have been studied through comparisons of North Americans and Southern Indians, in which a reduced digoxin metabolite profile correlates with E. lenta abundance. Further studies have also revealed an increase in digoxin toxicity when used alongside erythromycin or tetracycline, the researches attributed this to the decrease in the E. lenta population. == History == Derivatives of plants of the genus Digitalis have a long history of medical use. Nicholas Culpeper referred to various medical uses for foxglove in his 1652 publication The English physician. William Withering is credited with the first published description of the systematic use of Digitalis derivatives in his 1785 book An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases. Its use was somewhat sporadic until Sir James Mackenzie identified the phenomenon of atrial fibrillation, and the actions of digitalis on this. Its effects were first explained by Arthur Robertson Cushny. The name is a portmanteau, derived from Digitalis lanata and toxin. In 1930, digoxin was first isolated by Dr. Sydney Smith from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata. Initially, the digoxin was purified by dissolving the dried plant material in acetone and boiling the solution in chloroform. The solution was then reacted with acetic acid and small amount of ferric chloride and sulfuric acid (Keller reaction). Digoxin was distinguishable from other glucosides by the olive-green colored solution produced from this reaction, completely free of red. == Society and culture == Charles Cullen admitted in 2003 to killing as many as 40 hospital patients with overdoses of heart medication—usually digoxin—at hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over his 19-year career as a nurse. On March 10, 2006, he was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences and is not eligible for parole. On April 25, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release alerting the public to a Class I recall of Digitek, a brand of digoxin produced by Mylan. Some tablets had been released at double thickness and therefore double strength, causing some patients to experience digoxin toxicity. A class-action lawsuit against the Icelandic generic drug maker Actavis was announced two weeks later. On March 31, 2009, the FDA announced another generic digoxin pill recall by posting this company press release on the agency's web site: ""Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. Announces a Nationwide Voluntary Recall of All Lots of Digoxin Tablets Due to Size Variability"". A March 31 press release from Caraco, a generic pharmaceutical company, stated: [All] tablets of Caraco brand Digoxin, USP, 0.125 mg, and Digoxin, USP, 0.25 mg, distributed prior to March 31, 2009, which are not expired and are within the expiration date of September, 2011, are being voluntarily recalled to the consumer level. The tablets are being recalled because they may differ in size and therefore could have more or less of the active ingredient, digoxin. A 2008 study suggested digoxin has beneficial effects not only for the heart, but also in reducing the risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, comments on this study suggested that digoxin is not effective at reducing cancer risk at therapeutic concentrations of the drug, so the results need further investigation. === Brand names === Digoxin preparations are marketed under the brand names Cardigox; Cardiogoxin; Cardioxin; Cardoxin; Coragoxine; Digacin; Digicor; Digitek; Digomal; Digon; Digosin; Digoxine Navtivelle; Digoxina-Sandoz; Digoxin-Sandoz; Digoxin-Zori; Dilanacin; Eudigox; Fargoxin; Grexin; Lanacordin; Lanacrist; Lanicor; Lanikor; Lanorale; Lanoxicaps; Lanoxin; Lanoxin PG; Lenoxicaps; Lenoxin; Lifusin; Mapluxin; Natigoxin; Novodigal; Purgoxin; Sigmaxin; Sigmaxin-PG; Toloxin. == Digoxin and cancer == Cardiac glycosides, particularly digoxin, have been conventionally used for treatment of common cardiac problems, mainly heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. The interaction of digoxin and cancer has also been studied. Despite existence of numerous preclinical studies that investigated the anticancer effects of digoxin, there are no solid and conclusive results so far. Several studies have suggested that digoxin may have anticancer properties, others not. Digoxin, as a cardiac glycoside, has a chemical structure basically similar to that of estradiol. Digoxin has the ability to bind oestrogen receptors, and therefore it has been proposed that it might increase the risk of oestrogen-sensitive breast and uterine cancers. A large Danish study found a complicated picture, with slightly increased risk of breast cancer amongst women taking digoxin, but better prognostic features. The Nurses' Health Study found a similar slight increase of risk. Digoxin inhibits the proliferation of many cancerous cell lines in vitro, but its relevance to cancer in vivo remains unclear. == References == == Further reading ==",Rougoxin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.089030422270298), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007420408655889332), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00412838626652956)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0019286326132714748)])","('INFO; https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB007228 ', [])"

Since the introduction of other drugs with better outcomes and fewer adverse effects, it is generally now only used where heart failure is associated with atrial fibrillation and or a rapid ventricular rate. In certain circumstances it may be used under specialist guidance in addition to, or instead of, the recommended first-line treatments of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, and SGLT-2 inhibitor, where they are not effective or not tolerated. === Abortion === Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during abortions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise (measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration. == Side effects == The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal as of 2005. The combination of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular (AV) conduction (for example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block – so-called ""PAT with block"") is said to be pathognomonic (that is, diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin can lead to cardiac arrhythmias when given with thiazides and loop diuretics. This is because co-administration of digoxin with drugs such as thiazides and loop diuretics which can cause hypokalemia, low serum levels of potassium in the blood. This exacerbates the potential for cardiac arrhythmias because the low levels of potassium reduces the amount of K+ at the ATPase pump and increase calcium levels too much which leads to these arrhythmias. It can also cause visual disturbances as well as dizziness or fainting. Several other drugs associated with adverse drug reactions in concomitant use include verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, tetracycline, and erythromycin. == Overdose == In overdose, the usual supportive measures are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis of the cell membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab). The mechanism of action for drugs such as Digibind and Digifab, used when adverse events occur with the use of digoxin, is that the FAB regions on the antibodies created against digoxin expedite the excretion of the drug into urine. Therefore, the amount of digoxin in the body decreases quickly as it gets excreted rapidly. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Digoxin's primary mechanism of action involves inhibition of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase), mainly in the myocardium. This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium levels, resulting in decreased activity of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which normally imports three extracellular sodium ions into the cell and transports one intracellular calcium ion out of the cell. The reversal of this exchanger, triggered by the increase in intracellular sodium, results in an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. The increased calcium concentrations lead to the binding of more calcium to troponin C, which results in increased inotropy. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential. This leads to increased contractility (the force of contraction) of the heart without increasing heart energy expenditure. The inhibition of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in heart failure and may explain some of the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node. While it does increase the magnitude of myocardial contractility, the duration of the contraction is only slightly increased. Its use as an antiarrhythmic drug, then, comes from its direct and indirect parasympathetic stimulating properties. Vagus nerve stimulation slows down conduction at the AV node by increasing the refractory period of cardiac myocytes. The slowed AV node gives the ventricles more time to fill before contracting. This negative chronotropic effect is synergistic with the direct effect on cardiac pacemaker cells. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves, owing to improved filling. Overall, the heart rate is decreased while stroke volume is increased, resulting in a net increase in blood pressure, leading to increased tissue perfusion. This causes the myocardium to work more efficiently, with optimized hemodynamics and an improved ventricular function curve. Other electrical effects include a brief initial increase in action potential, followed by a decrease as the K+ conductance increases due to increased intracellular amounts of Ca2+ ions. The refractory period of the atria and ventricles is decreased, while it increases in the sinoatrial and AV nodes. A less negative resting membrane potential is made, leading to increased irritability. The conduction velocity increases in the atria, but decreases in the AV node. The effect upon Purkinje fibers and ventricles is negligible. Automaticity is also increased in the atria, AV node, Purkinje fibers, and ventricles. ECG changes seen in people taking digoxin include increased PR interval (due to decreased AV conduction) and a shortened QT interval. Also, the T wave may be inverted and accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV junctional rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Digoxin is also an M2 receptor muscarinic agonist. === Pharmacokinetics === Digoxin is usually given orally, but can also be given by IV injection in urgent situations (the IV injection should be slow, and heart rhythm should be monitored). While IV therapy may be better tolerated (less nausea), digoxin has a very long distribution half-life into the cardiac tissue, which will delay its onset of action by a number of hours. The half-life is about 36 hours for patients with normal renal function, digoxin is given once daily, usually in 125 μg or 250 μg doses. Digoxin elimination is mainly by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, which leads to significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs. Examples commonly used in patients with heart problems include spironolactone, verapamil and amiodarone. In patients with decreased kidney function the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd (volume of distribution), calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different glycoside, such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days and is eliminated by the liver. Effective plasma levels vary depending on the medical indication. For congestive heart failure, levels between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL are recommended. This recommendation is based on post hoc analysis of prospective trials, suggesting higher levels may be associated with increased mortality rates. For heart rate control (atrial fibrillation), plasma levels are less defined and are generally titrated to a goal heart rate. Typically, digoxin levels are considered therapeutic for heart rate control between 0.5 and 2.0 ng/mL (or 0.6 and 2.6 nmol/L). In suspected toxicity or ineffectiveness, digoxin levels should be monitored. Plasma potassium levels also need to be closely controlled (see side effects, below). Quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone increase plasma levels of digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully when coadministered. A study which looked to see if digoxin affected men and women differently found that digoxin did not reduce deaths overall, but did result in less hospitalization. Women who took digoxin died ""more frequently"" (33%) than women who took placebo (29%). Digoxin increased the risk of death in women by 23%. There was no difference in the death rate for men in the study. Digoxin is also used as a standard control substance to test for P-glycoprotein inhibition. Digoxin appears to be a peripherally selective drug due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. === Pharmacomicrobiomics === The bacteria Eggerthella lenta has been linked to a decrease in the toxicity of digoxin. These effects have been studied through comparisons of North Americans and Southern Indians, in which a reduced digoxin metabolite profile correlates with E. lenta abundance. Further studies have also revealed an increase in digoxin toxicity when used alongside erythromycin or tetracycline, the researches attributed this to the decrease in the E. lenta population. == History == Derivatives of plants of the genus Digitalis have a long history of medical use. Nicholas Culpeper referred to various medical uses for foxglove in his 1652 publication The English physician. William Withering is credited with the first published description of the systematic use of Digitalis derivatives in his 1785 book An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases. Its use was somewhat sporadic until Sir James Mackenzie identified the phenomenon of atrial fibrillation, and the actions of digitalis on this. Its effects were first explained by Arthur Robertson Cushny. The name is a portmanteau, derived from Digitalis lanata and toxin. In 1930, digoxin was first isolated by Dr. Sydney Smith from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata. Initially, the digoxin was purified by dissolving the dried plant material in acetone and boiling the solution in chloroform. The solution was then reacted with acetic acid and small amount of ferric chloride and sulfuric acid (Keller reaction). Digoxin was distinguishable from other glucosides by the olive-green colored solution produced from this reaction, completely free of red. == Society and culture == Charles Cullen admitted in 2003 to killing as many as 40 hospital patients with overdoses of heart medication—usually digoxin—at hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over his 19-year career as a nurse. On March 10, 2006, he was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences and is not eligible for parole. On April 25, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release alerting the public to a Class I recall of Digitek, a brand of digoxin produced by Mylan. Some tablets had been released at double thickness and therefore double strength, causing some patients to experience digoxin toxicity. A class-action lawsuit against the Icelandic generic drug maker Actavis was announced two weeks later. On March 31, 2009, the FDA announced another generic digoxin pill recall by posting this company press release on the agency's web site: ""Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. Announces a Nationwide Voluntary Recall of All Lots of Digoxin Tablets Due to Size Variability"". A March 31 press release from Caraco, a generic pharmaceutical company, stated: [All] tablets of Caraco brand Digoxin, USP, 0.125 mg, and Digoxin, USP, 0.25 mg, distributed prior to March 31, 2009, which are not expired and are within the expiration date of September, 2011, are being voluntarily recalled to the consumer level. The tablets are being recalled because they may differ in size and therefore could have more or less of the active ingredient, digoxin. A 2008 study suggested digoxin has beneficial effects not only for the heart, but also in reducing the risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, comments on this study suggested that digoxin is not effective at reducing cancer risk at therapeutic concentrations of the drug, so the results need further investigation. === Brand names === Digoxin preparations are marketed under the brand names Cardigox; Cardiogoxin; Cardioxin; Cardoxin; Coragoxine; Digacin; Digicor; Digitek; Digomal; Digon; Digosin; Digoxine Navtivelle; Digoxina-Sandoz; Digoxin-Sandoz; Digoxin-Zori; Dilanacin; Eudigox; Fargoxin; Grexin; Lanacordin; Lanacrist; Lanicor; Lanikor; Lanorale; Lanoxicaps; Lanoxin; Lanoxin PG; Lenoxicaps; Lenoxin; Lifusin; Mapluxin; Natigoxin; Novodigal; Purgoxin; Sigmaxin; Sigmaxin-PG; Toloxin. == Digoxin and cancer == Cardiac glycosides, particularly digoxin, have been conventionally used for treatment of common cardiac problems, mainly heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. The interaction of digoxin and cancer has also been studied. Despite existence of numerous preclinical studies that investigated the anticancer effects of digoxin, there are no solid and conclusive results so far. Several studies have suggested that digoxin may have anticancer properties, others not. Digoxin, as a cardiac glycoside, has a chemical structure basically similar to that of estradiol. Digoxin has the ability to bind oestrogen receptors, and therefore it has been proposed that it might increase the risk of oestrogen-sensitive breast and uterine cancers. A large Danish study found a complicated picture, with slightly increased risk of breast cancer amongst women taking digoxin, but better prognostic features. The Nurses' Health Study found a similar slight increase of risk. Digoxin inhibits the proliferation of many cancerous cell lines in vitro, but its relevance to cancer in vivo remains unclear. == References == == Further reading ==",Lanacrist,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4121114822482923e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00023326536756940186), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00672778207808733)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacycode.com](https://pharmacycode.com/Lanacrist.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Lanacrist - Cardiotonic Agents, Antiarrhythmic Agents, ATC:C01AA02, ATC:C01AA05, ATC:C01AA08', type='url_citation', url='https://pharmacycode.com/Lanacrist.html?utm_source=openai')])"

4346,"('Enalaprilate; enalaprilic acid; mk 421 diacid',)",Medical," Enalaprilat (MK-422), a new and potent angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitor, and its monoethyl ester precursor, enalapril, were studied in a single pass perfused rat liver preparation under constant perfusate flow (10 ml/min) at concentrations of 0.29-0.41 microM for 14C-enalapril and 0.01-0.015 microM for 3H- enalaprilat . During their simultaneous delivery to the same rat liver preparation, the steady state hepatic extraction ratio of 14C-enalapril was high (0.861 +/- 0.02) and 14C- enalaprilat appeared rapidly in effluent perfusate plasma. Of the enalapril dose, 22.7 +/- 6.9% appeared in bile. 14C- Enalaprilat accounted for 79% of the total radioactivity in bile (18% of dose) whereas 14C-enalapril was present only as 10% of the total (2.3% of dose). By contrast, the steady state hepatic extraction of 3H- enalaprilat was very low (0.053) and the disappearance was virtually identical to the appearance of 3H- enalaprilat in bile. These findings suggest that diffusional barrier exists for enalaprilat as the preformed metabolite, which hinders penetration into hepatocytes, and therefore, elimination. The precursor, enalapril, effectively brings enalaprilat into hepatocytes were more extensive biliary excretion of the generated metabolite takes place. This account adds to our further understanding of metabolite kinetics; in addition to the uneven distribution of enzyme system and the intrinsic clearance for metabolite formation and elimination, the presence of a diffusional barrier is another important determinant which may cause deviations between the kinetics of a generated and performed metabolite. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of captopril attenuates the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To determine whether these effects are related to inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme we assessed the effects of chronic i.c.v. administration of MK-422 (a converting enzyme inhibitor chemically unrelated to captopril) on arterial pressure and vascular reactivity in young (seven-week-old) male SHR. MK-422 (0.2 or 1.0 microgram/h, osmotic mini pump) was infused into the lateral ventrical for 4 weeks. Control SHR received artificial CSF i.c.v., or 0.2 microgram/h MK-422 i.v. Vascular reactivity to phenylephrine, vasopressin and direct sympathetic nerve stimulation was assessed in renal and mesenteric vascular beds using miniaturized pulsed Doppler flow probes. MK-422 attenuated the development of hypertension. Arterial pressure at 4 weeks of treatment was: SHR-i.c.v. MK-422 (0.1 microgram/h): 137 +/- 3.4; (1.0 microgram/h): 138 +/- 2.9; SHR i.v. MK-422 176 +/- 4.5 and SHR control: 168 +/- 4.9 mmHg (P less than 0.01). SHR-i.c.v. MK-422 showed significantly attenuated increases in mesenteric vascular reactivity in response to vasoconstrictors, nerves and sympathetic nervous stimulation. Dose and frequency response curves were characterized by a shift to the right and a significant decrease in the slopes. In conclusion, both captopril and MK-422 prevent the development of hypertension in SHR, presumably by blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme, suggesting that the brain renin-angiotensin system contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension in that model. The effects of 14-day trandolapril or enalapril treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were studied on blood pressure and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity measured ex vivo in various organs. Both ACE inhibitors caused dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and ACE activity, trandolapril being 30- and 400- to 1,000-fold more active than enalapril on blood pressure and ACE activity, respectively. However, comparison of ACE inhibitory activities of the diacid forms of trandolapril and enalapril, i.e., trandolaprilat and enalaprilat, measured in vitro on various tissues, showed that trandolaprilat was only three- to fivefold more active than enalaprilat. To understand the reasons for such discrepancies between ex vivo effects of ACE inhibitors and in vitro actions of their diacid metabolites, we measured the lipophilicities of the compounds and investigated the possibility that trandolapril could display an ACE inhibitory effect by itself. Trandolaprilat was found to be far more lipophilic than enalaprilat, as shown by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography studies performed at pH 7.4 (log kw7.4 = 1.487 vs. 0.108). In addition, trandolapril was practically as active in vitro as its diacid metabolite (IC50 = 2.5 vs. 1.35 nM) in inhibiting ACE activity in the aorta, whereas enalapril was practically devoid of any effect (IC50 = 240 nM). Measurements of relative affinities of inhibitors or metabolites for purified human renal ACE showed that trandolapril displayed about 20% of the affinity of its diacid metabolite (IC50 = 15 vs. 3.2 nM); enalaprilat affinity (34 nM) was within the same range as those of trandolapril and trandolaprilat, whereas enalapril displayed a very low affinity for the purified enzyme (IC50 = 50 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Enalaprilate; enalaprilic acid; mk 421 diacid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7432603272027336e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008237544680014253), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02325919084250927)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6295819/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6301792/?utm_source=openai), [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1401601/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=276, start_index=9, title='Pharmacological properties of the converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate (MK-421) - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6295819/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=276, start_index=9, title='Enalapril maleate (MK-421), a potent, nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor: absorption, disposition, and metabolism in man - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6301792/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=276, start_index=9, title='Effect of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor MK 421 and its lysine analogue on the components of the renin system in healthy subjects. - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1401601/?utm_source=openai')])"
4347,"('Benzonatate', 'Benzononatine', 'Tessalon', 'Benzononantin', 'Exangit')",Medical,"Benzonatate (), sold under the brand name Tessalon among others, is a medication that is used for the symptomatic relief of cough. Benzonatate is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within 20 minutes and last between 3 and 8 hours. Side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, headache, upset stomach, skin rash, hallucinations, and allergic reactions. Overdosage can result in serious adverse effects including seizures, irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, and death. Overdose of only a small number of capsules can be fatal. Chewing or sucking on the capsule, releasing the drug into the mouth, can also lead to laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and circulatory collapse. It is unclear if use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Benzonatate is a local anesthetic and voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. It is theorized to work by inhibiting stretch receptors in the lungs, in turn suppressing the cough reflex in the brain. Benzonatate is structurally related to other local anesthetics like procaine and tetracaine. Benzonatate was discovered in 1956 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1958. It is available as a generic medication. Availability worldwide is limited, with the drug remaining marketed only in the United States and Mexico. In 2022, it was the 130th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. A 2023 systematic review found that there is inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of benzonatate for cough and highlighted rising safety concerns. == Medical uses == === Cough === Benzonatate is a prescription non-opioid alternative for the symptomatic relief of cough. It has been found to improve cough associated with a variety of respiratory conditions including asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, pneumothorax, opioid-resistant cough in lung cancer, and emphysema. Benzonatate also reduces the consistency and volume of sputum production associated with cough in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Compared to codeine, benzonatate has been reported to be more effective in reducing the frequency of induced cough in experiments. Benzonatate does not treat the underlying cause of the cough. According to a 2001 literature review, more than 29 clinical studies have assessed benzonatate for the treatment of cough in more than 2,100 patients. A systematic review of the literature of benzonatate for cough was published in 2023. The review identified 37 relevant articles including 21 cohort studies, 5 experimental studies, and 11 case studies and series. The data were of very low quality. Most of the studies on benzonatate are decades old and were conducted shortly after its introduction. The systematic review concluded that there is inadequate evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of benzonatate and emphasized rising safety concerns surrounding the drug. It further concluded that there is a need for large observational studies or randomized trials to assess the place of benzonatate in modern medicine. === Hiccups === Benzonatate has been reported to be useful in the suppression of hiccups. === Intubation === Benzonatate acts as a local anesthetic and the liquid inside the capsule can be applied in the mouth to numb the oropharynx for awake intubation. However, there can be life-threatening adverse effects when the medication is absorbed by the oral mucosa, including choking, hypersensitivity reactions, and circulatory collapse. === Available forms === Benzonatate is available in the form of 100, 150, and 200 mg oral capsules. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity to benzonatate or any related compounds is a contraindication to its administration. == Side effects == Benzonatate is generally well-tolerated if the liquid-capsule is swallowed intact. Potential adverse effects of benzonatate include: Constipation, dizziness, fatigue, stuffy nose, nausea, and headache are frequently reported. Sedation, a feeling of numbness in the chest, sensation of burning in the eyes, a vague ""chilly"" sensation, itchiness, and rashes are also possible. Ingestion of a small handful of capsules has caused seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, and death in adults. === Hypersensitivity reactions === Benzonatate is structurally related to anesthetic medications of the para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) class which includes procaine and tetracaine. Procaine and tetracaine, previously used heavily in the fields of dentistry and anesthesiology, have fallen out of favor due to allergies associated with their metabolites. Similarly, severe hypersensitivity reactions to benzonatate have been reported and include symptoms of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and cardiovascular collapse. These reactions are possibly associated with chewing, sucking, or crushing the capsule in the mouth. === Improper use === Benzonatate should be swallowed whole. Crushing or sucking on the liquid-filled capsule, or ""softgel"", will cause release of benzonatate from the capsule and can produce a temporary local anesthesia of the oral mucosa. Rapid development of numbness of the tongue and choking can occur. In severe cases, excessive absorption can lead to laryngospasm, bronchospasm, seizures, and circulatory collapse. This may be due to a hypersensitivity reaction to benzonatate or a systemic local anesthetic toxicity, both of which have similar symptoms. There is a potential for these adverse effects to occur at a therapeutic dose, that is, a single capsule if chewed or sucked on in the mouth. === Psychiatric effects === Isolated cases of bizarre behavior, mental confusion, and visual hallucinations have been reported during concurrent use with other prescribed medications. Central nervous system effects associated with other para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) derivative local anesthetics, for example procaine or tetracaine, could occur with benzonatate and should be considered. === Children === Safety and efficacy in children below the age of ten have not been established. Accidental ingestion resulting in death has been reported in children below the age of ten. Benzonatate may be attractive to children due to its appearance, a round-shaped liquid-filled gelatin capsule, which looks like candy. Chewing or sucking of a single capsule can cause death of a small child. Signs and symptoms can occur rapidly after ingestion (within 15–20 minutes) and include restlessness, tremors, convulsions, coma, and cardiac arrest. Death has been reported within one hour of ingestion. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is not known if benzonatate can cause fetal harm to a pregnant woman or if it can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with benzonatate to evaluate its teratogenicity. It is not known whether benzonatate is excreted in human milk. == Overdose == Benzonatate is chemically similar to other local anesthetics such as tetracaine and procaine, and shares their pharmacology and toxicology. Benzonatate overdose is characterized by symptoms of restlessness, tremors, seizures, abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmia), cerebral edema, absent breathing (apnea), fast heart beat (tachycardia), and in severe cases, coma and death. Symptoms develop rapidly, typically within 5 minutes to 1 hour of ingestion. Treatment focuses on the removal of gastric contents and managing symptoms of sedation, convulsions, apnea, and cardiac arrhythmia. Despite a long history of safe and appropriate usage, the safety margin of benzonatate is reportedly narrow. Toxicity above the therapeutic dose is relatively low and ingestion of a small handful of pills can cause symptoms of overdose. Children are at an increased risk for toxicity, which has occurred with administration of only one or two capsules. Following cardiopulmonary collapse with benzonatate overdose, most people have significant neurological deficits or other end-organ damage. Due to increasing usage of benzonatate and the rapid onset of symptoms, there are accumulating cases of benzonatate overdose deaths, especially in children. == Pharmacology == Benzonatate is chemically similar to other local anesthetics such as tetracaine and procaine, and shares their pharmacology. === Pharmacodynamics === Similar to other local anesthetics, benzonatate is a potent voltage-gated sodium channel blocker. After absorption and circulation to the respiratory tract, benzonatate acts as a local anesthetic, decreasing the sensitivity of vagal afferent fibers and stretch receptors in the bronchi, alveoli, and pleura in the lower airway and lung. This dampens their activity and reduces the cough reflex. Benzonatate also has central antitussive activity on the cough center in central nervous system at the level of the medulla. However, there is minimal inhibition of the respiratory center at a therapeutic dosage. === Pharmacokinetics === The antitussive effect of benzonatate begins within 15 to 20 minutes after oral administration and typically lasts between 3 and 8 hours. The elimination half-life of benzonatate has been reported to be 1 hour. Benzonatate is hydrolyzed by plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) to the metabolite 4-(butylamino)benzoic acid (BABA) as well as polyethylene glycol monomethyl ethers. Like many other local anesthetic esters, the hydrolysis of the parent compound is rapid. There are concerns that those with pseudocholinesterase deficiencies may have an increased sensitivity to benzonatate as this hydrolysis is impaired, leading to increased levels of circulating medication. Aside from oral administration, benzonatate has also been used by a variety of other routes, including rectal administration, subcutaneous injection, intramuscular injection, and intravenous infusion. == Chemistry == Benzonatate is a butylamine, para-amino-benzoic acid, or long-chain polyglycol, structurally related to other ester local anesthetics such as procaine and tetracaine. The molecular weight of benzonatate is 603.7 g/mol. However, the reference standard for benzonatate is a mixture of n-ethoxy compounds, differing in the abundance of 7 to 9 repeating units, with an average molecular weight of 612.23 g/mol. There is also evidence that the compound is not uniform between manufacturers. == History == Benzonatate was first synthesized in 1956 and was introduced as an antitussive in the United States in 1958. == Society and culture == Benzonatate was first made available in the United States in 1958 as a prescription medication for the treatment of cough in individuals over the age of 10. There is a variety of prescription opioid-based cough relievers, such as hydrocodone and codeine, but have unwanted side effects and potential of abuse and diversion. However, benzonatate is currently the only prescription non-opioid antitussive and its usage has been rapidly increasing. The exact reasons of this increase are unclear. === Economics === In the United States between 2004 and 2009, prescriptions increased 50% from 3.1 million to 4.7 million, the market share of benzonatate among antitussives increased from 6.3% to 13%, and the estimated number of children under the age of 10 years receiving benzonatate increased from 10,000 to 19,000. Throughout this same period, greater than 90% of prescriptions were given to those 18 or older. The majority of prescriptions were given by general, family, internal, and physicians with pediatricians accounting for about 3% of prescribed benzonatate. In 2022, it was the 130th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. === Brand names === Tessalon is a brand name version of benzonatate manufactured by Pfizer. It is available as perles (capsules). Zonatuss was a brand name manufactured by Atley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Vertical Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Other brand names of benzonatate include Exangit, Tessalin, Tesalon, Tusical, Tusitato, and Ventussin. === Availability === Benzonatate is available in the United States and Mexico. == References ==",Exangit,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.107425062713446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06270606070756912), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06249622255563736)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4348,"('Flunixin meglumin', 'Banamine', 'Sch 14714 meglumine', 'Flumeglumine', 'Flunixin-s')",Medical,"Flunixin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), analgesic, and antipyretic used in horses, cattle and pigs. It is often formulated as the meglumine salt. In the United States, it is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and may only be lawfully distributed by order of a licensed veterinarian. There are many trade names for the product. == Dosage and uses in horses == Flunixin is administered at a dose of 1.1 mg/kg. The full analgesic and antipyretic effects usually occur 1–2 hours following treatment, but there is often an effective analgesic effect within approximately 15 minutes. Despite its short plasma half life of 1.6–2.5 hours, effects can persist for up to 30 hours, with maximal effects occurring between 2 and 16 hours. This is likely due to accumulation of the drug at inflammatory foci. Flunixin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Because it targets the inflamed tissue, flunixin is mainly used for colic pain, musculoskeletal pain, and ocular pain. It is also used as an antipyretic and to reduce the effects of endotoxemia. == Side effects and precautions == Flunixin is labeled for no more than 5 days of consecutive use and prolonged use increases the risk of toxicity. In horses, this includes gastric ulcers, right dorsal colitis, and nephrotoxicity. Flunixin is a prohibited substance under International Federation for Equestrian Sports rules, and its use is prohibited or restricted by many other equestrian organizations. At labeled dose (1.1 mg/kg) given IV, detection time was found to be 144 hours. However, drug recycling from bedding contamination by treated horses has been shown to potentially increase the clearance time. == Administration == Flunixin may be given orally as a paste, as granules in feed, or intravenously(IV). It is strongly recommended that it not be administered intramuscularly (IM) as it is very irritating to tissue and IM administration has been associated with myonecrosis in horses, so IV administration is preferred. Administration of phenylbutazone to a horse also receiving flunixin has been shown to increase the risk of toxicity without improving analgesia. For this reason, concurrent administration with another NSAID is not recommended. Doubling the dose of flunixin produces no improvement in analgesia, while potentially increasing the risk of toxicity. In the US, the only labeled route for flunixin administration in cattle is intravenous and pour-on. This is not the case in other countries; for example, in the UK, Allevenix is licensed for IV and intramuscular use, and a pour-on product also exists. In the US flunixin is not labelled for goat use, however, flunixin may be used in goats in an extra-label fashion under appropriate veterinary guidance. Flunixin administered subcutaneously to dairy goats may carry a milk withdraw recommendation of 36-60 hours. Interestingly, when given subcutaneously to goats in that study, tissue injury, such as seen in horses with intramuscular administration, was not observed. == See also == Clonixin == References == == External links == Flunixin meglumine Archived 2007-09-27 at the Wayback Machine Flunixin Meglumine For Veterinary Use Flunixin licensing in the UK provided by Norbrook",Banamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.023255610838532448)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008155851624906063), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10031452775001526)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/banamine-transdermal-nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory-drug-approved-control-pain-cattle-foot-rot,https://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/species/cattle/products/banamine-injectable-solution,https://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/species/equine/products/banamine-paste ', [])"

The uptake of DHA into microglia is essential for it to exert its neuroprotective effects. However, quantifying the uptake of DHA into microglia is complicated by the presence of endogenous DHA interfering with any quantification technique. A sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was therefore developed and validated in order to assess the microglial uptake of docosahexaenoic acid-d5 (DHA-d5) as a surrogate for DHA. Using a mobile phase consisting of 90 % (v/v) acetonitrile and 10 % (v/v) water containing 2 mM ammonium acetate, a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, and MS/MS detection in the negative ionization mode, DHA-d5 was detected at m/z transitions of 332.1/228.3/234.2, with good linearity between chromatographic area under the curve (AUC) and DHA-d5 mass (R While the processes governing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) trafficking across the blood-brain barrier have been elucidated, factors governing DHA uptake into microglia, an essential step for this fatty acid to exert its anti-inflammatory effects, are unknown. This study assessed the mRNA and protein expression of fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) and fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) in mouse BV-2 cells and their mRNA expression in primary mouse microglia. The microglial uptake of DHA-d5, a surrogate of DHA, was assessed by LC-MS/MS following interventions including temperature reduction, silencing of various FABP isoforms, competition with DHA, and metabolic inhibition. It was found that DHA-d5 uptake at 4°C was 39.6% lower than at 37°C, suggesting that microglial uptake of DHA-d5 likely involves passive and/or active uptake mechanisms. Of all FABP and FATP isoforms probed, only FABP3, FABP4, FABP5, FATP1, and FATP4 were expressed at both the mRNA and protein level. Silencing of FABP3, FABP4, and FABP5 resulted in no change in cellular DHA-d5 uptake, nor did concomitant DHA administration or the presence of 0.1% sodium azide/50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose.

Vitamin K1 hydroquinone (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinol) had no effect, in contrast with its effect in the intact system, where it can substitute for vitamin K1 plus NADH. The ability of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase to restore carboxylation in a system without vitamin K epoxidase activity shows that there is no obligatory coupling of the vitamin K1-dependent carboxylation with vitamin K1 epoxidation.

Similar to other nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), abacavir is used together with other HIV medications, and is not recommended by itself. It is taken by mouth as a tablet or solution and may be used in children over the age of three months. Abacavir is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include vomiting, insomnia (trouble sleeping), fever, and feeling tired. Other common side effects include loss of appetite, headache, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhea, rash, and lethargy (lack of energy). More severe side effects include hypersensitivity, liver damage, and lactic acidosis. Genetic testing can indicate whether a person is at higher risk of developing hypersensitivity. Symptoms of hypersensitivity include rash, vomiting, and shortness of breath. Abacavir is in the NRTI class of medications, which work by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme needed for HIV virus replication. Within the NRTI class, abacavir is a carbocyclic nucleoside. Abacavir was patented in 1988, and approved for use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Abacavir is used together with other HIV medications, such as abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and abacavir/lamivudine. The combination abacavir/lamivudine is an essential medicine. == Medical uses == Abacavir, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir should be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents. == Contraindications == Abacavir is contraindicated for people who have the HLA‑B*5701 allele or who have moderate or severe liver disease (hepatic impairment). == Side effects == Common adverse reactions include nausea, headache, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, Anorexia (symptom) (loss of appetite), and insomnia (trouble sleeping). Rare but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, elevated AST and ALT, depression, anxiety, fever/chills, URI, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and lipodystrophy. === Hypersensitivity syndrome === Hypersensitivity to abacavir is strongly associated with a specific allele at the human leukocyte antigen B locus namely HLA-B*5701. The mechanism for this hypersensitivity reaction is due to abacavir binding in the antigen-binding cleft of HLA-B*57:01, allowing alternative peptides to bind, which appear as ""non-self"" when presented to T cells. There is an association between the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and ancestry. The prevalence of the allele is estimated to be 3.4 to 5.8 percent on average in populations of European ancestry, 17.6 percent in Indian Americans, 3.0 percent in Hispanic Americans, and 1.2 percent in Chinese Americans. There is significant variability in the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 among African populations. In African Americans, the prevalence is estimated to be 1.0 percent on average, 0 percent in the Yoruba from Nigeria, 3.3 percent in the Luhya from Kenya, and 13.6 percent in the Masai from Kenya, although the average values are derived from highly variable frequencies within sample groups. Common symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome include fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. Some patients may also develop a skin rash. Symptoms of AHS typically manifest within six weeks of treatment using abacavir, although they may be confused with symptoms of HIV, immune reconstitution syndrome, hypersensitivity syndromes associated with other drugs, or infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an alert concerning abacavir and abacavir-containing medications on 24 July 2008, and the FDA-approved drug label for abacavir recommends pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and the use of alternative therapy in subjects with this allele. Additionally, both the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommend use of an alternative therapy in individuals with the HLA-B*5701 allele. Skin-patch testing may also be used to determine whether an individual will experience a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, although some patients susceptible to developing AHS may not react to the patch test. The development of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of abacavir therapy in all patients, including patients who do not possess the HLA-B*5701 allele. On 1 March 2011, the FDA informed the public about an ongoing safety review of abacavir and a possible increased risk of heart attack associated with the drug. A meta-analysis of 26 studies conducted by the FDA, however, did not find any association between abacavir use and heart attack === Immunopathogenesis === The mechanism underlying abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is related to the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in immunological tolerance and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific cytotoxic T cells, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome. == Interaction == Abacavir, and in general NRTIs, do not undergo hepatic metabolism and therefore have very limited (to none) interaction with the CYP enzymes and drugs that effect these enzymes. That being said there are still few interactions that can affect the absorption or the availability of abacavir. Below are few of the common established drug and food interaction that can take place during abacavir co-administration: Protease inhibitors such as tipranavir or ritonovir may decrease the serum concentration of abacavir through induction of glucuronidation. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation. Ethanol may result in increased levels of abacavir through the inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation. Methadone may diminish the therapeutic effect of Abacavir. Abacavir may decrease the serum concentration of Methadone. Orlistat may decrease the serum concentration of antiretroviral drugs. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully established but it is suspected that it is due to the decreased absorption of abacavir by orlistat. Cabozantinib: Drugs from the MRP2 inhibitor (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 inhibitors) family such as abacavir could increase the serum concentration of Cabozantinib. == Mechanism of action == Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits viral replication. It is a guanosine analogue that is phosphorylated to carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP). CBV-TP competes with the viral molecules and is incorporated into the viral DNA. Once CBV-TP is integrated into the viral DNA, transcription and HIV reverse transcriptase is inhibited. == Pharmacokinetics == Abacavir is given orally and is rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability of 83%. Solution and tablet have comparable concentrations and bioavailability. Abacavir can be taken with or without food. Abacavir can cross the blood–brain barrier. Abacavir is metabolized primarily through the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase to an inactive carboxylate and glucuronide metabolites. It has a half-life of approximately 1.5-2.0 hours. If a person has liver failure, abacavir's half life is increased by 58%. Abacavir is eliminated via excretion in the urine (83%) and feces (16%). It is unclear whether abacavir can be removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == History == Robert Vince and Susan Daluge along with Mei Hua, a visiting scientist from China, developed the medication in the '80s. Abacavir was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1998, and is the fifteenth approved antiretroviral drug in the United States. == Synthesis == == References == == Further reading == == External links == Abacavir pathway on PharmGKB",Ziagen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.540453326422721e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004573014739435166)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ziagen.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Ziagen Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ziagen.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4352,"('Ergocalciferol', 'Calciferol', 'Viosterol', 'Ercalciol', 'Ergorone')",Medical,"Ergocalciferol, also known as vitamin D2 and nonspecifically calciferol, is a type of vitamin D found in food. It is used as a dietary supplement to prevent and treat vitamin D deficiency due to poor absorption by the intestines or liver disease. It may also be used for low blood calcium due to hypoparathyroidism. It is taken by mouth or via injection into a muscle. Excessive doses can result in vitamin D toxicity causing increased urine production, high blood pressure, kidney stones, kidney failure, muscle weakness, and constipation. If high doses are taken for a long period of time, tissue calcification may occur. Normal doses are safe in pregnancy. It works by increasing the amount of calcium absorbed by the intestines and reabsorbed by the kidneys. Food in which it is found include some mushrooms. Ergocalciferol was first described in 1936. Ergocalciferol is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2022, it was the 38th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions. Certain foods such as breakfast cereal and margarine have ergocalciferol added to them in some countries. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Use == Ergocalciferol may be used as a vitamin D supplement, whereas cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is produced naturally by the skin when exposed to ultraviolet light. Ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) are considered to be equivalent for vitamin D production, as both forms appear to have similar efficacy in ameliorating rickets and reducing the incidence of falls in elderly patients. Conflicting reports exist, however, concerning the relative effectiveness, with some studies suggesting that ergocalciferol has less efficacy based on limitations in absorption, binding, and inactivation. A meta-analysis concluded that evidence usually favors cholecalciferol in raising vitamin D levels in blood, although it stated more research is needed. == Mechanism == Ergocalciferol is a secosteroid formed by a photochemical bond breaking of a steroid, specifically, by the action of ultraviolet light (UV-B or UV-C) on ergosterol, a form of provitamin D2. Like cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol is inactive by itself. It requires two hydroxylations to become active: the first in the liver by CYP2R1 to form 25-hydroxyergocalciferol (ercalcidiol or 25-OH D2), and the second in the kidney by CYP27B1, to form the active 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol (ercalcitriol or 1,25-(OH)2D2), which activates the vitamin D receptor. Unlike cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxylation is not performed by CYP27A1 for ergocalciferol. Ergocalciferol and metabolites have lower affinity to the vitamin D-binding protein compared to the D3 counterparts. The binding affinity of ercalcitriol to the vitamin D receptor is similar to that of calcitriol. Ergocalciferol itself and metabolites can be deactivated by 24-hydroxylation. == Sources == Fungus, from USDA nutrient database (per 100g), D2 + D3: Mushrooms, Agaricus bisporus: raw portobello: 0.3 μg (10 IU); exposed to ultraviolet light: 11.2 μg (446 IU) raw crimini: 0.1 μg (3 IU); exposed to ultraviolet light: 31.9 μg (1276 IU) Mushrooms, shiitake: raw: Vitamin D (D2 + D3): 0.4 μg (18 IU) dried: Vitamin D (D2 + D3): 3.9 μg (154 IU) Lichen Cladina arbuscula specimens grown under different natural conditions contain provitamin D2 and vitamin D2, ranges 89–146 and 0.22–0.55 μg/g dry matter respectively. They also contain vitamin D3 (range 0.67 to 2.04 μg/g) although provitamin D3 could not be detected. Vitamin D levels correlate positively with UV irradiation. Plantae Alfalfa (Medicago sativa subsp. sativa), shoot: 4.8 μg (192 IU) vitamin D2, 0.1 μg (4 IU) vitamin D3 === Biosynthesis === The vitamin D2 content in mushrooms and C. arbuscula increase with exposure to ultraviolet light. Ergosterol (provitamin D2) found in these fungi is converted to previtamin D2 on UV exposure, which then turns into vitamin D2. As cultured mushrooms are generally grown in darkness, less vitamin D2 is found compared to those grown in the wild or dried in the sun. When fresh mushrooms or dried powders are purposely exposed to ultraviolet light, vitamin D2 levels can be concentrated to much higher levels. The irradiation procedure does not cause significant discoloration, or whitening, of mushrooms. Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx. 2 oz or 60 grams) of fresh mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light have increased vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms or 3200 IU if exposed to just five minutes of UV light after being harvested. Button mushrooms with enhanced vitamin D2 content produced this way functions similarly to a vitamin D2 supplement; both effectively improves vitamin D status. Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread or mushrooms is bioavailable and increases blood levels of 25(OH)D. == Names == Viosterol, the name given to early preparations of irradiated ergosterol, is essentially synonymous with ergocalciferol. However, currently, Viosterol is also the brand name for cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in some countries. Ergocalciferol is manufactured and sold under various brand names, including Deltalin (Eli Lilly and Company), Drisdol (Sanofi-Synthelabo), and Calcidol (Patrin Pharma). == References == == External links == NIST Chemistry WebBook page for ergocalciferol",Ergorone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.01833922602236271), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.006717863027006388)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.2261187881231308), ('ICAL', -2.622600959512056e-06), (',', -6.079655122448457e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0024878999684005976), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47420209646224976)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C22122,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C07543,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ergone,https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/E/Ergorone.html,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C15785,https://plantaedb.com/compounds/ergone,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5124230/ ', [])"
4353,"('Ergocalciferol (vitamin d2)-d6', 'Oleovitamin d2;ergocalciferol; calciferol; ercalciol;d2, vitamin')",Medical," Our understanding of the mechanism of action of vitamin D has been broadened by the discovery of the extrarenal 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) in various vitamin D target tissues around the body and the implications of this for the putative paracrine actions of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃. This review updates our current knowledge of the cytochrome P450-mediated steps of vitamin D activation (CYP2R1, CYP27B1) and inactivation (CYP24A1, CYP3A4) and the newest physiological roles of vitamin D. The review goes on to examine how well exogenously supplied vitamin D compounds, whether dietary vitamin D₂ supplements or prescribed vitamin D analogs, substitute for their natural counterparts; how in some cases vitamin D can be used in conjunction with vitamin D analogs; and the overall impact of these supplements and drugs on the components of the vitamin D signal transduction machinery. Commercial mushroom production can expose mushrooms post-harvest to UV light for purposes of vitamin D2 enrichment by converting the naturally occurring provitamin D2 (ergosterol). The objectives of the present study were to artificially simulate solar UV-B doses occurring naturally in Central Europe and to investigate vitamin D2 and vitamin D4 production in sliced Agaricus bisporus (button mushrooms) and to analyse and compare the agaritine content of naturally and artificially UV-irradiated mushrooms. Agaritine was measured for safety aspects even though there is no rationale for a link between UV light exposure and agaritine content. The artificial UV-B dose of 0.53 J/cm(2) raised the vitamin D2 content to significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of 67.1 ± 9.9 μg/g dry weight (DW) than sun exposure (3.9 ± 0.8 μg/g dry DW). We observed a positive correlation between vitamin D4 and vitamin D2 production (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.001) after artificial UV irradiation, with vitamin D4 levels ranging from 0 to 20.9 μg/g DW. The agaritine content varied widely but remained within normal ranges in all samples. Irrespective of the irradiation source, agaritine dropped dramatically in conjunction with all UV-B doses both artificial and natural solar, probably due to its known instability. The biological action of vitamin D from UV-exposed mushrooms reflects the activity of these two major vitamin D analogues (D2, D4). Vitamin D4 should be analysed and agaritine disregarded in future studies of UV-exposed mushrooms. Extraction, lipid-reduction, and chromatographic methods suitable for the resolution and subsequent quantitation of vitamin D2, vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 from human milk are described. This procedure utilizes a methanol:methylene chloride extraction, precipitation of unwanted lipids with cold methanol and ether, backwash with alkaline buffer, silica Sep-Pak preparative chromatography, normal- and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with final quantitation of the antirachitic sterols by competitive protein binding assay. The described assay was used to determine these antirachitic sterols in milk from women receiving various supplements of vitamin D or undergoing ultraviolet phototherapy.","Oleovitamin d2;ergocalciferol; calciferol; ercalciol;d2, vitamin",PUBMED,"('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.6441793441772461), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.31327739357948303), (' MED', -0.2660912871360779), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.513892650604248), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0006387577159330249), ('ĠMED', -0.20615240931510925), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.25195831060409546), ('ĠEND', -0.008539588190615177), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007389436941593885)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.3132616877555847), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a616042.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergocalciferol ', [])"
4354,"('Selegiline hydrochloride', 'Eldepryl', 'Selegiline hcl', 'Zelapar', 'Deprenyl hydrochloride')",Medical,"Selegiline, also known as L-deprenyl and sold under the brand names Eldepryl, Zelapar, and Emsam among others, is a medication which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and major depressive disorder. It has also been studied and used off-label for a variety of other indications, but has not been formally approved for any other use. The medication, in the form licensed for depression, has modest effectiveness for this condition that is similar to that of other antidepressants. Selegiline is provided as a swallowed tablet or capsule or an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) for Parkinson's disease and as a patch applied to skin for depression. Side effects of selegiline occurring more often than with placebo include insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety, abnormal dreams, and application site reactions (with the patch form), among others. At high doses, selegiline has the potential for dangerous food and drug interactions, such as tyramine-related hypertensive crisis (the so-called ""cheese reaction"") and risk of serotonin syndrome. However, doses within the approved clinical range appear to have little to no risk of these interactions. In addition, the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline have reduced risks of such interactions compared to the conventional oral form. Selegiline has no known misuse potential or dependence liability and is not a controlled substance except in Japan. Selegiline acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and thereby increases levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. At typical clinical doses used for Parkinson's disease, selegiline is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), increasing brain levels of dopamine. At higher doses, it loses its specificity for MAO-B and also inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), which increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain as well. In addition to its MAOI activity, selegiline is a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) and enhances the impulse-mediated release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. This action may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. After administration, selegiline partially metabolizes into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, which act as norepinephrine releasing agents (NRAs) and may contribute to its therapeutic and adverse effects as well. The levels of these metabolites are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline. Chemically, selegiline is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine, a derivative of methamphetamine, and the purified levorotatory enantiomer of deprenyl (the racemic mixture of selegiline and D-deprenyl). Deprenyl was discovered and studied as an antidepressant in the early 1960s by Zoltan Ecseri, József Knoll, and other colleagues at Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company in Hungary. Subsequently, selegiline was purified from deprenyl and was studied and developed itself. Selegiline was first introduced for medical use, to treat Parkinson's disease, in Hungary in 1977. It was subsequently approved in the United Kingdom in 1982 and in the United States in 1989. The ODT was approved for Parkinson's disease in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in 2010, while the patch was introduced for depression in the United States in 2006. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor to be discovered and marketed. In addition to its medical use, there has been interest in selegiline as a potential anti-aging drug and nootropic. However, effects of this sort are controversial and uncertain. Generic versions of selegiline are available in the case of the conventional oral form, but not in the case of the ODT or transdermal patch forms. == Medical uses == === Parkinson's disease === In its oral and ODT forms, selegiline is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is most often used as an adjunct to medications such as levodopa (L-DOPA), although it has been used off-label as a monotherapy. The rationale for adding selegiline to levodopa is to decrease the required dose of levodopa and thus reduce the motor complications of levodopa therapy. Selegiline delays the point when levodopa treatment becomes necessary from about 11 months to about 18 months after diagnosis. There is some evidence that selegiline acts as a neuroprotective and reduces the rate of disease progression, though this is disputed. In addition to parkinsonism, selegiline can improve symptoms of depression in people with Parkinson's disease. There is evidence that selegiline may be more effective than rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This may be due to pharmacological differences between the drugs, such as the catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) actions of selegiline which rasagiline lacks. === Depression === Selegiline is used as an antidepressant in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Both the oral selegiline and transdermal selegiline patch formulations are used in the treatment of depression. However, oral selegiline is not approved for depression and is used off-label for this indication, while the transdermal patch is specifically licensed for treatment of depression. Both standard clinical doses of oral selegiline (up to 10 mg/day) and higher doses of oral selegiline (e.g., 30 to 60 mg/day) have been used to treat depression, with the lower doses selectively inhibiting MAO-B and the higher doses producing dual inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B. Unlike oral selegiline, transdermal selegiline bypasses first-pass metabolism, thereby avoiding inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A and minimizing the risk of food and drug interactions, whilst still allowing for selegiline to reach the brain and inhibit MAO-B. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness and safety of selegiline in the treatment of psychiatric disorders including depression. It included both randomized and non-randomized published clinical studies. The meta-analysis found that selegiline was more effective than placebo in terms of reduction in depressive symptoms (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = −0.96, k = 10, n = 1,308), response rates for depression improvement (RRTooltip risk ratio = 1.61, k = 9, n = 1,238), and response rates for improvement of depression with atypical features (RR = 2.23, k = 3, n = 136). Oral selegiline was significantly more effective than the selegiline patch in terms of depressive symptom improvement (SMD = −1.49, k = 6, n = 282 vs. SMD = −0.27, k = 4, n = 1,026, respectively; p = 0.03). However, this was largely due to older and less methodologically rigorous trials that were at high risk for bias. Oral selegiline studies also often employed much higher doses than usual, for instance 20 to 60 mg/day. The quality of evidence of selegiline for depression was rated as very low overall, very low for oral selegiline, and low to moderate for transdermal selegiline. For comparison, meta-analyses of other antidepressants for depression have found a mean effect size of about 0.3 (a small effect), which is similar to that with transdermal selegiline. In two pivotal regulatory clinical trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration, the selegiline transdermal patch decreased scores on depression rating scales (specifically the 17- and 28-item HDRSTooltip Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) by 9.0 to 10.9 points, whereas placebo decreased scores by 6.5 to 8.6 points, giving placebo-subtracted differences attributable to selegiline of 2.4 to 2.5 points. A 2013 quantitative review of the transdermal selegiline patch for depression, which pooled the results of these two trials, found that the placebo-subtracted number needed to treat (NNT) was 11 in terms of depression response (>50% reduction in symptoms) and 9 in terms of remission of depression (score of ≤10 on the MADRSTooltip Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). For comparison, other antidepressants, including fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, vilazodone, adjunctive aripiprazole, olanzapine/fluoxetine, and extended-release quetiapine, have NNTs ranging from 6 to 8 in terms of depression response and 7 to 14 in terms of depression remission. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that transdermal selegiline has similar effectiveness to other antidepressants. NNTs are measures of effect size and indicate how many individuals would need to be treated in order to encounter one additional outcome of interest. Lower NNTs are better, and NNTs corresponding to Cohen's d effect sizes have been defined as 2.3 for a large effect (d = 0.8), 3.6 for a medium effect (d = 0.5), and 8.9 for a small effect (d = 0.2). The effectiveness of transdermal selegiline for depression relative to side effects and discontinuation was considered to be favorable. While several large regulatory clinical trials of transdermal selegiline versus placebo for depression have been conducted, there is a lack of trials comparing selegiline to other antidepressants. Although multiple doses of transdermal selegiline were assessed, a dose–response relationship for depression was never established. Transdermal selegiline has shown similar clinical effectiveness in the treatment of atypical depression relative to typical depression and in the treatment of anxious depression relative to non-anxious depression. Transdermal selegiline does not cause sexual dysfunction and may improve certain domains of sexual function, for instance sexual interest, maintaining interest during sex, and sexual satisfaction. These benefits were apparent in women but not in men. The lack of sexual dysfunction with transdermal selegiline is in contrast to many other antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which are associated with high rates of sexual dysfunction. Transdermal selegiline patches have been underutilized in the treatment of depression compared to other antidepressants. A variety of factors contributing to this underutilization have been identified. One major factor is the very high cost of transdermal selegiline, which is often not covered by insurance and frequently proves to be prohibitive. Conversely, other widely available antidepressants are much cheaper in comparison. === Available forms === Selegiline is available in the following three pharmaceutical forms: Oral tablets and capsules 5 mg (brand names Eldepryl, Jumex, and generics) – indicated for Parkinson's disease Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) 1.25 mg (brand name Zelapar) – indicated for Parkinson's disease Transdermal patches 6, 9, and 12 mg/24 hours (brand name Emsam) – indicated for major depressive disorder The transdermal patch form is also known as the ""selegiline transdermal system"" or ""STS"" and is applied once daily. They are 20, 30, or 40 cm2 in size and contain a total of 20, 30, or 40 mg selegiline per patch (so 20 mg/20 cm2, 30 mg/30 cm2, and 40 mg/40 cm2), respectively. The selegiline transdermal patch is a matrix-type adhesive patch with a three-layer structure. It is the only approved non-oral MAOI, having reduced dietary restrictions and side effects in comparison to oral MAOIs, and is also the only approved non-oral first-line antidepressant. The selegiline patch can be useful for those who have difficulty tolerating oral medications. == Contraindications == Selegiline is contraindicated with serotonergic antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with serotonergic opioids like meperidine, tramadol, and methadone, with other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as linezolid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine, and with dextromethorphan, St. John's wort, cyclobenzaprine, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and carbamazepine. Combination of selegiline with serotonergic agents may cause serotonin syndrome, while combination of selegiline with adrenergic or sympathomimetic agents like ephedrine or amphetamines may cause hypertensive crisis. Long washout periods are required before starting and stopping these medications with discontinuation or initiation of selegiline. Consumption of tyramine-rich foods can result in hypertensive crisis with selegiline, also known as the ""cheese effect"" or ""cheese reaction"" due to the high amounts of tyramine present in some cheeses. Examples of other foods that may have high amounts of tyramine and similar substances include yeast products, chicken liver, snails, pickled herring, red wines, some beers, canned figs, broad beans, chocolate, and cream products. The preceding drug and food contraindications are dependent on selegiline dose and route, and hence are not necessarily absolute contraindications. While high oral doses of selegiline (≥20 mg/day) can cause such interactions, oral doses within the approved clinical range (≤10 mg/day) appear to have little to no risk of these interactions. In addition, the ODT and transdermal forms of selegiline have reduced risks of such interactions compared to the conventional oral form. Selegiline is also contraindicated in children less than 12 years of age and in people with pheochromocytoma, both due to heightened risk of hypertensive crisis. For all human uses and all forms, selegiline is pregnancy category C, meaning that studies in pregnant animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus but there are no adequate studies in humans. == Side effects == Side effects of the tablet form in conjunction with levodopa include, in decreasing order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, increased involuntary movements, agitation, slow or irregular heart rate, delusions, hypertension, new or increased angina pectoris, and syncope. Most of the side effects are due to a high dopamine levels, and can be alleviated by reducing the dose of levodopa. Selegiline can also cause cardiovascular side effects such as orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other types of cardiac arrhythmias. The main side effects of the patch form for depression include application-site reactions, insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, nervousness, and abnormal dreams. The selegiline patch carries a black box warning about a possible increased risk of suicide, especially for young people, as do all antidepressants since 2007. Side effects of selegiline that have been identified as occurring significantly more often than with placebo in meta-analyses for psychiatric disorders have included dry mouth (RRTooltip Risk ratio = 1.58), insomnia (RR = 1.61, NNHTooltip Number needed to harm = 19), and application site reactions with the transdermal form (RR = 1.81, NNH = 7). No significant diarrhea, headache, dizziness, nausea, sexual dysfunction, or weight gain were apparent in these meta-analyses. Selegiline, including in its oral, ODT, and patch forms, has been found to cause hypotension or orthostatic hypotension in some individuals. In a clinical trial, the rate of systolic orthostatic hypotension was 21% versus 9% with placebo and the rate of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was 12% versus 4% with placebo in people with Parkinson's disease taking the ODT form of selegiline. The risk of hypotension is greater at the start of treatment and in the elderly (3% vs. 0% with placebo). The rate of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension with the selegiline patch was 2.2% versus 0.5% with placebo in clinical trials of people with depression. Significant orthostatic blood pressure changes (≥10 mm Hg decrease) occurred in 9.8% versus 6.7% with placebo, but most of these cases were asymptomatic and heart rate was unchanged. The rates of other orthostatic hypotension-related side effects in this population were dizziness or vertigo 4.9% versus 3.1% with placebo and fainting 0.5% versus 0.0% with placebo. It is said that orthostatic hypotension is rarely seen with the selegiline transdermal patch compared to oral MAOIs. Caution is advised against rapidly rising after sitting or lying, especially after prolonged periods or at the start of treatment, as this can result in fainting. Falls are of particular concern in the elderly. MAOIs like selegiline may lower blood pressure by increasing dopamine levels and activating dopamine receptors, by increasing levels of the false neurotransmitter octopamine, and/or by other mechanisms. Meta-analyses published in the 1990s found that the addition of selegiline to levodopa increased mortality in people with Parkinson's disease. However, several subsequent meta-analyses with more trials and patients found no increase in mortality with selegiline added to levodopa. If selegiline does increase mortality, it has been theorized that this may be due to cardiovascular side effects, such as its amphetamine-related sympathomimetic effects and its MAO inhibition-related hypotension. Although selegiline does not seem to increase mortality, it appears to worsen cognition in people with Parkinson's disease over time. Conversely, rasagiline does not seem to do so and can enhance cognition. Rarely, selegiline has been reported to induce or exacerbate impulse control disorders, pathological gambling, hypersexuality, and paraphilias in people with Parkinson's disease. However, MAO-B inhibitors like selegiline causing impulse control disorders is uncommon, controversial, and less frequent than with dopamine receptor agonists like pramipexole. Impulse control disorders with dopaminergic agents have been linked specifically to activation of dopamine D3 receptors in the globus pallidus. Selegiline has also been reported to activate or worsen rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in some people with Parkinson's disease. Selegiline has shown little or no misuse potential in humans or monkeys. Likewise, it has no dependence potential in rodents. This is in spite of its amphetamine active metabolites, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, and is in contrast to agents like dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine. However, selegiline can strongly potentiate the reinforcing effects of exogenous β-phenethylamine by inhibiting its MAO-B-mediated metabolism. Misuse of the combination of selegiline and β-phenethylamine has been reported. == Overdose == Little information is available about clinically significant selegiline overdose. The drug has been studied clinically at doses as high as 60 mg/day orally, 10 mg/day as an ODT, and 12 mg/24 hours as a transdermal patch. In addition, deprenyl (the racemic form) has been clinically studied orally at doses as large as 100 mg/day. During clinical development of oral selegiline, some individuals who were exposed to doses of 600 mg developed severe hypotension and psychomotor agitation. Overdose may result in non-selective inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B and may be similar to overdose of other non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and tranylcypromine. Serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and/or death may occur with overdose. No specific antidote to selegiline overdose is available. == Interactions == === Serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis === Both the oral and patch forms of selegiline come with strong warnings against combining it with drugs that could produce serotonin syndrome, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the cough medicine dextromethorphan. Selegiline in combination with the opioid analgesic pethidine is not recommended, as it can lead to severe adverse effects. Several other synthetic opioids such as tramadol and methadone, as well as various triptans, are also contraindicated due to potential for serotonin syndrome. All three forms of selegiline carry warnings about food restrictions to avoid hypertensive crisis that are associated with MAOIs. The patch form was created in part to overcome food restrictions; clinical trials showed that it was successful. Additionally, in post-marketing surveillance from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141 exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data. The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6 mg/24 hours, does not require any dietary restrictions. Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor (RIMA) moclobemide, require a low-tyramine diet. A study found that selegiline in transdermal patch form did not importantly modify the pharmacodynamic effects or pharmacokinetics of the sympathomimetic agents pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Likewise, oral selegiline at an MAO-B-selective dosage did not appear to modify the pharmacodynamic effects or pharmacokinetics of intravenous methamphetamine in another study. Conversely, selegiline, also at MAO-B-selective doses, has been found to reduce the physiological and euphoric subjective effects of cocaine whilst not affecting its pharmacokinetics in some studies but not in others. Cautious safe combination of MAOIs like selegiline with stimulants like lisdexamfetamine has been reported. However, a hypertensive crisis with selegiline and ephedrine has also been reported. The selegiline drug labels warn about combination of selegiline with indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents, like amphetamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, due to the potential risk of hypertensive crisis, and recommend monitoring blood pressure with such combinations. The combination of selegiline with certain other medications, like phenylephrine and buspirone, is also warned against for similar reasons. In the case of phenylephrine, this drug is substantially metabolized by monoamine oxidase, including by both MAO-A and MAO-B. Selegiline can interact with exogenous dopamine, which is metabolized by MAO-A and MAO-B, and result in hypertensive crisis as well. Besides norepinephrine releasing agents, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) may be safe in combination with MAOIs like selegiline. Potent NRIs, such as reboxetine, desipramine, protriptyline, and nortriptyline, can reduce or block the pressor effects of tyramine, including in those taking MAOIs. This is by inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and preventing entry of tyramine into presynaptic noradrenergic neurons where tyramine induces the release of norepinephrine. As a result, NRIs may reduce the risk of tyramine-related hypertensive crisis in people taking MAOIs. Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), like methylphenidate and bupropion, are also considered to be safe in combination with MAOIs. However, initiation at low doses and slow upward dose titration is advisable in the case of both NRIs and NDRIs due to possible potentiation of their effects and side effects by MAOIs. Selegiline may potentiate the effects of serotonergic psychedelics that are MAO-B substrates, such as 2C drugs like 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-E. === Cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers === The cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of selegiline have not been fully elucidated. CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotypes did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of selegiline, suggesting that these enzymes are minimally involved in its metabolism and that inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes would not importantly affect its pharmacokinetics. However, although most pharmacokinetic variables were unaffected, overall exposure to selegiline's metabolite levomethamphetamine was 46% higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers and exposure to its metabolite desmethylselegiline was 68% higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers. As with the cases of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, the strong CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitor itraconazole has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline, suggesting lack of major involvement of this enzyme as well. On the other hand, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, which is known to act as a strong inducer of CYP3A enzymes, has paradoxically been found to increase exposure to selegiline and its metabolites levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine by approximately 2-fold (with selegiline used as the transdermal patch form). One enzyme thought to be majorly involved in the metabolism of selegiline based on in-vitro studies is CYP2B6. However, there are no clinical studies of different CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotypes or of CYP2B6 inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline. In addition to CYP2B6, CYP2A6 may be involved in the metabolism of selegiline to a lesser extent. Birth control pills containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol and a progestin like gestodene or levonorgestrel have been found to increase peak levels and overall exposure to oral selegiline by 10- to 20-fold. High levels of selegiline can lead to loss of MAO-B selectivity and inhibition of MAO-A as well. This increases susceptibility to side effects and interactions of non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergic medications. However, this study had a small sample size of four individuals as well as other methodological limitations. The precise mechanism underlying the interaction is unknown, but is likely related to cytochrome P450 inhibition and consequent inhibition of selegiline first-pass metabolism by ethinylestradiol. In contrast to birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol, menopausal hormone therapy with estradiol and levonorgestrel did not modify peak levels of selegiline and only modestly increased overall exposure (+59%). Hence, menopausal hormone therapy does not pose the same risk of interaction as ethinylestradiol-containing birth control pills when taken together with selegiline. Overall exposure to selegiline with oral selegiline has been found to be 23-fold lower in people taking anticonvulsants known to strongly activate drug-metabolizing enzymes. The anticonvulsants included phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and amobarbital. In a previous study however, carbamazepine specifically did not reduce selegiline exposure. Phenobarbital and certain other anticonvulsants are known to strongly induce CYP2B6, one of the major enzymes believed to be involved in selegiline metabolism. As such, it was concluded that strong CYP2B6 induction was most likely responsible for the dramatically reduced exposure to selegiline observed in the study. === Selegiline inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes === Selegiline has been reported to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2A6. It is a mechanism-based inhibitor (suicide inhibitor) of CYP2B6 and has been said to ""potently"" or ""strongly"" inhibit this enzyme in vitro. It may inhibit the metabolism of bupropion, a major CYP2B6 substrate, into its active metabolite hydroxybupropion. However, a study predicted that inhibition of CYP2B6 by selegiline would non-significantly affect exposure to bupropion. Selegiline has not been listed or described as a clinically significant CYP2B6 inhibitor by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of 2023. One small study observing three patients found that selegiline was safe and well-tolerated in combination with bupropion. In addition to CYP2B6 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, selegiline is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2A6 and may increase exposure to nicotine (a major CYP2A6 substrate). By inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP1A2, selegiline may inhibit its own metabolism and thereby interact with itself. === Other interactions === Dopamine antagonists like antipsychotics or metoclopramide, which block dopamine receptors and thereby antagonize the dopaminergic effects of selegiline, could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the medication. Dopamine-depleting agents like reserpine and tetrabenazine, by reducing dopamine levels, can also oppose the effectiveness of dopaminergic medications like selegiline. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Selegiline has multiple known mechanisms of action in terms of its pharmacodynamic activity. It is most notably an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, it is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) at lower doses (≤10 mg/day) but additionally inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) at higher doses (≥20 mg/day). MAO-B inhibition is thought to result in increased levels of dopamine and β-phenethylamine, whereas MAO-A inhibition results in increased levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Selegiline is also a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) and enhances the action potential-evoked release of norepinephrine and dopamine. The CAE activity of selegiline may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Both the MAOI activity and CAE activity of selegiline may be involved in its therapeutic effects in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and depression. According to József Knoll and other researchers, selegiline might have dopaminergic neuroprotective effects, might be able to modestly slow the rate of aging-related dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and might thereby have a disease-modifying effect in Parkinson's disease and antiaging effects generally. However, these theoretical effects of selegiline have not been clearly demonstrated in humans as of present and remain to be substantiated. Through its active metabolites levomethamphetamine (L-MA) and levoamphetamine (L-A), selegiline acts as a weak norepinephrine and/or dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). The clinical significance of this action is unclear, but it may be relevant to the effects and side effects of selegiline, especially at higher doses. Its active metabolite desmethylselegiline (DMS) also has MAOI and CAE activity and likely contributes to its effects as well. Levels of selegiline's metabolites are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline than with the oral form and this may result in differences in its effects and side effects. === Pharmacokinetics === Selegiline is available in forms for use by multiple different routes of administration and its pharmacokinetics vary by route. The bioavailability of the oral form of selegiline is 4 to 10%, of the ODT is 5 to 8 times that of the oral form, and of the transdermal patch is 75%. The time to peak levels of selegiline with oral administration is about 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The plasma protein binding of selegiline is 85 to 90%. It is metabolized extensively in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2B6 among other enzymes. Metabolites of selegiline include desmethylselegiline (DMS), levomethamphetamine (L-MA), and levoamphetamine (L-A). The oral form of selegiline is subject to strong first-pass metabolism and levels of the metabolites of selegiline are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms than with the oral form. The elimination half-lives of selegiline and its metabolites range from 1.2 to 10 hours for selegiline, 2.2 to 9.5 hours for DMS, 14 to 21 hours for levomethamphetamine, and 16 to 18 hours for levoamphetamine. Selegiline and its metabolites are eliminated mainly in urine (87% in urine and 15% in feces via oral administration), with its metabolites accounting for virtually all of the eliminated material in the case of the oral form. Hepatic impairment and renal impairment have been found to dramatically increase exposure to selegiline. == Chemistry == Selegiline is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is also known as (R)-(–)-N,α-dimethyl-N-(2-propynyl)phenethylamine, (R)-(–)-N-methyl-N-2-propynylamphetamine, or N-propargyl-L-methamphetamine. Selegiline (L-deprenyl) is the enantiopure levorotatory enantiomer of the racemic mixture deprenyl, whereas D-deprenyl is the dextrorotatory enantiomer. Selegiline is a derivative of levomethamphetamine (L-methamphetamine), the levorotatory enantiomer of the psychostimulant and sympathomimetic agent methamphetamine (N-methylamphetamine), with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the molecule. Selegiline is a small-molecule compound, with the molecular formula C13H17N and a low molecular weight of 187.281 g/mol. It has high lipophilicity, with an experimental log P of 2.7 and predicted log P values of 2.9 to 3.1. Pharmaceutically, selegiline is used almost always as the hydrochloride salt, though the free base form has also been used. At room temperature, selegiline hydrochloride is a white to near white crystalline powder. Selegiline hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, chloroform, and methanol. === Analogues === Selegiline is a close analogue of methamphetamine and amphetamine, and in fact produces their levorotatory forms, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, as metabolites. Selegiline is structurally similar to the antihypertensive agent pargyline (N-methyl-N-propargylbenzylamine), an earlier non-selective MAOI of the phenylalkylamine group. Besides selegiline and pargyline, another clinically used MAOI of the phenylalkylamine and amphetamine families is the antidepressant tranylcypromine (trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine). Tranylcypromine can be conceptualized as a cyclized amphetamine and has amphetamine-like actions at high doses similarly to selegiline. Another notable analogue of selegiline is 4-fluoroselegiline, a variation of selegiline in which one of the hydrogen atoms of the phenyl ring has been replaced with a fluorine atom. A large number of other analogues of selegiline derived via structural modification have been synthesized and characterized. Rasagiline ((R)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan) is an analogue of selegiline in which the amphetamine base structure has been replaced with a 1-aminoindan structure and the N-methyl group has been removed. Like selegiline, it is also a selective MAO-B inhibitor and used to treat Parkinson's disease. In contrast to selegiline however, rasagiline lacks the amphetamine metabolites and activity of selegiline. A further derivative of rasagiline, ladostigil ([N-propargyl-(3R)-aminoindan-5-yl]-N-propylcarbamate), a dual MAO-B inhibitor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was developed for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions but was ultimately never introduced for medical use. === Synthesis === Selegiline can be synthesized by the alkylation of levomethamphetamine using propargyl bromide. == History == Following the discovery in 1952 that the tuberculosis drug iproniazid elevated the mood of people taking it, and the subsequent discovery that the effect was likely due to inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and elevation of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain, many people and companies started trying to discover monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to use as antidepressants. Deprenyl, the racemic form of selegiline, was synthesized and discovered by Zoltan Ecseri at the Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company (part of Sanofi since 1993) in Budapest, Hungary. Chinoin received a patent on the drug in 1962 and the compound was first published in the scientific literature in English in 1965. Chinoin researchers had been studying substituted amphetamines since 1960, and decided to try synthesizing amphetamines that acted as MAOIs. It had been known that methamphetamine was a reversible inhibitor of MAO. Deprenyl, also known as N-propargyl-N-methylamphetamine, is closely related to and inspired by pargyline (N-propargyl-N-methylbenzylamine), another MAOI that had been synthesized earlier. Deprenyl was initially referred to by the chemical name phenylisopropylmethylpropinylamine and the developmental code name E-250. Work on the biology and effects of E-250 in animals and humans was conducted by a group led by József Knoll at Semmelweis University, which was also in Budapest. Deprenyl is a racemic compound (a mixture of two isomers called enantiomers). The racemic form has mild amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects that are diminished compared to those of amphetamine but are still present. The levorotatory enantiomer has further reduced stimulant effects, and further work, published in 1967, determined that the levorotatory enantiomer was a more potent MAOI than the dextrorotatory enantiomer. As a result, subsequent work was done with the single enantiomer L-deprenyl. In 1968, it was discovered by J. P. Johnston that monoamine oxidase exists in multiple forms. In 1971, Knoll showed that selegiline highly selectively inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and proposed that it is unlikely to cause the infamous ""cheese effect"" (hypertensive crisis resulting from consuming foods containing tyramine) that occurs with non-selective MAOIs. The lack of potentiation of tyramine effect by deprenyl had previously been reported in 1966 and 1968 studies, but could not be mechanistically explained until after the existence of multiple forms of MAO was discovered. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor to be discovered and hence is described as prototypical of these agents. Deprenyl and selegiline were initially studied as antidepressants for treatment of depression. Deprenyl was first found to be effective for depression from 1965 to 1967, while selegiline was first found to be effective for depression in 1971 and this was further corroborated in 1980. A 1984 study that combined selegiline with phenylalanine reported remarkably high effectiveness in the treatment of depression similar to that with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, selegiline in its original oral form was never further developed or approved for the treatment of depression. A few years after the discovery that selegiline was a selective MAO-B inhibitor, two Parkinson's disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that selegiline could be useful in Parkinson's disease. One of their colleagues, Moussa B. H. Youdim, visited Knoll in Budapest and took selegiline from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer's group published the first paper on the effect of selegiline in Parkinson's disease. Speculation, by József Knoll, that selegiline could be useful as an anti-aging and pro-sexual agent, began in the 1980s. The New York Times reported that selegiline was being used non-medically as a ""smart drug"" by 1992. Selegiline was first introduced for clinical use in Hungary in 1977. It was approved in the oral pill form under the brand name Jumex to treat Parkinson's disease. The drug was then introduced in the United Kingdom in 1982. In 1987, Somerset Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, which had acquired the rights to develop selegiline in the United States, filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the drug for Parkinson's disease in this country. While the NDA was under review, Somerset was acquired in a joint venture by two generic drug companies, Mylan and Bolan Pharmaceuticals. Selegiline was approved for Parkinson's disease by the FDA in 1989. It had been known since the mid-1960s that high doses of deprenyl had psychostimulant effects. Selegiline was first shown to metabolize into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine in humans in 1978. The involvement of these metabolites in the effects and side effects of selegiline has remained controversial and unresolved in the decades afterwards. In any case, concerns about these metabolites have contributed to the development of newer MAO-B inhibitors like rasagiline and safinamide that lack such metabolites. The catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) effects of selegiline became well-characterized and distinctly named in 1994. These effects had been observed much earlier, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, but were not properly distinguished from the other actions of selegiline, like MAO-B inhibition, until the 1990s. More potent, selective, and/or expansive monoaminergic activity enhancers (MAEs), like phenylpropylaminopentane (PPAP) and benzofuranylpropylaminopentane (BPAP), were derived from selegiline and other compounds and were first described in 1988 and 1999, respectively. These drugs had been proposed for potential treatment of psychiatric disorders like depression as well as for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, but were never developed or marketed. In the 1990s, J. Alexander Bodkin at McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, began a collaboration with Somerset to develop delivery of selegiline via a transdermal patch in order to avoid the well known dietary restrictions of MAOIs. Somerset obtained FDA approval to market the patch for depression in 2006. Similarly, the orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) form of selegiline, marketed under the brand name Zelapar, was approved for Parkinson's disease in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in 2010. Binding to and agonism of the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) as the mechanism responsible for the MAE effects of selegiline and related MAEs like PPAP and BPAP was first suggested in the early 2000s following the discovery of the TAARs. Activation of the TAAR1 as the mechanism of the MAE effects was first clearly substantiated in 2022. == Society and culture == === Names === Selegiline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while selegiline hydrochloride is the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. The word ""selegiline"" is pronounced (sə-LEJ-i-leen) or as ""seh-LEH-ji-leen"". Selegiline is also known as L-deprenyl, L-deprenil, L-deprenalin, L-deprenaline, L-phenylisopropylmethylpropinylamine, and L-E-250. It should not be confused with the racemic form, deprenyl (E-250), or with the dextrorotatory enantiomer, D-deprenyl, which are distinct substances. Major brand names of selegiline include Eldepryl, Jumex, and Movergan (oral tablet and/or capsule), Zelapar (orally disintegrating tablet or ODT), and Emsam (transdermal patch). Selegiline has been marketed under more than 70 brand names worldwide. The brand name ""Emsam"" was derived from the names of two children, Emily and Samuel, of one of the executives at Somerset Pharmaceuticals, the developer of Emsam. === Generic forms === Generic forms of oral selegiline are available in the United States. However, generic forms of the orally disintegrating tablet and the transdermal patch are not available in this country. The latter formulations of selegiline are very expensive, and this can be prohibitive to their use. There has been poor insurance coverage of the transdermal patch form for depression, with insurance companies often requiring patients to first fail to respond to one or two other antidepressants and to be responsible for larger copayments. It is expected that generics of the transdermal patch will become available at some point in the future. === Availability === Conventional oral selegiline (brand names Eldepryl, Jumex) is widely marketed throughout the world, including in over 70 countries. Conversely, the selegiline transdermal patch (brand name Emsam) is only marketed in the United States, while the selegiline orally disintegrating tablet (brand name Zelapar) is marketed in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. === Notable users === József Knoll, one of the developers of selegiline, began taking a low 1 mg daily dose of selegiline on January 1, 1989, at the age of 64.: 92 He reported in 2012 that this had continued for 22 years uninterrupted.: 92 Knoll stated that he had become so fascinated with the possible longevity-promoting effects of selegiline that he had decided to start taking it as a self-experiment.: 92 Knoll later died in 2018 at the age of 93. David Pearce, a British transhumanist philosopher, wrote his self-published book-length internet manifesto The Hedonistic Imperative six weeks after starting to take selegiline. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is known to have used selegiline for depression in the form of the Emsam patch for at least 5 to 10 years. He is also known to have simultaneously taken Adderall for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to have possessed non-pharmaceutical adrafinil, a prodrug of modafinil. === Fictional representations === In Gregg Hurwitz's novel Out of the Dark, selegiline (Emsam) and tyramine-containing food were used to assassinate the president of the United States. === Internet vendors === Selegiline in non-pharmaceutical form is sold on the Internet without a prescription by online vendors for uses such as purported cognitive enhancement (i.e., as a so-called ""smart drug"" or nootropic) and anti-aging effects. It is widely available for such purposes, for instance under informal brand names like Dep-Pro, Selepryl, and Cyprenil, which are oral liquid solutions of selegiline at a concentration of 1 mg per drop.: 86 === Presence in ecstasy === In his 1993 book E for Ecstasy examining the uses of the street drug ecstasy in the United Kingdom, the writer, activist, and ecstasy advocate Nicholas Saunders highlighted test results showing that certain consignments of the drug also contained selegiline. Consignments of ecstasy known as ""Strawberry"" contained what Saunders described as a ""potentially dangerous combination of ketamine, ephedrine and selegiline,"" as did a consignment of ""Sitting Duck"" Ecstasy tablets. === Doping in sport === Selegline is on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s list of prohibited substances. It is classified as a ""stimulant"" in this list, along with various amphetamines, methylphenidate, adrenergic sympathomimetics, modafinil, and other agents. A review of the pharmacology of WADA prohibited substances noted that although selegiline is classified as a stimulant in the WADA prohibited substances list and stimulants can enhance physical performance, selegiline was seemingly included in the list not because of any short-term stimulant effects of its own, but rather because it metabolizes into small amounts of levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine and can produce false positives for amphetamines on drug tests. In any case, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine are catecholamine releasing agents and can produce sympathomimetic and psychostimulant effects with sufficiently high exposure. Such actions may have performance-enhancing effects. === Regulatory status === Selegiline is a prescription drug. It is not specifically a controlled substance in the United States and hence is not an illegal drug. However, deprenyl and selegiline are controlled substances in Japan. They are classified as ""Stimulants"", alongside a variety of other amphetamines, under Article 2 of Japan's Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law. Selegiline is known to metabolize into small amounts of levoamphetamine and levomethamphetamine but is thought to have little to no misuse potential or dependence liability. == Non-medical use == === Anti-aging and longevity === József Knoll and his team are credited with having developed selegiline. Although selegiline's development as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression was headed by other teams, Knoll remained at the forefront of research into the potential longevity enhancing effects of selegiline up until his death in 2018. Knoll published his 2012 book How Selegiline ((–)-Deprenyl) Slows Brain Aging wherein he claims that:: 90 ""In humans, maintenance from sexual maturity on (–)-deprenyl (1mg daily) is, for the time being, the most promising prophylactic treatment to fight against the age related decay of behavioral performances, prolonging life, and preventing or delaying the onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's"". The mechanism of selegiline's longevity-promoting effect has been researched by several groups, including Knoll and his associates at Semmelweis University, Budapest. The drug has been determined to be a catecholaminergic activity enhancer when present in minuscule concentrations far below those at which monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity can be observed, thereby potentiating the release of catecholamine neurotransmitters in response to stimuli. Knoll maintains that micro-doses of selegiline act as a synthetic analogue to a known or unknown trace amine in order to preserve the brain catecholaminergic system, which he perceives as integral to the organism's ability to function in an adaptive, goal-directed and motivated manner during advancing physical age:: 70, 43 ""[...] enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic brain stem neurons play[s] a key role in controlling the uphill period of life and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The results of our longevity studies support the hypothesis that quality and duration of life rests upon the inborn efficiency of the catecholaminergic brain machinery, i.e. a high performing, long-living individual has a more active, more slowly deteriorating catecholaminergic system than its low performing, shorter living peer. Thus, a better brain engine allows for a better performance and a longer lifespan."" ""Since the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem are of key importance in ensuring that the mammalian organism works as a purposeful, motivated, goal-directed entity, it is hard to overestimate the significance of finding safe and efficient means to slow the decay of these systems with passing time. The conclusion that the maintenance on (–)-deprenyl that keeps the catecholaminergic neurons on a higher activity level is a safe and efficient anti-aging therapy follows from the discovery of the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic neurons of the brain stem. From the finding that this regulation starts working on a high activity level after weaning and the enhanced activity subsists during the uphill period of life, until sexual hormones dampen the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem, and this event signifies the transition from developmental longevity into postdevelopmental longevity, the downhill period of life."" Despite findings by Knoll that selegiline can prolong lifespan in rodents by 35% however, other studies have had conflicting findings and have even found increased mortality with selegiline in rodents. In humans with Parkinson's disease, selegiline has been associated with cardiovascular and psychiatric complications and has not been found to reduce mortality in long-term studies. As such, the claimed anti-aging and longevity benefits of selegiline have yet to be substantiated in humans and are controversial and uncertain. === Nootropic or ""smart drug"" === Selegiline is considered by some to be a nootropic, otherwise known as a cognitive enhancer or ""smart drug"", both at clinical and sub-clinical dosages, and has been used off-label and non-medically to improve cognitive performance. It is one of the most popular such agents. Selegiline has been found to have neuroprotective activity against certain neurotoxins and to increase the production of several brain growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The drug has also been found in animal models to improve learning ability and to help preserve it during ischemia and aging. Despite claims that selegiline and other claimed nootropics have cogintive-enhancing effects however, these effects are controversial and their benefits versus risks are uncertain. == Research == === Depression === Selegiline has been clinically studied in combination with oral L-phenylalanine or β-phenethylamine in the treatment of depression and was reported to be effective. L-Phenylalanine is known to be metabolized into β-phenethylamine, selegiline is known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of β-phenethylamine, and β-phenethylamine has been implicated in having psychostimulant-like mood-lifting effects. === Social anxiety === A small clinical study found that oral selegiline (10 mg/day) reduced symptoms of social anxiety disorder. The effectiveness was modest, with a reduction in social anxiety scores from baseline of 32% over 6 weeks of treatment. It was seemingly less effective than certain other agents used in the treatment of social anxiety, such as the non-selective MAOI phenelzine (45% symptom reduction) and the benzodiazepine clonazepam (51% symptom reduction), though it was similar to the SSRI sertraline (32% symptom decrease). === ADHD === Selegiline has been limitedly studied in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults. In a small randomized trial of selegiline for treatment of ADHD in children, there were improvements in attention, hyperactivity, and learning/memory performance but not in impulsivity. A small clinical randomized trial compared selegiline to methylphenidate, a first line treatment for ADHD, and reported equivalent efficacy as assessed by parent and teacher ratings. In another small randomized controlled trial of selegiline for the treatment of adult ADHD, a high dose of the medication for 6 weeks was not significantly more effective than placebo in improving symptoms. Selegiline in its transdermal patch form (brand name Emsam) has also been assessed in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in a small open-label pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer in 2003. However, there was a high rate of discontinuation and development was not further pursued. === Motivational disorders === Selegiline has been found to produce pro-motivational effects and to reverse motivational deficits in rodents. In case reports and small clinical studies, selegiline has been reported to improve disorders of diminished motivation like apathy and abulia due to conditions such as traumatic brain injury. In accordance with the preceding findings, selegiline, along with other dopaminergic and activating agents, may be useful in the treatment of disorders of diminished motivation, including apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism. === Addiction === Selegiline has been evaluated for smoking cessation both as a monotherapy and in combination with nicotine replacement therapy in five clinical studies. However, it is limitedly or not effective for this use. It was also evaluated for treatment of cocaine dependence in one study, but was similarly not effective. Studies are mixed on whether selegiline, at MAO-B-selective doses, reduces the effects of cocaine in humans. Selegiline, also at an MAO-B-selective dosage, did not modify or potentiate the pharmacological effects of intravenous methamphetamine in a small clinical study. === Sexual dysfunction === Selegiline has been assessed for treatment of sexual dysfunction induced by antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia, but was not effective in a single small clinical study. It also did not improve sexual function in men with depression, but did improve several domains of sexual function in women with depression. === Psychosis === Selegiline has been studied as an adjunct to antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia in four clinical studies. However, it failed to significantly reduce positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia in meta-analyses of these studies. === Excessive sleepiness === Selegiline has been evaluated for the treatment of narcolepsy in three small clinical studies. It was found to be effective in these studies. A dosage of 10 mg/day had no effect on symptoms, but 20 to 30 mg/day improved alertness, mood, and somewhat reduced cataplexy, clinical effects that have been described as comparable to the same dosages of amphetamine. Animal research indicates that the beneficial effects of high doses of selegiline in narcolepsy are likely due to conversion into its active metabolites, levoamphetamine and levomethamphetamine. Selegiline has also been evaluated for treatment of hypersomnia (excessive sleeping or sleepiness) in people with myotonic dystrophy, but its effectiveness was very uncertain. === Periodic limb movement disorder === Selegiline has been studied in the treatment of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in a single small open-label clinical study. It was reported to be effective as assessed by polysomnography, reducing periodic limb movements during sleep by about 60%. Selegiline has not been studied for the related condition restless legs syndrome (RLS) as of 2023. The drug has not been studied well enough in PLMD or RLS to be widely used in their treatment. === Tardive dyskinedia === Selegiline was studied in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in one small clinical study, but was ineffective. === Dementia and stroke === Selegiline has also been used off-label as a palliative treatment for dementia in Alzheimer's disease. However, its clinical effectiveness is limited or lacking for this use. It was also ineffective in the treatment of Lewy body dementia. Selegiline has been used to support motor rehabilitation in stroke recovery, but evidence for this use is inadequate and no recommendation can be made for or against it. === Disorders of consciousness === Selegiline has been studied in patients with disorders of consciousness, such as minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, and persistent coma, in a small open-label clinical study. It was found to be effective in enhancing arousal and promoting recovery of consciousness in some of these individuals. === Neurotoxicity === Selegiline has been reported to protect against the damage caused by the potent dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in animals. Conversely, selegiline is ineffective in protecting against the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Selegiline has also been reported to protect against methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents. The serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA appears to be dependent on release of dopamine and its subsequent metabolism by MAO-B within serotonergic neurons into hydroxyl radicals, which is blocked by MAO-B inhibition. Likewise, selegiline prevented the serotonergic neurotoxicity of a combination of methylenedioxyaminoindane (MDAI) and dextroamphetamine. Conversely, selegiline failed to reduce the serotonergic neurotoxicity caused by fenfluramine and either did not affect or potentiated the serotonergic neurotoxicity caused by para-chloroamphetamine (PCA). In addition, findings are mixed and conflicting on whether selegiline prevents amphetamine- and methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents. Although MAO-B-selective doses of selegiline protect against MDMA-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents, combination of amphetamines like MDMA with MAOIs, including selegiline, can produce serious complications, including serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and death. === Other formulations === The original oral formulation of selegiline was developed for the treatment of depression. However, it ended up being developed and approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease instead. In any case, oral selegiline has been widely used off-label to treat depression. The transdermal patch form of selegiline was developed and approved specifically for the treatment of depression. It was also under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cognition disorders, and Parkinson's disease, but development for these indications was discontinued. The ODT form of selegiline was developed and licensed exclusively for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. == Veterinary use == In veterinary medicine, selegiline is sold under the brand name Anipryl and is manufactured by Zoetis. It is available in the form of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 mg oral tablets for use in animals. Selegiline is used in dogs to treat canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) and, at higher doses, to treat pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH). CCD is a form of dementia that mimics Alzheimer's disease in humans. Geriatric dogs treated with selegiline show improvements in sleeping pattern, reduced urinary incontinence, and increased activity level, with most showing improvements by one month of treatment. Though it is labeled for use in dogs only, selegiline has been used off-label for geriatric cats with cognitive dysfunction. PDH is a hormonal disorder and is analogous to pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome in humans. Selegiline's effectiveness in treating PDH has been disputed. Theoretically, it works by increasing dopamine levels, which downregulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the brain, eventually leading to reduced levels of cortisol. Some claim that selegiline is only effective at treating PDH caused by lesions in the anterior pituitary (which comprise most canine cases). The greatest sign of improvement is lessening of PDH-related abdominal distention. Side effects in dogs are uncommon, but they include vomiting, diarrhea, diminished hearing, salivation, decreased weight, and behavioral changes such as hyperactivity, listlessness, disorientation, and repetitive motions. Selegiline has been limitedly studied in large animals like horses and its dosage in these animals has not been established. In preliminary research, a dose of selegiline of 30 mg orally or intravenously in horses had no observable effects on behavior or locomotor activity. The doses of selegiline used in animals are described as extremely high relative to those used in humans (which are ~0.1 mg/kg body weight). == References == == External links == Selegiline (l-deprenyl) (from The Good Drug Guide) - David Pearce - BLTC Research",Zelapar,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.246371776796877e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002486472949385643)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/zelapar.html ', [])"
4355,"('Selegiline', 'Deprenalin', 'Deprenyl', 'Emsam', 'Eldepryl')",Medical,"Selegiline, also known as L-deprenyl and sold under the brand names Eldepryl, Zelapar, and Emsam among others, is a medication which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and major depressive disorder. It has also been studied and used off-label for a variety of other indications, but has not been formally approved for any other use. The medication, in the form licensed for depression, has modest effectiveness for this condition that is similar to that of other antidepressants. Selegiline is provided as a swallowed tablet or capsule or an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) for Parkinson's disease and as a patch applied to skin for depression. Side effects of selegiline occurring more often than with placebo include insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety, abnormal dreams, and application site reactions (with the patch form), among others. At high doses, selegiline has the potential for dangerous food and drug interactions, such as tyramine-related hypertensive crisis (the so-called ""cheese reaction"") and risk of serotonin syndrome. However, doses within the approved clinical range appear to have little to no risk of these interactions. In addition, the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline have reduced risks of such interactions compared to the conventional oral form. Selegiline has no known misuse potential or dependence liability and is not a controlled substance except in Japan. Selegiline acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and thereby increases levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. At typical clinical doses used for Parkinson's disease, selegiline is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), increasing brain levels of dopamine. At higher doses, it loses its specificity for MAO-B and also inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), which increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain as well. In addition to its MAOI activity, selegiline is a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) and enhances the impulse-mediated release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. This action may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. After administration, selegiline partially metabolizes into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, which act as norepinephrine releasing agents (NRAs) and may contribute to its therapeutic and adverse effects as well. The levels of these metabolites are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline. Chemically, selegiline is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine, a derivative of methamphetamine, and the purified levorotatory enantiomer of deprenyl (the racemic mixture of selegiline and D-deprenyl). Deprenyl was discovered and studied as an antidepressant in the early 1960s by Zoltan Ecseri, József Knoll, and other colleagues at Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company in Hungary. Subsequently, selegiline was purified from deprenyl and was studied and developed itself. Selegiline was first introduced for medical use, to treat Parkinson's disease, in Hungary in 1977. It was subsequently approved in the United Kingdom in 1982 and in the United States in 1989. The ODT was approved for Parkinson's disease in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in 2010, while the patch was introduced for depression in the United States in 2006. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor to be discovered and marketed. In addition to its medical use, there has been interest in selegiline as a potential anti-aging drug and nootropic. However, effects of this sort are controversial and uncertain. Generic versions of selegiline are available in the case of the conventional oral form, but not in the case of the ODT or transdermal patch forms. == Medical uses == === Parkinson's disease === In its oral and ODT forms, selegiline is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is most often used as an adjunct to medications such as levodopa (L-DOPA), although it has been used off-label as a monotherapy. The rationale for adding selegiline to levodopa is to decrease the required dose of levodopa and thus reduce the motor complications of levodopa therapy. Selegiline delays the point when levodopa treatment becomes necessary from about 11 months to about 18 months after diagnosis. There is some evidence that selegiline acts as a neuroprotective and reduces the rate of disease progression, though this is disputed. In addition to parkinsonism, selegiline can improve symptoms of depression in people with Parkinson's disease. There is evidence that selegiline may be more effective than rasagiline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This may be due to pharmacological differences between the drugs, such as the catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) actions of selegiline which rasagiline lacks. === Depression === Selegiline is used as an antidepressant in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Both the oral selegiline and transdermal selegiline patch formulations are used in the treatment of depression. However, oral selegiline is not approved for depression and is used off-label for this indication, while the transdermal patch is specifically licensed for treatment of depression. Both standard clinical doses of oral selegiline (up to 10 mg/day) and higher doses of oral selegiline (e.g., 30 to 60 mg/day) have been used to treat depression, with the lower doses selectively inhibiting MAO-B and the higher doses producing dual inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B. Unlike oral selegiline, transdermal selegiline bypasses first-pass metabolism, thereby avoiding inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic MAO-A and minimizing the risk of food and drug interactions, whilst still allowing for selegiline to reach the brain and inhibit MAO-B. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness and safety of selegiline in the treatment of psychiatric disorders including depression. It included both randomized and non-randomized published clinical studies. The meta-analysis found that selegiline was more effective than placebo in terms of reduction in depressive symptoms (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = −0.96, k = 10, n = 1,308), response rates for depression improvement (RRTooltip risk ratio = 1.61, k = 9, n = 1,238), and response rates for improvement of depression with atypical features (RR = 2.23, k = 3, n = 136). Oral selegiline was significantly more effective than the selegiline patch in terms of depressive symptom improvement (SMD = −1.49, k = 6, n = 282 vs. SMD = −0.27, k = 4, n = 1,026, respectively; p = 0.03). However, this was largely due to older and less methodologically rigorous trials that were at high risk for bias. Oral selegiline studies also often employed much higher doses than usual, for instance 20 to 60 mg/day. The quality of evidence of selegiline for depression was rated as very low overall, very low for oral selegiline, and low to moderate for transdermal selegiline. For comparison, meta-analyses of other antidepressants for depression have found a mean effect size of about 0.3 (a small effect), which is similar to that with transdermal selegiline. In two pivotal regulatory clinical trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration, the selegiline transdermal patch decreased scores on depression rating scales (specifically the 17- and 28-item HDRSTooltip Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) by 9.0 to 10.9 points, whereas placebo decreased scores by 6.5 to 8.6 points, giving placebo-subtracted differences attributable to selegiline of 2.4 to 2.5 points. A 2013 quantitative review of the transdermal selegiline patch for depression, which pooled the results of these two trials, found that the placebo-subtracted number needed to treat (NNT) was 11 in terms of depression response (>50% reduction in symptoms) and 9 in terms of remission of depression (score of ≤10 on the MADRSTooltip Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). For comparison, other antidepressants, including fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, vilazodone, adjunctive aripiprazole, olanzapine/fluoxetine, and extended-release quetiapine, have NNTs ranging from 6 to 8 in terms of depression response and 7 to 14 in terms of depression remission. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that transdermal selegiline has similar effectiveness to other antidepressants. NNTs are measures of effect size and indicate how many individuals would need to be treated in order to encounter one additional outcome of interest. Lower NNTs are better, and NNTs corresponding to Cohen's d effect sizes have been defined as 2.3 for a large effect (d = 0.8), 3.6 for a medium effect (d = 0.5), and 8.9 for a small effect (d = 0.2). The effectiveness of transdermal selegiline for depression relative to side effects and discontinuation was considered to be favorable. While several large regulatory clinical trials of transdermal selegiline versus placebo for depression have been conducted, there is a lack of trials comparing selegiline to other antidepressants. Although multiple doses of transdermal selegiline were assessed, a dose–response relationship for depression was never established. Transdermal selegiline has shown similar clinical effectiveness in the treatment of atypical depression relative to typical depression and in the treatment of anxious depression relative to non-anxious depression. Transdermal selegiline does not cause sexual dysfunction and may improve certain domains of sexual function, for instance sexual interest, maintaining interest during sex, and sexual satisfaction. These benefits were apparent in women but not in men. The lack of sexual dysfunction with transdermal selegiline is in contrast to many other antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which are associated with high rates of sexual dysfunction. Transdermal selegiline patches have been underutilized in the treatment of depression compared to other antidepressants. A variety of factors contributing to this underutilization have been identified. One major factor is the very high cost of transdermal selegiline, which is often not covered by insurance and frequently proves to be prohibitive. Conversely, other widely available antidepressants are much cheaper in comparison. === Available forms === Selegiline is available in the following three pharmaceutical forms: Oral tablets and capsules 5 mg (brand names Eldepryl, Jumex, and generics) – indicated for Parkinson's disease Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) 1.25 mg (brand name Zelapar) – indicated for Parkinson's disease Transdermal patches 6, 9, and 12 mg/24 hours (brand name Emsam) – indicated for major depressive disorder The transdermal patch form is also known as the ""selegiline transdermal system"" or ""STS"" and is applied once daily. They are 20, 30, or 40 cm2 in size and contain a total of 20, 30, or 40 mg selegiline per patch (so 20 mg/20 cm2, 30 mg/30 cm2, and 40 mg/40 cm2), respectively. The selegiline transdermal patch is a matrix-type adhesive patch with a three-layer structure. It is the only approved non-oral MAOI, having reduced dietary restrictions and side effects in comparison to oral MAOIs, and is also the only approved non-oral first-line antidepressant. The selegiline patch can be useful for those who have difficulty tolerating oral medications. == Contraindications == Selegiline is contraindicated with serotonergic antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with serotonergic opioids like meperidine, tramadol, and methadone, with other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as linezolid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine, and with dextromethorphan, St. John's wort, cyclobenzaprine, pentazocine, propoxyphene, and carbamazepine. Combination of selegiline with serotonergic agents may cause serotonin syndrome, while combination of selegiline with adrenergic or sympathomimetic agents like ephedrine or amphetamines may cause hypertensive crisis. Long washout periods are required before starting and stopping these medications with discontinuation or initiation of selegiline. Consumption of tyramine-rich foods can result in hypertensive crisis with selegiline, also known as the ""cheese effect"" or ""cheese reaction"" due to the high amounts of tyramine present in some cheeses. Examples of other foods that may have high amounts of tyramine and similar substances include yeast products, chicken liver, snails, pickled herring, red wines, some beers, canned figs, broad beans, chocolate, and cream products. The preceding drug and food contraindications are dependent on selegiline dose and route, and hence are not necessarily absolute contraindications. While high oral doses of selegiline (≥20 mg/day) can cause such interactions, oral doses within the approved clinical range (≤10 mg/day) appear to have little to no risk of these interactions. In addition, the ODT and transdermal forms of selegiline have reduced risks of such interactions compared to the conventional oral form. Selegiline is also contraindicated in children less than 12 years of age and in people with pheochromocytoma, both due to heightened risk of hypertensive crisis. For all human uses and all forms, selegiline is pregnancy category C, meaning that studies in pregnant animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus but there are no adequate studies in humans. == Side effects == Side effects of the tablet form in conjunction with levodopa include, in decreasing order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, increased involuntary movements, agitation, slow or irregular heart rate, delusions, hypertension, new or increased angina pectoris, and syncope. Most of the side effects are due to a high dopamine levels, and can be alleviated by reducing the dose of levodopa. Selegiline can also cause cardiovascular side effects such as orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and other types of cardiac arrhythmias. The main side effects of the patch form for depression include application-site reactions, insomnia, dry mouth, dizziness, nervousness, and abnormal dreams. The selegiline patch carries a black box warning about a possible increased risk of suicide, especially for young people, as do all antidepressants since 2007. Side effects of selegiline that have been identified as occurring significantly more often than with placebo in meta-analyses for psychiatric disorders have included dry mouth (RRTooltip Risk ratio = 1.58), insomnia (RR = 1.61, NNHTooltip Number needed to harm = 19), and application site reactions with the transdermal form (RR = 1.81, NNH = 7). No significant diarrhea, headache, dizziness, nausea, sexual dysfunction, or weight gain were apparent in these meta-analyses. Selegiline, including in its oral, ODT, and patch forms, has been found to cause hypotension or orthostatic hypotension in some individuals. In a clinical trial, the rate of systolic orthostatic hypotension was 21% versus 9% with placebo and the rate of diastolic orthostatic hypotension was 12% versus 4% with placebo in people with Parkinson's disease taking the ODT form of selegiline. The risk of hypotension is greater at the start of treatment and in the elderly (3% vs. 0% with placebo). The rate of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension with the selegiline patch was 2.2% versus 0.5% with placebo in clinical trials of people with depression. Significant orthostatic blood pressure changes (≥10 mm Hg decrease) occurred in 9.8% versus 6.7% with placebo, but most of these cases were asymptomatic and heart rate was unchanged. The rates of other orthostatic hypotension-related side effects in this population were dizziness or vertigo 4.9% versus 3.1% with placebo and fainting 0.5% versus 0.0% with placebo. It is said that orthostatic hypotension is rarely seen with the selegiline transdermal patch compared to oral MAOIs. Caution is advised against rapidly rising after sitting or lying, especially after prolonged periods or at the start of treatment, as this can result in fainting. Falls are of particular concern in the elderly. MAOIs like selegiline may lower blood pressure by increasing dopamine levels and activating dopamine receptors, by increasing levels of the false neurotransmitter octopamine, and/or by other mechanisms. Meta-analyses published in the 1990s found that the addition of selegiline to levodopa increased mortality in people with Parkinson's disease. However, several subsequent meta-analyses with more trials and patients found no increase in mortality with selegiline added to levodopa. If selegiline does increase mortality, it has been theorized that this may be due to cardiovascular side effects, such as its amphetamine-related sympathomimetic effects and its MAO inhibition-related hypotension. Although selegiline does not seem to increase mortality, it appears to worsen cognition in people with Parkinson's disease over time. Conversely, rasagiline does not seem to do so and can enhance cognition. Rarely, selegiline has been reported to induce or exacerbate impulse control disorders, pathological gambling, hypersexuality, and paraphilias in people with Parkinson's disease. However, MAO-B inhibitors like selegiline causing impulse control disorders is uncommon, controversial, and less frequent than with dopamine receptor agonists like pramipexole. Impulse control disorders with dopaminergic agents have been linked specifically to activation of dopamine D3 receptors in the globus pallidus. Selegiline has also been reported to activate or worsen rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in some people with Parkinson's disease. Selegiline has shown little or no misuse potential in humans or monkeys. Likewise, it has no dependence potential in rodents. This is in spite of its amphetamine active metabolites, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, and is in contrast to agents like dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine. However, selegiline can strongly potentiate the reinforcing effects of exogenous β-phenethylamine by inhibiting its MAO-B-mediated metabolism. Misuse of the combination of selegiline and β-phenethylamine has been reported. == Overdose == Little information is available about clinically significant selegiline overdose. The drug has been studied clinically at doses as high as 60 mg/day orally, 10 mg/day as an ODT, and 12 mg/24 hours as a transdermal patch. In addition, deprenyl (the racemic form) has been clinically studied orally at doses as large as 100 mg/day. During clinical development of oral selegiline, some individuals who were exposed to doses of 600 mg developed severe hypotension and psychomotor agitation. Overdose may result in non-selective inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B and may be similar to overdose of other non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and tranylcypromine. Serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and/or death may occur with overdose. No specific antidote to selegiline overdose is available. == Interactions == === Serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis === Both the oral and patch forms of selegiline come with strong warnings against combining it with drugs that could produce serotonin syndrome, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the cough medicine dextromethorphan. Selegiline in combination with the opioid analgesic pethidine is not recommended, as it can lead to severe adverse effects. Several other synthetic opioids such as tramadol and methadone, as well as various triptans, are also contraindicated due to potential for serotonin syndrome. All three forms of selegiline carry warnings about food restrictions to avoid hypertensive crisis that are associated with MAOIs. The patch form was created in part to overcome food restrictions; clinical trials showed that it was successful. Additionally, in post-marketing surveillance from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141 exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data. The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6 mg/24 hours, does not require any dietary restrictions. Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor (RIMA) moclobemide, require a low-tyramine diet. A study found that selegiline in transdermal patch form did not importantly modify the pharmacodynamic effects or pharmacokinetics of the sympathomimetic agents pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Likewise, oral selegiline at an MAO-B-selective dosage did not appear to modify the pharmacodynamic effects or pharmacokinetics of intravenous methamphetamine in another study. Conversely, selegiline, also at MAO-B-selective doses, has been found to reduce the physiological and euphoric subjective effects of cocaine whilst not affecting its pharmacokinetics in some studies but not in others. Cautious safe combination of MAOIs like selegiline with stimulants like lisdexamfetamine has been reported. However, a hypertensive crisis with selegiline and ephedrine has also been reported. The selegiline drug labels warn about combination of selegiline with indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents, like amphetamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, due to the potential risk of hypertensive crisis, and recommend monitoring blood pressure with such combinations. The combination of selegiline with certain other medications, like phenylephrine and buspirone, is also warned against for similar reasons. In the case of phenylephrine, this drug is substantially metabolized by monoamine oxidase, including by both MAO-A and MAO-B. Selegiline can interact with exogenous dopamine, which is metabolized by MAO-A and MAO-B, and result in hypertensive crisis as well. Besides norepinephrine releasing agents, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) may be safe in combination with MAOIs like selegiline. Potent NRIs, such as reboxetine, desipramine, protriptyline, and nortriptyline, can reduce or block the pressor effects of tyramine, including in those taking MAOIs. This is by inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and preventing entry of tyramine into presynaptic noradrenergic neurons where tyramine induces the release of norepinephrine. As a result, NRIs may reduce the risk of tyramine-related hypertensive crisis in people taking MAOIs. Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), like methylphenidate and bupropion, are also considered to be safe in combination with MAOIs. However, initiation at low doses and slow upward dose titration is advisable in the case of both NRIs and NDRIs due to possible potentiation of their effects and side effects by MAOIs. Selegiline may potentiate the effects of serotonergic psychedelics that are MAO-B substrates, such as 2C drugs like 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-E. === Cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers === The cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of selegiline have not been fully elucidated. CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotypes did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of selegiline, suggesting that these enzymes are minimally involved in its metabolism and that inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes would not importantly affect its pharmacokinetics. However, although most pharmacokinetic variables were unaffected, overall exposure to selegiline's metabolite levomethamphetamine was 46% higher in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers and exposure to its metabolite desmethylselegiline was 68% higher in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared to extensive metabolizers. As with the cases of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, the strong CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitor itraconazole has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline, suggesting lack of major involvement of this enzyme as well. On the other hand, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, which is known to act as a strong inducer of CYP3A enzymes, has paradoxically been found to increase exposure to selegiline and its metabolites levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine by approximately 2-fold (with selegiline used as the transdermal patch form). One enzyme thought to be majorly involved in the metabolism of selegiline based on in-vitro studies is CYP2B6. However, there are no clinical studies of different CYP2B6 metabolizer phenotypes or of CYP2B6 inhibitors or inducers on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline. In addition to CYP2B6, CYP2A6 may be involved in the metabolism of selegiline to a lesser extent. Birth control pills containing the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol and a progestin like gestodene or levonorgestrel have been found to increase peak levels and overall exposure to oral selegiline by 10- to 20-fold. High levels of selegiline can lead to loss of MAO-B selectivity and inhibition of MAO-A as well. This increases susceptibility to side effects and interactions of non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergic medications. However, this study had a small sample size of four individuals as well as other methodological limitations. The precise mechanism underlying the interaction is unknown, but is likely related to cytochrome P450 inhibition and consequent inhibition of selegiline first-pass metabolism by ethinylestradiol. In contrast to birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol, menopausal hormone therapy with estradiol and levonorgestrel did not modify peak levels of selegiline and only modestly increased overall exposure (+59%). Hence, menopausal hormone therapy does not pose the same risk of interaction as ethinylestradiol-containing birth control pills when taken together with selegiline. Overall exposure to selegiline with oral selegiline has been found to be 23-fold lower in people taking anticonvulsants known to strongly activate drug-metabolizing enzymes. The anticonvulsants included phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and amobarbital. In a previous study however, carbamazepine specifically did not reduce selegiline exposure. Phenobarbital and certain other anticonvulsants are known to strongly induce CYP2B6, one of the major enzymes believed to be involved in selegiline metabolism. As such, it was concluded that strong CYP2B6 induction was most likely responsible for the dramatically reduced exposure to selegiline observed in the study. === Selegiline inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes === Selegiline has been reported to inhibit several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2A6. It is a mechanism-based inhibitor (suicide inhibitor) of CYP2B6 and has been said to ""potently"" or ""strongly"" inhibit this enzyme in vitro. It may inhibit the metabolism of bupropion, a major CYP2B6 substrate, into its active metabolite hydroxybupropion. However, a study predicted that inhibition of CYP2B6 by selegiline would non-significantly affect exposure to bupropion. Selegiline has not been listed or described as a clinically significant CYP2B6 inhibitor by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of 2023. One small study observing three patients found that selegiline was safe and well-tolerated in combination with bupropion. In addition to CYP2B6 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, selegiline is a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2A6 and may increase exposure to nicotine (a major CYP2A6 substrate). By inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP2B6 and CYP1A2, selegiline may inhibit its own metabolism and thereby interact with itself. === Other interactions === Dopamine antagonists like antipsychotics or metoclopramide, which block dopamine receptors and thereby antagonize the dopaminergic effects of selegiline, could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the medication. Dopamine-depleting agents like reserpine and tetrabenazine, by reducing dopamine levels, can also oppose the effectiveness of dopaminergic medications like selegiline. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Selegiline has multiple known mechanisms of action in terms of its pharmacodynamic activity. It is most notably an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, it is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) at lower doses (≤10 mg/day) but additionally inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) at higher doses (≥20 mg/day). MAO-B inhibition is thought to result in increased levels of dopamine and β-phenethylamine, whereas MAO-A inhibition results in increased levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Selegiline is also a catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) and enhances the action potential-evoked release of norepinephrine and dopamine. The CAE activity of selegiline may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Both the MAOI activity and CAE activity of selegiline may be involved in its therapeutic effects in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and depression. According to József Knoll and other researchers, selegiline might have dopaminergic neuroprotective effects, might be able to modestly slow the rate of aging-related dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and might thereby have a disease-modifying effect in Parkinson's disease and antiaging effects generally. However, these theoretical effects of selegiline have not been clearly demonstrated in humans as of present and remain to be substantiated. Through its active metabolites levomethamphetamine (L-MA) and levoamphetamine (L-A), selegiline acts as a weak norepinephrine and/or dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). The clinical significance of this action is unclear, but it may be relevant to the effects and side effects of selegiline, especially at higher doses. Its active metabolite desmethylselegiline (DMS) also has MAOI and CAE activity and likely contributes to its effects as well. Levels of selegiline's metabolites are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms of selegiline than with the oral form and this may result in differences in its effects and side effects. === Pharmacokinetics === Selegiline is available in forms for use by multiple different routes of administration and its pharmacokinetics vary by route. The bioavailability of the oral form of selegiline is 4 to 10%, of the ODT is 5 to 8 times that of the oral form, and of the transdermal patch is 75%. The time to peak levels of selegiline with oral administration is about 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The plasma protein binding of selegiline is 85 to 90%. It is metabolized extensively in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2B6 among other enzymes. Metabolites of selegiline include desmethylselegiline (DMS), levomethamphetamine (L-MA), and levoamphetamine (L-A). The oral form of selegiline is subject to strong first-pass metabolism and levels of the metabolites of selegiline are much lower with the ODT and transdermal patch forms than with the oral form. The elimination half-lives of selegiline and its metabolites range from 1.2 to 10 hours for selegiline, 2.2 to 9.5 hours for DMS, 14 to 21 hours for levomethamphetamine, and 16 to 18 hours for levoamphetamine. Selegiline and its metabolites are eliminated mainly in urine (87% in urine and 15% in feces via oral administration), with its metabolites accounting for virtually all of the eliminated material in the case of the oral form. Hepatic impairment and renal impairment have been found to dramatically increase exposure to selegiline. == Chemistry == Selegiline is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is also known as (R)-(–)-N,α-dimethyl-N-(2-propynyl)phenethylamine, (R)-(–)-N-methyl-N-2-propynylamphetamine, or N-propargyl-L-methamphetamine. Selegiline (L-deprenyl) is the enantiopure levorotatory enantiomer of the racemic mixture deprenyl, whereas D-deprenyl is the dextrorotatory enantiomer. Selegiline is a derivative of levomethamphetamine (L-methamphetamine), the levorotatory enantiomer of the psychostimulant and sympathomimetic agent methamphetamine (N-methylamphetamine), with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom of the molecule. Selegiline is a small-molecule compound, with the molecular formula C13H17N and a low molecular weight of 187.281 g/mol. It has high lipophilicity, with an experimental log P of 2.7 and predicted log P values of 2.9 to 3.1. Pharmaceutically, selegiline is used almost always as the hydrochloride salt, though the free base form has also been used. At room temperature, selegiline hydrochloride is a white to near white crystalline powder. Selegiline hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, chloroform, and methanol. === Analogues === Selegiline is a close analogue of methamphetamine and amphetamine, and in fact produces their levorotatory forms, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine, as metabolites. Selegiline is structurally similar to the antihypertensive agent pargyline (N-methyl-N-propargylbenzylamine), an earlier non-selective MAOI of the phenylalkylamine group. Besides selegiline and pargyline, another clinically used MAOI of the phenylalkylamine and amphetamine families is the antidepressant tranylcypromine (trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine). Tranylcypromine can be conceptualized as a cyclized amphetamine and has amphetamine-like actions at high doses similarly to selegiline. Another notable analogue of selegiline is 4-fluoroselegiline, a variation of selegiline in which one of the hydrogen atoms of the phenyl ring has been replaced with a fluorine atom. A large number of other analogues of selegiline derived via structural modification have been synthesized and characterized. Rasagiline ((R)-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan) is an analogue of selegiline in which the amphetamine base structure has been replaced with a 1-aminoindan structure and the N-methyl group has been removed. Like selegiline, it is also a selective MAO-B inhibitor and used to treat Parkinson's disease. In contrast to selegiline however, rasagiline lacks the amphetamine metabolites and activity of selegiline. A further derivative of rasagiline, ladostigil ([N-propargyl-(3R)-aminoindan-5-yl]-N-propylcarbamate), a dual MAO-B inhibitor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was developed for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions but was ultimately never introduced for medical use. === Synthesis === Selegiline can be synthesized by the alkylation of levomethamphetamine using propargyl bromide. == History == Following the discovery in 1952 that the tuberculosis drug iproniazid elevated the mood of people taking it, and the subsequent discovery that the effect was likely due to inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) and elevation of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain, many people and companies started trying to discover monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to use as antidepressants. Deprenyl, the racemic form of selegiline, was synthesized and discovered by Zoltan Ecseri at the Chinoin Pharmaceutical Company (part of Sanofi since 1993) in Budapest, Hungary. Chinoin received a patent on the drug in 1962 and the compound was first published in the scientific literature in English in 1965. Chinoin researchers had been studying substituted amphetamines since 1960, and decided to try synthesizing amphetamines that acted as MAOIs. It had been known that methamphetamine was a reversible inhibitor of MAO. Deprenyl, also known as N-propargyl-N-methylamphetamine, is closely related to and inspired by pargyline (N-propargyl-N-methylbenzylamine), another MAOI that had been synthesized earlier. Deprenyl was initially referred to by the chemical name phenylisopropylmethylpropinylamine and the developmental code name E-250. Work on the biology and effects of E-250 in animals and humans was conducted by a group led by József Knoll at Semmelweis University, which was also in Budapest. Deprenyl is a racemic compound (a mixture of two isomers called enantiomers). The racemic form has mild amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects that are diminished compared to those of amphetamine but are still present. The levorotatory enantiomer has further reduced stimulant effects, and further work, published in 1967, determined that the levorotatory enantiomer was a more potent MAOI than the dextrorotatory enantiomer. As a result, subsequent work was done with the single enantiomer L-deprenyl. In 1968, it was discovered by J. P. Johnston that monoamine oxidase exists in multiple forms. In 1971, Knoll showed that selegiline highly selectively inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and proposed that it is unlikely to cause the infamous ""cheese effect"" (hypertensive crisis resulting from consuming foods containing tyramine) that occurs with non-selective MAOIs. The lack of potentiation of tyramine effect by deprenyl had previously been reported in 1966 and 1968 studies, but could not be mechanistically explained until after the existence of multiple forms of MAO was discovered. Selegiline was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor to be discovered and hence is described as prototypical of these agents. Deprenyl and selegiline were initially studied as antidepressants for treatment of depression. Deprenyl was first found to be effective for depression from 1965 to 1967, while selegiline was first found to be effective for depression in 1971 and this was further corroborated in 1980. A 1984 study that combined selegiline with phenylalanine reported remarkably high effectiveness in the treatment of depression similar to that with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, selegiline in its original oral form was never further developed or approved for the treatment of depression. A few years after the discovery that selegiline was a selective MAO-B inhibitor, two Parkinson's disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that selegiline could be useful in Parkinson's disease. One of their colleagues, Moussa B. H. Youdim, visited Knoll in Budapest and took selegiline from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer's group published the first paper on the effect of selegiline in Parkinson's disease. Speculation, by József Knoll, that selegiline could be useful as an anti-aging and pro-sexual agent, began in the 1980s. The New York Times reported that selegiline was being used non-medically as a ""smart drug"" by 1992. Selegiline was first introduced for clinical use in Hungary in 1977. It was approved in the oral pill form under the brand name Jumex to treat Parkinson's disease. The drug was then introduced in the United Kingdom in 1982. In 1987, Somerset Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, which had acquired the rights to develop selegiline in the United States, filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the drug for Parkinson's disease in this country. While the NDA was under review, Somerset was acquired in a joint venture by two generic drug companies, Mylan and Bolan Pharmaceuticals. Selegiline was approved for Parkinson's disease by the FDA in 1989. It had been known since the mid-1960s that high doses of deprenyl had psychostimulant effects. Selegiline was first shown to metabolize into levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine in humans in 1978. The involvement of these metabolites in the effects and side effects of selegiline has remained controversial and unresolved in the decades afterwards. In any case, concerns about these metabolites have contributed to the development of newer MAO-B inhibitors like rasagiline and safinamide that lack such metabolites. The catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE) effects of selegiline became well-characterized and distinctly named in 1994. These effects had been observed much earlier, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, but were not properly distinguished from the other actions of selegiline, like MAO-B inhibition, until the 1990s. More potent, selective, and/or expansive monoaminergic activity enhancers (MAEs), like phenylpropylaminopentane (PPAP) and benzofuranylpropylaminopentane (BPAP), were derived from selegiline and other compounds and were first described in 1988 and 1999, respectively. These drugs had been proposed for potential treatment of psychiatric disorders like depression as well as for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, but were never developed or marketed. In the 1990s, J. Alexander Bodkin at McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, began a collaboration with Somerset to develop delivery of selegiline via a transdermal patch in order to avoid the well known dietary restrictions of MAOIs. Somerset obtained FDA approval to market the patch for depression in 2006. Similarly, the orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) form of selegiline, marketed under the brand name Zelapar, was approved for Parkinson's disease in the United States in 2006 and in the European Union in 2010. Binding to and agonism of the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) as the mechanism responsible for the MAE effects of selegiline and related MAEs like PPAP and BPAP was first suggested in the early 2000s following the discovery of the TAARs. Activation of the TAAR1 as the mechanism of the MAE effects was first clearly substantiated in 2022. == Society and culture == === Names === Selegiline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while selegiline hydrochloride is the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. The word ""selegiline"" is pronounced (sə-LEJ-i-leen) or as ""seh-LEH-ji-leen"". Selegiline is also known as L-deprenyl, L-deprenil, L-deprenalin, L-deprenaline, L-phenylisopropylmethylpropinylamine, and L-E-250. It should not be confused with the racemic form, deprenyl (E-250), or with the dextrorotatory enantiomer, D-deprenyl, which are distinct substances. Major brand names of selegiline include Eldepryl, Jumex, and Movergan (oral tablet and/or capsule), Zelapar (orally disintegrating tablet or ODT), and Emsam (transdermal patch). Selegiline has been marketed under more than 70 brand names worldwide. The brand name ""Emsam"" was derived from the names of two children, Emily and Samuel, of one of the executives at Somerset Pharmaceuticals, the developer of Emsam. === Generic forms === Generic forms of oral selegiline are available in the United States. However, generic forms of the orally disintegrating tablet and the transdermal patch are not available in this country. The latter formulations of selegiline are very expensive, and this can be prohibitive to their use. There has been poor insurance coverage of the transdermal patch form for depression, with insurance companies often requiring patients to first fail to respond to one or two other antidepressants and to be responsible for larger copayments. It is expected that generics of the transdermal patch will become available at some point in the future. === Availability === Conventional oral selegiline (brand names Eldepryl, Jumex) is widely marketed throughout the world, including in over 70 countries. Conversely, the selegiline transdermal patch (brand name Emsam) is only marketed in the United States, while the selegiline orally disintegrating tablet (brand name Zelapar) is marketed in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. === Notable users === József Knoll, one of the developers of selegiline, began taking a low 1 mg daily dose of selegiline on January 1, 1989, at the age of 64.: 92 He reported in 2012 that this had continued for 22 years uninterrupted.: 92 Knoll stated that he had become so fascinated with the possible longevity-promoting effects of selegiline that he had decided to start taking it as a self-experiment.: 92 Knoll later died in 2018 at the age of 93. David Pearce, a British transhumanist philosopher, wrote his self-published book-length internet manifesto The Hedonistic Imperative six weeks after starting to take selegiline. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is known to have used selegiline for depression in the form of the Emsam patch for at least 5 to 10 years. He is also known to have simultaneously taken Adderall for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to have possessed non-pharmaceutical adrafinil, a prodrug of modafinil. === Fictional representations === In Gregg Hurwitz's novel Out of the Dark, selegiline (Emsam) and tyramine-containing food were used to assassinate the president of the United States. === Internet vendors === Selegiline in non-pharmaceutical form is sold on the Internet without a prescription by online vendors for uses such as purported cognitive enhancement (i.e., as a so-called ""smart drug"" or nootropic) and anti-aging effects. It is widely available for such purposes, for instance under informal brand names like Dep-Pro, Selepryl, and Cyprenil, which are oral liquid solutions of selegiline at a concentration of 1 mg per drop.: 86 === Presence in ecstasy === In his 1993 book E for Ecstasy examining the uses of the street drug ecstasy in the United Kingdom, the writer, activist, and ecstasy advocate Nicholas Saunders highlighted test results showing that certain consignments of the drug also contained selegiline. Consignments of ecstasy known as ""Strawberry"" contained what Saunders described as a ""potentially dangerous combination of ketamine, ephedrine and selegiline,"" as did a consignment of ""Sitting Duck"" Ecstasy tablets. === Doping in sport === Selegline is on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s list of prohibited substances. It is classified as a ""stimulant"" in this list, along with various amphetamines, methylphenidate, adrenergic sympathomimetics, modafinil, and other agents. A review of the pharmacology of WADA prohibited substances noted that although selegiline is classified as a stimulant in the WADA prohibited substances list and stimulants can enhance physical performance, selegiline was seemingly included in the list not because of any short-term stimulant effects of its own, but rather because it metabolizes into small amounts of levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine and can produce false positives for amphetamines on drug tests. In any case, levomethamphetamine and levoamphetamine are catecholamine releasing agents and can produce sympathomimetic and psychostimulant effects with sufficiently high exposure. Such actions may have performance-enhancing effects. === Regulatory status === Selegiline is a prescription drug. It is not specifically a controlled substance in the United States and hence is not an illegal drug. However, deprenyl and selegiline are controlled substances in Japan. They are classified as ""Stimulants"", alongside a variety of other amphetamines, under Article 2 of Japan's Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law. Selegiline is known to metabolize into small amounts of levoamphetamine and levomethamphetamine but is thought to have little to no misuse potential or dependence liability. == Non-medical use == === Anti-aging and longevity === József Knoll and his team are credited with having developed selegiline. Although selegiline's development as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression was headed by other teams, Knoll remained at the forefront of research into the potential longevity enhancing effects of selegiline up until his death in 2018. Knoll published his 2012 book How Selegiline ((–)-Deprenyl) Slows Brain Aging wherein he claims that:: 90 ""In humans, maintenance from sexual maturity on (–)-deprenyl (1mg daily) is, for the time being, the most promising prophylactic treatment to fight against the age related decay of behavioral performances, prolonging life, and preventing or delaying the onset of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's"". The mechanism of selegiline's longevity-promoting effect has been researched by several groups, including Knoll and his associates at Semmelweis University, Budapest. The drug has been determined to be a catecholaminergic activity enhancer when present in minuscule concentrations far below those at which monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity can be observed, thereby potentiating the release of catecholamine neurotransmitters in response to stimuli. Knoll maintains that micro-doses of selegiline act as a synthetic analogue to a known or unknown trace amine in order to preserve the brain catecholaminergic system, which he perceives as integral to the organism's ability to function in an adaptive, goal-directed and motivated manner during advancing physical age:: 70, 43 ""[...] enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic brain stem neurons play[s] a key role in controlling the uphill period of life and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The results of our longevity studies support the hypothesis that quality and duration of life rests upon the inborn efficiency of the catecholaminergic brain machinery, i.e. a high performing, long-living individual has a more active, more slowly deteriorating catecholaminergic system than its low performing, shorter living peer. Thus, a better brain engine allows for a better performance and a longer lifespan."" ""Since the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem are of key importance in ensuring that the mammalian organism works as a purposeful, motivated, goal-directed entity, it is hard to overestimate the significance of finding safe and efficient means to slow the decay of these systems with passing time. The conclusion that the maintenance on (–)-deprenyl that keeps the catecholaminergic neurons on a higher activity level is a safe and efficient anti-aging therapy follows from the discovery of the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic neurons of the brain stem. From the finding that this regulation starts working on a high activity level after weaning and the enhanced activity subsists during the uphill period of life, until sexual hormones dampen the enhancer regulation in the catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain stem, and this event signifies the transition from developmental longevity into postdevelopmental longevity, the downhill period of life."" Despite findings by Knoll that selegiline can prolong lifespan in rodents by 35% however, other studies have had conflicting findings and have even found increased mortality with selegiline in rodents. In humans with Parkinson's disease, selegiline has been associated with cardiovascular and psychiatric complications and has not been found to reduce mortality in long-term studies. As such, the claimed anti-aging and longevity benefits of selegiline have yet to be substantiated in humans and are controversial and uncertain. === Nootropic or ""smart drug"" === Selegiline is considered by some to be a nootropic, otherwise known as a cognitive enhancer or ""smart drug"", both at clinical and sub-clinical dosages, and has been used off-label and non-medically to improve cognitive performance. It is one of the most popular such agents. Selegiline has been found to have neuroprotective activity against certain neurotoxins and to increase the production of several brain growth factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The drug has also been found in animal models to improve learning ability and to help preserve it during ischemia and aging. Despite claims that selegiline and other claimed nootropics have cogintive-enhancing effects however, these effects are controversial and their benefits versus risks are uncertain. == Research == === Depression === Selegiline has been clinically studied in combination with oral L-phenylalanine or β-phenethylamine in the treatment of depression and was reported to be effective. L-Phenylalanine is known to be metabolized into β-phenethylamine, selegiline is known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of β-phenethylamine, and β-phenethylamine has been implicated in having psychostimulant-like mood-lifting effects. === Social anxiety === A small clinical study found that oral selegiline (10 mg/day) reduced symptoms of social anxiety disorder. The effectiveness was modest, with a reduction in social anxiety scores from baseline of 32% over 6 weeks of treatment. It was seemingly less effective than certain other agents used in the treatment of social anxiety, such as the non-selective MAOI phenelzine (45% symptom reduction) and the benzodiazepine clonazepam (51% symptom reduction), though it was similar to the SSRI sertraline (32% symptom decrease). === ADHD === Selegiline has been limitedly studied in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults. In a small randomized trial of selegiline for treatment of ADHD in children, there were improvements in attention, hyperactivity, and learning/memory performance but not in impulsivity. A small clinical randomized trial compared selegiline to methylphenidate, a first line treatment for ADHD, and reported equivalent efficacy as assessed by parent and teacher ratings. In another small randomized controlled trial of selegiline for the treatment of adult ADHD, a high dose of the medication for 6 weeks was not significantly more effective than placebo in improving symptoms. Selegiline in its transdermal patch form (brand name Emsam) has also been assessed in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in a small open-label pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer in 2003. However, there was a high rate of discontinuation and development was not further pursued. === Motivational disorders === Selegiline has been found to produce pro-motivational effects and to reverse motivational deficits in rodents. In case reports and small clinical studies, selegiline has been reported to improve disorders of diminished motivation like apathy and abulia due to conditions such as traumatic brain injury. In accordance with the preceding findings, selegiline, along with other dopaminergic and activating agents, may be useful in the treatment of disorders of diminished motivation, including apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism. === Addiction === Selegiline has been evaluated for smoking cessation both as a monotherapy and in combination with nicotine replacement therapy in five clinical studies. However, it is limitedly or not effective for this use. It was also evaluated for treatment of cocaine dependence in one study, but was similarly not effective. Studies are mixed on whether selegiline, at MAO-B-selective doses, reduces the effects of cocaine in humans. Selegiline, also at an MAO-B-selective dosage, did not modify or potentiate the pharmacological effects of intravenous methamphetamine in a small clinical study. === Sexual dysfunction === Selegiline has been assessed for treatment of sexual dysfunction induced by antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia, but was not effective in a single small clinical study. It also did not improve sexual function in men with depression, but did improve several domains of sexual function in women with depression. === Psychosis === Selegiline has been studied as an adjunct to antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia in four clinical studies. However, it failed to significantly reduce positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia in meta-analyses of these studies. === Excessive sleepiness === Selegiline has been evaluated for the treatment of narcolepsy in three small clinical studies. It was found to be effective in these studies. A dosage of 10 mg/day had no effect on symptoms, but 20 to 30 mg/day improved alertness, mood, and somewhat reduced cataplexy, clinical effects that have been described as comparable to the same dosages of amphetamine. Animal research indicates that the beneficial effects of high doses of selegiline in narcolepsy are likely due to conversion into its active metabolites, levoamphetamine and levomethamphetamine. Selegiline has also been evaluated for treatment of hypersomnia (excessive sleeping or sleepiness) in people with myotonic dystrophy, but its effectiveness was very uncertain. === Periodic limb movement disorder === Selegiline has been studied in the treatment of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in a single small open-label clinical study. It was reported to be effective as assessed by polysomnography, reducing periodic limb movements during sleep by about 60%. Selegiline has not been studied for the related condition restless legs syndrome (RLS) as of 2023. The drug has not been studied well enough in PLMD or RLS to be widely used in their treatment. === Tardive dyskinedia === Selegiline was studied in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in one small clinical study, but was ineffective. === Dementia and stroke === Selegiline has also been used off-label as a palliative treatment for dementia in Alzheimer's disease. However, its clinical effectiveness is limited or lacking for this use. It was also ineffective in the treatment of Lewy body dementia. Selegiline has been used to support motor rehabilitation in stroke recovery, but evidence for this use is inadequate and no recommendation can be made for or against it. === Disorders of consciousness === Selegiline has been studied in patients with disorders of consciousness, such as minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, and persistent coma, in a small open-label clinical study. It was found to be effective in enhancing arousal and promoting recovery of consciousness in some of these individuals. === Neurotoxicity === Selegiline has been reported to protect against the damage caused by the potent dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in animals. Conversely, selegiline is ineffective in protecting against the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Selegiline has also been reported to protect against methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents. The serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA appears to be dependent on release of dopamine and its subsequent metabolism by MAO-B within serotonergic neurons into hydroxyl radicals, which is blocked by MAO-B inhibition. Likewise, selegiline prevented the serotonergic neurotoxicity of a combination of methylenedioxyaminoindane (MDAI) and dextroamphetamine. Conversely, selegiline failed to reduce the serotonergic neurotoxicity caused by fenfluramine and either did not affect or potentiated the serotonergic neurotoxicity caused by para-chloroamphetamine (PCA). In addition, findings are mixed and conflicting on whether selegiline prevents amphetamine- and methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rodents. Although MAO-B-selective doses of selegiline protect against MDMA-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents, combination of amphetamines like MDMA with MAOIs, including selegiline, can produce serious complications, including serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and death. === Other formulations === The original oral formulation of selegiline was developed for the treatment of depression. However, it ended up being developed and approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease instead. In any case, oral selegiline has been widely used off-label to treat depression. The transdermal patch form of selegiline was developed and approved specifically for the treatment of depression. It was also under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), cognition disorders, and Parkinson's disease, but development for these indications was discontinued. The ODT form of selegiline was developed and licensed exclusively for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. == Veterinary use == In veterinary medicine, selegiline is sold under the brand name Anipryl and is manufactured by Zoetis. It is available in the form of 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 mg oral tablets for use in animals. Selegiline is used in dogs to treat canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) and, at higher doses, to treat pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH). CCD is a form of dementia that mimics Alzheimer's disease in humans. Geriatric dogs treated with selegiline show improvements in sleeping pattern, reduced urinary incontinence, and increased activity level, with most showing improvements by one month of treatment. Though it is labeled for use in dogs only, selegiline has been used off-label for geriatric cats with cognitive dysfunction. PDH is a hormonal disorder and is analogous to pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome in humans. Selegiline's effectiveness in treating PDH has been disputed. Theoretically, it works by increasing dopamine levels, which downregulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the brain, eventually leading to reduced levels of cortisol. Some claim that selegiline is only effective at treating PDH caused by lesions in the anterior pituitary (which comprise most canine cases). The greatest sign of improvement is lessening of PDH-related abdominal distention. Side effects in dogs are uncommon, but they include vomiting, diarrhea, diminished hearing, salivation, decreased weight, and behavioral changes such as hyperactivity, listlessness, disorientation, and repetitive motions. Selegiline has been limitedly studied in large animals like horses and its dosage in these animals has not been established. In preliminary research, a dose of selegiline of 30 mg orally or intravenously in horses had no observable effects on behavior or locomotor activity. The doses of selegiline used in animals are described as extremely high relative to those used in humans (which are ~0.1 mg/kg body weight). == References == == External links == Selegiline (l-deprenyl) (from The Good Drug Guide) - David Pearce - BLTC Research",Eldepryl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.9682672902708873e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001934325322508812)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/eldepryl.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selegiline,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-13490/eldepryl-oral/details ', [])"

Despite chemically being a tricyclic dibenzazepine (iminostilbene) derivative similar to imipramine, opipramol is not a monoamine reuptake inhibitor like most other tricyclic antidepressants, and instead acts primarily as a sigma-1 receptor agonist. It was developed by Schindler and Blattner in 1961. == Medical uses == Opipramol is typically used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and somatoform disorders. Preliminary studies suggest that opipramol shows potential clinical significance in the treatment of severe sleep bruxism. == Contraindications == In patients with hypersensitivity to opipramol or another component of the formulation Acute alcohol, sedative, analgesic, and antidepressant intoxications Acute urinary retention Acute delirium Untreated narrow-angle glaucoma Benign prostatic hyperplasia with residual urinary retention Paralytic ileus Pre-existing higher-grade atrioventricular blockages or diffuse supraventricular or ventricular stimulus conduction disturbances Combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) === Pregnancy and lactation === Experimental animal studies did not indicate injurious effects of opipramol on the embryonic development or fertility. Opipramol should only be prescribed during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, for compelling indication. It should not be used during lactation and breastfeeding, since it passes into breast milk in small quantities. == Side effects == Frequently (≥1% to <10%) reported adverse reactions with opipramol, especially at the beginning of the treatment, include fatigue, dry mouth, blocked nose, hypotension, and orthostatic dysregulation. Adverse reactions reported occasionally (≥0.1% to <1%) include dizziness, stupor, micturition disturbances, vigilance, accommodation disturbances, tremor, weight gain, thirst, allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), abnormal ejaculation, erectile impotence, constipation, transient increases in liver enzymes, tachycardia, and palpitations. Rarely (≥0.01% to <0.1%) reported adverse reactions include excitation, headache, paresthesia especially in elderly patients, restlessness, sweating, sleep disturbances, edema, galactorrhea, urine blockage, nausea and vomiting, fever, collapse conditions, stimulation conducting disturbances, intensification of present heart insufficiency, blood profile changes particularly leukopenia, confusion, delirium, stomach complaints, taste disturbance, and paralytic ileus especially with sudden discontinuation of a longer-term high-dose therapy. Very rarely (<0.01%) reported adverse reactions include seizures, motor disorders (akathisia, dyskinesia, ataxia), polyneuropathy, glaucoma, anxiety, hair loss, agranulocytosis, severe liver dysfunction after long-term treatment, jaundice, and chronic liver damage. == Overdose == Symptoms of intoxication from overdose include drowsiness, insomnia, stupor, agitation, coma, transient confusion, increased anxiety, ataxia, convulsions, oliguria, anuria, tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, AV block, hypotension, shock, respiratory depression, and, rarely, cardiac arrest. == Interactions == While opipramol is not a monoamine reuptake inhibitor, any irreversible MAOIs should still be discontinued at least 14 days before treatment. Opipramol can compete with other tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, antiarrhythmics (of class 1c), and other drugs for microsomal enzymes, which can lead to slower metabolism and higher plasma concentrations of these drugs. Co-administration of antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone) can increase the plasma concentration of opipramol. Barbiturates and anticonvulsants can reduce the plasma concentration of opipramol and thereby weaken its therapeutic effect. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Opipramol acts as a high affinity sigma receptor agonist, primarily of the σ1 subtype, but also of the σ2 subtype with lower affinity. In one study of σ1 receptor ligands that also included haloperidol, pentazocine, (+)-3-PPP, ditolylguanidine, dextromethorphan, SKF-10,047 ((±)-alazocine), ifenprodil, progesterone, and others, opipramol showed the highest affinity (Ki = 0.2–0.3) for the guinea pig σ1 receptor of all the tested ligands except haloperidol, which it was approximately equipotent with. The sigma receptor agonism of opipramol is thought to be responsible for its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Unlike other TCAs, opipramol does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin or norepinephrine. However, it does act as a high affinity antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor and is a low to moderate affinity antagonist of the dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2, and α1-adrenergic receptors. H1 receptor antagonism accounts for its antihistamine effects and associated sedative side effects. In contrast to other TCAs, opipramol has very low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and virtually no anticholinergic effects. Sigma receptors are a set of proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. σ1 receptors play key role in potentiating intracellular calcium mobilization thereby acting as sensor or modulator of calcium signaling. Occupancy of σ1 receptors by agonists causes translocation of the receptor from endoplasmic reticulum to peripheral areas (membranes) where the σ1 receptors cause neurotransmitter release. Opipramol is said to have a biphasic action, with prompt initial improvement of tension, anxiety, and insomnia followed by improved mood later. Hence, it is an anxiolytic with an antidepressant component. After sub-chronic treatment with opipramol, σ2 receptors are significantly downregulated but σ1 receptors are not. === Pharmacokinetics === Opipramol is rapidly and completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability of opipramol amounts to 94%. After single oral administration of 50 mg, the peak plasma concentration of the drug is reached after 3.3 hours and amounts to 15.6 ng/mL. After single oral administration of 100 mg the maximum plasma concentration is reached after 3 hours and amounts to 33.2 ng/mL. Therapeutic concentrations of opipramol range from 140 to 550 nmol/L. The plasma protein binding amounts to approximately 91% and the volume of distribution is approximately 10 L/kg. Opipramol is partially metabolized in the liver to deshydroxyethylopipramol. Metabolism occurs through the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. Its terminal half-life in plasma is 6–11 hours. About 70% is eliminated in urine with 10% unaltered. The remaining portion is eliminated through feces. == History == Opipramol was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1952 and was patented in 1961. The drug was first introduced for use in medicine in 1961. Opipramol was one of the first TCAs to be introduced, with imipramine marketed in the 1950s and amitriptyline marketed in 1961. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Opipramol is the English, German, French, and Spanish generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while opipramol hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana is opipramolo and in Latin is opipramolum. === Brand names === Opipramol is marketed under the brand names Deprenil, Dinsidon, Ensidon, Insidon, Insomin, Inzeton, Nisidana, Opipram, Opramol, Oprimol, Pramolan, and Sympramol among others. == References ==",Deprenil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00029828163678757846), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.31561434268951416), (',', -0.12575094401836395), ('ĠMED', -0.08348248153924942), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0070683895610272884)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([meshb.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012642&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='MeSH Browser', type='url_citation', url='https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012642&utm_source=openai')])"

At doses of between 10 and 40 mg a day it has also been shown to improve depression particularly when psychomotor retardation is prominent and anxiety minimal. The mortality rates of fungal infections that affect the central nervous system are high in consequence of the absence of effective antifungal drugs with good penetration across the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In the present work in vitro antifungal activities of three good penetrating non-antifungal drugs (amantadine hydrochloride, R-(-)-deprenyl hydrochloride, valproic acid sodium salt) and their combinations with three antifungal agents (amphotericin B, itraconazole, terbinafine) were tested with broth microdilution method against eight fungal isolates belonging to Zygomycetes (Lichtheimia corymbifera, Rhizomucor miehei, Rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis, Saksenaeavasiformis) and Aspergillus genus (A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. terreus). These are known to be possible agents of central nervous fungal infections (CNFI). When used alone, the investigated nonantifungal drugs exerted slight antifungal effects. In their combinations with antifungal agents they acted antagonistically, additively and synergistically against zygomyceteous isolates. Primarily antagonistic interactions were revealed between the investigated drugs in case of Aspergilli, but additive and synergistic interactions were also observed. The additive and synergistic combinations allowed the usage of reduced concentrations of antifungal agents to inhibit the fungal growth in our study. These combinations would be a basis of an effective, less toxic therapy for treatment of CNFI. Low oral bioavailability of selegiline hydrochloride (SH) is primarily due to extensive first-pass metabolism and hence the need for an alternative pathway of administration.

4358,"('Procaine hcl', 'Naucaine', 'Neocaine', 'Omnicain', 'Planocaine')",Medical,"Procaine is a local anesthetic drug of the amino ester group. It is most commonly used in dental procedures to numb the area around a tooth and is also used to reduce the pain of intramuscular injection of penicillin. Owing to the ubiquity of the trade name Novocain (without the ""e"" in the original German patent) or Novocaine (with the ""e"" in the US patent), in some regions, procaine is referred to generically as novocaine. It acts mainly as a sodium channel blocker. Today, it is used therapeutically in some countries due to its sympatholytic, anti-inflammatory, perfusion-enhancing, and mood-enhancing effects. Procaine was first synthesized in 1905, shortly after amylocaine. It was created by the chemist Alfred Einhorn who gave the chemical the trade name Novocain, from the Latin nov- (meaning ""new"") and -caine, a common ending for alkaloids used as anesthetics. It was introduced into medical use by surgeon Heinrich Braun. Prior to the discovery of amylocaine and procaine, cocaine was a commonly used local anesthetic. Einhorn wished his new discovery to be used for amputations, but for this surgeons preferred general anesthesia. Dentists, however, found it very useful. == Pharmacology == The primary use for procaine is as an anaesthetic. Aside from its use as a dental anesthetic, procaine is used less frequently today, since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as mepivacaine, and prilocaine), procaine is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine for the purpose of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. As a dental anesthesic, for example, more novocaine is needed for root canal treatment than for a simple filling. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse. Procaine, an ester anesthetic, is metabolized in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase through hydrolysis into para-amino benzoic acid (PABA), which is then excreted by the kidneys into the urine. A 1% procaine injection has been recommended for the treatment of extravasation complications associated with venipuncture, steroids, and antibiotics. It has likewise been recommended for treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injections (10 ml of 1% procaine), as it helps relieve pain and vascular spasm. Procaine is an occasional additive in illicit street drugs and is presented and sold usually as cocaine or heroin. == Adverse effects == Application of procaine leads to the depression of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of procaine led to the increase of dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain. Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to procaine dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. Procaine may also induce weakening of the myocardium leading to cardiac arrest. Procaine can also cause allergic reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to procaine are usually not in response to procaine itself, but to its metabolite PABA. Allergic reactions are in fact quite rare, estimated to have an incidence of 1 per 500,000 injections. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygous (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and do not hydrolyze ester anesthetics such as procaine. This results in a prolonged period of high levels of the anesthetic in the blood and increased toxicity. However, certain populations in the world such as the Vysya community in India commonly have a deficiency of this enzyme. == Synthesis == Procaine can be synthesized in two ways. The first consists of the direct reaction of benzocaine with 2-diethylaminoethanol using sodium ethoxide-ethanol solution as the solvent and base. The second is by oxidizing 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which is further reacted with thionyl chloride, the resulting acyl chloride is then reacted with 2-diethylaminoethanol to give Nitrocaine. Finally, the nitro group is reduced by hydrogenation over Raney nickel catalyst. == See also == Chloroprocaine Peter DeMarco == References == == Further reading ==",Neocaine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3856492842023727e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.08298054337501526), ('ICAL', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03835362568497658)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6931474208831787)])","('INFO; ', [])"
