It is usually prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure in order to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack. It was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1989. == Medical uses == Isradipine is given as either a 2.5 mg or 5 mg capsule. == Side effects == Common side effects include: Dizziness Warmth, redness, or tingly feeling under your skin Headache Weakness, tired feeling Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach Skin rash or itching Serious side effects include: Lightheadedness or fainting Shortness of breath, especially from minimal physical activity Swelling in the hands and feet Rapid and/or heavy heartbeat Chest pain == Drug interactions == It is advised that those using isradipine not take dolasetron (Anzemet), as both agents can cause a dose-dependent PR interval and QRS complex prolongation. Itraconazole (Onmel/Sporanox) exhibits a negative inotropic effect on the heart and thus could spur an additive effect when used concomitantly with isradipine. Itraconazole also inhibits an important cytochrome liver enzyme (CYP 450 3A4) which is needed to metabolize isradipine and other calcium channel blockers. This will increase plasma levels of isradipine and could cause an unintentional overdose of the medication. Caution is advised when administering both agents together. Tizanidine demonstrates anti-hypertensive effects and should be avoided in patients taking isradipine due to the possibility of synergism between both medications. The antibiotic rifampin lowered plasma concentrations of isradipine to below detectable limits. Cimetidine increased isradipine mean peak plasma levels. A downward dose adjustment may be necessary with this particular instance of polypharmacy. Severe hypotension was reported with fentanyl anesthesia when it was combined with other calcium channel blockers. Even though isradipine, another calcium channel blocker, has not been used in conjunction with fentanyl anesthesia in any studies, caution is advised. == Overdose == Symptoms of an isradipine overdose include: Lethargy Sinus tachycardia Transient hypotension == Stereochemistry == Isradipine contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers, more precisely atropisomers.

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.",Acetyl-11-keto-œ≤-boswellic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.723973582556937e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.07956615835428238), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4748372733592987)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00033546582562848926)])","('INFO; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3201914/?utm_source=openai), [bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com](https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0500-4-406?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8931781/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=315, start_index=6, title='Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA); targeting oral cavity pathogens - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3201914/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=315, start_index=6, title='Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA); targeting oral cavity pathogens | BMC Research Notes | Full Text', type='url_citation', url='https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0500-4-406?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=315, start_index=6, title='The Biological Activity of 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-β-Boswellic Acid in Nervous System Diseases - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8931781/?utm_source=openai')])"
1787,"('Sodium molybdate', 'Molybdate (disodium)')",Medical,"Sodium molybdate, Na2MoO4, is useful as a source of molybdenum. This white, crystalline salt is often encountered as the dihydrate, Na2MoO4·2H2O. == Preparation == Dissolution of MoO3 in sodium hydroxide at 50–70 °C followed by crystallizing the filtered product. If crystallized below 10 °C, the decahydrate forms. Above 10 °C, the dihydate crystallizes. The anhydrous salt is obtained by heating this product at 100 °C. MoO3 + 2NaOH + H2O → Na2MoO4·2H2O == Uses == The agriculture industry uses 500 tons per year as a fertilizer. In particular, its use has been suggested for treatment of whiptail in broccoli and cauliflower in molybdenum-deficient soils. However, care must be taken because at a level of 0.3 ppm sodium molybdate can cause copper deficiencies in animals, particularly cattle. It is used in industry for corrosion inhibition, as it is a non-oxidizing anodic inhibitor. The addition of sodium molybdate significantly reduces the nitrite requirement of fluids inhibited with nitrite-amine, and improves the corrosion protection of carboxylate salt fluids. In industrial water treatment applications where galvanic corrosion is a potential due to bimetallic construction, the application of sodium molybdate is preferred over sodium nitrite. Sodium molybdate has the advantage in that the dosing of lower ppm's of molybdate allow for lower conductivity of the circulating water. Sodium molybdate at levels of 50-100 ppm offer the same levels of corrosion inhibition as sodium nitrite at levels of 800+ ppm. By utilizing lower concentrations of sodium molybdate, conductivity is kept at a minimum and thus galvanic corrosion potentials are decreased. == Reactions == When treated with sodium borohydride, molybdate is reduced to molybdenum(IV) oxide: Na2MoO4 + NaBH4 + 2H2O → NaBO2 + MoO2 + 2NaOH + 3H2 Sodium molybdate reacts with the acids of dithiophosphates: Na2MoO4 + (R = Me, Et)(RO)2PS2H → [MoO2(S2P(OR)2)2] which further reacts to form [MoO3(S2P(OR)2)4]. == Structure == In aqueous solution, sodium molybdate features dissociated sodium ions and tetrahedral molybdate (MoO42-), which adopts a sulfate-like structure. The solid dihydrate material has a complex structure typical for alkali metal salts of oxyanions. The MoO42- subunits are tetrahedral with Mo-O distances near 178 pm. == Safety == Sodium molybdate supports the biosynthesis of molybdoenzymes, which are found in all higher forms of life. The LC50 for freshwater fish ranges from 60 to 7630 mg/L.

1789,"('H-his-oh.hcl.h2o', 'Histidine', 'H-his-oh', 'Glyoxaline-5-alanine', 'Anti-rheuma')","Food, Medical","Histidine (symbol His or H) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also. It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC. Histidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. The name stems from its discovery in tissue, from ἱστός histós ""tissue"". It is also a precursor to histamine, a vital inflammatory agent in immune responses. The acyl radical is histidyl. == Properties of the imidazole side chain == The conjugate acid (protonated form) of the imidazole side chain in histidine has a pKa of approximately 6.0. Thus, below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated (as described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation). The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both nitrogens and can be represented with two equally important resonance structures. Sometimes, the symbol Hip is used for this protonated form instead of the usual His. Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost. The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N3-H or N1-H tautomers. The N3-H tautomer is shown in the figure above. In the N1-H tautomer, the NH is nearer the backbone. These neutral tautomers, also referred to as Nε (or Nτ) and Nδ (or Nπ), are sometimes referred to with symbols Hie and Hid, respectively. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is aromatic at all pH values. Under certain conditions, all three ion-forming groups of histidine can be charged forming the histidinium cation. The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of hemoglobin, histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as carbon monoxide. This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in hemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free heme. The tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by 15N NMR spectroscopy. The two 15N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to nitric acid on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased chemical shift). NMR spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm). This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ammonium. The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order paramagnetic effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited π* states of the aromatic ring. At pH > 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm. === Ligand === Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. One example is the axial base attached to Fe in myoglobin and hemoglobin. Poly-histidine tags (of six or more consecutive H residues) are utilized for protein purification by binding to columns with nickel or cobalt, with micromolar affinity. Natural poly-histidine peptides, found in the venom of the viper Atheris squamigera have been shown to bind Zn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) and affect the function of venom metalloproteases. N-terminal histidines are known to function as bidentate ligands, with a metal (generally copper) bound to both the amine of the N-terminus and the Nε of the histidine; the Nδ is often methylated. Although recently discovered, this ""histidine brace"" motif is critical in biogeochemical cycles: it functions as the active site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which break down unreactive polysaccharides such as cellulose. It is proposed that the evolution of these enzymes in fungi corresponds to the first widespread ability to decompose woody plant mass, leading to the end of the Carboniferous era and its mass accumulation of coal deposits. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === l-Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in humans. Humans and other animals must ingest histidine or histidine-containing proteins. The biosynthesis of histidine has been widely studied in prokaryotes such as E. coli. Histidine synthesis in E. coli involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction. For example, as shown in the pathway, His4 catalyzes 4 different steps in the pathway. Histidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is made from ribose-5-phosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first reaction of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of PRPP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzyme ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is indicated by His1 in the image. His4 gene product then hydrolyzes the product of the condensation, phosphoribosyl-ATP, producing phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), which is an irreversible step. His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form d-erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes l-histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of l-histidinol to form l-histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, l-histidinal is converted to l-histidine. The histidine biosynthesis pathway has been studied in the fungus Neurospora crassa, and a gene (His-3) encoding a multienzyme complex was found that was similar to the His4 gene of the bacterium E. coli. A genetic study of N. crassa histidine mutants indicated that the individual activities of the multienzyme complex occur in discrete, contiguous sections of the His-3 genetic map, suggesting that the different activities of the multienzyme complex are encoded separately from each other. However, mutants were also found that lacked all three activities simultaneously, suggesting that some mutations cause loss of function of the complex as a whole. Just like animals and microorganisms, plants need histidine for their growth and development. Microorganisms and plants are similar in that they can synthesize histidine. Both synthesize histidine from the biochemical intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms. ==== Regulation of biosynthesis ==== This pathway requires energy in order to occur therefore, the presence of ATP activates the first enzyme of the pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (shown as His1 in the image on the right). ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is the rate determining enzyme, which is regulated through feedback inhibition meaning that it is inhibited in the presence of the product, histidine. === Degradation === Histidine is one of the amino acids that can be converted to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle). Histidine, along with other amino acids such as proline and arginine, takes part in deamination, a process in which its amino group is removed. In prokaryotes, histidine is first converted to urocanate by histidase. Then, urocanase converts urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. Imidazolonepropionase catalyzes the reaction to form formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) from 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. The formimino group is transferred to tetrahydrofolate, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate. Overall, these reactions result in the formation of glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate can then be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form α-ketoglutarate. === Conversion to other biologically active amines === The histidine amino acid is a precursor for histamine, an amine produced in the body necessary for inflammation. The enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase converts histidine into ammonia and urocanic acid. A deficiency in this enzyme is present in the rare metabolic disorder histidinemia, producing urocanic aciduria as a key diagnostic finding. Histidine can be converted to 3-methylhistidine, which serves as a biomarker for skeletal muscle damage, by certain methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis, which is a dipeptide found in skeletal muscle.

1792,"('Miransertib', 'Miransertib [inn]', 'Miransertib [usan]', 'Miransertib [who-dd]', 'Miransertib (usan/inn)')",Medical," Leishmaniasis is amongst the most important neglected diseases, afflicting more than 12 million people in 88 countries. There is an urgent need for safe orally bioavailable and cost-effective drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis. It has recently been shown that Leishmania activates host macrophage serine/threonine kinase Akt, to promote survival of both parasites and infected cells. Here, we sought to evaluate a compound, Miransertib (ARQ 092), an orally bioavailable and selective allosteric Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials for patients with PI3K/Akt-driven tumors or Proteus syndrome. Miransertib was tested against Leishmania donovani and Leishmania amazonensis, causative agents of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. Cultured promastigotes were susceptible to Miransertib. In addition, Miransertib was markedly effective against intracellular amastigotes of L. donovani or L. amazonensis-infected macrophages. Miransertib also enhanced mTOR dependent autophagy in Leishmania-infected macrophages, which may represent one mechanism of Miransertib-mediated killing of intracellular Leishmania. Whereas parasite clearance in the spleen of mice infected with L. donovani and treated with Miransertib was comparable to that when treated with miltefosine, Miransertib caused a greater reduction in the parasite load in the liver. In the cutaneous leishmaniasis infection model, lesions were reduced by 40% as compared to mock treated mice. Together, these results provide direct evidence to support the conclusion that Miransertib is an excellent lead compound for the development of a new oral drug therapy for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Low-flow vascular malformations are congenital overgrowths composed of abnormal blood vessels potentially causing pain, bleeding and obstruction of different organs. These diseases are caused by oncogenic mutations in the endothelium, which result in overactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Lack of robust in vivo preclinical data has prevented the development and translation into clinical trials of specific molecular therapies for these diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the Pik3ca PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) refers to a group of rare disorders, caused by somatic activating mutations in PIK3CA, resulting in abnormal PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway signalling. Significant associated morbidity is frequently observed, and approved treatments are lacking. Miransertib (ARQ 092) is a novel, orally available, selective pan-AKT inhibitor with proven in vitro efficacy. Following recent results of the use of AKT inhibitors in Proteus syndrome (PS) and AKT-mutant cancers, we investigated its therapeutic use in two patients with severe PROS who had exhausted conventional treatment methods. Two patients, one with CLOVES variant (P1) and one with facial infiltrating lipomatosis and hemimegalencephaly (P2), were commenced on miransertib treatment on a compassionate use basis. In patient one, intra-abdominal and paraspinal overgrowth had resulted in respiratory compromise, obstructive uropathy, dysfunctional seating and lying postures, and chronic pain. In patient two, hemifacial overgrowth and hemimegalencephaly had caused difficulties with articulation and oral function, and refractory epilepsy. Miransertib treatment was continued for a median duration of 22 months (range 22-28). In patient one, alleviation of respiratory compromise was observed and functionally, seating and lying postures improved. Serial volumetric MRI analysis revealed 15% reduction in calculated volumes of fatty overgrowth between treatment commencement and end. In patient two, reduction in seizure burden and improved parent-reported quality of life measures were reported. Treatment was discontinued in both patients due to lack of sustained response, and poor compliance in year two of treatment (P2). No significant toxicities were reported. We report the first paediatric case series of the use of miransertib in two children with PROS. Objective clinical response was observed in patient one, and improvement in key qualitative outcomes was reported in patient two. Treatment was well tolerated with no significant toxicities reported. This case series highlights the potential therapeutic utility of miransertib in selected paediatric patients with severe PROS, and further demonstrates the potential for re-purposing targeted therapies for the treatment of rare diseases. An open label, Phase 1/2 study of miransertib in children with PROS and PS is underway to more accurately assess the efficacy of miransertib in the treatment of PROS disorder (NCT03094832).",Miransertib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006816447712481022), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008630713447928429)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/arqule-announces-first-patient-dosed-in-registrational-mosiac-trial-of-miransertib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=162, start_index=9, title='ArQule Announces First Patient Dosed in Registrational MOSIAC Trial of Miransertib for the Treatment of Proteus Syndrome and PIK3CA-related Overgrowth Spectrum | Nasdaq', type='url_citation', url='https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/arqule-announces-first-patient-dosed-in-registrational-mosiac-trial-of-miransertib?utm_source=openai')])"
1793,"('Docusate (sodium)', 'Dioctyl sulfosuccinate (sodium salt)', 'Docusate hydrogen', 'Spolion 8', 'Colace')",Medical,"Docusate is the common chemical and pharmaceutical name of the anion bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate, also commonly called dioctyl sulfosuccinate (DOSS). Salts of this anion, especially docusate sodium, are widely used in medicine as an emollient laxative and as stool softeners, by mouth or rectally. Some studies claim that docusate is not more effective than a placebo for improving constipation. Other docusate salts with medical use include those of calcium and potassium. Docusate salts are also used as food additives, emulsifiers, dispersants, and wetting agents, among other uses. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 148th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with senna was the 261st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == History == Sodium docusate was patented in 1937 by Coleman R. Caryl and Alphons O. Jaeger for American Cyanamid, which commercialized it for many years as a detergent under the brand name Aerosol OT. Its use for the treatment of constipation was first proposed in 1955 by James L. Wilson and David G. Dickinson, and quickly popularized under the name Doxinate. == Medical use == === Constipation === The main medical use of docusate sodium is to treat constipation, acting as a laxative and stool softener. In painful anorectal conditions such as hemorrhoid and anal fissures, it can help avoid pain caused by straining during bowel movements. When administered by mouth, a bowel movement often occurs in 1 to 3 days, while rectal use may be effective within 20 minutes. Sodium docusate is recommended as a stool softener for children. However, its effectiveness for constipation is poorly supported by evidence. Multiple studies have found docusate to be no more effective than a placebo for improving constipation. Others have found it to be less useful for the treatment of chronic constipation than psyllium. The medication may be given to people who are receiving opioid medication, although prolonged use may cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract. === Other medical uses === Docusate sodium, when used with ear syringing, may help with earwax removal, particularly in the case of impaction. Sodium docusate is also used as a lubricant in the production of tablets and as an emulsifier in topical preparations and other suspensions. === Precautions and contraindications === Docusate sodium is approved and recommended as safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Docusate is not recommended in people with appendicitis, acute abdomen, or ileus. When taken by mouth it should be ingested with plenty of water. === Side effects === Side effects are uncommon and typically mild, and may include stomach pain, abdominal cramps or diarrhea, Efficacy decreases with long-term use, and may cause poor bowel function. Serious allergic reactions may occur with the drug. The most severe side effect of docusate, although very rare, is rectal bleeding. === Interactions === Docusate might increase the resorption of other drugs, for example, dantron (1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone). === Mechanism of action === Docusate is an anionic surfactant, which works by reducing the surface tension of the stool, allowing more intestinal water and fat to combine with the stool. This decreases the strain and discomfort associated with constipation. It does not stay in the gastrointestinal tract but is absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted via the gallbladder after undergoing extensive metabolism. === Pharmaceutical brand names === In the U.S., docusate sodium for pharmaceutical use is available under multiple brand names: Aqualax, Calube, Colace, Colace Micro-Enema, Correctol Softgel Extra Gentle, DC-240, Dialose, Diocto, Dioctocal, Dioctosoftez, Dioctyn, Dionex, Doc-Q-Lace, Docu Soft, Docucal, Doculax, Docusoft S, DOK, DOS, Doss-Relief, DSS, Dulcolax - Stool Softener (not to be confused with another drug marketed under the Dulcolax brand, bisacodyl, which is a stimulant laxative), Ex-Lax Stool Softener, Fleet Sof-Lax, Genasoft, Kasof, Laxa-basic, Modane Soft, Octycine-100, Pedia-Lax, Preferred Plus Pharmacy Stool Softener, Regulax SS, Sulfalax Calcium, Sur-Q-Lax, Surfak Stool Softener, and Therevac-SB. Generic preparations are also available. In the UK, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is sold under the brand names Docusol (Typharm Ltd) and DulcoEase (Boehringer Ingelheim). In Australia, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is sold as Coloxyl and Coloxyl with senna. In India, preparations include Laxatin by Alembic, Doslax by Raptakos Laboratories, Cellubril by AstraZeneca, and Laxicon by Stadmed. == Other uses == Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is used as a surfactant in a wide range of applications, often under the name Aerosol-OT. It is unusual in that it can form microemulsions without the use of co-surfactants, and it has a rich variety of aqueous-phase behavior including multiple liquid crystalline phases. === Food additive === Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate has been approved by the US FDA as a ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) additive. It is used in a variety of food products, as a surface active agent, stabilizer, thickener, wetting agent, processing aid, solubilizing agent, emulsifier, and dispersant. The highest amount found in food products is 0.5% by weight, which include pasteurized cheese spreads, cream cheeses and salad dressings. The FDA also approved its use as a wetting agent or solubilizer for flavoring agents in carbonated and non-carbonated drinks at levels up to 10 parts per million. === Microencapsulation === Sodium docusate is the most widely used surfactant in reverse micelle encapsulation studies. === Non-medical brand names === As a surfactant, docusate sodium is or has been commercialized under many brand names, including DSS, Aerosol OT, Alphasol OT, Colace, Complemix, Coprol, Dioctylal, Dioctyl-Medo Forte, Diotilan, Diovac, Disonate, Doxinate, Doxol, Dulsivac, Molatoc, Molofac, Nevax, Norval, Regutol, Softili, Solusol, Sulfimel DOS, Vatsol OT, Velmol, and Waxsol == Chemistry == === Structure and properties === The structural formula of the docusate anion is R−O−C(=O)−CH(SO−3)−CH2−C(=O)−O−R, where R is the 2-ethylhexyl group H3C−(CH2)3−C(−CH2−CH3)H−CH2−. The conjugate acid can be described as the twofold carboxylate ester of sulfosuccinic acid with 2-ethylhexanol. The compound is a white, wax-like, plastic solid, with an odor suggestive of octyl alcohol. It starts to decompose at about 220 °C. The solubility of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate in water is 14 g/L at 25 °C, increasing to 55 g/L at 70 °C. Solubility is better in less polar solvents: 1:30 in ethanol, 1:1 in chloroform and diethylether, and practically unlimited in petroleum ether (25 °C). It also is highly soluble in glycerol, although this is a rather polar solvent. It is also highly soluble in xylene, oleic acid, acetone, diacetone alcohol, methanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, furfurol, and vegetable oils. The ester groups are easily cleaved under basic conditions, but are stable against acids. === Synthesis === Sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate can be obtained by treating dioctyl maleate with sodium bisulfite. The bisulfite anion adds to the double bond: −CH=CH− + HSO−3 → −CH(−SO−3)−CH2− == Toxicity == Ingestion may cause the side effects described above, such as diarrhea, intestinal bloating, and occasionally cramping pains. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is not known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic. === Marine species === Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is of low toxicity for crustaceans such as the hermit crab Clibanarius erythropus and the shrimp Crangon crangon. Toxicity for molluscs varies widely, with 48-hour LD50 found between 5 mg/L for the common limpet and 100 mg/L for the common periwinkle. Various species of phytoplankton have an LD50 around 8 mg/L. In a 2010 study, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate exhibited higher toxicity against bacteria (Vibrio fischeri, Anabaena sp.) and algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) than did a number of fluorinated surfactants (PFOS, PFOA, or PFBS). Measuring bioluminescence inhibition of the bacteria and growth inhibition of the algae, the LD50 were in the range of 43–75 mg/L. Combinations of the fluorinated compounds with dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate showed mid to highly synergistic effects in most settings, meaning that such combinations are significantly more toxic than the individual substances. === Freshwater species === The substance is highly toxic for rainbow trout with a median lethal concentration (LC50) of 0.56 mg/L after 48 hours for the pure substance. It is only slightly to moderately toxic for rainbow trout fingerlings, and slightly toxic for harlequin rasboras (LC50 27 mg/L of a 60% formulation after 48 hours). == References ==",Colace,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.00017720005416776985), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.010054484941065311), (',', -7.505351095460355e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.0005567280459217727), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00041416651220060885), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0001461399078834802), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038110725581645966)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docusate,https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/colace,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/colace ', [])"

An extensive medicinal chemistry study, designed to generate more potent analogues of roscovitine, led to the identification of an optimal substitution at the N6 position (compound CR8). An extensive selectivity study (108 kinases) highlights the exquisite selectivity of CR8 for CDK1/2/3/5/7/9. CR8 was 2- to 4-fold more potent than (R)-roscovitine at inhibiting these kinases. Cocrystal structures of (R)-CR8 and (R)-roscovitine with pCDK2/cyclin A showed that both inhibitors adopt essentially identical positions. The cellular effects of CR8 and (R)-roscovitine were investigated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. CR8 inhibited the phosphorylation of CDK1 and 9 substrates, with a 25-50 times higher potency compared to (R)-roscovitine. CR8 was consistently more potent than (R)-roscovitine at inducing apoptotic cell death parameters: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium reduction (40-fold), lactate dehydrogenase release (35-fold), caspases activation (68-fold) and poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage (50-fold). This improved cell death-inducing activity of CR8 over (R)-roscovitine was observed in 25 different cell lines. Altogether these results show that second-generation analogues of (R)-roscovitine can be designed with improved antitumor potential. Following the discovery of (R)-roscovitine's beneficial effects in three polycystic kidney disease (PKD) mouse models, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) inhibitors have been investigated as potential treatments. We have used various affinity chromatography approaches to identify the molecular targets of roscovitine and its more potent analog (S)-CR8 in human and murine polycystic kidneys. These methods revealed casein kinases 1 (CK1) as additional targets of the two drugs. CK1ε expression at the mRNA and protein levels is enhanced in polycystic kidneys of 11 different PKD mouse models as well as in human polycystic kidneys. A shift in the pattern of CK1α isoforms is observed in all PKD mouse models. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of both CK1ε and CK1α are increased in mouse polycystic kidneys. Inhibition of CK1ε and CK1α may thus contribute to the long-lasting attenuating effects of roscovitine and (S)-CR8 on cyst development. CDKs and CK1s may constitute a dual therapeutic target to develop kinase inhibitory PKD drug candidates.",(r)-cr8,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.021282630041241646), ('ICAL', -4.887569048150908e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06199674680829048)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/r-cr8-2/360510R,https://www.bio-techne.com/p/small-molecules-peptides/r-cr8_3605,https://www.tocris.com/products/r-cr8_3605,https://www.rndsystems.com/cn/products/r-cr8_3605,https://zellbio.eu/product/r-cr8/,https://www.scbt.com/ko/p/r-cr8-294646-77-8,https://www.fishersci.at/shop/products/r-cr8/18034532,https://www.biocompare.com/11119-Chemicals/3273377-R-CR8/,https://www.fishersci.pt/shop/products/r-cr8-2/18034532,https://www.biomol.com/products/chemicals/biochemicals/r-cr8-cay14006-1,https://www.targetmol.com/compound/%28r%29-cr8 ', [])"

As PTX-200, the drug is currently in two early stage clinical trials in breast cancer and ovarian cancer being conducted by the small molecule drug development company Prescient Therapeutics. == Background == Triciribine is a cell-permeable unnatural nucleoside that inhibits the phosphorylation and signalling of all three family members of Akt - Akt-1, Akt-2 and Akt-3. These are serine/threonine protein kinases in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway that play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Following recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 (Akt-1 numbering) by PDK-1 or PDK-2 results in full activation of the enzyme. Triciribine does not inhibit PI3K or PDK1, the direct upstream activators of Akt, nor does it inhibit PKC, PKA, ERK1/2, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, p38, STAT3, or JNK signalling pathways. == Early development, 1971-2004 == Triciribine, first synthesized in 1971, was found to have definite anti-cancer properties and a phosphate ester of the drug went into clinical trials in the 1980s because it had improved solubility. The trials found the drug to be toxic with limited efficacy. For example, a Phase I study in 1984 evaluating 33 advanced cancer patients using a five-day continuous infusion schedule found hyperglycemia, hepatotoxicity, and thrombocytopenia as common toxicities with only one patient's cancer improving. A Phase II trial in 1993 found only two responders out of 21 cervical cancer patients. Triciribine was widely considered to be a failed cancer drug until its 'rehabilitation' in the early 2000s. == Development as an Akt inhibitor, 2004 - == In the early 2000s Said Sebti at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute in Tampa, Fl and Jin Cheng at the University of South Florida established that Triciribine would be effective against tumours with hyperactivated AKT. By 2010 important parts of the mechanism of action for Triciribine had been elucidated, specifically its binding to the PH domain of AKT, thereby blocking its recruitment to the membrane, leading to subsequent inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Pre-clinical work, 2004-2015. A number of pre-clinical studies confirmed the initial 2004 finding, including one showing synergy with tipifarnib and one showing effectiveness in pancreatic cancer cells. Phase I in solid tumors, 2011. This pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study suggested that treatment with PTX-200 could inhibit phosphorylated AKT in tumours at doses that were tolerable. Phase I in advanced leukemia, 2013 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00642031). This study, conducted at the Lee Moffitt as well as the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, tested Triciribine as a single agent. Of the 32 evaluable patients, 15 had progressive disease and 17 had stable disease following a single cycle of treatment. Of the patients with stable disease, 3 patients with AML achieved ≥50% bone marrow blast reduction and a fourth patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia had marked spleen reduction and resolution of leukocytosis. == Current development == As PTX-200, triciribine is currently in a Phase Ib/II study in breast cancer) and a Phase Ib trial in platinum resistant ovarian cancer.

Together with cephamycins, they constitute a subgroup of β-lactam antibiotics called cephems. Cephalosporins were discovered in 1945, and first sold in 1964. == Discovery == The aerobic mold which yielded cephalosporin C was found in the sea near a sewage outfall in Su Siccu, by Cagliari harbour in Sardinia, by the Italian pharmacologist Giuseppe Brotzu in July 1945. == Structure == Cephalosporin contains a 6-membered dihydrothiazine ring. Substitutions at position 3 generally affect pharmacology; substitutions at position 7 affect antibacterial activity, but these cases are not always true. == Medical uses == Cephalosporins can be indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by bacteria susceptible to this particular form of antibiotic. First-generation cephalosporins are active predominantly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. They are therefore used mostly for skin and soft tissue infections and the prevention of hospital-acquired surgical infections. Successive generations of cephalosporins have increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria, albeit often with reduced activity against Gram-positive organisms. The antibiotic may be used for patients who are allergic to penicillin due to the different β-lactam antibiotic structure. The drug is able to be excreted in the urine. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) associated with the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever. === Allergic hypersensitivity === The commonly quoted figure of 10% of patients with allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent ""safety first"" policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to all members of the group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins or carbapenems. The contraindication, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or cefuroxime and injectable cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided. A 2012 literature review similarly finds that the risk is negligible with third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. The risk with first-generation cephalosporins having similar R1 sidechains was also found to be overestimated, with the real value closer to 1%. === MTT side chain === Several cephalosporins are associated with hypoprothrombinemia and a disulfiram-like reaction with ethanol. These include latamoxef (moxalactam), cefmenoxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefmetazole, and cefotetan. This is thought to be due to the methylthiotetrazole side-chain of these cephalosporins, which blocks the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (likely causing hypothrombinemia) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (causing alcohol intolerance). Thus, consumption of alcohol after taking these cephalosporin orally or intravenously is contraindicated, and in severe cases can lead to death. The methylthiodioxotriazine sidechain found in ceftriaxone has a similar effect. Cephalosporins without these structural elements are believed to be safe with alcohol. == Mechanism of action == Cephalosporins are bactericidal and, like other β-lactam antibiotics, disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer forming the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala at the end of muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala site, thereby irreversibly inhibiting PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan. == Resistance == Resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics can involve either reduced affinity of existing PBP components or the acquisition of a supplementary β-lactam-insensitive PBP. Compared to other β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins), they are less susceptible to β-lactamases. Currently, some Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli strains are resistant to cephalosporins. Some Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have also developed resistance to cephalosporins to varying degrees. == Classification == The cephalosporin nucleus can be modified to gain different properties. Cephalosporins are sometimes grouped into ""generations"" by their antimicrobial properties. The first cephalosporins were designated first-generation cephalosporins, whereas, later, more extended-spectrum cephalosporins were classified as second-generation cephalosporins. Each newer generation has significantly greater Gram-negative antimicrobial properties than the preceding generation, in most cases with decreased activity against Gram-positive organisms. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, however, have true broad-spectrum activity. The classification of cephalosporins into ""generations"" is commonly practised, although the exact categorization is often imprecise. For example, the fourth generation of cephalosporins is not recognized as such in Japan. In Japan, cefaclor is classed as a first-generation cephalosporin, though in the United States it is a second-generation one; and cefbuperazone, cefminox, and cefotetan are classed as second-generation cephalosporins. === First generation === Cefalotin, cefazolin, cefalexin, cefapirin, cefradine, and cefadroxil are drugs belonging to this group. === Second generation === Cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefprozil, and cefmetazole are classed as second-generation cephems. === Third generation === Ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime are classed as third-generation cephalosporins. Flomoxef and latamoxef are in a new, related class called oxacephems. === Fourth generation === Drugs included in this group are cefepime and cefpirome. === Further generations === Some state that cephalosporins can be divided into five or even six generations, although the usefulness of this organization system is of limited clinical relevance. === Naming === Most first-generation cephalosporins were originally spelled ""ceph-"" in English-speaking countries. This continues to be the preferred spelling in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, while European countries (including the United Kingdom) have adopted the International Nonproprietary Names, which are always spelled ""cef-"". Newer first-generation cephalosporins and all cephalosporins of later generations are spelled ""cef-"", even in the United States. === Activity === There exist bacteria which cannot be treated with cephalosporins of generations first through fourth: Listeria spp. Atypicals (including Mycoplasma and Chlamydia) MRSA Enterococci Fifth-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftaroline) are effective against MRSA, Listeria spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. === Overview table === == History == Cephalosporin compounds were first isolated from cultures of Acremonium strictum from a sewer in Sardinia in 1948 by Italian scientist Giuseppe Brotzu. He noticed these cultures produced substances that were effective against Salmonella typhi, the cause of typhoid fever, which had β-lactamase. Guy Newton and Edward Abraham at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at the University of Oxford isolated cephalosporin C. The cephalosporin nucleus, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), was derived from cephalosporin C and proved to be analogous to the penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), but it was not sufficiently potent for clinical use. Modification of the 7-ACA side chains resulted in the development of useful antibiotic agents, and the first agent, cefalotin (cephalothin), was launched by Eli Lilly and Company in 1964. == References == == External links == Cephalosporins",Cephalosporins,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.034383063204587e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031849632505327463)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin,https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/cephalosporins.html ', [])"

Unlike glutamate, NMDA only binds to and regulates the NMDA receptor and has no effect on other glutamate receptors (such as those for AMPA and kainate). NMDA receptors are particularly important when they become overactive during, for example, withdrawal from alcohol as this causes symptoms such as agitation and, sometimes, epileptiform seizures. == Biological function == In 1962, J.C. Watkins reported synthesizing NMDA, an isomer of the previously known N-Methyl-DL-aspartic-acid. NMDA is a water-soluble D-alpha-amino acid — an aspartic acid derivative with an N-methyl substituent and D-configuration — found across Chordates from lancelets to mammals. At homeostatic levels NMDA plays an essential role as a neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine regulator. At increased but sub–toxic levels NMDA becomes neuro-protective. In excessive amounts NMDA is an excitotoxin. Behavioral neuroscience research utilizes NMDA excitotoxicity to induce lesions in specific regions of an animal subject's brain or spinal cord to study behavioral changes. The mechanism of action for the NMDA receptor is a specific agonist binding to its NR2 subunits, and then a non-specific cation channel is opened, which can allow the passage of Ca2+ and Na+ into the cell and K+ out of the cell. Therefore, NMDA receptors will only open if glutamate is in the synapse and concurrently the postsynaptic membrane is already depolarized - acting as coincidence detectors at the neuronal level. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) produced by activation of an NMDA receptor also increases the concentration of Ca2+ in the cell. The Ca2+ can in turn function as a second messenger in various signaling pathways. This process is modulated by a number of endogenous and exogenous compounds and plays a key role in a wide range of physiological (such as memory) and pathological processes (such as excitotoxicity). == Antagonists == Examples of antagonists, or more appropriately named receptor channel blockers, of the NMDA receptor are APV, amantadine, dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine, magnesium, tiletamine, phencyclidine (PCP), riluzole, memantine, methoxetamine (MXE), methoxphenidine (MXP) and kynurenic acid. While dizocilpine is generally considered to be the prototypical NMDA receptor blocker and is the most common agent used in research, animal studies have demonstrated some amount of neurotoxicity, which may or may not also occur in humans.

Some results suggest that (S)-3,5-DHPG may be a partial agonist of mGluR1a and mGluR5a in neurons and astrocytes. It has been reported that (S)-3,5-DHPG can, under certain conditions, interact with NMDA receptors. (S)-3,5-DHPG exerts different effects on second messengers in adult and neonatal tissues. It stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner in both the adult and neonate hippocampus, inhibits stimulated cAMP levels in the adult and enhances the cAMP in the neonate. It is an effective antagonist of mGluRs linked to phospholipase D (PLD) in the adult and an agonist in the neonate brain or astrocyte cultures. (S)-3,5-DHPG induces elevation of [Ca2+]i and regulates multiple subtypes of Ca2+ channels. This agonist of group I mGluRs may modulate neurotransmitters release, reflecting the diversity of mechanisms involved. Depending on the dose, (S)-3,5-DHPG enhances or decreases excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and under appropriate conditions it can induce long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). Some studies suggested a therapeutic role for (S)-3,5-DHPG in neuronal injury, regulation of intestinal motility and secretion, learning and memory processes and in cardiovascular system. (S)-3,5-DHPG may be useful as a cognitive enhancing agent in memory impairment associated with ischemia or hypoxia. Recent investigations suggested possible beneficial effects of (S)-3,5-DHPG in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the effects of (S)-3,5-DHPG, a selective agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (I mGluRs), on certain behaviors in rats after short-term hypoxia as a model of experimentally induced amnesia. The effect of (S)-3,5-DHPG administered intracerebroventriculary (icv) at doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 nmol was assessed using behavioral tests: the open field test, the passive avoidance response and the elevated ""plus"" maze test. (S)-3,5-DHPG did not change the number of crossed fields and rearings and only at a dose of 0.01 nmol it increased the number of bar approaches in the open field test. (S)-3,5-DHPG used at all doses improved consolidation, and at doses of 0.01 and 1.0 nmol it improved retrieval in the passive avoidance test. (S)-3,5-DHPG did not produce any significant effects in control rats in the elevated ""plus"" maze test. Hypoxia inhibited locomotor and exploratory activity of rats, significantly impaired consolidation and retrieval processes. We observed tendency to shortening the time spent in open arms and to decrease in the number of entries into open arms in the elevated ""plus"" maze in rats with underwent hypoxia. In hypoxia-treated groups of rats, (S)-3,5-DHPG inhibited locomotor and exploratory activity in comparison with the control groups administered (S)-3,5-DHPG. Hypoxia significantly inhibited beneficial effects of (S)-3,5-DHPG on consolidation and retrieval in passive avoidance. (S)-3,5-DHPG only at the dose of 1.0 nmol used before hypoxia improved consolidation and at the dose of 0.01 nmol enhanced retrieval in comparison with saline-treated group subjected to hypoxia. (S)-3,5-DHPG only at the dose of 1.0 nmol in hypoxia-treated group shortened the time spent in closed arms and increased the number of entries into closed and open arms in the elevated ""plus"" maze vs saline-treated group subjected to hypoxia. In rats subjected to hypoxia, (S)-3,5-DHPG, the agonist of I mGluRs, improved consolidation and retrieval and exhibited anxiolytic activity in dose-dependent manner.

These findings indicate that face-washing behavior is due to selective activation of mGlu1 receptor by (S)-3,5-DHPG, and that the face-washing behavior induced by (S)-3,5-DHPG in mice can be used for in vivo testing of the antagonistic potency of both competitive and non-competitive mGlu1 receptor antagonists.","(rs)-3,5-dhpg",PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20141461491584778)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.07930696755647659), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0012443665182217956)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -2.935296834039036e-06)])","('INFO; https://www.rndsystems.com/products/rs-35-dhpg_0342,https://hellobio.com/rs35dhpg.html,https://www.glpbio.com/rs-3-5-dhpg.html ', [])"

Here, we show that the crystal growth faces of methyl α-D-mannopyranoside (MDM), a representative pyranose sugar, also show noteworthy structural compatibility with the known periodicities of AF(G)Ps. We selected fish AFGPs (AFGP8, AFGP1-5), and a beetle AFP (DAFP1) with increasing antifreeze activity as potential additives for controlling MDM crystal growth. Similar to their effects on ice growth, the AF(G)Ps can inhibit MDM crystal growth and recrystallization, and more significantly, the effectiveness for the AF(G)Ps are well correlated with their antifreeze activity. MDM crystals grown in the presence of AF(G)Ps are smaller and have better defined shapes and are of higher quality as indicated by single crystal X-ray diffraction and polarized microscopy than control crystals, but no new polymorphs of MDM were identified by single crystal X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR, and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. The observed changes in the average sizes of the MDM crystals can be related to the changes in the number of the MDM nuclei in the presence of the AF(G)Ps. The critical free energy change differences of the MDM nucleation in the absence and presence of the additives were calculated. These values are close to those of the ice nucleation in the presence of AF(G)Ps suggesting similar interactions are involved in the molecular recognition of MDM by the AF(G)Ps. To our knowledge this is the first report where AF(G)Ps have been used to control crystal growth of carbohydrates and on AFGPs controlling non-ice-like crystals. Our finding suggests MDM might be a possible alternative to ice for studying the detailed mechanism of AF(G)P-crystal interactions. The relationships between AF(G)Ps and carbohydrate binding proteins are also discussed. The structural compatibility between AF(G)Ps and growing crystal faces demonstrated herein adds to the repertoire of molecular recognition by AF(G)Ps, which may have potential applications in the sugar, food, pharmaceutical, and materials industries. Microcapsules are made of porous membranes through which enzymes or proteins can readily permeate. Glucoamylase was encapsulated into microcapsules in the presence of concanavalin A. Microencapsulated glucoamylase was released from the microcapsules into the bulk phase in the presence of methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside, while it was not released in the absence of methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. The initiation and cessation of glucoamylase release from the microcapsules accurately corresponded to the addition and removal of methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside, respectively. Methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside served as a controller for the release of glucoamylase. While methyl α-d-glucopyranosides and α-d-galactopyranosides selectively form 4,6-O-benzylidenes when reacted with excess benzaldehyde in the presence of acid catalyst methyl α-d-mannopyranosides does not exhibit the same selectivity because of the cis-arrangement of the C2 and C3 hydroxyl groups. The selectivity for the 4,6-O-benzylidene is restored by using 2,6-dimethylbenzaldehyde instead of benzaldehyde. In addition the excess 2,6-dimethylbenzaldehyde is easily recovered from the reaction by extraction with petroleum ether and can be reused without further purification. The 2,6-dimethylbenzylidene exhibits properties similar to the unsubstituted benzylidene with regard to chemical synthesis.",Methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.1269751489162445)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3345310389995575), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014371813274919987)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1804,"('Jak3 inhibitor i', 'Janex 1', 'Ex-a2590', 'S5903', 'Phenol, 4-[(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinazolinyl)amino]-')",Medical," Accumulating evidence suggests that vascular remodeling due to immoderate proliferation and migration of SMCs is a common process occurring in APE. In this work, we tried to find a breakthrough in the pathological mechanism to alleviate the prognosis of APE by improving SMCs proliferation and explored the effect of JANEX-1 on PDGF-induced proliferation-related molecules in PVSMCs and assessed the therapeutic potential of JAK3 for vascular remodeling in APE mice. We demonstrated that JANEX-1, blocking JAK3 expression or activity, reduced JAK3/STAT3 signaling pathway, VEGF expression and FAK activation, and PDGF-induced proliferation of PVSMCs. Moreover, JANEX-1 inhibited the thrombus-induced intimal hyperplasia and the expression of VEGF and FAK activation in neointimal SMCs of APE mice. The data are helpful to elucidate the pharmacological mechanism and potential therapeutic effect of JANEX-1 in APE. Here we show that Janus kinase (JAK) 3 is an important molecular target for treatment of autoimmune insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. The rationally designed JAK3 inhibitor JANEX-1 exhibited potent immunomodulatory activity and delayed the onset of diabetes in the NOD mouse model of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Whereas 60% of vehicle-treated control NOD mice became diabetic by 25 weeks, the incidence of diabetes at 25 weeks was only 9% for NOD females treated with daily injections of JANEX-1 (100 mg/kg/day) from Week 10 through Week 25 (P = 0.007). Furthermore, JANEX-1 prevented the development of insulitis and diabetes in NOD-scid/scid females after adoptive transfer of splenocytes from diabetic NOD females. Chemical inhibitors such as JANEX-1 may provide the basis for effective treatment modalities against human type 1 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the immunosuppressive activity of a JAK3 inhibitor in the context of an autoimmune disease. JANEX-1/WHI-P131, a selective Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitor, has been shown to delay the onset of diabetes in the NOD mouse model. However, the molecular mechanism by which JANEX-1 protects pancreatic beta-cells is unknown. In the current study, we investigated the role of JANEX-1 on interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced beta-cell damage using isolated islets. JANEX-1-pretreated islets showed resistance to cytokine toxicity, namely suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production, reduced inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS) expression, and decreased islet destruction. The molecular mechanism by which JANEX-1 inhibits iNOS expression was mediated through suppression of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Islets treated with the cytokines downregulated the protein levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3, but pretreatment with JANEX-1 attenuated these decreases. Additionally, islets from JAK3(-/-) mice were more resistant to cytokine toxicity than islets from control mice. These results demonstrate that JANEX-1 protects beta-cells from cytokine toxicity through suppression of the NF-kappaB and JAK/STAT pathways and upregulation of SOCS proteins, suggesting that JANEX-1 may be used to preserve functional beta-cell mass.",Janex 1,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4855663721391466e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0032808545511215925), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018174076452851295)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.invivochem.com/janex-1.html,https://www.glpbio.com/janex-1.html,https://www.yeasen.com/products/detail/2442,https://www.selleck.co.jp/products/janex-1.html,https://www.targetmol.com/compound/janex-1 ', [])"

1806,"('Levetiracetam', 'Keppra', '(s)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)butanamide', 'Keppra xr', '(2s)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)butanamide')",Medical,"Levetiracetam, sold under the brand name Keppra among others, is a novel antiepileptic drug (medication) used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial-onset, myoclonic, or tonic–clonic seizures, and is taken either by mouth as an immediate or extended release formulation or by injection into a vein. Levetiracetam was discovered in 1992 through screening in audiogenic seizure susceptible mice and, 3 years later, was reported to exhibit saturable, stereospecific binding in brain to a approximately 90 kDa protein, later identified as the ubiquitous synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV2A."" The discovery process identifying levetiracetam's antiepileptic potential was unique because it challenged several dogmas of antiepileptic drug discovery, and thereby encountered skepticism from the epilepsy community. Common side effects of levetiracetam include sleepiness, dizziness, feeling tired, and aggression. Severe side effects may include psychosis, suicide, and allergic reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome or anaphylaxis. Levetiracetam is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. It acts as a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) ligand. Levetiracetam was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999 and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 123rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Focal epilepsy === Levetiracetam is effective as single-drug treatment for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy in adults. It reduces focal seizures by 50% or more as an add-on medication. === Partial-complex epilepsy === Levetiracetam is effective as add-on treatment for partial (focal) epilepsy. === Generalized epilepsy === Levetiracetam is effective for treatment of generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy. It has been approved in the United States as add-on treatment for myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. Levetiracetam has been approved in the European Union as a monotherapy treatment for epilepsy in the case of partial seizures or as an adjunctive therapy for partial, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. Levetiracetam is sometimes used off label to treat status epilepticus. === Prevention of seizures === Based on low-quality evidence, levetiracetam is about as effective as phenytoin for prevention of early seizures after traumatic brain injury. It may be effective for prevention of seizures associated with subarachnoid hemorrhages. === Other === Levetiracetam has not been found to be useful for treatment of neuropathic pain, nor for treatment of essential tremors. Levetiracetam has not been found to be useful for treating all developmental disorders within the autism spectrum; studies have only proven to be an effective treatment for partial, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures associated with autism spectrum disorder. === Special groups === Levetiracetam's efficacy and tolerability in individuals with intellectual disability is comparable to those without. Studies in female pregnant rats have shown minor fetal skeletal abnormalities when given maximum recommended human doses of levetiracetam orally throughout pregnancy and lactation. Studies were conducted to look for increased adverse effects in the elderly population as compared to younger patients. One such study published in Epilepsy Research showed no significant increase in incidence of adverse symptoms experienced by young or elderly patients with disorders of the central nervous system. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects of levetiracetam treatment include effects on the central nervous system such as somnolence, decreased energy, headache, dizziness, mood swings and coordination difficulties. These adverse effects are most pronounced in the first month of therapy. About 4% of patients dropped out of pre-approval clinical trials due to these side effects. About 13% of people taking levetiracetam experience adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are usually mild. These include agitation, hostility, apathy, anxiety, emotional lability, and depression. Serious psychiatric adverse side effects that are reversed by drug discontinuation occur in about 1%. These include hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, or psychosis. These occur mostly within the first month of therapy, but can rarely develop at any time during treatment. Although rare, Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which appears as a painful spreading rash with redness and blistering and/or peeling skin, have been reported in patients treated with levetiracetam. The incidence of SJS following exposure to anti-epileptics such as levetiracetam is about 1 in 3,000. Levetiracetam should not be used in people who have previously shown hypersensitivity to levetiracetam or any of the inactive ingredients in the tablet or oral solution. Such hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited to, unexplained rash with redness or blistered skin, difficulty breathing, and tightness in the chest or airways. In a study, the incidence of decreased bone mineral density of patients on levetiracetam was significantly higher than for those on different epileptic medications. === Suicide === Levetiracetam, along with other anti-epileptic drugs, can increase the risk of suicidal behavior or thoughts. Patients taking levetiracetam should be monitored closely for signs of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or tendencies, or any altered emotional or behavioral states. === Kidney and liver === Kidney impairment decreases the rate of elimination of levetiracetam from the body. Individuals with reduced kidney function may require dose adjustments, guided by monitoring of kidney function. Dose adjustment of levetiracetam is not necessary in liver impairment. === Drug interactions === No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between levetiracetam or its major metabolite and concomitant medications. The pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam is not influenced by phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, digoxin, ethinylestradiol, or warfarin. == Mechanism of action == The exact mechanism by which levetiracetam acts to treat epilepsy is unknown. Levetiracetam does not exhibit pharmacologic actions similar to that of classical anticonvulsants. It does not inhibit voltage-dependent Na+ channels, does not affect GABAergic transmission, and does not bind to GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors. However, the drug binds to SV2A, a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein, and inhibits presynaptic calcium channels, reducing neurotransmitter release and acting as a neuromodulator. This is believed to impede impulse conduction across synapses. As of 2024, this is widely accepted to be its mechanism of action. However, the molecular basis of this action remains unknown. == Pharmacokinetics == The FDA provided a detailed review of the pharmacology and biopharmaceutics of Levetiracetam in 2013. === Absorption === The absorption of levetiracetam tablets and oral solution is rapid and essentially complete. The bioavailability of levetiracetam is close to 100 percent, and the effect of food on absorption is minor. === Distribution === The volume of distribution of levetiracetam is similar to total body water. Levetiracetam modestly binds to plasma proteins (less than 10%). === Metabolism === Levetiracetam does not undergo extensive metabolism, and the metabolites formed are not active and do not exert pharmacological activity. Metabolism of levetiracetam is not by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, but through other metabolic pathways such as hydrolysis and hydroxylation. === Excretion === In persons with normal kidney function, levetiracetam is eliminated from the body primarily by the kidneys with about 66 percent of the original drug passed unchanged into urine. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam in adults is about 6 to 8 hours, although the mean CSF half life of approx. 24 hours better reflects levels at site of action. === Analogues === Brivaracetam, a chemical analogue to levetiracetam, is a racetam derivative with similar properties. == Society and culture == Levetiracetam is available as regular and extended release oral formulations and as intravenous formulations. The immediate release tablet has been available as a generic in the United States since 2008, and in the UK since 2011. The patent for the extended release tablet will expire in 2028. The branded version Keppra is manufactured by UCB Pharmaceuticals S.A. In 2015, Aprecia's orally disintegrating tablet form of the drug manufactured using pharmaceutical 3D printing techniques was approved by the FDA, under the trade name Spritam. Some have said that the drug has been improved by 3D printing, as the formula used now has improved disintegration properties. === Legal status === ==== Australia ==== Levetiracetam is a Schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A Schedule 4 substance is classified as ""Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription."" ==== Japan ==== Under Japanese law, levetiracetam and other racetams cannot be brought into the country except for personal use by a traveler for whom it has been prescribed. Travelers who plan to bring more than a month's worth must apply for an import certificate, known as a Yakkan Shoumei (薬監証明, yakkan shōmei). == Research == Levetiracetam has been studied in the past for treating symptoms of neurobiological conditions such as Tourette syndrome, and anxiety disorder. However, its most serious adverse effects are behavioral, and its benefit-risk ratio in these conditions is not well understood. Levetiracetam is being tested as a drug to reduce hyperactivity in the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, Levetiracetam has been experimentally shown to reduce Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, a type of movement disorder, or dyskinesia associated with the use of Levodopa, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. Of the ten medications evaluated in a 2023 systematic review of the literature, levetiracetam was found to be the only medication with sufficient evidence showing that it may cause seizure freedom in some infants. Further, adverse effects from levetiracetam were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group. Because available research included only 2 published studies reporting seizure freedom rates, however, the strength of the evidence was judged to be low. == References ==",Keppra xr,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.0146166207268834e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044228785554878414)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/keppra-xr.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Keppra-XR: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/keppra-xr.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1807,"('Letrozole', 'Femara', 'Letrozol', 'Femera', ""Benzonitrile, 4,4'-(1h-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethylene)bis-"")",Medical,"Letrozole, sold under the brand name Femara among others, is an aromatase inhibitor medication that is used in the treatment of breast cancer for post-menopausal women. It was patented in 1986 and approved for medical use in 1996. In 2021, it was the 222nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Breast cancer === Letrozole is indicated for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer; extended adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have received prior standard adjuvant tamoxifen therapy; first and second-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive or unknown advanced breast cancer. Letrozole is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of local or metastatic breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive or has an unknown receptor status in postmenopausal women. ==== Comparison with tamoxifen ==== Tamoxifen is also used to treat hormonally-responsive breast cancer, but it does so by interfering with the estrogen receptor. However, letrozole is effective only in post-menopausal women, in whom estrogen is produced predominantly in peripheral tissues (i.e. in adipose tissue, like that of the breast) and a number of sites in the brain. In pre-menopausal women, the main source of estrogen is from the ovaries not the peripheral tissues, and letrozole is ineffective. In the BIG 1–98 Study, of post-menopausal women with hormonally-responsive breast cancer, letrozole reduced the recurrence of cancer, but did not change survival rate, compared to tamoxifen. === Ovulation induction === Letrozole has been used for ovulation induction by fertility doctors since 2001, because it has fewer side-effects than clomiphene (Clomid) and less chance of multiple gestation. A study of 150 babies following treatment with either letrozole alone or letrozole and gonadotropins presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine 2005 Conference found no difference in overall abnormalities but did find a significantly higher rate of locomotor and cardiac abnormalities among the group having taken letrozole compared to natural conception. A larger, follow-up study with 911 babies compared those born following treatment with letrozole to those born following treatment with clomiphene. That study also found no significant difference in the rate of overall abnormalities, but found that congenital cardiac anomalies was significantly higher in the clomiphene group compared to the letrozole group. India banned the usage of letrozole in 2011, citing potential risks to infants while in 2012, an Indian parliamentary committee said that their office of the drug controller had colluded with letrozole's makers to approve the drug for infertility in India. The committee also stated that letrozole's use for infertility was illegal worldwide, while off-label uses are legal in many countries such as the US and UK. === Medical Abortion === Tests have shown that the efficacy of first-trimester medical abortions (using misoprostol) can be improved by including letrozole in the drug regimen. === Use in sports === Letrozole is considered a performance enhancing drug by the World Antidoping Agency (WADA), as are other aromatase inhibitors, because it may be used to counteract the side effects of anabolic steroids. Letrozole itself is not evidenced as being a performance enhancer. == Contraindications == Letrozole is contraindicated in women having a pre-menopausal hormonal status. Precautions are advised against becoming pregnant while using letrozole; on the loss of bone mineral density; on the increased level of cholesterol and fat in the blood; and on dizziness and against driving. Breast feeding (lactation) is also counterindicated. == Side effects == The most common side effects are sweating, hot flushes, arthralgia (joint pain), and fatigue. Generally, side effects include signs and symptoms of hypoestrogenism. There is concern that long term use may lead to osteoporosis, which is why in certain patient populations such as post-menopausal women or osteoporotics, bisphosphonates may also be prescribed. == Interactions == Letrozole inhibits the liver enzyme CYP2A6, and to a lesser extent CYP2C19, in vitro, but no relevant interactions with drugs like cimetidine and warfarin have been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Letrozole is an orally active, nonsteroidal, selective aromatase inhibitor and hence an antiestrogen. It prevents aromatase from producing estrogens by competitive, reversible binding to the heme of its cytochrome P450 unit. The action is specific, and letrozole does not reduce production of corticosteroids. == Research == The antiestrogen action of letrozole has been shown to be useful in pretreatment for termination of pregnancy, in combination with misoprostol. It can be used in place of mifepristone, which is expensive and unavailable in many countries. Letrozole is sometimes used as a treatment for gynecomastia, although it is probably most effective at this if caught in an early stage (such as in users of anabolic steroids). Some studies have shown that letrozole can be used to promote spermatogenesis in male patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Letrozole has also been shown to delay the fusing of the growth plates in mice. When used in combination with growth hormone, letrozole has been shown effective in one adolescent boy with a short stature. Letrozole has also been used to treat endometriosis. Endometrial stromal sarcomas are hormonally sensitive tumors as it is represented that letrozole reduces serum estrogen levels. Letrozole is well-tolerated and is a good option for long-term management of this disease. Also in a study on Uterine myoma the volume was successfully reduced by use of an aromatase inhibitor. Rapid onset of action and avoidance of initial gonadotropin flare with an aromatase inhibitor. Letrozole has been documented to be safe and effective for improving height and pubertal outcomes in children living with constitutional delay in growth and puberty, and is better than testosterone with regard to improvement in testicular volume and delaying bone-age progression. This was documented in a meta-analysis published by Dutta et al. which analyzed data from 7 different randomized controlled trials. == References ==",Femara,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.794906312279636e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007138088112697005)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/letrozole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='Letrozole - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/letrozole?utm_source=openai')])"
1808,"('Mycophenolic acid', 'Mycophenolate', 'Melbex', 'Myfortic', 'Mycophenolsaeure')",Medical,"Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant medication used to prevent rejection following organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease and lupus. Specifically it is used following kidney, heart, and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil. Common side effects include nausea, infections, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine. Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 227th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Organ transplant === Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and kidney transplantation rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in liver, heart, or lung transplants in children older than two years. === Autoimmune disease === Mycophenolate is increasingly utilized as a steroid sparing treatment in autoimmune diseases and similar immune-mediated disorders including Behçet's disease, pemphigus vulgaris, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, small vessel vasculitides, and psoriasis. It is also used for retroperitoneal fibrosis along with a number of other medications. Specifically it has also been used for psoriasis not treatable by other methods. Its increasing application in treating lupus nephritis has demonstrated more frequent complete response and less frequent complications compared to cyclophosphamide bolus therapy, a regimen with risk of bone marrow suppression, infertility, and malignancy. Further work addressing maintenance therapy demonstrated mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide, again in terms of response and side-effects. Walsh proposed that mycophenolate should be considered as a first-line induction therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis in people without kidney dysfunction. === Comparison to other agents === Compared with azathioprine it has higher incidence of diarrhea, and no difference in risk of any of the other side effects in transplant patients. Mycophenolic acid is 15 times more expensive than azathioprine. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥ 1% of people) include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, leukopenia, or anemia reflect the immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with thrombophlebitis and thrombosis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and/or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. More rarely, pulmonary fibrosis or various neoplasia occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site. Several cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have also been reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that people are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 people that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal. === Pregnancy === Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to get pregnant. === Blood tests === Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can occur. == Mechanism of action == Purines (including the nucleosides guanosine and adenosine) can either be synthesized de novo using ribose 5-phosphate or they can be salvaged from free nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid is a potent, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme essential to the de novo synthesis of guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) from inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMPDH inhibition particularly affects lymphocytes since they rely almost exclusively on de novo purine synthesis. In contrast, many other cell types use both pathways, and some cells, such as terminally differentiated neurons, depend completely on purine nucleotide salvage. Thus, use of mycophenolic acid leads to a relatively selective inhibition of DNA replication in T cells and B cells. == Pharmacology == Mycophenolate can be derived from the fungi Penicillium stoloniferum, P. brevicompactum and P. echinulatum. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety mycophenolic acid. It reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect. Mycophenolate is potent and can, in many contexts, be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of a three-compound regimen of immunosuppressants, also including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone). == Chemistry == Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholino‌ ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the carboxyl group. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a pKa values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group. == History == Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (The species is now called P. brevicompactum.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he isolated crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and given the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis). Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist Anthony Allison and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge of drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became vice president for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was sold under the brand name Cellcept. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 1996. == Names == It was initially introduced as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, brand name Cellcept) to improve oral bioavailability. The salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an alternative MPA formulation. MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety. == Research == Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with success for some patients. It is also being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine. A combination of mycophenolate and ribavirin has been found to stop infection by and replication of dengue virus in vitro. It has also shown promising antiviral activity against MERS, especially in combination with interferon. Preliminary data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‐on therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. == References ==",Myfortic,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.4834770708112046e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004113190341740847)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/myfortic.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=9, title='Myfortic: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/myfortic.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1810,"('Etretinate', 'Ro 10-9359', 'Tegison', 'Retinoid', 'Ethyl etrinoate')",Medical,"The retinoids are a class of chemical compounds that are natural derivatives of vitamin A or are chemically related to it. Synthetic retinoids are utilized in cosmetic formulations, clinical dermatology, and the treatment of some forms of cancer. Retinoids have many important functions throughout the body, including in vision, regulation of skin proliferation and differentiation, growth of bone tissue, immune function, and male fertility. The biology of retinoids is complex, having well-documented effectiveness in the management of conditions ranging from acute promyelocytic leukemia to acne to photoaging. On the other hand, retinoids may be involved in metabolic dysfunction and, at least in some forms, carcinogenesis. == Types == Retinoids are divided into four generations based on their molecular structure and receptor selectivity. == Structure == The basic structure of the hydrophobic retinoid molecule consists of a cyclic end group, a polyene side chain and a polar end group. The conjugated system formed by alternating C=C double bonds in the polyene side chain are responsible for the color of retinoids (typically yellow, orange, or red). Hence, many retinoids are chromophores. Alternation of side chains and end groups creates the various classes of retinoids. First generation retinoids are produced naturally in the body and interact with their normal biological counterparts, such as retinol binding protein 4 for retinol, retinoid receptors for all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-retinoic acid. 13-cis retinoic acid has an unknown biological pathway but appears to act as a growth factor. Second generation retinoids have a mixed effect and interact mainly with signaling in the skin. Third generation retinoids have narrow biological roles due to their constrained structure, with adapalene mimicking the effects of isotretinoin, bexarotene binding only the Retinoid X receptors, and tazarotene binding the Retinoic acid receptor beta and Retinoic acid receptor gamma forms. The only fourth generation retinoid, Trifarotene, binds selectively to the RAR-y receptor. It was approved for use in the US in 2019. == Pharmacokinetics == The major source of retinoids in human diet are plant pigments such as carotenes and retinyl esters derived from animal sources. Retinyl esters are transported through the chylomicron pathway to the liver or fat tissue while retinol or carotenes are transported from the enterocytes to the liver and are processed into retinyl esters by LRAT for storage. Most synthetic retinoids are absorbed when taken orally while topical retinoids cannot diffuse through the skin barrier unless it is compromised. All classes of retinoid bind to many proteins. Natural retinoids such as retinol and retinyl esters bind to carrier proteins such as RBP4, chylomicrons and VLDL while synthetic retinoids likely bind to these and other proteins. First generation retinoids are rapidly metabolized by Cytochrome p450 enzymes, typically of the Cyp26 family. Later generation retinoids are resistant to Cyp26 metabolism and remain in the body for much longer. == Uses == Common skin conditions treated by topical retinoids include acne, psoriasis, and effects of photoaging. In addition, retinoids are used to treat some rare skin disorders, including discoid lupus and mycosis fungoides. In Japan, isotretinoin may be used for neuroblastoma treatment, but it is not approved in other countries due to a lack of consistency in studies of its effectiveness. Oral retinoids are readily toxic, requiring consistent clinical oversight, and are approved in several diseases for which said toxicity is paradoxically useful, including acute promyelocytic leukemia, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and heterotopic ossification. == Toxicity == Toxic effects of retinoids occur with both acute or prolonged intake, depending on which retinoid is considered. The specific toxicity is related to the mechanism of action as well as exposure. A medical sign of chronic or acute poisoning with retinol is hypervitaminosis A, which includes the presence of painful tender swellings on the long bones. Anorexia, skin lesions, hair loss, hepatosplenomegaly, papilloedema, bleeding, general malaise, pseudotumor cerebri, and death may also occur. Similar effects occur with other retinoids, except for 13-cis retinoic acid and its derivatives, such as adapalene. Retinoids provoke rapid elevation of circulating triglycerides leading to hypertriglyceridemia as well as cholesterol, leading to hypercholesterolemia. Retinoids are further shown to worsen many metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. Large-scale randomized, controlled clinical trials have conclusively shown that vitamin A, retinol and other retinoids increase mortality and cancer rates. In addition to the harmful effects shared by other retinoids, bexarotene causes severe hypothyroidism. The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), based on its review, confirmed that taking oral retinoids during pregnancy can have harmful effects on the baby as they may cause CNS, cranio-facial, cardiovascular and other defects. The use of acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin should be prohibited in women of childbearing age unless they take measures to prevent pregnancy. The use of topical retinoids should also be excluded during pregnancy and in women planning pregnancy. Many lotions that claim to prevent or treat stretch marks contain retinol, which is not an ingredient that is safe for pregnant women. The Association of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends that pregnant women consult a health care provider before trying any lotions or oils for stretch mark prevention. == See also == Hypervitaminosis A == References == == External links == Retinoids at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Retinoid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.03509675711393356), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.11893235146999359), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -2.816093228830141e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.6931790709495544), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.06202549487352371), (' FOOD', -1.0280383548888494e-06)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.05418446660041809), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -4.053033626405522e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.2434167116880417), ('OG', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.0015076948329806328), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6947643756866455), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -5.900685573578812e-05), (',', -0.04859459772706032), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0015654225135222077), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019415830029174685)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.050945982336997986), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' PERSONAL', -2.935296834039036e-06), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoid ', [])"
1811,"('Edonerpic maleate', 'Edonerpic', 'Edonerpic-maleate', 'Edonerpic [inn]', 'Edonerpic [who-dd]')",Medical," Dysfunction of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) is a key molecular mechanism of excitotoxic neuronal injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Edonerpic maleate is a low molecular-weight compound that was screened as a candidate neuroprotective agent. In this study, we investigated its effects on TBI and GluRs signaling. Traumatic neuronal injury (TNI) induced by scratch followed by glutamate treatment was performed to mimic TBI in vitro. Edonerpic maleate at 1 and 10 μM exerted protective activity when it was added within 2 h following injury. The protective activities were also confirmed by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. In addition, edonerpic maleate inhibited the expression of surface NR2B, total GluR1, and surface GluR1, and mitigated the intracellular Ca We have previously reported that the microtubule-associated collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is necessary for the expression of chronic pain. CRMP2 achieves this control of nociceptive signaling by virtue of its ability to regulate voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels. To date, however, no drugs exist that target CRMP2. Recently, the small molecule edonerpic maleate (1 -{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl)ethoxy]propyl}azetidin-3-ol maleate), a candidate therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease was reported to be a novel CRMP2 binding compound with the potential to decrease its phosphorylation level in cortical tissues in vivo. Here we sought to determine the mechanism of action of edonerpic maleate and test its possible effect in a rodent model of chronic pain. We observed: (i) no binding between human CRMP2 and edonerpic maleate; (ii) edonerpic maleate had no effect on CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons; (iii) edonerpic maleate-decreased calcium but increased sodium current density in DRG neurons; and (iv) edonerpic maleate was ineffective in reversing post-surgical allodynia in male and female mice. Thus, while CRMP2 inhibiting compounds remain a viable strategy for developing new mechanism-based pain inhibitors, edonerpic maleate is an unlikely candidate. Brain damage such as stroke is a devastating neurological condition that may severely compromise patient quality of life. No effective medication-mediated intervention to accelerate rehabilitation has been established. We found that a small compound, edonerpic maleate, facilitated experience-driven synaptic glutamate AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic-acid) receptor delivery and resulted in the acceleration of motor function recovery after motor cortex cryoinjury in mice in a training-dependent manner through cortical reorganization. Edonerpic bound to collapsin-response-mediator-protein 2 (CRMP2) and failed to augment recovery in CRMP2-deficient mice. Edonerpic maleate enhanced motor function recovery from internal capsule hemorrhage in nonhuman primates. Thus, edonerpic maleate, a neural plasticity enhancer, could be a clinically potent small compound with which to accelerate rehabilitation after brain damage.",Edonerpic maleate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02324594371020794), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0016146968118846416), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008636976592242718)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([alzforum.org](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/edonerpic?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=6, title='Edonerpic | ALZFORUM', type='url_citation', url='https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/edonerpic?utm_source=openai')])"

A simple protein precipitation method using acetonitrile was used for the sample preparation and the pre-treated samples were separated by a reverse-phase C18 column. The calibration curve was evaluated in the range of 3.02 ~ 2200 ng/mL and the quadratic regression (weighted 1/concentration) was used for the best fit of the curve with a correlation coefficient ≥0.997. The in vivo PK studies in rats showed that vipadenant bioavailability was 30.4 ± 8.9% with a low to moderate drug clearance. In addition, in vitro/in vivo metabolite profiles in rat were also explored. Five different metabolites were observed in our experimental conditions and the major metabolites were different between in vitro and in vivo conditions. As far as we know, there has been no report on the development of quantitative methods for its PK samples nor the identification of its metabolites since vipadenant was developed. Therefore, this paper would be very useful to better understand the pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism properties of vipadenant in rat as well as other species. Adenosine A2A receptor antagonists are potential new treatments for Parkinson disease. We used positron emission tomography (PET) of the A2A receptor radiotracer, [C]SCH442416, to assess binding of the novel A2A antagonist, vipadenant (previously known as BIIB014), to human brain A2A receptors and to investigate the relationship among dose, steady-state plasma levels, and receptor occupancy. We used PET to compare [C]SCH442416 uptake before and after blockade with daily oral vipadenant (2.5-100 mg/d for 10 or 11 days) in healthy volunteers (n = 15). We estimated receptor occupancy in brain regions of interest, particularly the putamen, by kinetic modeling of PET data. We estimated the dose, minimal plasma concentration at steady state (Cmin), and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC0-tau) at the steady state required for saturation (> or =90% receptor occupancy) using Bayesian Emax and logistic regression models. The estimated receptor occupancy of vipadenant in the brain regions of interest varied from 74% to 94% at the lowest daily dose (2.5 mg) and reached saturation in all regions at 100 mg. In the putamen, the estimated minimal daily dose, steady-state Cmin, and steady-state AUC0-tau required for receptor saturation were 10.2 mg (interquartile range, 28%), 0.097 microg/mL (27%), and 6 microg h/mL (21%), respectively. This study provides the first evidence that vipadenant occupies A2A receptors in the human brain. Receptor occupancy was related to both dose and plasma levels of vipadenant.

The present study examined the opioid receptors involved in the antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2 ((R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[4-morpholinylmethyl]-pyrrolo-[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthyl) methanone mesylate), a high-affinity cannabinoid receptor agonist, in mice. WIN 55212-2, at doses of 0.3-3 mg/kg ip, produced a dose-dependent antitussive effect. This antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2 was antagonized by pretreatment with either methysergide (3 mg/kg ip), a 5-HT receptor antagonist, or naloxone (1 mg/kg ip), an opioid receptor antagonist. Furthermore, pretreatment with N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (SR141716A, 3 mg/kg ip), a cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist, also significantly reduced the antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2. Blockade of mu-opioid receptors by pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (40 mg/kg sc) significantly reduced the antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2. However, pretreatment with nor-binaltorphimine (20 mg/kg sc), a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, did not affect the antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2. Pretreatment with naloxonazine (35 mg/kg sc), a mu(1)-opioid receptor antagonist, also did not affect the antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2. These results indicate that the antitussive effect of WIN 55212-2 is mediated by the activation of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors and mu(2) (naloxonazine-insensitive)-opioid receptors, but not mu(1) (naloxonazine-sensitive)- or kappa-opioid receptors. We examined the effects of a cannabinoid receptor agonist, (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-merpholino)methyl]pyrrolo-[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthyl)methanone (WIN 55212-2), on various respiratory reactions induced by the activation of capsaicin-sensitive afferent sensory nerves (C-fibers). WIN 55212-2 significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced guinea pig bronchoconstriction, but not the neurokinin A-induced reaction. Intravenous injection of WIN 55212-2 also blocked cigarette smoke-induced rat tracheal plasma extravasation. However, substance P-induced rat tracheal plasma extravasation was not affected by the administration of WIN 55212-2. A cannabinoid CB(2) receptor antagonist, {N-[(1S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1] heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)pyrazole-3-carboxamide} (SR 144528) reduced the inhibitory effects of WIN 55212-2, but not a cannabinoid CB(1) antagonist, [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamidehydrochloride] (SR 141716A). A Maxi-K(+) channel opener, 1-(2'-hydroxy-5'-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-trifluoromethyl-2(3H)benzimidazolone (NS 1619), specifically inhibited capsaicin-induced guinea pig bronchoconstriction and cigarette smoke-induced rat tracheal plasma extravasation. These findings suggest that WIN 55212-2 inhibits the activation of C-fibers via cannabinoid CB(2) receptors and Maxi-K(+) channels and reduces airway neurogenic inflammatory reactions in vivo. Brain slices from 7-d-old Wistar rats were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 30 min. OGD slices were incubated with vehicle or with the CB1/CB2 cannabinoid agonist WIN55212 (50 microM), the CB1 agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA) (50 microM), or the CB2 agonist JW133 (50 microM), alone or combined with the CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonist SR 141716 (50 microM) or SR 144528 (50 microM), respectively. Neuronal damage was assessed by histologic analysis and spectrophotometric determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux into the incubation medium. Additionally, medium glutamate levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and those of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and CB1/CB2 receptor expression were determined in slices homogenate by Western blot. Both CB1 and CB2 receptors were expressed in slices. OGD increased CB1 expression, cellular damage, LDH efflux, glutamate and TNF-alpha release, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; WIN55212 inhibited all these actions. SR141716 and SR144528 inhibited the effect of R(+)-WIN-55212-2 (WIN), as well as the reduction of LDH efflux by ACEA and JW133, respectively.

Readily available in most countries, it is no longer sold in Switzerland, Brazil, France, Iran, Germany, Denmark, or the United States, due to its mercury content. == Uses == Merbromin's best-known use is as a topical antiseptic to treat minor wounds, burns, and scratches. It is also used in the antisepsis of the umbilical cord, and the antisepsis of wounds with inhibited scar formation, such as neuropathic ulcers and diabetic foot sores. When applied on a wound, it stains the skin a distinctive carmine red, which can persist through repeated washings. Due to its persistence and to its lethality to bacteria, Merbromin is useful on infections of the fingernail or toenail. In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reclassified merbromin from ""generally recognized as safe"" to ""untested,"" due to a lack of recent studies or updated supporting information. Consequently, its use in the United States has been superseded by other agents (e.g., povidone iodine, benzalkonium chloride, chloroxylenol). == Synthesis == Merbromin is synthesized by combining dibromofluorescein with mercuric acetate and sodium hydroxide or, alternatively, through action of the mercuric acetate upon (or combining with) sodium dibromofluorescein. Because of its anionic character, it is chemically incompatible with acids, the majority of alkaloid salts and most local anesthetics. == Mercurochrome == Merbromin is sold under the trade name Mercurochrome (in which the suffix ""-chrome"" denotes ""color""). The name is also commonly used for over-the-counter antiseptic solutions consisting of merbromin (typically at 2% concentration) dissolved in either ethyl alcohol (tincture) or water (aqueous). Its antiseptic qualities were discovered in 1918 by Hugh H. Young, a physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The chemical soon became popular among parents and physicians for everyday antiseptic uses, in part because the dye component made it easy to see where the antiseptic had been applied. On 19 October 1998, citing potential for mercury poisoning, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reclassified merbromin from ""generally recognized as safe"" to ""untested,"" effectively halting its distribution within the United States. Sales were subsequently halted in Brazil (2001), Germany (2003), and France (2006). It remains readily available in most other countries. Within the United States, products such as Humco Mercuroclear (""Aqueous solution of benzalkonium chloride and lidocaine hydrochloride"") play on the brand recognition history of Mercurochrome but substitute other ingredients with similar properties.

Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with escalating doses of CUDC-427 orally on a daily 14-day on/7-day off schedule in 21-day cycles using a modified continuous reassessment method design. Blood samples were assayed to determine the pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacodynamic alterations of cellular IAP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. Forty-two patients received 119 cycles of CUDC-427. Overall, the most common treatment-related toxicities were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and rash. One DLT (grade 3 fatigue) occurred in a patient at 450 mg dose level during cycle 1, and 5 patients experienced AEs related to CUDC-427 that led to discontinuation and included grade 3 pruritus, and fatigue, and grade 2 drug hypersensitivity, pneumonitis, rash, and QT prolongation. The maximum planned dose of 600 mg orally daily for 2 weeks was reached, which allometrically scaled to exceed the IC90 in preclinical xenograft studies. Significant decreases in cIAP-1 levels in PBMCs were observed in all patients 6 hours after initial dosing. Responses included durable complete responses in one patient with ovarian cancer and one patient with MALT lymphoma. CUDC-427 can be administered safely at doses up to 600 mg daily for 14 days every 3 weeks.

1824,"('Guaifenesin', 'Guaiacol glyceryl ether', 'Guaiphenesin', 'Glycerol guaiacolate', 'Guaiphenesine')",Medical,"Guaifenesin, also known as glyceryl guaiacolate, is an expectorant medication taken by mouth and marketed as an aid to eliminate sputum from the respiratory tract. Chemically, it is an ether of guaiacol and glycerine. It may be used in combination with other medications. A 2014 study found that guaifenesin does not affect sputum volume in upper respiratory infections (the upper respiratory system includes most breathing parts above the lungs). Side effects may include dizziness, sleepiness, skin rash, and nausea. While it has not been properly studied in pregnancy, it appears to be safe. It has been alleged to work in 2023 by making airway secretions more liquid, even as it has been demonstrated not to work. Guaifenesin has been used medically since at least 1933. It is available as a generic medication and over-the-counter (OTC). In 2022, it was the 295th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. In 2022, the combination dextromethorphan/guaifenesin was the 290th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Guaifenesin is used to try to help with coughing up thick mucus. It is sometimes combined with the antitussive (cough suppressant) dextromethorphan, such as in Mucinex DM or Robitussin DM. It is also combined with ephedrine in Primatene and Bronkaid tablets for symptomatic relief of asthma. Guaifenesin is combined with phenylephrine and paracetamol in certain Lemsip formulations. A Cochrane review identified three clinical trials assessing guaifenesin for the treatment of acute cough, with one finding significant benefit and the other two trials finding that it was not effective. == Side effects == Although generally well-tolerated, side effects of guaifenesin may include an allergic reaction (rare), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or headache. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Guaifenesin might act as an expectorant by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi via stimulation of the gastric mucosa. This stimulation leads to an increased parasympathetic activity in the respiratory tract via the so-called gastro-pulmonary reflex, although some in vitro studies suggested that it might also act directly on the respiratory epithelium. This increase in volume and reduction in viscosity aids in the flow of respiratory tract secretions, allowing ciliary movement to carry the loosened secretions upward toward the pharynx. Thus, guaifenesin may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate the removal of the secretions. Additionally, guaifenesin has a demonstrated central antitussive effect. == History == Similar medicines derived from the guaiac tree were used as a generic remedy by American indigenous peoples when explorers reached North America in the 16th century. The Spanish encountered guaiacum wood ""when they conquered Santo Domingo; it was soon brought back to Europe, where it acquired an immense reputation in the sixteenth century as a cure for syphilis and certain other diseases..."" The 1955 edition of the Textbook of Pharmacognosy states: ""Guaiacum has a local stimulant action which is sometimes useful in sore throat. The resin is used in chronic gout and rheumatism, whilst the wood is an ingredient in the compound concentrated solution of sarsaparilla, which was formerly much used as an alternative in syphilis."" In the US, guaifenesin was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1952. Although previously deemed ""Generally Regarded as Safe"" in its original approval, the drug received a New Drug Application for the extended-release version, which received approval on 12 July 2002. Because of this, the FDA then issued letters to other manufacturers of timed-release guaifenesin to stop marketing their unapproved versions, leaving Adams Respiratory Therapeutics in control of the market. In 2007, Adams was acquired by Reckitt Benckiser. The drug is now sold over-the-counter by many companies, alone and in combination. == Veterinary use == Guaifenesin's neurological properties first became known in the late 1940s. Guaifenesin is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used routinely in large-animal veterinary surgery. Guaifenesin is used in combination with, for example, ketamine, since guaifenesin does not provide analgesia or produce unconsciousness. In horses, the drug's biological half-life is 77 minutes. Premedication with xylazine (1.1 mg/kg) can reduce the dose required from 163 mg/kg (in geldings) to just 88 mg/kg. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Guaifenesin is taken by mouth, and is supplied as a tablet, a capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, dissolving granules, and a syrup. It is available under many brand names, as either the sole active ingredient or part of a combination drug. Drugs combined with guaifenesin in over-the-counter preparations include the cough-suppressant dextromethorphan, analgesics such as paracetamol/acetaminophen, and decongestants such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylephrine. === Economics === In 2014, sales of guaifenesin were estimated to be approximately $135 million per year in the United States. == See also == Guaifenesin protocol == References == == External links == ""F.D.A.

1826,"('Diltiazem (hydrochloride)', 'Diltiazem', 'Cis-diltiazem', 'Cardizem', 'Dilt-cd')",Medical,"Diltiazem, sold under the brand name Cardizem among others, is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart arrhythmias. It may also be used in hyperthyroidism if beta blockers cannot be used. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. When given by injection, effects typically begin within a few minutes and last a few hours. Common side effects include swelling, dizziness, headaches, and low blood pressure. Other severe side effects include an overly slow heart beat, heart failure, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. It is unclear if use when breastfeeding is safe. Diltiazem works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of arteries, resulting in them opening and allowing blood to flow more easily. Additionally, it acts on the heart to prolong the period until it can beat again. It does this by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. It is a class IV antiarrhythmic. Diltiazem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 100th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. An extended release formulation is also available. == Medical uses == Diltiazem is indicated for: Stable angina (exercise-induced) – diltiazem increases coronary blood flow and decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, secondary to decreased peripheral resistance, heart rate, and contractility. Variant angina – it is effective owing to its direct effects on coronary dilation. Unstable angina (preinfarction, crescendo) – diltiazem may be particularly effective if the underlying mechanism is vasospasm. Myocardial bridge For supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), diltiazem appears to be as effective as verapamil in treating re-entrant supraventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter is another indication. The initial bolus should be 0.25 mg/kg, intravenous (IV). Because of its vasodilatory effects, diltiazem is useful for treating hypertension. Calcium channel blockers are well tolerated, and especially effective in treating low-renin hypertension. It is also used as topical application for anal fissures because it promotes healing due to its vasodilatory property. == Contraindications and precautions == In congestive heart failure, patients with reduced ventricular function may not be able to counteract the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of diltiazem, the result being an even higher compromise of function. With SA node or AV conduction disturbances, the use of diltiazem should be avoided in patients with SA or AV nodal abnormalities, because of its negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects. Low blood pressure patients, with systolic blood pressures below 90 mm Hg, should not be treated with diltiazem. Diltiazem may paradoxically increase ventricular rate in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome because of accessory conduction pathways. Diltiazem is relatively contraindicated in the presence of sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular node conduction disturbances, bradycardia, impaired left ventricle function, peripheral artery occlusive disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. == Side effects == A reflex sympathetic response, caused by the peripheral dilation of vessels and the resulting drop in blood pressure, works to counteract the negative inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects of diltiazem. Undesirable effects include hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, headaches and edema. Rare side effects are congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hepatotoxicity. == Drug interactions == Because of its inhibition of hepatic cytochromes CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, there are a number of drug interactions. Some of the more important interactions are listed below. === Beta-blockers === Intravenous diltiazem should be used with caution with beta-blockers because, while the combination is most potent at reducing heart rate, there are rare instances of dysrhythmia and AV node block. === Quinidine === Quinidine should not be used concurrently with calcium channel blockers because of reduced clearance of both drugs and potential pharmacodynamic effects at the SA and AV nodes. === Fentanyl === Concurrent use of fentanyl with diltiazem, or any other CYP3A4 inhibitors, as these medications decrease the breakdown of fentanyl and thus increase its effects. == Mechanism of action == Diltiazem, also known as (2S,3S)-3-acetoxy-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepin-4(5H)-one hydrochlorid has a vasodilating activity attributed to the (2S,3S)-isomer. Diltiazem is a potent vasodilator, increasing blood flow and variably decreasing the heart rate via strong depression of A-V node conduction. It binds to the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels in a fashion somewhat similar to verapamil, another nondihydropyridine (non-DHP) calcium channel blocker. Chemically, it is based upon a 1,4-thiazepine ring, making it a benzothiazepine-type calcium channel blocker. It is a potent and mild vasodilator of coronary and peripheral vessels, respectively, which reduces peripheral resistance and afterload, though not as potent as the dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers. This results in minimal reflexive sympathetic changes. Diltiazem has negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects. This means diltiazem causes a decrease in heart muscle contractility – how strong the beat is, lowering of heart rate – due to slowing of the sinoatrial node, and a slowing of conduction through the atrioventricular node – increasing the time needed for each beat. Each of these effects results in reduced oxygen consumption by the heart, reducing angina, typically unstable angina, symptoms. These effects also reduce blood pressure by causing less blood to be pumped out. == Research == Diltiazem is prescribed off-label by doctors in the US for prophylaxis of cluster headaches. Some research on diltiazem and other calcium channel antagonists in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine is ongoing. Recent research has shown diltiazem may reduce cocaine cravings in drug-addicted rats. This is believed to be due to the effects of calcium blockers on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling in the brain. Diltiazem also enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in animal tests, without increasing respiratory depression, and reduces the development of tolerance. Diltiazem is also being used in the treatment of anal fissures. It can be taken orally or applied topically with increased effectiveness. When applied topically, it is made into a cream form using either petrolatum or Phlojel. Phlojel absorbs the diltiazem into the problem area better than the petrolatum base. It has good short-term success rates. == References ==",Dilt-cd,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3589766240329482e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007133323233574629)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01814994215965271)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/diltiazem-oral-route/description/drg-20071775?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=137, start_index=9, title='Diltiazem (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/diltiazem-oral-route/description/drg-20071775?utm_source=openai')])"
1827,"('Atipamezole', 'Antisedan', 'Atipamezolum [latin]', 'Atipamezol [spanish]', 'Atipamezol')",Medical,"Atipamezole , sold under the brand name Antisedan among others, is a synthetic α2 adrenergic receptor antagonist used for the reversal of the sedative and analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine and medetomidine in dogs. Its reversal effect works by competing with the sedative for α2-adrenergic receptors and displacing them. It is mainly used in veterinary medicine, and while it is only licensed for dogs and for intramuscular use, it has been used intravenously, as well as in cats and other animals (intravenous use in cats and dogs is not recommended due to the potential for cardiovascular collapse. This occurs due to profound hypotension caused by reversal of the alpha 1 effects while the reflex bradycardia is still in effect.). There is a low rate of side effects, largely due to atipamezole's high specificity for the α2-adrenergic receptor. Atipamezole has a very quick onset, usually waking an animal up within 5 to 10 minutes. It was originally released in 1996. It is available in as a generic medication. == Veterinary use == Atipamezole is a veterinary drug whose prime purpose is to reverse the effects of the sedative dexmedetomidine (as well as its racemic mixture, medetomidine). It can also be used to reverse the related sedative xylazine. While it reverses both the sedative and analgesic (pain-relieving) effects of dexmedetomidine, atipamezole may not entirely reverse the cardiovascular depression that dexmedetomidine causes. Atipamezole is licensed in the United States for intramuscular injection (IM) in dogs; it is, however, used off-label in cats, rabbits, and farm animals such as horses and cows, as well as in zoo medicine for reptiles (including tortoises, turtles, and alligators), armadillos, hippopotamuses, giraffes, okapi, and others. It has been given intravenously (IV), subcutaneously, intraperitoneally and, in red-eared sliders, intranasally. Atipamezole has also been used as an antidote for various toxicities in dogs. For example, the anti-tick medication amitraz is commonly ingested by dogs who eat their anti-tick collars. Amitraz works by the same mechanism as dexmedetomidine and is thus easily reversed by atipamezole. Atipamezole also reverses the hypotension caused by tizanidine (a muscle relaxant) toxicity, and relieves toxicity from decongestants such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. === Available forms === Atipamezole is sold at 5 mg/mL for ease of use: 5 times as much atipamezole as medetomidine is needed for full reversal, and because medetomidine is sold as 1 mg/mL, 1 mL of atipamezole reverses 1 mL of medetomidine. When the enantiomerically pure version of medetomidine (dexmedetomidine) was released, it was sold at 0.5 mg/mL, because it was twice as strong as medetomidine. As such, 1 mL of atipamezole also reverses 1 mL of dexmedetomidine. === Specific populations === Atipamezole is not recommended for animals that are pregnant, lactating, or slated for breeding. == Contraindications == While there are no absolute contraindications to atipamezole, it is recommended against being given with anticholinergics, as both can cause dramatic increases in heart rate. Atipamezole should also not be given too soon after an animal has been given dexmedetomidine mixed with ketamine or telazol(tiletamine); because it reverses only the dexmedetomidine, the ketamine or telazol will still be active, and the animal can wake up excited, delirious, and with muscle contractions. Some recommend not using it in dogs sedated with ketamine at all, since they can convulse due to the excitement effect. == Side effects == Atipamezole's low rate of side effects is due to its high specificity for ɑ2-adrenergic receptors; it has very little affinity for ɑ1-adrenergic receptors and no affinity for most serotonin, muscarinic, and dopamine receptors. There is occasional vomiting, hypersalivation, and diarrhea. It can potentially cause CNS excitement, which can lead to tremors, tachycardia (increased heart rate), and vasodilation. The vasodilation leads to a transient decrease in blood pressure, which (in dogs) increases to normal within 10 minutes. There have been reports of transient hypoxemia. The chance of side effect can be minimized by administering atipamezole slowly. There is a possibility of the sedation reversing abruptly, leading to nervous, aggressive, or delirious dogs. Such cases are more associated with intravenous administration (which has a faster onset than IM administration). The rapid administration of atipamezole leads to sudden displacement of dexmedetomidine from peripheral ɑ2-adrenergic receptors; this can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, which is followed by a reflex tachycardia and hypertension. There have been some cases where intravenous administration of atipamezole lead to death via cardiovascular collapse. This is thought to be combination of sudden hypotension added onto the low heart rate caused by sedatives. There is some possibility of the animal relapsing into sedation after being given atipamezole, made more likely if the original sedative was given intravenously. Rats and monkeys have experienced increased sexual activity after being given atipamezole. == Overdose == The LD50 of atipamezole for rats is 44 mg/kg when given subcutaneously. The minimum lethal dose in dogs is over 5 mg/m2; dogs have tolerated getting ten times the standard dose. Signs of overdose include panting, trembling, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as increased blood levels of creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Dogs who received atipamezole without first receiving dexmedetomidine have shown no clinical signs other than mild muscle tremors. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Atipamezole is a competitive antagonist at ɑ2-adrenergic receptors that competes with dexmedetomidine, an ɑ2-adrenergic receptors agonist. It does not directly interact with dexmedetomidine; rather, their structural similarity allows atipamezole to easily compete for receptor binding sites. Atipamezole reverses analgesia by blocking norepinephrine feedback inhibition on nociceptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Out of the three ɑ2-antagonists commonly used in veterinary medicine (atipamezole, yohimbine, and tolazine), atipamezole shows the highest preference for ɑ2- over ɑ1-receptors, binding to them with a ratio of 8526:1. It shows no preference for a particular ɑ2-receptor subtype. Atipamezole has a rapid onset: it reverses the decreased heart rate caused by sedation within three minutes. The animal usually begins waking up within 5–10 minutes. In a study of over 100 dogs, more than half could stand up within 5 minutes, and 96% could stand up within 15. Atipamezole reaches maximum serum concentration within 10 minutes of IM administration. Atipamezole is distributed extensively to the tissues; at a particular time, concentrations in the brain reach two to three times the concentration in the plasma. Atipamezole undergoes heavy first-pass metabolism in the liver, which includes the glucuronidation at nitrogen during. Metabolites are mostly excreted in the urine. The elimination half-life is 2.6 hours in dogs and 1.3 hours rats. == Research == Atipamezole's effects on cognitive function have been studied in rats and in humans. While low doses in rats improved alertness, selective attention, learning, and recall, higher doses generally impaired cognitive function (most likely due to norepinephrine overactivity). In rats, it has also been shown to improve cognitive function decreased by strokes or brain lesions. Studies in humans have found it to increase focus but decrease multitasking abilities. Atipamezole has also been researched in humans as a potential anti-Parkinsonian. Because atipamezole increases sexual activity in monkeys, there have been claims of its potential to treat erectile dysfunction. == Notes == == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Atipamezole at Wikimedia Commons",Antisedan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.7320537567138672), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5760718584060669), (' INDUSTR', -1.1875571544806007e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2327011376619339), ('ICAL', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5760664343833923)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.drugs.com/vet/antisedan.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atipamezole ', [])"

It is used to treat COVID‑19 in those infected by SARS-CoV-2. It is taken by mouth. Molnupiravir is a prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine and exerts its antiviral action by introducing copying errors during viral RNA replication. Molnupiravir was originally developed to treat influenza at Emory University by the university's drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), but was reportedly abandoned for mutagenicity concerns. It was then acquired by the Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which later partnered with Merck & Co. to develop the drug further. Based on positive results in placebo-controlled double-blind randomized clinical trials, molnupiravir was approved for medical use in the United Kingdom in November 2021. In December 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to molnupiravir for use in certain populations where other treatments are not feasible. The emergency use authorization was only narrowly approved (13–10) because of questions about efficacy and concerns that molnupiravir's mutagenic effects could create new variants that evade immunity and prolong the COVID‑19 pandemic. In September 2023, molnupiravir's viral mutagenicity was confirmed to contribute to circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomic variation in a study of global SARS CoV 2 isolates after 2022: molnupiravir-specific genomic changes were more common, especially where molnupiravir had been used. == Medical uses == In the UK, molnupiravir is indicated for treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in adults with a positive SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. In the US molnupiravir is unapproved but is authorized under an EUA for emergency use for the treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate COVID‑19 who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID‑19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID‑19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. == Contraindications == Use during pregnancy is not recommended. There are no human data on use during pregnancy to assess the risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Based on animal data, the drug may cause fetal harm. == Adverse effects == Adverse reactions observed in the phase III MOVe-OUT study included diarrhea (2%), nausea (1%) and dizziness (1%), all of which were mild or moderate. The US FDA prescription label contains a boxed warning. In rats, bone and cartilage toxicity was observed after repeated dosing. == Overdose == The effects of overdose are unknown, treatment consists of general supportive measures such as monitoring of clinical status. == Drug interactions == Based on limited available data, there are no drug interactions. == Mechanism of action == Molnupiravir inhibits viral reproduction by promoting widespread mutations in the replication of viral RNA by RNA-directed RNA polymerase. It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (also called EIDD-1931 5′-triphosphate or NHC-TP). During replication, the virus's enzyme incorporates NHC-TP into newly made RNA instead of using real cytidine. Molnupiravir can swap between two forms (tautomers), one of which mimics cytidine (C) and the other uridine (U). NHC-TP is not recognized as an error by the virus's proofreading exonuclease enzymes, which can replace mutated nucleotides with corrected versions. When the viral RNA polymerase attempts to copy RNA containing molnupiravir, it sometimes interprets it as C and sometimes as U. This causes more mutations in all downstream copies than the virus can survive, an effect called viral error catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis. == Chemistry == The first synthesis of molnupiravir was disclosed in a patent filed by Emory University in 2018. In the first step, acetone is used as a protecting group to render two of the three hydroxy groups of uridine unreactive to treatment with the acid anhydride of isobutyric acid, which converts the third hydroxy group to its ester. Treatment with 1,2,4-triazole and phosphoryl chloride produces a reactive intermediate in which the triazole portion can be replaced with hydroxylamine. Finally, removal of the protecting group using formic acid converts the material to molnupiravir.: 93–95 == History == Molnupiravir was developed at Emory University by its drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE). In 2014, DRIVE began a screening project funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to find an antiviral drug targeting Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), which led to the discovery of EIDD-1931. When turned into the prodrug EIDD-2801 (molnupiravir), the compound also showed activity against other RNA viruses including influenza, Ebola, chikungunya, and various coronaviruses. The international nonproprietary name of the drug was inspired by that of Thor's hammer, Mjölnir. The idea is that the drug will strike down the virus like a mighty blow from the god of thunder. In 2019, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) approved moving molnupiravir into Phase I clinical trials for influenza. In March 2020, the research team pivoted to studying SARS-CoV-2, and successfully used molnupiravir to treat human cells infected with the novel coronavirus. A study found that it is orally active against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets. DRIVE then licensed molnupiravir for human clinical studies to Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which later partnered with Merck & Co. to develop the drug further. The primary data supporting the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization for molnupiravir are from MOVe-OUT, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying molnupiravir for the treatment of non-hospitalized participants with mild to moderate COVID‑19 at high risk for progression to severe COVID‑19 and/or hospitalization. Participants were adults 18 and older with a pre-specified chronic medical condition or at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for other reasons who had not received a COVID‑19 vaccine. The main outcome measured in the trial was the percentage of people who were hospitalized or died due to any cause during 29 days of follow-up. Of the 709 people who received molnupiravir, 6.8% were hospitalized or died within this period compared to 9.7% of the 699 people who received a placebo. In November 2022, the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence decided molnupiravir should not be routinely used to treat COVID‑19, as research showed it made no significant difference to hospitalization or death rates and was not cost effective. The drug was added to its ""not recommended"" list in draft COVID‑19 treatment guidance for consultation. == Society and culture == === Economics === In September 2021, Merck signed a voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) that allows MPP to sublicense molnupiravir and supply the COVID‑19 oral medication to 105 low- and middle-income countries. The cost of the US government's initial purchase was about $712 per course of treatment; treatment with generics in developing countries can cost as little as $20. Sales of molnupiravir were $952 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. === Legal status === In October 2021, Merck submitted an EUA application to the FDA, and in November 2021, the FDA's Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research met to discuss the application. The committee narrowly voted, 13 for and 10 opposed, to recommend authorization for adults with mild to moderate illness who are at high risk of developing severe COVID‑19. Concerns were expressed over the drug's low effectiveness in preventing death, which in the final trial was only 30%, as well as the increased mutation rate the drug causes, which could theoretically worsen the pandemic by driving the evolution of more dangerous variants. In December 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for molnupiravir for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID‑19 in adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID‑19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID‑19 treatment options authorized by the FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. In October 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) started a rolling review of molnupiravir. In February 2023, the EMA recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for molnupiravir. In June 2023, Merck Sharp & Dohme withdrew its application for a marketing authorization of molnupiravir. In November 2021, molnupiravir was approved in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the treatment of established infections of COVID‑19. The MHRA issued a conditional marketing authorization applicable in the UK, and an emergency use authorization for Northern Ireland. In November 2021, the Bangladesh Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) authorized emergency use of molnupiravir. In January 2022, molnupiravir was approved for medical use in Israel and in February 2022 in Russia. === Brand names === Molnupiravir is the international nonproprietary name. Generic versions are available under the brand names Molulife (Mankind), Molena (Emcure), and Esplevir (Promomed). === Public health concerns === At a November 2021 AMDAC meeting, multiple advisors raised the concern that molnupiravir could accelerate the emergence of variants of concern. Other scientists raised similar concerns both before and after the meeting. These concerns were confirmed with the September 2023 publication of a study of 15 million global SARS-CoV-2 sequences: after molnupiravir had been introduced in 2022, genomic changes were more common, especially where it had been used. == Research == Alternative patented routes to molnupiravir have been reviewed.

It works by increasing insulin release from the pancreas and decreases excessive glucagon release. Exenatide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. In 2019, it was the 312th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Exenatide is used to treat type 2 diabetes as an add-on to metformin, a biguanide, or a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone. A 2011 Cochrane review showed a HbA1c reduction of 0.20% more with Exenatide 2 mg compared to insulin glargine, exenatide 10 μg twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Exenatide, lead to greater weight loss than glucagon-like peptide analogues. Due to shorter duration of studies, this review did not allow for long-term positive or negative effects to be assessed. == Side effects == The main side effects of exenatide use are gastrointestinal in nature, including acid or sour stomach, belching, diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and vomiting. These tend to subside with time; exenatide is therefore not meant for people with severe gastrointestinal disease. Other side effects include dizziness, headache, and feeling jittery. Drug interactions listed on the package insert include delayed or reduced concentrations of lovastatin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and digoxin, although this has not been proven to alter the effectiveness of these other medications. In response to postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients using exenatide, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning to the labeling of Byetta in 2007. In August 2008, four additional deaths from pancreatitis in users of exenatide were reported to the FDA; while no definite relationship had been established, the FDA was reportedly considering additional changes to the drug's labeling. Examination of the medical records of the millions of patients part of the United Healthcare Insurance plans did not show any greater rate of pancreatitis among Byetta users than among diabetic patients on other medications. However, diabetics do have a slightly greater incidence of pancreatitis than do non-diabetics. It also may increase risk of mild sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. Additionally, the FDA has raised concerns over the lack of data to determine if the long-acting once-weekly version of exenatide (but not the twice-daily form of exenatide) may increase thyroid cancer risk. This concern comes out of observing a very small but nevertheless increased risk of thyroid cancer in rodents that was observed for another drug (liraglutide) that is in the same class as exenatide. The data available for exenatide showed less of a risk towards thyroid cancer than liraglutide, but to better quantify the risk the FDA has required Amylin to conduct additional rodent studies to better identify the thyroid issue. The approved form of the once weekly exenatide [Bydureon] has a black box warning discussing the thyroid issue. Eli Lilly has reported they have not seen a link in humans, but that it cannot be ruled out. Eli Lilly has stated the drug causes an increase in thyroid problems in rats given high doses. In March 2013, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication announcing investigations into incretin mimetics due to findings by academic researchers. A few weeks later, the European Medicines Agency launched a similar investigation into GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors. == Mechanism of action == Exenatide binds to the intact human Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in a similar way to the human peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1); exenatide bears a 50% amino acid homology to GLP-1 and it has a longer half-life in vivo. Exenatide is believed to facilitate glucose control in at least five ways: Exenatide augments pancreas response (i.e. increases insulin secretion) in response to eating meals; the result is the release of a higher, more appropriate amount of insulin that helps lower the rise in blood sugar from eating. Once blood sugar levels decrease closer to normal values, the pancreas response to produce insulin is reduced; other drugs (like injectable insulin) are effective at lowering blood sugar, but can ""overshoot"" their target and cause blood sugar to become too low, resulting in the dangerous condition of hypoglycemia. Exenatide also suppresses pancreatic release of glucagon in response to eating, which helps stop the liver from overproducing sugar when it is unneeded, which prevents hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). Exenatide helps slow down gastric emptying and thus decreases the rate at which meal-derived glucose appears in the bloodstream. Exenatide has a subtle yet prolonged effect to reduce appetite, promote satiety via hypothalamic receptors (different receptors than for amylin). Most people using exenatide slowly lose weight, and generally the greatest weight loss is achieved by people who are the most overweight at the beginning of exenatide therapy. Clinical trials have demonstrated the weight reducing effect continues at the same rate through 2.25 years of continued use. When separated into weight loss quartiles, the highest 25% experience substantial weight loss, and the lowest 25% experience no loss or small weight gain. Exenatide reduces liver fat content. Fat accumulation in the liver or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly related with several metabolic disorders, in particular low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides, present in patients with type 2 diabetes. It became apparent that exenatide reduced liver fat in mice, rat and more recently in man. == Chemistry == Exenatide is a 39-amino-acid peptide; it is a synthetic version of exendin-4, a peptide found in the venom of the Gila monster. == History == During the early 1980s, Jean-Pierre Raufman worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health for John Pisano, an ""eccentric biochemist"" who specialized in collecting venoms from various animals and looking for novel substances that could affect human physiology. In the course of this work, Raufman focused on investigating the Gila monster because he was curious about how it only eats once or twice per year. He discovered molecules in the monster's saliva ""that caused inflammation of the pancreas in test animals"". He later recalled: ""We got a tremendous response from Gila monster venom"". When Raufman gave a lecture about his findings, his research piqued the curiosity of John Eng, an endocrinologist at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in New York City. Eng had trained under Rosalyn Sussman Yalow, who shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for development of the radioimmunoassay technique. In 1992, Eng used that technique to isolate a novel substance from Gila monster venom which he called exendin-4. He tested exendin-4 on diabetic mice and discovered that it was not only effective for reducing blood glucose but was effective for several hours. This was an enormously significant clinical finding, because it was GLP-1's extremely short half-life which had defeated earlier attempts to turn that substance into a drug. Attempts to bypass that issue by infusing patients in clinical tests with very high doses of GLP-1—in order to overcome its rapid metabolism in the bloodstream—had produced extremely severe nausea, followed by immediate vomiting. Eng's employer, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, turned out to have no interest in obtaining a drug patent on exendin-4, so Eng filed the patent application himself in 1993. He then spent three years on fruitless efforts to persuade the pharmaceutical industry to develop exendin-4 into a drug. Jens Juul Holst, a GLP-1 expert, later recalled seeing the skepticism which Eng encountered when he tried to present his work on a poster at industry conferences: ""He was extremely frustrated ... Nobody was interested in his work. None of the important people. It was too strange for people to accept"". At a 1996 American Diabetes Association conference in San Francisco, Eng finally caught the attention of scientist Andrew Young of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, who immediately recognized exendin-4's potential and arranged for his company to license Eng's patent. Young was excited to see Eng's poster at the conference summarizing his findings, but then noticed an Eli Lilly and Company executive reading the same poster, and he became worried that Lilly might beat Amylin to a license. When Eng arrived at Amylin's San Diego headquarters, he was astonished to discover how much information Amylin's scientists had already figured out about exendin-4 in the brief period of time after Young saw his poster, which convinced him that Amylin was the right company to partner with. Amylin went on to create exenatide, a synthetic version of exendin-4, and later formed an alliance with Lilly in 2002 to bring the drug to market. Exenatide was approved by the FDA in April 2005, for people whose diabetes is not well controlled on other oral medications. This was a landmark event which proved that targeting the GLP-1 receptor was a viable strategy and inspired other pharmaceutical companies to focus their research and development on that receptor. In 2011, Lilly and Amylin dissolved their partnership, with Amylin keeping the rights to exenatide. Meanwhile, Lilly had been awakened to the possibilities of this class of drugs and continued to develop newer drugs of the same class. By October 2024, the blockbuster drug tirzepatide had transformed Lilly into the most valuable drug company in the world. == Society and culture == 53 consolidated lawsuits against manufacturers of ""GLP-1/DPP-4 products"" were dismissed in 2015. == Research == In 2016, work published showing that it can reverse impaired calcium signalling in steatotic liver cells, which, in turn, might be associated with proper glucose control. It is being evaluated for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. A phase 3 clinical trial, started in January 2020 has an Estimated Study Completion Date of 30 June 2024 (NCT04232969). A 2025 study that randomly assigned Parkinson’s patients to receive exenatide, a drug related to Ozempic, found no evidence that it slowed disease progression or provided any benefit after 96 weeks. The research, in The Lancet, showed no improvements in patient symptoms, brain scans, or any specific subgroup—regardless of how the data was analyzed, the outcome remained unchanged. == References == == External links == Exenatide at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Exenatide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.0503786799963564e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044145373976789415)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01276?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Exenatide: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01276?utm_source=openai')])"
1831,"('Candesartan', 'Cv 11974', 'Candesartan cilexetil related compound g', '[3h]candesartan', 'Candesartan (usan/inn)')",Medical,"Candesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used mainly for the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Candesartan has a very low maintenance dose. Like olmesartan, the metabolism of the drug is unusual as it is a cascading prodrug. Candesartan has good bioavailibility and is the most potent by weight of the AT-1 receptor antagonists. It was patented in 1990 and approved for medical use in 1997. == Medical uses == === Hypertension === As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, candesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Candesartan has an additive antihypertensive effect when combined with a diuretic, such as chlorthalidone. It is available in a fixed-combination formulation with a low dose of the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparations are marketed under various trade names including Atacand Plus, Hytacand, Blopress Plus, Advantec and Ratacand Plus. === Heart failure === In heart failure patients, angiotensin receptor blockers such as candesartan and valsartan may be a suitable option for those who do not tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medicines. Randomised control trials have shown candesartan reduces heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths for patients who have heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%). === Prehypertension === In a four-year randomized controlled trial, candesartan was compared to placebo to see whether it could prevent or postpone the development of full-blown hypertension in people with so-called prehypertension. During the first two years of the trial, half of participants were given candesartan while the other half received placebo; candesartan reduced the risk of developing hypertension by nearly two-thirds during this period. In the last two years of the study, all participants were switched to placebo. By the end of the study, candesartan had significantly reduced the risk of hypertension, by more than 15%. Serious adverse effects were more common among participants receiving placebo than in those given candesartan. === Prevention of atrial fibrillation === In 2005, meta-analysis results showed that angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors considerably reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with coexisting heart failure and systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Specifically, an analysis of the CHARM study showed benefits for Candesartan in reducing new occurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular function. While these studies have demonstrated a potential additional benefit for candesartan when used in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are required to further elucidate the role of candesartan in the prevention of atrial fibrillation in other population groups. === Diabetic retinopathy === Use of antihypertensive drugs has been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy; the role of candesartan specifically in reducing progression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes is still up for debate. Results from a 2008 study on patients with type 1 diabetes showed there was no benefit in using candesartan to reduce progression of diabetic retinopathy when compared to placebo. Candesartan has been demonstrated to reverse the severity (cause regression) of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient populations investigated in these studies were limited to mostly Caucasians and those younger than 75 years of age, so generalization of these findings to other population groups should be done with caution. === Migraine prophylaxis === Candesartan may be helpful in migraine prevention as it has better tolerability and fewer side effects compared to other first line medications. It has been recommended by multiple guidelines for migraine prophylaxis in adults with different levels of recommendations, however further studies on larger populations are needed. == Adverse effects == As with other drugs that inhibit the renin–angiotensin system, if candesartan is taken by pregnant women during the second or third trimester, it can cause injury and in some cases, death of the developing fetus. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in people who take candesartan and are volume-depleted or salt-depleted, as can also occur when diuretics are coadministered. Reduction in renal glomerular filtration rate may occur; people with renal artery stenosis may be at higher risk. Hyperkalemia may occur; people who are also taking spironolactone or eplerenone may be at higher risk. Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system. As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan can rarely cause severe liver injury. == Chemistry and pharmacokinetics == Candesartan is marketed as the cyclohexyl 1-hydroxy ethyl carbonate (cilexetil) ester, known as candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan cilexetil is metabolised completely by esterases in the intestinal wall during absorption to the active candesartan moiety. In the first step of the cascading pro-drug mechanism, the carbonate group is hydrolyzed, releasing carbon dioxide. The metabolite at this step is cyclohexanol which, being relatively non-toxic, is advantageous to the design of the drug. The other aspect of the cascading prodrug is the O-CH-CH3 molecule which becomes converted into acetic acid, which is another product from the cascading side reaction. Similar to the insight from cyclohexanol, the metabolite of acetic acid relatively is non-toxic and thus less of a hazard if produced as the drug takes pharmacologic action. The use of a prodrug form increases the bioavailability of candesartan. Despite this, absolute bioavailability is relatively poor at 15% (candesartan cilexetil tablets) to 40% (candesartan cilexetil solution). Its IC50 is 15 μg/kg. Candesartan is not administered in its active form because the administration of the pro-drug would require greater doses and has an unfavorable adverse event profile. == Research == There is ongoing research into several potential benefits of candesartan beyond established indications. Candesartan is being investigated for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. In an early Alzheimer's disease mouse model, candesartan significantly reduced amyloid burden and inflammation and it is being examined as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's. Rat models indicate that candesartan may have neuroprotective benefits that mitigate certain central mechanisms of ageing and senescence. Additionally, candesartan has shown potential therapeutic applications as an anti-anxiety agent. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, candesartan induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved both LV function and exercise tolerance with no side effects in patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The unique anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Candesartan are shown to offer superior renoprotection of chronic renal inflammation, and in ultrahigh doses and in a multidrug context, could be investigated as potentially inducing remission of chronic kidney disease. == History == The compound known as TCV-116 (candesartan) was studied by Japanese scientists using standard laboratory rats. Animal studies were published showing the effectiveness of the compound in 1992–1993, with a pilot study on humans published in the summer of 1993. == Names == The prodrug candesartan cilexetil is marketed by AstraZeneca and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, commonly under the trade names Blopress, Atacand, Amias, and Ratacand.

1833,"('Xylometazoline (hydrochloride)', 'Xylometazoline', 'Xylomethazoline', 'Otrivine', 'Otrivin')",Medical,"Xylometazoline, also spelled xylomethazoline, is a medication used to reduce symptoms of nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis. It is used directly in the nose as a spray or drops. Side effects include trouble sleeping, irritation of the nose, nausea, nosebleed (3%), period pain (10%) and headache (3%). Long term use (> 10 days) is not recommended due to a rhinitis medicamentosa when stopped. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. Xylometazoline is in the decongestant and alpha-adrenergic agonist families of medication. One study classified it with selectivity ratios in alpha 2 adrenergic receptors of 151 for a2A vs a2B, 4.5 a2A vs a2C, and 33.9 a2B vs a2C. Making it a highly selective a2A agonist. Xylometazoline was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Xylometazoline is available as a generic medication. == Mechanism of action == Xylometazoline works by stimulating adrenergic receptors on the lamina propria of blood vessels in the nose. The decongestant effect is due to constriction of large veins in the nose which swell up during the inflammation of any infection or allergy of the nose. The smaller arteries are also constricted and this causes the colour of the nasal epithelium to be visibly paler after dosage. Xylometazoline is an imidazole derivative which is designed to mimic the molecular shape of adrenaline. It binds to α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa. Due to its sympathomimetic effects, it should not be used by people with high blood pressure, or other heart problems. Extended usage of xylometazoline can result in decreased effectiveness or a buildup of tolerance against the drug. The number of receptors decreases, and when the administration of the drug is ceased, chronic congestion can occur; this is called rhinitis medicamentosa, commonly referred to as rebound congestion. Moreover, long-term overdosing can cause degenerative changes in nasal mucous membranes that pose another health problem. == Society and culture == In 2021, a US FDA Drug Safety Communication stated that, while a US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) proposed rule regarding child-resistant packaging covered products containing xylometazoline, no such products were marketed in the United States at that time. === Brand names === The most common name for over-the-counter products containing xylometazoline internationally is ""Otrivin"" (used in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Jordan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Egypt, Sweden, Vietnam, Hong Kong), ""Otrivine"" (United Kingdom, Ireland, Turkey, Belgium), or ""Otriven"" (Germany). A product marketed as ""Otrivin Oxy"" contains oxymetazoline instead of xylometazoline. Other product names used include Antazol (Square, in Bangladesh), Xylomet (Opsonin, Bangladesh), Cirovin, Klarigen (in Denmark), Nasolin (in Finland), Neo-Rinoleina, Novorin, Olynth, Otrinoz, Galazolin (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus), Nasomist-X, Otrix, Rhinoset, Zenfresh, Naphthyzinium, Xymelyn (in Latvia), Sinutab Nasal Spray, Snup akut, Sudafed, Xylo-COMOD, Xylolin (in the United Arab Emirates), Xylovit, Olynth (in Serbia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Slovakia), Meralys (in Croatia) Xynosine (in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan), Xymelin, Zymelin, Xylostar, Xylorin (in Poland), Nasobol, Xylo Mepha and others (Switzerland), Decozal (in Jordan), Nasic, Orinox (Romania), Narhimed (Italy), nasa Rhinathiol (Belgium), Zolinol, Nasorhinathiol, and Vibrocil (Portugal). === Formulations === The standard adult solution strength is 0.1% w/v xylometazoline (or 1 mg per 1 mL solution). == Synthesis == 5-tert-Butyl-m-xylene is reacted with chloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of zinc chloride to form 2,6-dimethyl-4-tert-butyl-benzylchloride, which is then reacted with sodium cyanide in the presence of potassium iodide to produce 2,6-dimethyl-4-tert-butyl-benzylcyanide. This is then reacted with ethylene diamine in the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid to form the corresponding imidazoline, this being xylometazoline. Carbon disulfide can also be used as a catalyst in the last step. When using para-toluenesulfonic acid, the resulting salt can be basified and extracted with hydrochloric acid to produce xylometazoline hydrochloride, which is the main form used in medications. == References ==",Otrivin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00018618757894728333), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004092533141374588)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylometazoline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=93, start_index=9, title='Xylometazoline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylometazoline?utm_source=openai')])"

The safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AR9281 were evaluated in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending, single oral dose (10-1000 mg) and multiple dose (100-400 mg every 8 hours for 7 days) studies in healthy subjects. AR9281 was well tolerated, and no dose-related adverse events were observed during either study. The drug was rapidly absorbed with a mean terminal half-life ranging from 3 to 5 hours. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner up to the 500-mg dose and exhibited a greater than dose linearity at higher doses. AR9281 directly and dose-dependently inhibited blood s-EH activity with 90% inhibition or greater over an 8-hour period at the 250-mg dose and over a 12-hour period at the 500-mg dose. Multiple doses of AR9281 ranging from 100 to 400 mg every 8 hours resulted in a sustained inhibition of s-EH activity at 90% or greater during the trough. The current studies provide proof of safety and target inhibition of AR9281 in healthy subjects. AR9281 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics support a twice-daily or thrice-daily dosing regimen in patients. Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) are demonstrating promise as potential pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, inflammation, and kidney disease. The present study determined the ability of a first-inclass sEHI, AR9281, to decrease blood pressure, improve vascular function, and decrease renal inflammation and injury in angiotensin hypertension. Rats were infused with angiotensin and AR9281 was given orally during the 14-day infusion period. Systolic blood pressure averaged 180 ± 5 mmHg in vehicle treated and AR9281 treatment significantly lowered blood pressure to 142 ± 7 mmHg in angiotensin hypertension. Histological analysis demonstrated decreased injury to the juxtamedullary glomeruli. Renal expression of inflammatory genes was increased in angiotensin hypertension and two weeks of AR9281 treatment decreased this index of renal inflammation. Vascular function in angiotensin hypertension was also improved by AR9281 treatment. Decreased afferent arteriolar and mesenteric resistance endothelial dependent dilator responses were ameliorated by AR9281 treatment of angiotensin hypertensive rats. These data demonstrate that the first-in-class sEHI, AR9281, lowers blood pressure, improves vascular function and reduces renal damage in angiotensin hypertension. 1-(1-Acetyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-adamantan-1-yl-urea 14a (AR9281), a potent and selective soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, was recently tested in a phase 2a clinical setting for its effectiveness in reducing blood pressure and improving insulin resistance in pre-diabetic patients. In a mouse model of diet induced obesity, AR9281 attenuated the enhanced glucose excursion following an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test.

1836,"('Piclidenoson', 'Ib-meca', 'Cf 101', 'N(6)-ibamu', ""N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)-5'-n-methylcarboxamidoadenosine"")",Medical," Psoriasis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, affects 0.2-4.8% of the global population. The disease manifests primarily as plaque psoriasis, causing chronic physical and psychological burdens. Although numerous treatments exist, there is ongoing exploration for novel therapies due to concerns about the toxicity, efficacy, and costs of current options. An A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonist called Piclidenoson has been shown to reduce inflammation and could be used to treat moderate to severe psoriasis. This meta-analysis evaluates the safety and efficacy of Piclidenoson in psoriasis treatment. This meta-analysis was conducted accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024566459). A comprehensive search on Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar was conducted up to July 2024. Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving Piclidenoson. Efficacy outcomes included PASI 75 and PGA 0 or 1, while safety outcomes included adverse events. Pooled outcomes were presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analysis employed the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) is overexpressed in the skin and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of psoriasis patients. We investigated the efficacy/safety of piclidenoson (CF101), an orally bioavailable A3AR agonist that inhibits IL-17 and IL-23 production in keratinocytes, in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind phase 3 COMFORT-1 trial randomized patients (3:3:3:2) to piclidenoson 2 mg BID, piclidenoson 3 mg BID, apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo. At Week 16, patients in the placebo arm were re-randomized (1:1:1) to piclidenoson 2 mg BID, piclidenoson 3 mg BID or apremilast 30 mg BID. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving ≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline (PASI-75) at Week 16 versus placebo. A total of 529 patients were randomized and received ≥1 dose of study medication (safety population). The efficacy analysis population for the primary end point included 426 patients (piclidenoson 2 mg BID, 127; piclidenoson 3 mg BID, 103; apremilast, 118; placebo, 78). Piclidenoson at 2 and 3 mg BID exhibited similar efficacy. The primary end point was met with the 3 mg BID dose: PASI 75 rate of 9.7% versus 2.6% for piclidenoson versus placebo, p = 0.037. The PASI responses with piclidenoson continued to increase throughout the study period in a linear manner. At week 32, analysis in the per-protocol population showed that a greater proportion of patients in the piclidenoson 3 mg BID arm (51/88, 58.0%) achieved improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) compared to apremilast (59/108, 55.1%), and the test for noninferiority trended towards significance (p = 0.072). The safety/tolerability profile of piclidenoson was excellent and superior to apremilast. Piclidenoson demonstrated efficacy responses that increased over time alongside a favourable safety profile. These findings support its continued clinical development as a psoriasis treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03168256).

It functions by inhibiting both tubulin polymerization and Src kinase signaling. It is potentially effective in impeding the development of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The most common side effects include local skin reactions, application site pruritus, and application site pain. Tirbanibulin was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2020, and in the European Union in July 2021. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Tirbanibulin is indicated for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis of the face or scalp. == Mechanism of Action == Tirbanibulin, chemically known as N-benzyl-2-(5-(4-(2-morpholinoethoxy)phenyl) pyridine-2-yl) acetamide, is a microtubule and non–ATP-competitive inhibitor. The drug in various ways mimics the mechanisms of chemotherapy by suspending the protooncogenic Src tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. Notably, it promotes G2/M arrest during cell cycle, upregulates p53, and triggers apoptosis via caspase-3 stimulation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. == Side effects == In several studies tirbanibulin has been observed to induce skin reactions at the site of application, ranging from mild to severe erythema, flaking, ulceration, and pain. Extensive research has not been conducted on the risks of tirbanibulin usage by specific human populations (i.e., pregnant populations). Significant differences have not been observed in the safety or effectiveness of tirbanibulin between geriatric or pediatric populations. == History == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tirbanibulin based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT03285477 and Trial 2/NCT03285490) of 702 adults with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. The trials were conducted at 62 sites in the United States. Participants received once daily treatment with either tirbanibulin or inactive control ointment for 5 consecutive days to the single predetermined area where they had actinic keratosis. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was completed. The benefit of tirbanibulin in comparison to control was assessed after 57 days by comparing the percentage of participants who did not have any actinic keratosis on the treatment area (100% clearance). == Society and culture == === Legal status === In May 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for tirbanibulin, intended for the treatment of actinic keratosis.

1839,"('Platelet activating factor', 'Platelet-activating factor', 'Hag-pc', 'Hexadecyl-paf-acether', 'Platelet-activating factor c16')","Endogenous, Medical","Platelet-activating factor, also known as PAF, PAF-acether or AGEPC (acetyl-glyceryl-ether-phosphorylcholine), is a potent phospholipid activator and mediator of many leukocyte functions, platelet aggregation and degranulation, inflammation, and anaphylaxis. It is also involved in changes to vascular permeability, the oxidative burst, chemotaxis of leukocytes, as well as augmentation of arachidonic acid metabolism in phagocytes. PAF is produced by a variety of cells, but especially those involved in host defense, such as platelets, endothelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. PAF is continuously produced by these cells but in low quantities and production is controlled by the activity of PAF acetylhydrolases. It is produced in larger quantities by inflammatory cells in response to specific stimuli. == History == PAF was discovered by French immunologist Jacques Benveniste in the early 1970s. PAF was the first phospholipid known to have messenger functions. Benveniste made significant contributions in the role and characteristics of PAF and its importance in inflammatory response and mediation. Using lab rats and mice, he found that ionophore A23187 (a mobile ion carrier that allows the passage of Mn2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and has antibiotic properties against bacteria and fungi) caused the release of PAF. These developments led to the finding that macrophages produce PAF and that macrophages play an important function in aggregation of platelets and liberation of their inflammatory and vasoactive substances. Further studies on PAF were conducted by Constantinos A. Demopoulos in 1979. Demopoulos found that PAF plays a crucial role in heart disease and strokes. His experiment’s data found that atherosclerosis (the accumulation of lipid-rich lesions in the endothelium of the arteries) can be attributed to PAF and PAF-like lipids, and identified biologically active compounds in the polar lipid fractions of olive oil, honey, milk and yoghurt, mackerel, and wine that have PAF-antagonistic properties and inhibit the development of atherosclerosis in animal models. During the course of his studies, he also determined the chemical structure of the compound. == Evolution == PAF can be found in protozoans, yeasts, plants, bacteria, and mammals. PAF has regulatory role in protozoans. The regulatory role is thought to diverge from that point and be maintained as living organisms started to evolve. During evolution, functions of PAF in the cell have been changing and enlarging. PAF has been found in plants but its function has not yet been determined. == Function == PAF is used to transmit signals between neighboring cells and acts as a hormone, cytokines, and other signaling molecules. The PAF signaling system can trigger inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, amplify these cascades when acting with other mediators, and mediate molecular and cellular interactions (cross talk) between inflammation and thrombosis. Unregulated PAF signaling can cause pathological inflammation and has been found to be a cause in sepsis, shock, and traumatic injury. PAF can be used as a local signaling molecule and travel over very short distances or it can be circulated throughout the body and act via endocrine. PAF initiates an inflammatory response in allergic reactions. This has been demonstrated in the skin of humans and in the paws and skin of lab rabbits and rodents. The inflammatory response is enhanced by the use of vasodilators, including prostaglandin E1 (PGE,) and PGE2 and inhibited by vasoconstrictors. PAF also induces apoptosis in a different way that is independent of the PAF receptor. The pathway to apoptosis can be inhibited by negative feedback from PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme that catabolizes platelet-activating factor. It is an important mediator of bronchoconstriction. It causes platelets to aggregate and blood vessels to dilate. Thus, it is important to the process of hemostasis. At a concentration of 10−12 mol/L, PAF causes life-threatening inflammation of the airways to induce asthma like symptoms. Toxins such as fragments of destroyed bacteria induce the synthesis of PAF, which causes a drop in blood pressure and reduced volume of blood pumped by the heart, which leads to shock and possibly death. == Structure == Several molecular species of platelet-activating factor that vary in the length of the O-alkyl side-chain have been identified. Its alkyl group is connected by an ether linkage at the C1 carbon to a 16-carbon chain. The acyl group at the C2 carbon is an acetate unit (as opposed to a fatty acid) whose short length increases the solubility of PAF allowing it to function as a soluble signal messenger. The C3 has a phosphocholine head group, just like standard phosphatidylcholine. Studies found that PAF could not be modified without losing its biological activity. Thus, small changes in the structure of PAF could render its signaling abilities inert. Investigation led to the understanding that platelet and blood pressure response were dependent on the sn-2 propionyl analog. If the sn-1 was removed then PAF lacked any sort of biological activity. Finally, the sn-3 position of PAF was experimented with by removing methyl groups sequentially. As more and more methyl groups were removed, biological activity diminished until it was eventually inactive. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === PAF is produced by stimulated basophils, monocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells primarily through lipid remodeling. A variety of stimuli can initiate the synthesis of PAF. These stimuli could be macrophages going through phagocytosis or endothelium cells uptake of thrombin. There are two different pathways in which PAF can be synthesized: de novo pathway and remodeling. The remodeling pathway is activated by inflammatory agents and it is thought to be the primary source of PAF under pathological conditions. The de novo pathway is used to maintain PAF levels during normal cellular function. The most common pathway taken to produce PAF is remodeling. The precursor to the remodeling pathway is a phospholipid, which is typically phosphatidylcholine (PC). The fatty acid is removed from the sn-2 position of the three-carbon backbone of the phospholipid by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to produce the intermediate lyso-PC (LPC). An acetyl group is then added by LPC acetyltransferase (LPCAT) to produce PAF. Using the de novo pathway, PAF is produced from 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (AAG). Fatty acids are joined on the sn-1 position with 1-O-hexadecyl being the best for PAF activity. Phosphocholine is then added to the sn-3 site on AAG creating PAF. === Regulation === The concentration of PAF is controlled by the synthesis of the compound and by the actions of PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AH). PAF-AH are a family of enzymes that have the ability to catabolize and degrade PAF and turn it into an inactive compound. The enzymes within this family are lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, cytoplasmic platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 2, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b. Cations are one form of regulation in the production of PAF. Calcium plays a large role in the inhibition of enzymes that produce PAF in the denovo pathway of PAF biosynthesis. The regulation of PAF is still not completely understood. Enzymes that are associated with the production of PAF are controlled by metal ions, thiol compounds, fatty acids, pH, compartmentalization, and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. These controls on these PAF producing enzymes are believed to work in conjunction to control it, but the overall pathway and reasoning is not well understood. == Pharmacology == === Inhibition === PAF antagonists do not provoke an inflammatory response upon binding, but block or lessen the effect of PAF. Examples of PAF antagonists are: CV-3988 is a PAF antagonist that blocks signaling events correlated to the expression and binding of PAF to the PAF Receptor. SM-12502 is a PAF antagonist, which is metabolized in the liver by the enzyme CYP2A6. Rupatadine is an antihistamine and PAF antagonist used to treat allergies.

1840,"('Cefepime (dihydrochloride monohydrate)', 'Cefepime', 'Maxipime', 'Cefepima', 'Cefepimum [latin]')",Medical,"Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Cefepime has an extended spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with greater activity against both types of organism than third-generation agents. A 2007 meta-analysis suggested when data of trials were combined, mortality was increased in people treated with cefepime compared with other β-lactam antibiotics. In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) performed their own meta-analysis which found no mortality difference. Cefepime was patented in 1982 by Bristol-Myers Squibb and approved for medical use in 1994. It is available as a generic drug and sold under a variety of trade names worldwide. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. == Medical use == Cefepime is usually reserved to treat moderate to severe nosocomial pneumonia, infections caused by multiple drug-resistant microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. Cefepime has good activity against important pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. A particular strength is its activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by many plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases, cefepime is stable and is a front-line agent when infection with Enterobacteriaceae is known or suspected. === Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility === Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic and has been used to treat bacteria responsible for causing pneumonia and infections of the skin and urinary tract. Some of these bacteria include Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Streptococcus species. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: Escherichia coli: ≤0.007 – 128 μg/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 0.06 – >256 μg/ml Streptococcus pneumoniae: ≤0.007 – >8 μg/ml === Cefepime Induced Neurotoxicity === Cefepime crosses the blood brain barrier and exhibits a concentration-dependent ϒ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist effect, which can cause neurological symptoms in susceptible individuals, particularly those with renal dysfunction. Up to 15% of ICU patients treated with cefepime will experience cefepime induced neurotoxicity. Symptoms typically begin within 2-6 days of cefepime administration and include diminished level of consciousness, disorientation, aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Symptoms typically resolve within 1-3 days of discontinuing cefepime. == Chemistry == The combination of the syn-configuration of the methoxy imino moiety and the aminothiazole moiety confers extra stability to β-lactamase enzymes produced by many bacteria. The N-methyl pyrrolidine moiety increases penetration into Gram-negative bacteria. These factors increase the activity of cefepime against otherwise resistant organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. == Trade names == Following expiration of the Bristol-Myers Squibb patent, cefepime became available as a generic and is now marketed by numerous companies worldwide under tradenames including Neopime (Neomed), Maxipime, Cepimax, Cepimex, and Axepim. == References == == External links == ""Cefepime"".

Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a sensitive circulating kidney biomarker whose concentrations increase earlier than creatinine as glomerular filtration rate decreases. Unlike creatinine SDMA is unaffected by lean body mass. The IDEXX SDMA test introduces a clinically relevant and reliable tool for the diagnosis and management of kidney disease. SDMA has been provisionally incorporated into the International Renal Interest Society guidelines for CKD to aid staging and targeted treatment of early and advanced disease. Asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA, respectively) are toxic, non-proteinogenic amino acids formed by post-translational modification and are uremic toxins that inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production and play multifunctional roles in many human diseases. Both ADMA and SDMA have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular events and death in a range of illnesses. Major progress has been made in research on ADMA-lowering therapies in animal studies; however, further studies are required to fill the translational gap between animal models and clinical trials in order to treat human diseases related to elevated ADMA/SDMA levels. Here, we review the reported impacts of ADMA and SDMA on human health and disease, focusing on the synthesis and metabolism of ADMA and SDMA; the pathophysiological roles of these dimethylarginines; clinical conditions and animal models associated with elevated ADMA and SDMA levels; and potential therapies against ADMA and SDMA. There is currently no specific pharmacological therapy for lowering the levels and counteracting the deleterious effects of ADMA and SDMA. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impact of ADMA and SDMA on a wide range of human diseases is essential to the development of specific therapies against diseases related to ADMA and SDMA. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is considered a more sensitive indirect estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than creatinine (Cr).

The SDMA IA was validated for equine serum by comparison to liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) results and other methods. Symmetric dimethylarginine and Cr were compared by analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Median and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for LC-MS (10.0 [9.4, 10.2] μg/dL) and IA (9.7 [9.5, 10.0] μg/dL) SDMA concentrations were strongly correlated (R = .74, P < .001). Symmetric dimethylarginine was lower (P < .01) in Percherons and Belgians, than in Clydesdales. Median values and 95% CI for Cr were 1.3 (1.2, 1.4), 1.4 (1.3, 1.5), and 1.4 (1.3, 1.5) mg/dL (P = .06) for Percherons, Clydesdales, and Belgians, respectively.

1842,"('Combretastatin a4', 'Combretastatin a-4', 'Combrestatin a4', '(z)-2-methoxy-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)phenol', 'Combretastatin-a4')",Medical," Combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) is a water-soluble prodrug of combretastatin A4 (CA4). The vascular targeting agent CA4 is a microtubule depolymerizing agent. The mechanism of action of the drug is thought to involve the binding of CA4 to tubulin leading to cytoskeletal and then morphological changes in endothelial cells. These changes increase vascular permeability and disrupt tumor blood flow. In experimental tumors, anti-vascular effects are seen within minutes of drug administration and rapidly lead to extensive ischemic necrosis in areas that are often resistant to conventional anti-cancer treatments. Following single-dose administration a viable tumor rim typically remains from which tumor regrowth occurs. When given in combination with therapies targeted at the proliferating viable rim, enhanced tumor responses are seen and in some cases cures. Results from the first clinical trials have shown that CA4P monotherapy is safe and reduces tumor blood flow. There has been some promising demonstration of efficacy. CA4P in combination with cisplatin is also safe. Functional imaging studies have been used to aid the selection of doses for phase II trials. Both dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and positron emission tomography can measure the anti-vascular effects of CA4P in humans. This review describes the background to the development of CA4P, its proposed mechanism of action, the results from the first clinical trials with CA4P and the role of imaging techniques in its clinical development. We describe the use of natural product combretastatin A4 (CA4) as a versatile new payload for the construction of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Cetuximab conjugates consisting of CA4 derivatives were site-specially prepared by disulfide re-bridging approach using cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. These ADCs retained antigen binding and internalization efficiency and exhibited high potencies against cancer cell lines in vitro. The conjugates also demonstrated significant antitumor activities in EGFR-positive xenograft models without observed toxicities. CA4 appears to be a viable payload option for ADCs research and development. For many years, research on anticancer therapy has focussed almost exclusively on targeting cancer cells directly, to selectively kill them or restrict their growth. But limited advances in this strategy have led researchers to shift their attention to other potential targets. Active research is now on-going on targeting tumour stroma. Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) appear a promising class of anticancer drugs that are currently under investigation as a sole or combined therapy in human cancer patients. This article will briefly touch on the history and biology of combretastatin A4-phosphate (CA4P) as a typical example of VDAs and will concentrate on the side effects that can be expected when used in veterinary patients. Particularly, the pathogenesis of these side effects and how they may be prevented and/or treated will be discussed.

1843,"('Cholesterol', 'Cholesterin', 'Cholesteryl alcohol', 'Cholest-5-en-3beta-ol', 'Cholestrin')","Endogenous, Medical","Cholesterol is the principal sterol of all higher animals, distributed in body tissues, especially the brain and spinal cord, and in animal fats and oils. Cholesterol is biosynthesized by all animal cells and is an essential structural and signaling component of animal cell membranes. In vertebrates, hepatic cells typically produce the greatest amounts. In the brain, astrocytes produce cholesterol and transport it to neurons. It is absent among prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), although there are some exceptions, such as Mycoplasma, which require cholesterol for growth. Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acid and vitamin D. Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood, especially when bound to low-density lipoprotein (LDL, often referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. François Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769. In 1815, chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul named the compound ""cholesterine"". == Etymology == The word cholesterol comes from Ancient Greek chole- 'bile' and stereos 'solid', followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol. == Physiology == Cholesterol is essential for all animal life. While most cells are capable of synthesizing it, the majority of cholesterol is ingested or synthesized by hepatocytes and transported in the blood to peripheral cells. The levels of cholesterol in peripheral tissues are dictated by a balance of uptake and export. Under normal conditions, brain cholesterol is separate from peripheral cholesterol, i.e., the dietary and hepatic cholesterol do not cross the blood brain barrier. Rather, astrocytes produce and distribute cholesterol in the brain. De novo synthesis, both in astrocytes and hepatocytes, occurs by a complex 37-step process. This begins with the mevalonate or HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the target of statin drugs, which encompasses the first 18 steps. This is followed by 19 additional steps to convert the resulting lanosterol into cholesterol. A human male weighing 68 kg (150 lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000 mg) of cholesterol per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307 mg. Most ingested cholesterol is esterified, which causes it to be poorly absorbed by the gut. The body also compensates for absorption of ingested cholesterol by reducing its own cholesterol synthesis. For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. Surprisingly, in rats, blood cholesterol is inversely correlated with cholesterol consumption. The more cholesterol a rat eats the lower the blood cholesterol. During the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase. Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts. In larger quantities they produce phytosterols, chemically similar substances which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ≈200–300 mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700 mg/day. === Function === ==== Membranes ==== Cholesterol is present in varying degrees in all animal cell membranes, but is absent in prokaryotes. It is required to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group of each cholesterol molecule interacts with water molecules surrounding the membrane, as do the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids, while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move. The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a trans conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar. In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, hydrogen ions, and sodium ions. ==== Substrate presentation ==== Cholesterol regulates the biological process of substrate presentation and the enzymes that use substrate presentation as a mechanism of their activation. Phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is a well-defined example of an enzyme activated by substrate presentation. The enzyme is palmitoylated causing the enzyme to traffic to cholesterol dependent lipid domains sometimes called ""lipid rafts"". The substrate of phospholipase D is phosphatidylcholine (PC) which is unsaturated and is of low abundance in lipid rafts. PC localizes to the disordered region of the cell along with the polyunsaturated lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PLD2 has a PIP2 binding domain. When PIP2 concentration in the membrane increases, PLD2 leaves the cholesterol-dependent domains and binds to PIP2 where it then gains access to its substrate PC and commences catalysis based on substrate presentation. ==== Signaling ==== Cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell or oligodendrocyte membranes, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of myelin) is believed to be part of the basis for multiple sclerosis. Cholesterol binds to and affects the gating of a number of ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptor, and the inward-rectifier potassium channel. Cholesterol also activates the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor. The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be explained by the fact that cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body. Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone, muscle, and macrophages. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol. ==== As a chemical precursor ==== Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of vitamin D in the calcium metabolism and all steroid hormones, including the adrenal gland hormones cortisol and aldosterone, as well as the sex hormones progesterone, estrogens, and testosterone, and their derivatives. ==== Epidermis ==== The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis. It is composed of terminally differentiated and enucleated corneocytes that reside within a lipid matrix, like ""bricks and mortar."" Together with ceramides and free fatty acids, cholesterol forms the lipid mortar, a water-impermeable barrier that prevents evaporative water loss. As a rule of thumb, the epidermal lipid matrix is composed of an equimolar mixture of ceramides (≈50% by weight), cholesterol (≈25% by weight), and free fatty acids (≈15% by weight), with smaller quantities of other lipids also being present. Cholesterol sulfate reaches its highest concentration in the granular layer of the epidermis. Steroid sulfate sulfatase then decreases its concentration in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. The relative abundance of cholesterol sulfate in the epidermis varies across different body sites with the heel of the foot having the lowest concentration. === Metabolism === Cholesterol is recycled in the body. The liver excretes cholesterol into biliary fluids, which are then stored in the gallbladder, which then excretes them in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the small intestine back into the bloodstream. == Biosynthesis and regulation == === Biosynthesis === Almost all animal tissues synthesize cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. All animal cells (exceptions exist within the invertebrates) manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver and the intestines; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the brain, the adrenal glands, and the reproductive organs. Synthesis within the body starts with the mevalonate pathway where two molecules of acetyl CoA condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA. This is followed by a second condensation between acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA). This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Production of mevalonate is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for statins (a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs). Mevalonate is finally converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires ATP. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum. Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol. Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol via either of two pathways, the Bloch pathway, or the Kandutsch-Russell pathway. The final 19 steps to cholesterol contain NADPH and oxygen to help oxidize methyl groups for removal of carbons, mutases to move alkene groups, and NADH to help reduce ketones. Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries concerning some of the mechanisms and methods of regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. === Regulation of cholesterol synthesis === Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake of food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas a lower intake of food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and INSIG-1. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low. The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase in endogenous production of cholesterol. A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates the expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation. Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteasome. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low. === Plasma transport and regulation of absorption === As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in water, or hydrophilic. Because of this, it dissolves in blood at exceedingly small concentrations. To be transported effectively, cholesterol is instead packaged within lipoproteins, complex discoidal particles with exterior amphiphilic proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble. This allows it to travel through the blood via emulsification. Unbound cholesterol, being amphipathic, is transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle along with phospholipids and proteins. Cholesterol esters bound to fatty acid, on the other hand, are transported within the fatty hydrophobic core of the lipoprotein, along with triglyceride. There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some are carried as their native ""free"" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles. Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex apolipoproteins, typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. These surface receptors serve as unique molecular signatures, which then help determine fat distribution delivery throughout the body. Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport particles, contain apolipoprotein B-48, apolipoprotein C, and apolipoprotein E (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants and is taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver. VLDL particles are produced by the liver from triacylglycerol and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These particles contain apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E in their shells and can be degraded by lipoprotein lipase on the artery wall to IDL. This arterial wall cleavage allows absorption of triacylglycerol and increases the concentration of circulating cholesterol. IDL particles are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by HTGL and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become cholesterol-laden LDL particles. LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL particle shells contain just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, recognized by LDL receptors in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors concentrate in clathrin-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via endocytosis. These vesicles then fuse with a lysosome, where the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes. LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by SREBP, the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol de novo, according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL particles from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol. When this process becomes unregulated, LDL particles without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL particles are oxidized and taken up by macrophages, which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness). These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a lipoprotein) with ""bad"" cholesterol. HDL particles are thought to transport cholesterol back to the liver, either for excretion or for other tissues that synthesize hormones, in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Large numbers of HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes, whereas low numbers of HDL particles is associated with atheromatous disease progression in the arteries. === Metabolism, recycling and excretion === Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives called oxysterols. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. This finding became known as the ""oxysterol hypothesis"". Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription. In biochemical experiments, radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol, are used. These derivatives undergo degradation upon storage, and it is essential to purify cholesterol prior to use. Cholesterol can be purified using small Sephadex LH-20 columns. Cholesterol is oxidized by the liver into a variety of bile acids. These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, glucuronic acid, or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation, which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones (lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently). Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and it can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. Although cholesterol is a steroid generally associated with mammals, the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to completely degrade this molecule and contains a large number of genes that are regulated by its presence. Many of these cholesterol-regulated genes are homologues of fatty acid β-oxidation genes, but have evolved in such a way as to bind large steroid substrates like cholesterol. == Dietary sources == Animal fats are complex mixtures of triglycerides, with lesser amounts of both the phospholipids and cholesterol molecules from which all animal (and human) cell membranes are constructed. Since all animal cells manufacture cholesterol, all animal-based foods contain cholesterol in varying amounts. Major dietary sources of cholesterol include red meat, egg yolks and whole eggs, liver, kidney, giblets, fish oil, shellfish, and butter. Human breast milk also contains significant quantities of cholesterol. Plant cells synthesize cholesterol as a precursor for other compounds, such as phytosterols and steroidal glycoalkaloids, with cholesterol remaining in plant foods only in minor amounts or absent. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain phytosterols, which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines and reduce the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. A typical diet contributes on the order of 0.2 gram of phytosterols, which is not enough to have a significant impact on blocking cholesterol absorption. Phytosterols intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol. === Medical guidelines and recommendations === In 2015, the scientific advisory panel of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture for the 2015 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans dropped the previously recommended limit of consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 mg per day with a new recommendation to ""eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible"", thereby acknowledging an association between a diet low in cholesterol and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. A 2013 report by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommended focusing on healthy dietary patterns rather than specific cholesterol limits, as they are hard for clinicians and consumers to implement. They recommend the DASH and Mediterranean diet, which are low in cholesterol. A 2017 review by the American Heart Association recommends switching saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Some supplemental guidelines have recommended doses of phytosterols in the 1.6–3.0 grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA). A meta-analysis demonstrated a 12% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.1 grams per day. The benefits of a diet supplemented with phytosterols have also been questioned. == Clinical significance == === Hypercholesterolemia === According to the lipid hypothesis, elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood lead to atherosclerosis which may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Since higher blood LDL – especially higher LDL concentrations and smaller LDL particle size – contributes to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles, LDL particles are often termed ""bad cholesterol"". High concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheromas, offer protection and are commonly referred to as ""good cholesterol"". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body composition, medications, diet, and other factors. A 2007 study demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is larger in older people. Elevated levels of the lipoprotein fractions, LDL, IDL and VLDL, rather than the total cholesterol level, correlate with the extent and progress of atherosclerosis. Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates are high. A post hoc analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of ""good cholesterol"". About one in 250 individuals can have a genetic mutation for the LDL cholesterol receptor that causes them to have familial hypercholesterolemia. Inherited high cholesterol can also include genetic mutations in the PCSK9 gene and the gene for apolipoprotein B. Elevated cholesterol levels are treatable by a diet that reduces or eliminates saturated fat, and trans fats, often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents, such as statins, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, monoclonal antibody therapy (PCSK9 inhibitors), nicotinic acid derivatives or bile acid sequestrants. There are several international guidelines on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Human trials using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins, have repeatedly confirmed that changing lipoprotein transport patterns from unhealthy to healthier patterns significantly lowers cardiovascular disease event rates, even for people with cholesterol values currently considered low for adults. Studies have shown that reducing LDL cholesterol levels by about 38.7 mg/dL with the use of statins can reduce cardiovascular disease and stroke risk by about 21%. Studies have also found that statins reduce atheroma progression. As a result, people with a history of cardiovascular disease may derive benefit from statins irrespective of their cholesterol levels (total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L [193 mg/dL]), and in men without cardiovascular disease, there is benefit from lowering abnormally high cholesterol levels (""primary prevention""). Primary prevention in women was originally practiced only by extension of the findings in studies on men, since, in women, none of the large statin trials conducted prior to 2007 demonstrated a significant reduction in overall mortality or in cardiovascular endpoints. Meta-analyses have demonstrated significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, without significant heterogeneity by sex. The 1987 report of National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panels suggests the total blood cholesterol level should be: < 200 mg/dL normal blood cholesterol, 200–239 mg/dL borderline-high, > 240 mg/dL high cholesterol. The American Heart Association provides a similar set of guidelines for total (fasting) blood cholesterol levels and risk for heart disease: Statins are effective in lowering LDL cholesterol and widely used for primary prevention in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as in secondary prevention for those who have developed cardiovascular disease. The average global mean total Cholesterol for humans has remained at about 4.6 mmol/L (178 mg/dL) for men and women, both crude and age standardized, for nearly 40 years from 1980 to 2018, with some regional variations and reduction of total Cholesterol in Western nations. More current testing methods determine LDL (""bad"") and HDL (""good"") cholesterol separately, allowing cholesterol analysis to be more nuanced. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a variant): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400 mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400 mg/dL. In the Framingham Heart Study, each 10 mg/dL (0.6 mmol/L) increase in total cholesterol levels increased 30-year overall mortality by 5% and CVD mortality by 9%. While subjects over the age of 50 had an 11% increase in overall mortality, and a 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1 mg/dL (0.06 mmol/L) year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to a different correlation, whereby the disease itself increases risk of death, as well as changes a myriad of factors, such as weight loss and the inability to eat, which lower serum cholesterol. This effect was also shown in men of all ages and women over 50 in the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme. These groups were more likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases with very low total cholesterol, of 186 mg/dL (10.3 mmol/L) and lower. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a marker for frailty occurring with age. === Hypocholesterolemia === Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism, or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor, may result in hypocholesterolemia. === Testing === The American Heart Association recommends testing cholesterol every 4–6 years for people aged 20 years or older. A separate set of American Heart Association guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that people taking statin medications should have their cholesterol tested 4–12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3–12 months thereafter. For men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65, a cholesterol test should occur every 1–2 years, and for seniors over age 65, an annual test should be performed. A blood sample after 12-hours of fasting is taken by a healthcare professional from an arm vein to measure a lipid profile for a) total cholesterol, b) HDL cholesterol, c) LDL cholesterol, and d) triglycerides. Results may be expressed as ""calculated"", indicating a calculation of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. Cholesterol is tested to determine for ""normal"" or ""desirable"" levels if a person has a total cholesterol of 5.2 mmol/L or less (200 mg/dL), an HDL value of more than 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL, ""the higher, the better""), an LDL value of less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and a triglycerides level of less than 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL). Blood cholesterol in people with lifestyle, aging, or cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, family history of coronary artery disease, or angina, are evaluated at different levels. == Interactive pathway map == Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == Cholesteric liquid crystals == Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the cholesteric liquid crystalline phase. The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a chiral nematic phase, and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in liquid-crystal display thermometers and in temperature-sensitive paints. == Stereoisomers == Cholesterol has 256 stereoisomers that arise from its eight stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers have biochemical significance (nat-cholesterol and ent-cholesterol, for natural and enantiomer, respectively), and only one occurs naturally (nat-cholesterol). == Additional images == == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Cholesterol at Wikimedia Commons",Cholesterin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.00012511172099038959), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.438573680294212e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.004914585035294294), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.8954096958623268e-05), ('OUS', -2.145764938177308e-06), (',', -0.01815756969153881), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0005087750032544136), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01818554848432541)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.842555426876061e-06), (' FOOD', -0.00033546582562848926)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/cholesterol?utm_source=openai), [chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB7383339.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=226, start_index=33, title='Cholesterol | Chemical Compound | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/cholesterol?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=226, start_index=33, title='Cholesterol | 57-88-5', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB7383339.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

1845,"('Trihexyphenidyl (hydrochloride)', 'Trihexyphenidyl', 'Benzhexol', 'Triphenidyl', 'Parkinane retard')",Medical,"Trihexyphenidyl (THP, benzhexol, trihex, marketed as Artane and others) is an antispasmodic drug used to treat stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. It is an agent of the antimuscarinic class and is often used in management of Parkinson's disease. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's in the US in 2003. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Trihexyphenidyl is used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease in mono and combination therapy. It is active in postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic forms. The drug is also commonly used to treat extrapyramidal side effects occurring during antipsychotic treatment. It reduces the frequency and duration of oculogyric crises as well as of dyskinetic movements and spastic contractions. Trihexyphenidyl may improve psychotic depression and mental inertia frequently associated with Parkinson's disease and symptomatic problems caused by antipsychotic treatment. The drug cannot cure Parkinson's disease, but may provide substantial alleviation of symptoms. An estimated 50–75% of people with Parkinson's disease will react positively and experience a 20–30% symptomatic improvement. To increase therapeutic activity, trihexyphenidyl is often given concomitantly with levodopa or other antimuscarinic or antihistaminic (e.g. diphenhydramine) agents. Combination therapy with dopamine agonists such as cabergoline is also possible. This is often termed a 'multidimensional approach'. Trihexyphenidyl has also been prescribed for essential tremor and akathisia. In pediatrics, it has been used for children with dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and to control drooling. In organophosphate poisoning, trihexyphenidyl is a more effective antidote than atropine to counteract the cholinergic crisis, seizures, and neuropathology. Equivocal preliminary results from small studies exist for other dyskinesias, Huntington's chorea, Spasmodic torticollis. == Contraindications == Contraindications include according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration Australia from 2022: Hypersensitivity to trihexyphenidyl Narrow angle glaucoma Ileus (disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine) Caution: People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous tachycardia People under 18 years of age should not be treated due to a lack of clinical experience. People should allow a period to adjust to the dose when first starting trihexyphenidyl and when the dose has been increased or added to a regimen with other drugs because acute somnolence and accumulated fatigue can make it particularly dangerous to operate an automobile, heavy machinery etc. == Adverse effects == Dose-dependent side effects are frequent, but typically lessen over time as the body adapts to the medication. All of the following symptoms considered, Artane has been shown to dramatically and consistently improve neurologic defects in people aged 16–86 over the course of five years. People who are older or who have psychiatric conditions may become confused or develop delirium. Side effects include but are not limited to: Central nervous system: drowsiness, vertigo, headache, and dizziness are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, anxiety, delirium, and confusion are noted. Trihexyphenidyl may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoric effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered (REM sleep depression). Trihexyphenidyl may lower the seizure-threshold. Peripheral side effects: dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and constipation are frequent. Tachycardia or heart palpitations (fast heart rate) may be noted. Allergic reactions are rare, but may occur. Many of these peripheral symptoms, especially considering an acute increase in anxiety with various physical complaints, as well as evidence of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are indicative of withdrawal, especially in people with psychiatric conditions Eyes: trihexyphenidyl causes mydriasis with or without photophobia. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma or cause blurred vision. Tolerance may develop during therapy which requires dose adjustments. Striated musculature and weight gain. Trihexyphenidyl is a pregnancy category C drug. It is advised to only use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. == Overdose == Trihexyphenidyl and other antiparkinsonian drugs are known to be substances of abuse. This is true both in abusers of other substances and in chronic schizophrenics, the latter being infrequent abusers of other drugs. Overdose mimics an atropine intoxication with dryness of mucous membranes, red face, bowel and bladder paralysis, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central nervous system consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is physostigmine, which combines a peripheral and a central action. Carbachol can be used to treat atonic bowel and bladder. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets. A case report of 24 hour long arrhythmia was treated with verapamil. Excessive myoclonus can be complicated by rhabdomyolysis; in one case risk was increased due to concomitant use of risperidone. == Interactions == Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, antihistamines, TCAs) : Side effects of trihexyphenidyl may be increased. Quinidine : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction). Antipsychotics : Long term use of trihexyphenidyl may mask or increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Pethidine (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased. Metoclopramide : Action of metoclopramide is decreased. Alcohol : Risk of serious intoxication. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic. It is specifically an antimuscarinic and acts as a non-selective antagonist of all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. However, its antagonistic activity is much stronger at the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M4 receptors, and it can be described as selective for these receptors. The exact mechanism of action in parkinsonian syndromes is not precisely understood, but it is known that trihexyphenidyl blocks efferent impulses in parasympathetically innervated structures like smooth muscles (spasmolytic activity), salivary glands, and eyes (mydriasis). In higher doses direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may contribute. In very high doses central toxicity as seen in atropine overdose is noted. It possibly also binds to dopamine receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Trihexyphenidyl is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of action is within 1 hour after oral dosing. The peak activity is noted after 2 to 3 hours. The duration of action of one single dose is 6 to 12 hours in a dose dependent manner. It is excreted in the urine, probably as unchanged drug. More precise data in animals and humans have so far not been determined. == History == Trihexyphenidyl has been clinically relevant in trials pertaining to Parkinson's disease since 1949. In the US, the FDA approved Artane, or its generic form Trihexyphenidyl HCL, only on June 25, 2003 for the clinical use of all types of parkinsonism. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === The neurologist Oliver Sacks reported using the drug recreationally in the 1960s. He recalled taking ""a large dose"" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's. More recounts of Dr. Sacks' experiences — including experimentation with mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and probably DMT — have been compared in his book Hallucinations. During the 1970s, trihexyphenidyl (trade name Parkan) was the most popular recreationally used prescription drug in Hungary. In a 2008 news report, trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, among other prescription drugs. The report states that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress reaction. Although that may be the case for some, others used Artane as a substitute or more intense version of LSD. This was especially prevalent in the 1960s, according to a report in ""The New Yorker"". Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence. It is still diverted from its primary use, in combination with other drugs, on the Réunion island (France). == Chemistry == Trihexyphenidyl can be synthesized in two ways, one linear and one convergent synthesis. In the first way, the initial 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is synthesized in turn by the aminomethylation of acetophenone using paraformaldehyde and piperidine in a Mannich reaction. In the second step the 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is reacted with cyclohexylmagnesium bromide in a Grignard reaction. === Stereochemistry === Trihexyphenidyl has a chiral center and two enantiomers. Medications are racemates. == See also == Biperiden (bicyclic ring) Cycrimine (cyclopentanyl instead of cyclohexanyl) Gamfexine Procyclidine == References == This article incorporates public domain material from Toxnet:Trihexyphenidyl.

Saturation analysis of [3H]-SB-269970 binding to mouse forebrain, rat cortex, pig cortex, marmoset cortex and human thalamus membranes was consistent with labelling a homogenous population of binding sites in each tissue. K(D) values for [3H]-SB-269970 binding in these tissues ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 nM, being similar to those reported for the human cloned and guinea pig cortex 5-HT7 receptors (1.3 and 1.7 nM, respectively). Bmax values for [3H]-SB-269970 binding to the mouse, rat, pig, marmoset and human brain membranes were 20, 30, 31, 14 and 68 fmoles x mg x protein(-1), respectively. For each species the profile of inhibition of [3H]-SB-269970 binding, using a number of 5-HT7 receptor agonists and antagonists, correlated well with that reported for the human cloned 5-HT7(a) receptor (correlation coefficients were 0.95, 0.94, 0.92, 0.95, 0.97 versus the mouse, rat, pig, marmoset and human tissues, respectively). In conclusion, [3H]-SB-269970 has been shown to radiolabel 5-HT7 receptors in rodent, pig and primate brain and represents a valuable tool with which to further characterise the distribution and function of 5-HT7 receptors in native tissues and elucidate their potential role in disease states. Recently, studies have demonstrated that serotonin type 7 receptors (5-HT7) have conflincting effects on neuronal excitability in different brain regions. However, the effect of 5-HT7 on seizures has not been exactly elucidated yet. Therefore, our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT7 antagonist SB-269970 on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) induced fully kindled rats. In the study, 32 adult male Wistar Albino rats (weighing 220-260 g) were used. Rats were injected with PTZ (35 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every other day to generate kindling model. 5-CT (0.1 mg/kg) and SB-269970 (1 mg/kg) were administered 30 min before acute seizure induction with PTZ (35 mg/kg). Seizure stages were determined according to the Racine scale. After electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings of seizure-induced rats were obtained, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation. The hippocampal GABA levels were determined by ELISA kit and the number of c-Fos positive neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 and CA3 areas were measured by immunohistochemical method. The results showed that SB-269970 reduced the number of spikes, percent seizure duration and duration of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (dGTCS), while increasing the onset time of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (oGTCS). The hippocampal GABA levels were significantly increased in the SB-269970 group compared with the PTZ group. In addition, SB-269970 reduced the number of c-Fos positive cells in hippocampal CA1 area. 5-HT7 antagonist SB-269970 displays anticonvulsant effects on PTZ-induced seizures in fully kindled rats and these effects may be related to GABAergic activity in the hippocampus. The novel 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, SB-269970-A, potently displaced [(3)H]-5-CT from human 5-HT(7(a)) (pK(i) 8.9+/-0.1) and 5-HT(7) receptors in guinea-pig cortex (pK(i) 8.3+/-0.2). 5-CT stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in 5-HT(7(a))/HEK293 membranes (pEC(50) 7.5+/-0.1) and SB-269970-A (0.03 - 1 microM) inhibited the 5-CT concentration-response with no significant alteration in the maximal response. The pA(2) (8.5+/-0.2) for SB-269970-A agreed well with the pK(i) determined from [(3)H]-5-CT binding studies. 5-CT-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in guinea-pig hippocampal membranes (pEC(50) of 8.4+/-0.2) was inhibited by SB-269970-A (0.3 microM) with a pK(B) (8.3+/-0.1) in good agreement with its antagonist potency at the human cloned 5-HT(7(a)) receptor and its binding affinity at guinea-pig cortical membranes. 5-HT(7) receptor mRNA was highly expressed in human hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus and testis. SB-269970-A was CNS penetrant (steady-state brain : blood ratio of ca. 0.83 : 1 in rats) but was rapidly cleared from the blood (CLb=ca. 140 ml min(-1) kg(-1)). Following a single dose (3 mg kg(-1)) SB-269970 was detectable in rat brain at 30 (87 nM) and 60 min (58 nM). In guinea-pigs, brain levels averaged 31 and 51 nM respectively at 30 and 60 min after dosing, although the compound was undetectable in one of the three animals tested. 5-CT (0.3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) induced hypothermia in guinea-pigs was blocked by SB-269970-A (ED(50) 2.96 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and the non-selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist metergoline (0.3 - 3 mg kg(-1) s.c.), suggesting a role for 5-HT(7) receptor stimulation in 5-CT induced hypothermia in guinea-pigs.

Like theophylline, it is a xanthine derivative. == Medical uses == Doxophylline is used to treat chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. In animal and human studies, it has shown similar efficacy to theophylline but with significantly fewer side effects. In February 2014, the US FDA granted an orphan drug designation to doxofylline for the treatment of bronchiectasis following the submission of an application by Alitair Pharmaceuticals, in May 2013. == Pharmacology == Unlike other xanthines, doxofylline lacks any significant affinity for adenosine receptors and does not produce stimulant effects. This suggests that its antiasthmatic effects are mediated by another mechanism, perhaps its actions on phosphodiesterase. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, doxofylline importantly differs from theophylline also because it lacks the ability to interfere with the cytochrome enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4, thus preventing significant interaction with other drugs metabolized via these pathways in the liver. Concomitant treatment with certain other medications (including allopurinol, H2 receptor antagonists, lincosamide antibiotics, macrolide antibiotics, and propranolol) can decrease the hepatic clearance of doxofylline, which can result in increased serum levels of doxofylline. == Names == It is marketed under many brand names worldwide, including: Xiva, An Li Nuo Er, An Sai Ma, Ansimar, Asima, Bestofyline, Chuan Ning, D-Fyal, Dilatair, Doxiba, Doxiva, Doxobid, Doxobron, Doxofilina, Doxofillina, Doxofyllin, Doxoll, Doxophylline, Doxovent, Doxyjohn, Fei Te Ai Si, Fixolin, Jian Fang Neng, Lang Ming, Lv Meng, Mai Ping Xi, Maxivent, Mucosma, Na De Lai, Phylex, Phyllin, Puroxan, Rexipin, Shu Zhi, Shuai An, Shuweixin, Suo Di, Suo Ji, Suo Li An, Xi Si Nuo, Xin Qian Ping, Xin Xi Ping, Yi Suo, and Yili.

It thereby decreases the urgency to urinate. It is not known whether this selectivity for the M3 receptor translates into any clinical advantage when treating symptoms of overactive bladder syndrome. Although it is said to be selective for the M3 receptor, darifenacin is also said to antagonize the other four muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. == References == == External links == ""Darifenacin"".

1850,"('Albendazole', 'Albenza', 'Eskazole', 'Valbazen', 'Zentel')",Medical,"Albendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelmintic and antiprotozoal agent of the benzimidazole type. It is used for the treatment of a variety of intestinal parasite infections, including ascariasis, pinworm infection, hookworm infection, trichuriasis, strongyloidiasis, taeniasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, cutaneous larva migrans, giardiasis, and gnathostomiasis, among other diseases. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Rare but potentially serious side effects include bone marrow suppression which usually improves on discontinuing the medication. Liver inflammation has been reported and those with prior liver problems are at greater risk. It is pregnancy category D in Australia, meaning it may cause harm if taken by pregnant women. Albendazole was developed in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Albendazole is available in a fixed-dose combination with ivermectin. == Medical uses == Albendazole is an effective treatment for: Flatworms Clonorchiasis Fasciolosis Opisthorchiasis Cestodes (tapeworms), as an alternative to praziquantel or niclosamide for adult beef tapeworms and as an alternative to praziquantel for pork tapeworms. It is also given for infections by T. crassiceps. Though praziquantel is often better at treating tapeworm infections, albendazole is used more often in endemic countries due to being cheaper and having a broader spectrum. Cysticercosis (especially neurocysticercosis), which is caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm (i.e. albendazole is the drug of choice for larval pork tapeworms, but not adult pork tapeworms). Old cysts are not affected. Echinococcosis of the liver, lung, and peritoneum (caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, or of the alveoli (caused by E. multilocularis) when surgical excision is not possible. Alveolar and cystic echinococcosis may require lifelong treatment with albendazole, which only prevents the parasites from growing and reproducing rather than killing them. Nematodes Anatrichosomiasis Angiostrongyliasis Anisakiasis Ascariasis, which can be cured with a single dose of albendazole. Baylisascariasis, caused by the raccoon roundworm. Albendazole can achieve good results (95–100% efficacy after a 10-day course of treatment) if treatment is initiated within 72 hours of ingestion of the egg-containing raccoon feces. Corticosteroids are sometimes added in cases of eye and CNS infections. Pinworm infection Filariasis; since albendazole's disintegration of the microfilariae (""pre-larva"") can cause an allergic reaction, antihistamines or corticosteroids are sometimes added to treatment. In cases of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi, albendazole is sometimes given as an adjunct to ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine in order to suppress microfilaremia. It can also be given for Loa loa filariasis as an adjunct or replacement to diethylcarbamazine. Albendazole has an embryotoxic effect on Loa loa adults and thus slowly reduces microfilaremia. Gnathostomiasis when caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum. Albendazole has a similar effectiveness to ivermectin in these cases, though it needs to be given for 21 days rather than the 2 days needed for ivermectin. Gongylonemiasis Hepatic capillariasis caused by Capillaria hepatica Hookworm infections, including cutaneous larva migrans caused by hookworms of genus Ancylostoma. A single dose of albendazole is sufficient to treat intestinal infestations by A. duodenale or Necator americanus. Intestinal capillariasis, as an alternative to mebendazole Mansonelliasis when caused by Mansonella perstans. Albendazole is effective against adult worms but not against the immature microfilariae. Oesophagostomumiasis, when caused by Oesophagostomum bifurcum Strongyloidiasis, as an alternative to ivermectin or thiabendazole. Albendazole can be given with diethylcarbamazine to lower microfilaremia levels. Toxocariasis, also called ""visceral larva migrans"", when caused by the dog roundworm Toxocara canis or cat roundworm T. catis. Corticosteroids can be added in severe cases, and surgery might be required to repair secondary damage. Trichinosis, when caused by Trichinella spiralis or T. pseudospiralis. Albendazole has a similar efficacy to thiabendazole, but fewer side effects. It works best when given early, acting on the adult worms in the intestine before they generate larva that can penetrate the muscle and cause a more widespread infection. Corticosteroids are sometimes added on to prevent inflammation caused by dying larva. Trichostrongyliasis, as an alternative to pyrantel pamoate. A single dose is sufficient for treatment. Trichuriasis (whipworm infection), sometimes considered as an alternative to mebendazole and sometimes considered to be the drug of choice. Only a single dose of albendazole is needed. It can also be given with ivermectin. Giardiasis, as an alternative or adjunct to metronidazole, especially in children Microsporidiosis, including ocular microsporidiosis caused by Encephalitozoon hellem or E. cuniculi, when combined with topical fumagillin Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, when caused by the amoeba Balamuthia mandrillaris, in combination with miltefosine and fluconazole Arthropods Crusted scabies, when combined with topical crotamiton and salicylic acid Head lice infestation, though ivermectin is much better Intestinal myiasis Though albendazole is effective in treating many diseases, it is only FDA-approved for treating hydatid disease caused by dog tapeworm larvae and neurocysticercosis caused by pork tapeworm larvae. === Ivermectin/albendazole === When co-administered, ivermectin and albendazole act in synergy. Ivermectin targets the parasite's nervous and muscular systems, causing paralysis, while albendazole disrupts the parasite's metabolism and energy production. This dual approach immobilizes and kills the parasite and improves the treatment's effectiveness. In January 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive scientific opinion for ivermectin/albendazole for the treatment of infections caused by several types of worm parasites including lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for use in people aged five years of age or older, for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminth infections, caused by different types of intestinal parasitic worms, which are spread through soil contaminated by human feces in areas with poor sanitation. Among the worms responsible for these diseases are hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus), roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms (Trichuris trichiura) and a roundworm called Strongyloides stercoralis. Ivermectin/albendazole is also indicated for the treatment of microfilaraemia (the presence of worm larvae in the blood) in people with lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease commonly known as elephantiasis, which impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for the treatment of cases of lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, a parasite which is responsible for 90% of cases worldwide. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity to the benzimidazole class of compounds contraindicates its use. == Side effects == The most common side effects of albendazole are experienced by over 10% of people and include headache and abnormal liver function. Elevation of liver enzymes occurs in 16% of patients receiving treatment specifically for hydatid disease and goes away when treatment ends. Liver enzymes usually increase to two to four times the normal levels (a mild to moderate increase). An estimated 1–10% of people experience abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or vertigo, increased intracranial pressure, meningeal signs, temporary hair loss, and fever. The headache, nausea, and vomiting are thought to be caused by the sudden destruction of cysticerci (tapeworm larvae), which causes acute inflammation. Fewer than 1% of people get hypersensitivity reactions such as rashes and hives, leukopenias (drop in white blood cell levels) such as agranulocytosis and granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count), pancytopenia (drop in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets), hepatitis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, irreversible bone marrow suppression, and aplastic anemia. Side effects can be different when treating for hydatid disease versus neurocysticercosis: for example, those being treated for the former are more likely to experience elevated liver enzymes and abdominal pain, while those being treated for the latter are more likely to experience headache. Treating hydatid disease can also unmask undiagnosed neurocysticercosis. People receiving albendazole for the treatment of neurocysticercosis can have neurological side effects such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and focal signs caused by the inflammatory reaction that occurs when parasites in the brain are killed. Steroids and anticonvulsants are often given with albendazole when treating neurocysticercosis to avoid these effects. Those being treated for retinal neurocysticercosis can face retinal damage if they are not first checked for ocular cysticeri, since changes to existing lesions in the eye by albendazole can cause permanent blindness. === Pregnancy === Albendazole is a pregnancy class D drug in Australia. It is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy, and should be avoided up to one month before conception. While studies in pregnant rats and rabbits have shown albendazole to be teratogenic, albendazole has been found to be safe in humans during the second and third trimesters. It can, however, possibly cause infantile eczema when given during pregnancy. In pregnant dogs, albendazole use has led to puppies with reduced weight and with cleft palates. Birds have lower rates of laying eggs and hatching when given albendazole. Albendazole sulfoxide is secreted into breast milk at around 1.5% of the maternal dose, though oral absorption is poor enough that it is unlikely to affect nursing infants. == Overdose == Because of its low solubility, albendazole often cannot be absorbed in high enough quantities to be toxic. The oral LD50 of albendazole in rats was found to be 2,500 mg/kg. It takes 20 times the normal dose to kill a sheep, and 30 times the normal dose to kill cattle. Overdose affects the liver, testicles, and gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) the most. It can manifest with lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal cramps, dizziness, convulsions, and sleepiness. There is no specified antidote. == Interactions == The antiepileptics carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital lower the plasma concentration and half-life of albendazole sulfoxide's R(+) enantiomer. The antacid cimetidine heightens serum albendazole concentrations, increases the half-life of albendazole, and doubles albendazole sulfoxide levels in bile. It was originally thought to work by increasing albendazole bioavailability directly; however, it is now known that cimetidine inhibits the breakdown of albendazole sulfoxide by interfering with CYP3A4. The half-life of albendazole sulfoxide thus increases from 7.4 hours to 19 hours. This might be a helpful interaction on more severe cases, because it boosts the potency of albendazole. Paradoxically, cimetidine also inhibits the absorption of albendazole by reducing gastric acidity. Several other interactions exist. Corticosteroids increase the steady-state plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide; dexamethasone, for example, can increase the concentration by 56% by inhibiting the elimination of albendazole sulfoxide. The anti-parasitic praziquantel increases the maximum plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide by 50%, and the anti-parasitic levamisole increases the AUC (total drug exposure) by 75%. Grapefruit inhibits the metabolism of albendazole within the intestinal mucosa. Finally, long-term administration of the antiretroviral ritonavir, which works as a CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreases the maximum concentration of albendazole in the plasma as well as the AUC. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === As a vermicide, albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of β-tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules (it binds much better to the β-tubulin of parasites than that of mammals). Albendazole leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Albendazole also prevents the formation of spindle fibers needed for cell division, which in turn blocks egg production and development; existing eggs are prevented from hatching. Cell motility, maintenance of cell shape, and intracellular transport are also disrupted. At higher concentrations, it disrupts the helminths' metabolic pathways by inhibiting metabolic enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, with inhibition of the latter leading to less energy produced by the Krebs cycle. Due to diminished ATP production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies. Some parasites have evolved some resistance to albendazole by having a different set of amino acids constitute β-tubulin, decreasing the binding affinity of albendazole. Some parasites (especially filarial nematodes) live in symbiosis with Wolbachia, a type of intracellular parasite bacteria. In such cases the Wolbachia are necessary to the survival of the parasitic worms. Elimination of Wolbachia from these filarial nematodes generally results in either death or sterility of the host nematode. === Pharmacokinetics === To target intestinal parasites, which is the most common indication for prescription, albendazole is taken on an empty stomach to stay within the gut. Oral absorption of albendazole varies among species, with 1–5% of the drug being successfully absorbed in humans, 20–30% in rats, and 50% in cattle. The absorption also largely depends on gastric pH. People have varying levels of gastric pHs on empty stomachs, and thus absorption from one person to another can vary wildly when taken without food. Generally, the absorption in the GI tract is poor due to albendazole's low solubility in water. It is, however, better absorbed than other benzimidazole carbamates. Food stimulates gastric acid secretion, lowering the pH and making albendazole more soluble and thus more easily absorbed. Oral absorption is especially increased with a fatty meal, as albendazole dissolves better in lipids, allowing it to cross the lipid barrier created by the mucus surface of the GI tract. Absorption is also affected by how much of the albendazole is degraded within the small intestine by metabolic enzymes in the villi. The pharmacokinetics of albendazole differ slightly between men and women: women have a lower oral clearance and volume of distribution, while men have a lower serum peak concentration. Albendazole undergoes very fast first-pass metabolism in all species, such that the unchanged drug is undetectable in plasma. Most of it is oxidized into albendazole sulfoxide (also known as ricobendazole and albendazole oxide) in the liver by cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs) and a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was discovered later. In humans, the cytochrome P450 oxidases are thought to include CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, while those in the rats are thought to be CYP2C6 and CYP2A1. Oxidation to albendazole sulfoxide by FMO produces R(+) enantiomers, while oxidation the cytochromes and by some enzymes in the gut epithelium produce S(−). Different species produce the R(+) and S(−) enantiomers in different quantities; humans, dogs, and most other species produce the R(+) enantiomer more (with the human AUC ratio being 80:20). Compared to the S(−) enantiomer, the R(+) has greater pharmacological activity, lasts longer in the bloodstream, is found in higher concentrations in the infected host tissues, and is found in higher concentrations within the parasites themselves. Some albendazole is also converted to hydroxyalbendazole, mainly by CYP2J2. For systemic parasites, albendazole acts as a prodrug, while albendazole sulfoxide reaches systemic circulation and acts as the real antihelminthic. Albendazole sulfoxide is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the cerebrospinal fluid at 43% of plasma concentrations; its ability to enter the central nervous system allows it to treat neurocysticercosis. Albendazole sulfoxide is converted to the inactive albendazole sulfone by cytochrome P450 oxidases, thought to include CYP3A4 or CYP2C. Other inactive metabolites include: 2-aminosulfone, ω-hydroxysulfone, and β-hydroxysulfone. The major final metabolites that are excreted by humans are: methyl [5-(propylsulfonyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)] carbamate, methyl [6-hydroxy 5-(n-propylsulfonyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)] carbamate, methyl [5-(n-propylsulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)] carbamate, 5-(n-propylsulfonyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl amine, and 5-(n-propysulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl amine. There are also some minor hydroxylated sulfated or glucuronidated derivatives. No unchanged albendazole is excreted, as it is metabolized too quickly. In humans, the metabolites are excreted mostly in bile, with only a small amount being excreted in urine (less than 1%) and feces. In ruminants, 60–70% of the metabolites are excreted in urine. Like all benzimidazoles, albendazole has no residual effect, and thus protects poorly against reinfestations. == History == Albendazole, patented in 1975, was invented by Robert J. Gyurik and Vassilios J. Theodorides and assigned to SmithKline Corporation. It was introduced in 1977 as an antihelminthic for sheep in Australia, and was registered for human use in 1982. == Society and culture == === Economics === The pharmaceutical company Amedra increased the price after purchasing the rights to the drug, instead of lowering it as generics are predicted to do, drawing criticism from patients' rights advocates. In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline donated 763 million albendazole tablets for the treatment and prevention of parasitic infections in developing countries, bringing the total to over 4 billion tablets donated since 1998. === Brand names === Brand names include: Albenza, Alworm, Andazol, Eskazole, Noworm, Zentel, Alben-G, ABZ, Cidazole, Wormnil etc. == Research == Albendazole and related compounds or metabolites like albendazole sulfone (ALB-SO2) exhibit antibacterial effects via an unknown, possibly FtsZ-related, mechanism. It inhibits division of Wolbachia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, turning them into a long ""filament"" shape as they grow and fail to divide. Since Brugia malayi relies on symbiotic Wolbachia, this would mean that albendazole is targeting both the worm and its essential symbioant. == Veterinary use == Albendazole is mainly used in cattle and sheep, but has found some use in cats and dogs as well; it is also used in ratite birds for flagellate parasites and tapeworms. It is also used off-label to treat endoparasites in goats and pigs. Albendazole has been used as an antihelminthic and for control of flukes in a variety of animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, swine, camels, dogs, cats, elephants, poultry, and others. Side effects include anorexia in dogs and lethargy, depression, and anorexia in cats, with more than 10% of dogs and cats having anorexia. Of dogs and cats, 1–10% experience elevated liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Less than 1% experience neutropenia or aplastic anemia, though these require a use of at least 5 days. While it is also associated with bone marrow suppression and toxicity in cats and dogs at high doses, albendazole has a higher margin of safety in other species. Thus, it is usually only prescribed in cats and dogs when an infection is present that is resistant to the commonly prescribed metronidazole and fenbendazole. It is extensively used for ruminant livestock in Latin America. It is marketed for this purpose by Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health) in numerous countries (including the United States and Canada) as Valbazen in oral suspension and paste formulations; by Interchemie in the Netherlands and elsewhere as Albenol-100; by Channelle Animal Health Ltd. in the United Kingdom as Albex; and by Ravensdown in New Zealand (as Albendazole). Although most formulations are administered orally, Ricomax (ricobendazole, or albendazole sulfoxide) is administered by subcutaneous injection. Albendazole has greater bioavailability in ruminants: some albendazole sulfoxide, when released back into the rumen, is reduced to albendazole by the resident microbiota, with a preference of the (+) enantiomer being the substrate. Cats and dogs, having no rumen reservoir, sometimes need higher or more frequent doses as compared to ruminants. In dogs, albendazole sulfoxide is detectable in the plasma for less than 12 hours, but in sheep and goats, it remains at measurable levels for around three days. === Meat === The limitations in early pregnancy are due to a limited period during which teratogenic effects may occur. Summarized research data relating to the durations of these preslaughter and early pregnancy periods when albendazole should not be administered are found in US FDA NADA 110-048 (cattle) and 140-934 (sheep). Some data and inferences regarding goats are found in US FDA Supplemental NADA 110-048 (approved 24 January 2008). Maximum residue limits (MRLs) for albendazole in food, adopted by the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius in 1993, are 5000, 5000, 100, and 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (μg/kg) for kidney, liver, fat, and muscle, respectively, and 100 μg/L for milk. For analysis purposes, MRLs of various nations may pertain to concentration of a marker substance which has been correlated with concentrations of the administered substance and its metabolized products. For example, in Canada, the marker substance specified by Health Canada is albendazole-2-aminosulfone, for which the MRL in liver of cattle is 200 μg/kg. There is a 27-day cattle withdrawal time for meat. == References ==",Zentel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00026603974401950836), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002498839981853962)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/zentel,https://www.drugs.com/otc/1283511/zentel.html,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/zentel ', [])"

It is formed from galactose by galactokinase.The improper metabolism of galactose-1-phosphate is a characteristic of galactosemia. The Leloir pathway is responsible for such metabolism of galactose and its intermediate, galactose-1-phosphate. Deficiency of enzymes found in this pathway can result in galactosemia; therefore, diagnosis of this genetic disorder occasionally involves measuring the concentration of these enzymes. One of such enzymes is galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a UDP-activator group from UDP-glucose to galactose-1-phosphate. Although the cause of enzyme deficiency in the Leloir pathway is still disputed amongst researchers, some studies suggest that protein misfolding of GALT, which may lead to an unfavorable conformational change that impacts its thermal stability and substrate-binding affinity, may play a role in the deficiency of GALT in Type 1 galactosemia.

To be utilized in cellular catabolism it must first be converted to glucose 6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase in a free equilibrium. One reason that cells form glucose 1-phosphate instead of glucose during glycogen breakdown is that the very polar phosphorylated glucose cannot leave the cell membrane and so is marked for intracellular catabolism. Phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency is known as glycogen storage disease type 14 (GSD XIV). === Anabolic === In glycogenesis, free glucose 1-phosphate can also react with UTP to form UDP-glucose, by using the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.

It is produced by inverting α-glucan phosphorylases including maltose phosphorylase, kojibiose phosphorylase and trehalose phosphorylase and is then converted into glucose 6-phosphate by β-phosphoglucomutase. == See also == Pentose phosphate pathway Gerty Cori == References ==",Cori ester,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -4.179569077678025e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0003806257154792547), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.2633979618549347), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.564294092939235e-05), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6933205127716064)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0007099286303855479)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_1-phosphate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=101, start_index=12, title='Glucose 1-phosphate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_1-phosphate?utm_source=openai')])"
1855,"('Impulsin', 'Palmitoylethanolamide', 'Palmidrol', 'N-(2-hydroxyethyl)hexadecanamide', 'Palmitoyl ethanolamide')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide, and lipid modulator. A main target of PEA is proposed to be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). PEA also has affinity to cannabinoid-like G-coupled receptors GPR55 and GPR119. PEA cannot strictly be considered a classic endocannabinoid because it lacks affinity for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. == Early and recent studies == In 1975, Czech physicians described the results of a clinical trial looking at joint pain, where the analgesic action of aspirin versus PEA was tested; both drugs were reported to enhance joint movements and decrease pain. In 1970 the drug manufacturer Spofa in Czechoslovakia introduced Impulsin, a tablet dose of PEA, for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory infections. In Spain, the company Almirall introduced Palmidrol in tablet and suspension forms in 1976, for the same indications. In the mid-1990s, the relationship between anandamide and PEA was described; the expression of mast cell receptors sensitive to the two molecules was demonstrated by Levi-Montalcini and coworkers. During this period, more insight into the functions of endogenous fatty acid derivatives emerged, and compounds such as oleamide, palmitoylethanolamide, 2-lineoylglycerol and 2-palmitoylglycerol were explored for their capacity to modulate pain sensitivity and inflammation via what at that time was thought to be the endocannabinoid signalling pathway. Primary reports also have provided evidence that PEA downregulates hyperactive mast cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that it alleviates pain elicited in mouse models. PEA and related compounds such as anandamide also seem to have synergistic effects in models of pain and analgesia. == Animal models == In a variety of animal models, PEA seems to have some promise; researchers have been able to demonstrate relevant clinical efficacy in a variety of disorders, from multiple sclerosis to neuropathic pain. In the mouse forced swimming test, palmitoylethanolamide was comparable to fluoxetine for depression. An Italian study published in 2011 found that PEA reduced the raised intraocular pressure of glaucoma. In a spinal trauma model, PEA reduced the resulting neurological deficit via the reduction of mast cell infiltration and activation. PEA in this model also reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its activity as an inhibitor of inflammation counteracts reactive astrogliosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide, in a model relevant for neurodegeneration, probably via the PPAR-α mechanism of action. In models of stroke and other CNS trauma, PEA exerted neuroprotective properties. == Animal models of chronic pain and inflammation == Chronic pain and neuropathic pain are indications for which there is high unmet need in the clinic. PEA has been tested in a variety of animal models for chronic and neuropathic pain, because cannabinoids, such as THC, have been proven to be effective in neuropathic pain states. The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of PEA in two models of acute and persistent pain seemed to be explained at least partly via the de novo neurosteroid synthesis. In chronic granulomatous pain and inflammation model, PEA could prevent nerve formation and sprouting, mechanical allodynia, and PEA inhibited dorsal root ganglia activation, which is a hallmark for winding up in neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of PEA as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory molecule is probably based on different aspects. PEA inhibits the release of both preformed and newly synthesised mast cell mediators, such as histamine and TNF-alpha. PEA, as well as its analogue adelmidrol (di-amide derivative of azelaic acid), can both down-regulate mast cells. PEA reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prevents IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the latter related to PEA as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist. In 2012 it became clear that PEA can also reduce reperfusion injury and the negative impact of shock on various outcome parameters, such as renal dysfunction, ischemic injury and inflammation, most probably via the PPAR-alpha pathway. Studies have shown that PEA activates PPAR-alpha and TRPV1 receptors that control inflammation and the sensation of pain. Among the reperfusion and inflammation markers measured PEA could reduce the increase in creatinine, γGT, AST, nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; kidney MPO activity and MDA levels, nitrotyrosine, PAR and adhesion molecules expression, the infiltration and activation of mast cells and apoptosis. The biological responses to PEA dosing in animal models and in humans are being investigated vis-à-vis its involvement in a repair mechanism relevant to patient conditions of chronic inflammation and chronic pain. In a model of visceral pain (inflammation of the urinary bladder) PEA was able to attenuate the viscero-visceral hyper-reflexia induced by inflammation of the urinary bladder, one of the reasons why PEA is currently explored in the painful bladder syndrome. In a different model for bladder pain, the turpentine-induced urinary bladder inflammation in the rat, PEA also attenuated a referred hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent way. Chronic pelvic pain in patients seem to respond favourably to a treatment with PEA. == Activity in non-neuronal cells == PEA, as an N-acylethanolamine, has physico-chemical properties comparable to anandamide, and, while it is not strictly an endocannabinoid, it is often studied in conjunction with anandamide because of their overlapping synthetic and metabolic pathways. N-acylethanolamines such as PEA often act as signaling molecules, activating receptors and regulating a variety of physiological functions. PEA is known to activate intracellular, nuclear and membrane-associated receptors, and to regulate many physiological functions related to the inflammatory cascade and chronic pain states. Endocannabinoid lipids like PEA are widely distributed in nature, in a variety of plant, invertebrate, and mammalian tissues. PEA's mechanism of action sometimes is described as Autacoid Local Injury Antagonism (acronym ALIA), and PEA under this nomenclature is an ALIAmide. Levi-Montalcini and coworkers presented evidence in 1993 that lipid amides of the N-acylethanolamine type, such as PEA, are potential prototypes of naturally occurring molecules capable of modulating mast cell activation, and her group used the acronym ALIA in that report. An autocoid is a regulating molecule, locally produced. An ALIAmide is an autocoid synthesized on-demand in response to injury, and acts locally to counteract such pathology. Soon after the breakthrough paper of Levi-Montalcini, the mast cell appeared to be an important target for the anti-inflammatory activity of PEA. Since 1993, at least 25 papers have been published on the various effects of PEA on mast cells. These cells are often found in proximity to sensory nerve endings, and their degranulation can enhance the nociceptive signal, the reason why peripheral mast cells are considered to be pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive. PEA's activity is currently seen as a new inroad in the treatment of neuropathic pain and related disorders based on overactivation of glia and glia-related cells, such as in diabetes and glaucoma. Microglia plays a key role in the winding up phenomenon and central sensitization. == Clinical relevance == The effects of oral dosing of PEA have been explored in humans, and include clinical trials for a variety of pain states, for inflammatory and pain syndromes. Daily doses range from 300 to 1200 mg per day. In a 2017 systematic meta-analysis involving 10 studies including data from 786 patients receiving PEA for pain-related indications and 512 controls, PEA was found to be associated with pain reduction significantly greater than observed in controls (P < 0.001). Positive influences have also been observed in dermal applications, specifically atopic eczema, which may be linked to PPAR alpha activation. In a 2015 analysis of a double blind placebo controlled study of PEA in sciatic pain, the Numbers Needed to Treat was 1.5. Its positive influence in chronic pain, and inflammatory states such as atopic eczema, seems to originate mainly from PPAR alpha activation. Since 2012 a number of new trials have been published, among which studies in glaucoma. PEA also seems to be one of the factors responsible for the decrease in pain sensitivity during and after sport, comparable to the endogenous opiates (endorphines). From a clinical perspective the most important and promising indications for PEA are linked to neuropathic and chronic pain states, such as diabetic neuropathic pain, sciatic pain, CRPS, pelvic pain and entrapment neuropathic pain states. In a blind trial reported in a conference proceeding, patients affected by pain from synovitis or TMJ osteoarthritis (N=25, in total) were randomly assigned to PEA or ibuprofen groups for two weeks; the decrease in pain reported after two weeks was significantly higher for the PEA-treated group, likewise for improved masticatory function. In 2012, 20 patients with thalidomide and bortezomib induced neuropathy were reported to have improved nerve functions and less pain after a two-month treatment with PEA. The authors pointed out that although a placebo effect might play a role in the reported pain relief, the changes in neurophysiological measures clearly indicated that PEA exerted a positive action on the myelinated fibre groups. Sixteen men and fourteen women with two major types of neuropathic pain refractory to analgesic treatment—peripheral diabetic neuropathy (4 men, 7 women) or post-herpetic neuralgia (12 men, 7 women)—whose symptoms spanned eight pain categories (""burning"", ""osteoarticular"", ""piercing"", etc.) who were under prior treatment with pregabalin were transferred to PEA, after which pregabalin treatment was gradually reintroduced; all were responding well after 45 days, and presented significant decreases in pain scores (without drug-drug interactions). In 2013, a metareview was published on the clinical efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of the common cold and influenza, based on reports from six double-blind, placebo, randomized controlled trials, addressing PEA's proposed anti-inflammatory and retinoprotectant effects. In 2019, significant increases in fatty acid amides including PEA, arachidonoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide were noted in a Scottish woman with a previously undocumented variant of congenital insensitivity to pain. This was found to be a result of a combination of a hypomorphic single nucleotide polymorphism of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), alongside a mutation of the pseudogene, FAAH-OUT. The pseudogene was previously considered to be non-coding DNA, FAAH-OUT was found to be capable of modulating the expression of FAAH, making it a possible future target for novel analgesia/anxiolytic drug development. In 2020, PEA has been suggested as a drug that may prove beneficial for the treatment of lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. A pharmaceutical company called FSD Pharma have entered PEA into a Phase 1 clinical trial under the name FSD-201, and has approval from the FDA for progressing to Phase 2a for this indication. == Metabolism == PEA is metabolized by the cellular enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase (NAAA), the latter of which has more specificity toward PEA over other fatty acid amides. == Safety == PEA is generally considered safe, and without adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or drug interactions. A 2016 study assessing safety claims in sixteen clinical trials, six case reports/pilot studies and a meta‐analysis of PEA as an analgesic, concluded that for treatment periods up to 49 days, clinical data argued against serious ADRs at an incidence of 1/200 or greater. A 2016 pooled meta-analysis involving twelve studies found that no serious ADRs were registered and/or reported. No data on interactions with PEA have been reported. Based on its mechanism, PEA may be considered likely to interact with other PPAR-α agonists used to treat high triglycerides; this remains unconfirmed. == See also == N-Acylethanolamine N-Acylphosphatidylethanolamine == References == == Further reading ==",Palmidrol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5247965455055237), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00026217024424113333), (' END', -0.0010713927913457155), ('OG', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ENO', -0.00029685118352063), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.5763665437698364), (' FOOD', -0.031380169093608856)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.2807018458843231), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.0015113847330212593), ('ĠEND', -0.0007995745982043445), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005340476520359516)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0032114614732563496)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1856,"('Pioglitazone', 'U 72107', 'Actos', 'Glustin', 'Zactos')",Medical,"Pioglitazone, sold under the brand name Actos among others, is an anti-diabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It may be used with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or insulin. Use is recommended together with exercise and diet. It is not recommended in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, muscle pains, inflammation of the throat, and swelling. Serious side effects may include bladder cancer, low blood sugar, heart failure, and osteoporosis. Use is not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class and works by improving sensitivity of tissues to insulin. Pioglitazone was patented in 1985, and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 120th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. It was withdrawn in France and Germany in 2011. == Medical uses == Pioglitazone is used to lower blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes either alone or in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin. The effects of pioglitazone have been compared in a Cochrane systematic review to that of other blood sugar lowering-medicine, including metformin, acarbose, and repaglinide, as well as with appropriate diet and exercise, not showing any benefit in reducing the chance of developing type 2 diabetes in people at risk. It did, however, show reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to a placebo or to no treatment. These results should be interpreted considering that most of the data of the studies included in this review were of low or very-low certainty. While pioglitazone does decrease blood sugar levels, the main study that looked at the medication found no difference in the main cardiovascular outcomes that were looked at. The secondary outcome of death from all causes, myocardial infarction, and stroke were lower. Pioglitazone has been found to reduce all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetic patients compared to other therapies, with a 60% reduction in mortality in those exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed. Another study found an all-cause mortality hazard ratio of 0.33 for pioglitazone after adjusting for >40 covariates, compared to insulin. Due to insufficient data on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke, this was not possible to compare in a more recent review. == Contraindications == Pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, other thiazolidinediones or any of components of its pharmaceutical forms. It is ineffective and possibly harmful in diabetes mellitus type 1 and diabetic ketoacidosis. Its safety in pregnancy, lactation (breastfeeding) and people under 18 is not established. Given previous experiences with the related drug troglitazone, acute diseases of the liver are regarded as a contraindication for pioglitazone. == Side effects == A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, the developer of pioglitazone (sold as Actos in many markets) admitted that it has similar implications for female patients. The risk of hypoglycemia is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose. Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema. As a result, it may precipitate congestive heart failure (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause anemia. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems. Chronic administration of the drug has led to occasional instances of cholestatic hepatitis, reversible upon drug discontinuation. On 30 July 2007, an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of ""myocardial ischemic events"" when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A meta-analysis released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased CHF. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review assessed occurrence of adverse effects with use of pioglitazone, but was not able to reach any conclusions due to insufficient data on included studies. === Bladder cancer === On 9 June 2011, the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products decided to withdraw pioglitazone due to high risk of bladder cancer. This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications. On 10 June 2011, Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted. On 15 June 2011, the U.S. FDA announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and two months later the label was updated with an additional warning about this risk. A 2017 meta-analysis found no difference in the rates of bladder cancer attributed to pioglitazone. == Drug interactions == Combination with sulfonylureas or insulin reciprocally exponentiate risk of hypoglycemia. Therapy with pioglitazone increase the chance of pregnancy in individuals taking oral contraception. == Mechanism of action == Pioglitazone selectively stimulates the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and to a lesser extent PPAR-α. It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. As a result, pioglitazone reduces insulin resistance in the liver and peripheral tissues, decreases gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reduces quantity of glucose and glycated hemoglobin in the bloodstream. Since 2004, pioglitazone and other active TZDs have been shown to bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane protein mitoNEET with affinity comparable to that of pioglitazone for PPARγ. Leriglitazone is a metabolite. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2008, it generated the tenth-highest amount of money for a medication in the U.S. in 2008, with sales exceeding $2.4 billion. To 2020, no study has examined the socioeconomic effects of utilization of pioglitazone. === Brand names === Pioglitazone is marketed as Actos in the United States, Canada, the UK and Germany, Glustin in the European Union, Glizone and Pioz in India by Zydus Cadila and USV Limited, respectively and Zactos in Mexico by Takeda Pharmaceuticals. On 17 August 2012, the US FDA announced its approval of the first generic version of Actos. == Research == === Psychiatry === ==== Bipolar disorder ==== Pioglitazone has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. However, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of pioglitazone in the treatment of bipolar depression. ==== Major depression ==== There is research that suggests that pioglitazone may be useful for treating major depression. === Other illnesses === Pioglitazone has been found to exert anti-ageing effects in Drosophila. Pioglitazone has been tried for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, showing promising results according to several meta-analyses. Because it is thought to reduce inflammatory activity in neuroglia, it was studied in a small clinical trial involving children with autism, under the autoimmune/inflammatory hypotheses of the causes of autism. Pioglitazone may improve symptoms of psoriasis. Pioglitazone is also being researched as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in preclinical studies, however testing for the efficacy of Pioglitazone has been fraught with failure and confusing results from clinical trials. Pioglitazone has been shown in animal models to be a possible treatment for Opioid use disorder. == References ==",Zactos,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.8609820219571702e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015090041561052203)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01814994215965271), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicamentosplm.com](https://www.medicamentosplm.com/Home/productos/zactos_tabletas/50/101/10521/210?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=131, start_index=9, title='ZACTOS - PLM', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicamentosplm.com/Home/productos/zactos_tabletas/50/101/10521/210?utm_source=openai')])"

Omacetaxine approval in US is discontinued (August 2024)[1][2] and is no longer recommended for treatment of CML (as of NCCN CML guidance 3.2025) [3]. HHT is a natural plant alkaloid derived from Cephalotaxus fortunei. HHT and related compound esters of cephalotaxine were described first in 1970, and were the subject of intensive research efforts by Chinese investigators to clarify their role as anticancer and antileukemic agents from the 1970s until the present. It was approved by the US FDA in October 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with CML with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). == Medical uses == Omacetaxine/homoharringtonine was indicated for use as a treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who are resistant or intolerant of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In June 2009, results of a long-term open label Phase II study were published, which investigated the use of omacetaxine infusions in CML patients. After twelve months of treatment, about one third of patients showed a cytogenetic response. A study in patients who had failed imatinib and who had the drug resistant T315I mutation achieved cytogenetic response in 28% of patients and hematologic response in 80% of patients, according to preliminary data. Phase I studies including a small number of patients have shown benefit in treating myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 25 patients) and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML, 76 patients). Patients with solid tumors did not benefit from omacetaxine. == Adverse effects == By frequency: Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1–10% frequency): Seizures Haemorrhage † Myelosuppression, including: thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia, in descending order of frequency. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women using HHT should avoid becoming pregnant and also avoid nursing while receiving HHT. == Mechanism of action == Omacetaxine mepesuccinate is a protein translation inhibitor. It inhibits protein translation by preventing the initial elongation step of protein synthesis. It interacts with the ribosomal A-site and prevents the correct positioning of amino acid side chains of incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate acts only on the initial step of protein translation and does not inhibit protein synthesis from mRNAs that have already commenced translation. == References ==",Ceflatonin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.173704271830502e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007211488205939531), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10042008757591248)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001234428636962548), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/ceflatonin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Ceflatonin: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/ceflatonin?utm_source=openai')])"
1858,"('Bempedoic acid', 'Nexletol', 'Nilemdo', 'Bempedoate', 'Bempedoic acid [usan:inn]')",Medical,"Bempedoic acid, sold under the brand name Nexletol among others, is a medication for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol levels). The most common side effects include hyperuricemia (high blood levels of uric acid), pain in arms or legs, and anemia (low red blood cell counts). Bempedoic acid blocks an enzyme in the liver called adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase, which is involved in making cholesterol. Bempedoic acid was approved for use in the United States in February 2020, and for use in the European Union in April 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == In the US, bempedoic acid is indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in combination with diet and the highest tolerated statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who need additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. In the EU, bempedoic acid is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin; or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. == Side effects == Common adverse effects in clinical trials were muscle spasms (3.6% of treated patients, as compared to 2.3% under placebo), pain in the back (3.3% versus 2.2%) or in a limb (3.0% versus 1.7%), gout (1.5% versus 0.4%), and gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea. A less common but more serious adverse effect was tendon rupture in the rotator cuff of the shoulder, the biceps tendon or the Achilles tendon (0.5% versus 0.0%). == Interactions == Bempedoic acid does not interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in the liver and only weakly inhibits the transporter proteins SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3 and SLC22A7 (the latter possibly being responsible for the increase of uric acid in the blood, and therefore the adverse effect gout). Despite this, the drug increases blood levels of statins. The effect is most pronounced with simvastatin and pravastatin, whose AUC is increased about twofold. No other clinically relevant interactions have been found in studies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Bempedoic acid is a prodrug. It is activated to the thioester with coenzyme A by the enzyme SLC27A2 in the liver. The activated substance inhibits ATP citrate lyase, which is involved in the liver's biosynthesis of cholesterol upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that is blocked by statins. The substance also activates AMP-activated protein kinase, but this effect is likely not relevant in humans. === Pharmacokinetics === Following oral intake, bempedoic acid reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 3.5 hours. Food does not affect its absorption. When in the bloodstream, 99.3% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. About a fifth of the substance is reversibly converted by an aldo-keto reductase enzyme to a metabolite (called ESP15228) that is also pharmacologically active in form of its coenzyme A–thioester. Of ESP15228, 99.2% are bound to plasma proteins. Both bempedoic acid and the metabolite are inactivated by glucuronidation of their carboxylic acid groups. Bempedoic acid has a biological half-life of 21±11 hours. Over 95% of the substance are excreted in form of metabolites; about 70% with the urine and 30% with the feces. == History == There were two clinical trials that evaluated the benefits and side effects of bempedoic acid. The trial designs were similar. All enrolled subjects were on a lipid-lowering diet and taking the highest dose of a statin (drug commonly used to lower cholesterol) for high cholesterol. In both trials, subjects were randomly assigned to receive bempedoic acid or placebo tablets every day for 52-weeks. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given. The trials measured percent change in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) blood levels from baseline to week twelve and compared bempedoic acid to placebo. In one clinical trial, bempedoic acid reduced LDL-C by about 20 mg/dl compared to placebo and had a similar frequency of side effects to placebo, although a higher percentage of drug-receiving subjects dropped out of the study because of side effects (11% vs. 7% under placebo). In one randomized controlled trial, patients who could not tolerate therapy with statins had a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after being treated with bempedoic acid. In January 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in the European Union recommended granting of a marketing authorization for bempedoic acid as both a standalone drug (brand name Nilemdo) and as a fixed-dose combination medication with ezetimibe (brand name Nustendi). Bempedoic acid was approved for use in the European Union in April 2020, and the combination bempedoic acid/ezetimibe was approved in March 2020. In February 2020, bempedoic acid was approved for use in the United States both as a standalone drug (brand name Nexletol) and in a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe (brand name Nexlizet). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the approval of Nexletol to Esperion Therapeutics. The FDA approved bempedoic acid based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT02666664 and Trial 2/NCT02991118) of 3009 subjects with high LDL cholesterol and known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or HeFH. The trials were conducted in United States, Canada, and Europe. == See also == Bempedoic acid/ezetimibe == References == == Further reading == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02666664 for ""Evaluation of Long-Term Safety and Tolerability of ETC-1002 in High-Risk Patients With Hyperlipidemia and High CV Risk (CLEAR Harmony)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02988115 for ""Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Bempedoic Acid (ETC-1002) in Patients With Hyperlipidemia and Statin Intolerant (CLEAR Serenity)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02991118 for ""Evaluation of Long-Term Efficacy of Bempedoic Acid (ETC-1002) in Patients With Hyperlipidemia at High Cardiovascular Risk (CLEAR Wisdom)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Nilemdo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013193720951676369), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015808953903615475)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nilemdo?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=103, start_index=9, title='Nilemdo | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nilemdo?utm_source=openai')])"
1859,"('Nifedipine', 'Adalat', 'Procardia', 'Procardia xl', 'Adalat cc')",Medical,"Nifedipine, sold under the brand name Procardia among others, is a calcium channel blocker medication used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, and premature labor. It is one of the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lung function and provide time for transfer of the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. It is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast- and slow-release formulations. Common side effects include lightheadedness, headache, feeling tired, leg swelling, cough, and shortness of breath. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure and heart failure. Nifedipine is considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Nifedipine was patented in 1967, and approved for use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 151st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === High blood pressure === The approved uses are for the long-term treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. In hypertension, recent clinical guidelines generally favour diuretics and ACE inhibitors, although calcium channel antagonists, along with thiazide diuretics, are still favoured as primary treatment for patients over 55 and black patients. Nifedipine given as sublingual administration has previously been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed on an as-needed basis to patients taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This was found to be dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual administration of nifedipine promotes a hypotensive effect via peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete heart block, and death. As a result of this, in 1985 the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and effectiveness of sublingual nifedipine for the management of hypertensive emergencies, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor effective. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury. === Early labor === Nifedipine has been used frequently as a tocolytic (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It also has benefits over beta-agonists and may also have some benefits over atosiban and magnesium sulfate, although atosiban results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference was found in the rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, while data on longer-term outcomes is lacking. === Other === Raynaud's phenomenon is often treated with nifedipine. A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of nifedipine. Topical nifedipine has been shown to be as effective as topical nitrates for anal fissures. Nifedipine is also used in high-altitude medicine to treat high altitude pulmonary edema. Nifedipine is one of the main choices for the treatment of Prinzmetal angina due to its vasodilating effects on the coronary arteries. Other uses include painful spasms of the esophagus such as from cancer or tetanus. It is also used for the small subset of people with pulmonary hypertension. Finally, nifedipine can be used in the treatment of renal calculi, which are commonly referred to as kidney stones. Studies have indicated that it helps to relieve renal colic. However, alpha blockers (such as tamsulosin) have been described as being significantly better. == Side effects == Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine. Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. As calcium channel blocker, nifedipine has a risk of causing gingival hyperplasia. == Overdose == A number of persons have developed toxicity due to acute overdosage with nifedipine, either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or parenteral administration. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of consciousness. The drug may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal investigation following death. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid chromatography and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 μg/L range. == Mechanism of action == Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. Although nifedipine and other dihydropyridines are commonly regarded as specific to the L-type calcium channel, they also possess nonspecific activity towards other voltage-dependent calcium channels. Nifedipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. == History == Nifedipine (initially BAY a1040, then Adalat) was developed by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, with most initial studies being performed in the early 1970s. In 1980, Ahmed Hegazy and Klaus-Dieter Rämsch submitted their invention on extended release formulation that became known as Adalat retard. Marketed as Adalat CC in US, a 1995 US lawsuit found that Pfizer's Procardia XL was also based on Bayer's Adalat European and US patents. The use of nifedipine and related calcium channel antagonists was much reduced in response to 1995 trials that mortality was increased in patients with coronary artery disease who took nifedipine. This study was a meta-analysis, and demonstrated harm mainly in short-acting forms of nifedipine (that could cause large fluctuations in blood pressure) and at high doses of 80 mg a day and more. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In India, nifedipine is manufactured by JB Chemicals, and comes in brands Nicardia Retard (Nifedipine 10 mg, 20 mg tablets) and Nicardia XL 30/60, which are Nifedipine Extended Release tablets. In Switzerland, nifedipine is sold only as a generic version of extended release formulation, under the names Nifedipin Mepha and Nifedipin Spirig. == References ==",Adalat cc,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003968881501350552), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032145516015589237)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/adalat.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=75, start_index=9, title='Adalat CC: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/adalat.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Kaiss-Chapman and R.O. Morris [1977] Biochem Biophys Res Commun 76: 453-459). A potential source of the iP is isopentenylated transfer RNA (tRNA), which, in turn, is synthesized by the activity of tRNA:isopentenyltransferase encoded by the bacterial miaA gene. To determine whether secreted iP had its origin in isopentenylated tRNA, a miaA- deletion/insertion mutant was prepared and reconstructed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens in vivo. The mutant no longer possessed tRNA:isopentenylation activity and no longer released iP into the extracellular medium. Transfer RNA therefore makes a small but significant contribution to the total amount of cytokinin normally secreted by Agrobacterium strains. tRNA-mediated synthesis may also account for cytokinin production by other plant-associated bacteria, such as Rhizobia, that have been reported to secrete similarly low levels of nonhydroxylated cytokinins. Cytokinins (CKs), primarily trans-zeatin (tZ) and isopentenyladenine (iP) types, play critical roles in plant growth, development, and various stress responses. Long-distance transport of tZ-type CKs meidated by Arabidopsis ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily G14 (AtABCG14) has been well studied; however, less is known about the biochemical properties of AtABCG14 and its transporter activity toward iP-type CKs. Here we reveal the biochemical properties of AtABCG14 and provide evidence that it is also required for long-distance transport of iP-type CKs. AtABCG14 formed homodimers in human (Homo sapiens) HEK293T, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and Arabidopsis cells. Transporter activity assays of AtABCG14 in Arabidopsis, tobacco, and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that AtABCG14 may directly transport multiple CKs, including iP- and tZ-type species. AtABCG14 expression was induced by iP in a tZ-type CK-deficient double mutant (cypDM) of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2. The atabcg14 cypDM triple mutant exhibited stronger CK-deficiency phenotypes than cypDM. Hormone profiling, reciprocal grafting, and  The diversity of cytokinin (CK) metabolites suggests their interconversions are the predominant regulatory mechanism of CK action. Nevertheless, little is known about their directionality and kinetics in planta. CK metabolite levels were measured in 2-wk-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants at several time points up to 100 min following exogenous application of selected CKs. The data were then evaluated qualitatively and by mathematical modeling.

1862,"('Mefenamic acid', 'Ponstel', 'Mephenamic acid', 'Ponstan', 'Mephenaminic acid')",Medical,"Mefenamic acid is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and is used to treat mild to moderate pain. Its name derives from its systematic name, dimethylphenylaminobenzoic acid. It was discovered and brought to market by Parke-Davis as Ponstel in the 1960s. It became generic in the 1980s and is available worldwide under many brand names such as Meftal. == Medical uses == Mefenamic acid is used to treat pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, postoperative pain, acute pain including muscle and back pain, toothache and menstrual pain, as well as being prescribed for menorrhagia. In a 10-year study, mefenamic acid and other oral medicines (tranexamic acid) were as effective as the levonorgestrel intrauterine coil; the same proportion of women had not had surgery for heavy bleeding and had similar improvements in their quality of life. There is evidence that supports the use of mefenamic acid for perimenstrual migraine headache prophylaxis, with treatment starting two days prior to the onset of flow or one day prior to the expected onset of the headache and continuing for the duration of menstruation. Mefenamic acid is recommended to be taken with food. == Contraindications == Mefenamic acid is contraindicated in people who have shown hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria and asthma to this drug or to other NSAIDs (e.g. aspirin); those with peptic ulcers or chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract; those with kidney or liver disease; heart failure; after coronary artery bypass surgery; and during the third trimester of pregnancy. == Side effects == Known mild side effects of mefenamic acid include headaches, nervousness, and vomiting. Potentially serious side effects may include diarrhea, gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcers, hematemesis (vomiting blood), skin reactions (rashes, itching, swelling; in rare cases toxic epidermal necrolysis) and rarely blood cell disorders such as agranulocytosis. It has been associated with acute liver damage. In 2008 the US label was updated with a warning concerning a risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in pregnancy. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. In its November 2023 monthly drug safety alert under the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI), the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission flagged a risk of DRESS Syndrome due to use of mefenamic acid. == Overdose == Symptoms of overdosing include kidney failure, gastrointestinal problems, bleeding, rashes, confusion, hallucinations, vertigo, seizures, and loss of consciousness. It is treated with induction of vomiting, gastric lavage, bone char, and control of electrolytes and vital functions. == Interactions == Interactions are broadly similar to those of other NSAIDs. Mefenamic acid interferes with the anti–blood clotting mechanism of Aspirin. It increases the blood thinning effects of warfarin and phenprocoumon because it displaces them from their plasma protein binding and increases their free concentrations in the bloodstream. It adds to the risk of gastrointestinal ulcera associated with corticosteroids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It can increase the risk for adverse effects of methotrexate and lithium by lowering their excretion via the kidneys. It can increase the kidney toxicity of ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Combination with antihypertensive drugs such as ACE inhibitors, sartans and diuretics can decrease their effectiveness as well as increase the risk for kidney toxicity. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like other members of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of NSAIDs, it inhibits both isoforms of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). This prevents formation of prostaglandins, which play a role in pain sensitivity, inflammation and fever, but also in hemostasis, kidney function, sustaining of pregnancy, and protection of the gastric mucosa. === Pharmacokinetics === Mefenamic acid is rapidly absorbed from the gut and reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to four hours. When in the bloodstream, over 90% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It probably crosses the placenta, and is found in the breast milk in small amounts. It is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C9 to the only weakly active 3'-hydroxymethylmefenamic acid. 3'-carboxymefenamic acid has also been identified as a metabolite, as well as carboxy glucuronides of all three substances. Mefenamic acid and its metabolites are excreted via the urine (52–67%) and the faeces (20–25%, or less than 20% following another source). The parent substance has a biological half-life of two hours; the half-life of its metabolites may be longer. == History == Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented mefenamic acid in 1961, along with fellow members of the class of anthranilic acid derivatives, flufenamic acid in 1963 and meclofenamate sodium in 1964. U.S. Patent 3,138,636 on the drug was issued in 1964. It was approved in the UK in 1963 as Ponstan, in West Germany in 1964 as Ponalar and in France as Ponstyl, and the US in 1967 as Ponstel. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Analogous to fenamic acid, this compound may be made from 2-chlorobenzoic acid and 2,3-dimethylaniline. === Conformational flexibility === Mefenamic acid, a member of the fenamate, is a chemical compound derived from anthranilic acid . This derivative is created by substituting one of the hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom with a 2,3-dimethylphenyl fragment. The result is a structurally complex molecule with fascinating conformational properties. The mefenamic acid molecule exhibits conformational lability, meaning it can exist in various shapes or conformers. This flexibility arises from changes in the position of the carboxylic acid group and the 2,3-dimethylphenyl fragment about the anthranil moiety. Specifically, the arrangement of the substituted benzene fragments relative to each other plays a crucial role in determining the different polymorphic forms of mefenamic acid. Recent experimental studies have unveiled two additional hidden conformers of mefenamic acid. These conformers result from alterations in the positions of hydroxyl groups within the molecule. This discovery adds to our understanding of the compound's structural diversity. External factors, including temperature, pressure, and the surrounding medium, highly influence the conformational state of mefenamic acid. Researchers have conducted extensive investigations into its spatial structure not only in organic solvents but also in supercritical fluids, aerogels, and lipid bilayers. These studies have helped elucidate the impact of different environments on the molecule's conformation. == Society and culture == === Availability and pricing === Mefenamic acid is generic and is available worldwide under many brand names. In the US, wholesale price of a week's supply of generic mefenamic acid has been quoted as $426.90 in 2014. Brand-name Ponstel is $571.70. By contrast, in the UK, a weeks supply is £1.66, or £8.17 for branded Ponstan. In New Zealand, a weeks's supply of Ponstan costs NZ$9.08, around US$5.50. == Research == While studies have been conducted to see if mefenamic acid can improve behavior in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease there is little evidence that mefenamic acid or other NSAIDs can treat or prevent Alzheimer's in humans; clinical trials of NSAIDs other than mefenamic acid for treatment of Alzheimer's have found more harm than benefit. A small controlled study of 28 human subjects showed improved cognitive impairment using mefenamic acid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy. == References == == Further reading ==",Ponstan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.8967437174287625e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009179668850265443)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefenamic_acid,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/ponstan,https://www.myvmc.com/drugs/ponstan/ ', [])"

This bicyclic compound may be viewed as fused rings of the aromatic compounds benzene and imidazole. It is a white solid that appears in form of tabular crystals. == Preparation == Benzimidazole was discovered during research on vitamin B12. The benzimidazole nucleus was found to be a stable platform on which drugs could be developed. Benzimidazole is produced by condensation of o-phenylenediamine with formic acid, or the equivalent trimethyl orthoformate: C6H4(NH2)2 + HC(OCH3)3 → C6H4N(NH)CH + 3 CH3OH 2-Substituted derivatives are obtained when the condensation is conducted with aldehydes in place of formic acid, followed by oxidation. == Reactions == Benzimidazole is a base: C6H4N(NH)CH + H+ → [C6H4(NH)2CH]+ It can also be deprotonated with stronger bases: C6H4N(NH)CH + LiH → Li [C6H4N2CH] + H2 The imine can be alkylated and also serves as a ligand in coordination chemistry. The most prominent benzimidazole complex features N-ribosyl-dimethylbenzimidazole, as found in vitamin B12. N,N'-Dialkylbenzimidazolium salts are precursors to certain N-heterocyclic carbenes. == Applications == Benzimidazole derivatives are among the most frequently used ring systems for small molecule drugs listed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Many pharmaceutical agents belong to the benzimidazole class of compounds. For example: Angiotensin II receptor blockers such as azilsartan, candesartan, and telmisartan. Anthelmintic agents such as albendazole, ciclobendazole, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole, triclabendazole, and thiabendazole. These drugs work by binding tubulin, a vital part of the cytoskeleton and mitotic spindle. Benzimidazoles are selectively toxic towards parasitic nematodes, selectively binding and depolymerising their tubulins. Antihistamines such as astemizole, bilastine, clemizole, emedastine, mizolastine, and oxatomide. Benzimidazole fungicides such as benomyl, carbendazim, fuberidazole, and thiabendazole. These drugs selectively bind to and depolymerise fungal tubulin. Benzimidazole opioids such as bezitramide, brorphine, clonitazene, etodesnitazene, etonitazene, etonitazepipne, etonitazepyne, isotonitazene, metodesnitazene, and metonitazene. Proton-pump inhibitors such as dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, ilaprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and tenatoprazole. Typical antipsychotics such as benperidol, clopimozide, droperidol, neflumozide, and oxiperomide, and pimozide. Other notable pharmaceutical agents which contain a benzimidazole group include abemaciclib, bendamustine, dabigatran, daridorexant, and glasdegib. In printed circuit board manufacturing, benzimidazole can be used as an organic solderability preservative. Several dyes are derived from benzimidazoles. == See also == Benzimidazoline Polybenzimidazole, a high performance fiber == References == == Further reading == Grimmett, M. R. (1997).

Recent studies suggest that PZA might be a dual inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II that exerts its effects by diminishing the formation of topoisomerase-DNA adducts. Consistent with this unique mechanism of action, PZA exhibits broad spectrum antitumor activity in preclinical models in vivo. In addition, this agent displays several unique properties including solid tumor selectivity, activity against hypoxic cells, and cytotoxicity in noncycling cells. PZA also retains full activity against cells that are resistant to other agents on the basis of overexpression of P-glycoprotein or the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP). PZA has been studied in phase I trials in adults and children, and is currently undergoing broad phase II trials in a number of tumor types. No significant anti-tumor activity has been seen in gastrointestinal malignancies and prostate cancer. Results from ongoing or recently completed trials are awaited before the utility of this agent in our current armamentarium can be defined. Because of its unique properties, combination studies with other antineoplastic agents are warranted. Pyrazoloacridine (PZA) is an investigational nucleic acid binding agent that inhibits the activity of topoisomerases 1 and 2. We conducted a phase II clinical study to determine the efficacy and toxicities of PZA in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). In this phase II multicenter study, patients who were treated with no more than one prior chemotherapy for MBC were treated with 750 mg/m² of PZA given as a 3-hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment cycles were continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. The study was designed to distinguish between a response rate of < 15% vs > 30% (alpha = 0.10, beta = 0.10) using Simons optimal 2-stage design. At least 2 responses were required in the first 12 patients in the 1st stage and 6 of 35 in the 2nd stage to recommend the agent for further study. Two patients in the first stage had a response allowing accrual to second stage. A total of 15 patients (out of 35 planned) were treated on the study prior to premature closure. Three patients had a partial response (20%) lasting 4.5-6 months. Two patients had stable disease for 3 and 5 months. The dose limiting toxicity was granulocytopenia with ten patients requiring dose reduction or dose delay for grade 4 neutropenia. Other grade 3 and 4 toxicities include vomiting (n = 2), nausea (n = 2), neurotoxicity (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), anemia (n = 1), dyspnea 9n = 1) and renal (n = 1). Pyrazoloacridine demonstrated modest activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Pyrazoloacridine (NSC 366140, PD115934, PZA) is a new class of acridine anticancer agents under investigation in Phase II clinical trials in patients with advanced cancers. Although poor responses in patients to the treatment with PZA alone have been observed, this class of agents remains of interest because of its distinct mechanism of action from other topoisomerase poisons. Therefore, the combination of PZA with conventional anticancer agents presents an attractive approach to treat drug-resistant human tumors. In the present study, the cytotoxic effects of PZA combined with doxorubicin, topotecan, and etoposide were determined using paired parental and doxorubicin-resistant human colon carcinoma (SW-620 and SW620/AD-300) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MCF-7/TH). Cytotoxicity was measured by soft agar clonogenic assays. Dose effect and combination effects were analyzed by the method of Chou and Talalay. The combination of PZA with doxorubicin, topotecan, and etoposide in fixed ratios demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity on both SW-620 and SW620/AD-300 cell lines. The combination of PZA with doxorubicin also exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity against both MCF-7 and MCF-7/TH cell lines. The mechanism of synergism appeared independent of topoisomerase I and II inhibition, and interference with protein-DNA complexes. Strategies to define optimal drug combinations are proving to be of significant value when considering potential clinical applications of new and established agents.",Pyrazoloacridine,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00023071514442563057), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001234931987710297), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004089208785444498)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16133802/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9815948/,https://mayoclinic.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/current-status-of-pyrazoloacridine-as-an-anticancer-agent ', [])"

In a phase 1, first-in-human study (FIHS), progressive amyloid removal was observed in some patients after ≤ 3 cycles of miridesap/dezamizumab. This observational, non-interventional study in patients who received miridesap/dezamizumab during the FIHS (planned follow-up: 5 years) evaluated response to treatment based on routine assessments of disease status and key organ function. In a post hoc analysis, patients responding to treatment in the FIHS during follow-up were identified as responders and further categorized as sustained or declining responders. In the FIHS, 17/23 patients were treatment responders. Of these patients, seven (immunoglobulin light chain [AL], n = 6; serum amyloid A, n = 1) were considered sustained responders and ten (fibrinogen-a alpha chain [AFib], n = 5; AL, n = 4; apolipoprotein A-I, n = 1) were considered declining responders.

Registered 28 January 2013, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01777243 . Miridesap, a depleter of serum amyloid P component (SAP), forms an essential component of a novel approach to remove systemic amyloid deposits; low oral bioavailability necessitates that it is given parenterally. We sought to identify and clinically characterise a pro-drug that preserves the pharmacological properties of miridesap while having adequate oral bioavailability and physical stability. We utilised a preclinical screening cascade focused on appropriate physicochemical properties, physical and gut stability, and conversion to miridesap in liver microsomes and blood. GSK3039294 (GSK294) had the desired in vitro profile and progressed to preclinical in vivo pharmacokinetic and safety assessments. Based on a favourable profile, it was tested in healthy participants after single and repeat dosing. GSK294 was highly soluble and stable in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, stable in intestinal microsomes, and permeable in Madine Darby Canine Kidney type II cells. GSK294 was rapidly hydrolysed to miridesap and its mono pro-drug ester in blood and liver microsomes. GSK294 showed good oral bioavailability of miridesap in rats and dogs. Following administration of GSK294 600 mg QD for 7 days in humans, pharmacodynamically active concentrations of miridesap were achieved with substantial and sustained depletion of plasma SAP. The study was terminated due to observations of arrhythmia, the relation of which to GSK294 remains unclear. Using a preclinical screening cascade, we identified a pro-drug for a palindromic molecule with unique pharmacology (miridesap). The pro-drug depleted circulating SAP with a time course and extent similar to that of parenterally administered miridesap. This phase 1 study characterized the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of miridesap (GSK2315698) following an intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy Japanese men. Subjects in Cohort 1 received 1-hour IV infusions of 10, 20, and 40 mg of miridesap or placebo, and subjects in Cohort 2 received a 15-hour IV infusion of 20 mg/h of miridesap or placebo. No treatment-related adverse events were reported. No new safety signals were identified for either vital signs or clinical laboratory parameters. A dose-dependent increase was observed in miridesap exposure (area under the concentration-time curve and maximum observed drug concentration) in the 10 to 40 mg/h dose range after a 1-hour IV infusion of miridesap.

This analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug is primarily used as a pain relief for mild to moderate inflammation related to osteoarthritis in dogs. Grapiprant has been approved by the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine and was categorized as a non-cyclooxygenase inhibiting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in March 2016. Preclinical studies also indicate that grapiprant is not only efficacious as a reliever of acute pain but also in chronic pain relief and inflammation. The effect of the drug is directly proportional to the dosage and its effects are comparable to human medications such as rofecoxib and piroxicam. Grapiprant has also been tested in humans, and was researched to be used as pain control for inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. Grapiprant is widely accepted in veterinary medicine due to its specific and targeted approach to pain management in dogs. The serum concentration of grapiprant is increased when used in conjunction with other drugs such as acetaminophen, albendazole, and alitretinoin. Common side effects are intestinal related effects such as mild diarrhea, appetite loss, and vomiting. It is theorised that it might lead to reduced tear production due to it being a sulfa-based medication, as well as decreased albumin levels. == Medical uses == Grapiprant is indicated for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. == Mechanism of action == The effect of grapiprant can be explained through the function of prostaglandin E2, in which acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator of redness of the skin, edema and pain which are the typical signs of inflammation. The effect of PGE2 stems from its action through the four prostaglandin receptor subgroups EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, in which the prostaglandin EP4 receptor acts as the main intermediary of the prostaglandin-E2-driven inflammation. Grapiprant acts as a specific antagonist that binds and blocks the prostaglandin EP4 receptor, one out of the four prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor subgroups. The EP4 receptor then mediates the prostaglandin-E2-elicited response to pain, and hence grapiprant was proven to be effective in the decrease of pain in several inflammatory pain models of rats. It was also proven to be effective in reducing osteoarthritis-related pain in humans, which serves as a proof for its mechanism of action. The approximate calculation for canine efficacy dose is between the range of 1.3 and 1.7 mg/kg, in conjunction with a methylcellulose suspending agent. Based on the calculations from the comparisons of binding affinity of grapiprant to the EP4 receptors of dogs, rats, and humans, the study of plasma and serum protein binding determinations, the effective doses determined in inflammation pain models of rats, and human-related clinical studies, it is evaluated that Grapiprant should be administered just once a day. The approved dose of the commercial Grapiprant tablet by the FDA for the pain relief and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis to dogs is reported to be 2 mg/kg a day. == Absorption == Studies in animals such as horses have shown the presence of grapiprant in serum 72 hours with a concentration >0.005 ng/mL after the initial administration of a dose of 2 mg/kg. Grapiprant is expeditiously absorbed and the reported serum concentration was reported to be 31.9 ng/ml in an amount of time of 1.5 hours. The actual body exposure to grapiprant after administration of one dose was shown to be 2000 ng·hr/mL. The degree and rate at which grapiprant is absorbed into the body, presents a mean bioavailability of 39%. A significant reduction in the bioavailability, concentration time and maximal concentration were reported to have occurred after food intake. And thus, grapiprant is usually not administered with food as it will not be as efficient. == Distribution == The volume of distribution in cat studies was reported to be 918 ml/kg. == Route of elimination == Following an oral administration, the majority of the dose was metabolized within the first 72 hours. Equine studies have shown that grapiprant is present in urine 96 hours after the first administration of a dose of 2 mg/kg and has a concentration >0.005 ng/ml. From the excreted dose conducted in horses, it is found that 55%, 15% and 19% of the orally-administered dose was excreted in bile, urine, and faeces respectively. == Toxicity == Safety studies conducted on grapiprant have demonstrated that it generally possesses an acceptable safety profile and a wide safety margin in veterinary studies. In animal studies, a research on 2.5–12 times overdose was conducted for grapiprant and the study resulted in soft stool and mucus-filled faeces, occasional bloody stools and emesis. == References ==",Grapiprant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.023287637159228325), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0030500818975269794), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03822053596377373)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapiprant ', [])"
1869,"('Clavulanate (lithium)', 'Clavulanate', 'Acide clavulanique', 'Acido clavulanico', 'Antibiotic mm 14151')",Medical,"Clavulanic acid is a β-lactam drug that functions as a mechanism-based β-lactamase inhibitor. While not effective by itself as an antibiotic, when combined with penicillin-group antibiotics, it can overcome antibiotic resistance in bacteria that secrete β-lactamase, which otherwise inactivates most penicillins. In its most common preparations, potassium clavulanate (clavulanic acid as a salt of potassium) is combined with: amoxicillin (co-amoxiclav, trade names Augmentin, Clavulin, Tyclav, Clavaseptin (veterinary), Clavamox (veterinary), Synulox (veterinary), and others) ticarcillin (co-ticarclav, trade name Timentin) Clavulanic acid was patented in 1974. In addition to its β-lactamase inhibition, clavulanic acid shows off-target activity in the nervous system by upregulating the glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and has been studied in the potential treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders. == Medical uses == Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid is a first-line treatment for many types of infections, including sinus infections, and urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis. This is, in part, because of its efficacy against gram-negative bacteria which tend to be more difficult to control than gram-positive bacteria with chemotherapeutic antibiotics. == Adverse effects == The use of clavulanic acid with penicillins has been associated with an increased incidence of cholestatic jaundice and acute hepatitis during therapy or shortly after. The associated jaundice is usually self-limiting and very rarely fatal. The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) recommends that treatments such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid preparations be reserved for bacterial infections likely to be caused by amoxicillin-resistant β-lactamase-producing strains, and that treatment should not normally exceed 14 days. Allergic reactions have been reported. == Sources == The name is derived from strains of Streptomyces clavuligerus, which produces clavulanic acid. === Biosynthesis === The β-lactam like structure of clavulanic acid looks structurally similar to penicillin, but the biosynthesis of this molecule involves a different biochemical pathway. Clavulanic acid is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus, using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and L-arginine as starting materials. Although each of the intermediates of the pathway is known, the exact mechanism for all of the enzymatic reactions is not fully understood. The process mainly involves 3 enzymes: clavaminate synthase, β-lactam synthetase, and N2-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine (CEA) synthase. Clavaminate synthase is a non-heme oxygenase dependent on iron and α-keto-glutarate and is encoded by orf5 of the clavulanic acid gene cluster. The specific mechanism of how this enzyme works is not fully understood, but this enzyme regulates 3 steps in the overall synthesis of clavulanic acid. All 3 steps occur in the same region of the catalytic, iron-containing reaction center, yet do not occur in sequence and affect different areas of the clavulanic acid structure. β-lactam synthetase is a 54.5 kDa protein that is encoded by orf3 of the clavulanic acid gene cluster, and shows similarity to asparagine synthase – Class B enzymes. The exact mechanism on how this enzyme works to synthesize the β-lactam is not proven, but is believed to occur in coordination with a CEA synthase and ATP. CEA synthase is a 60.9 kDA protein and is the first gene found in the clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster, encoded by orf2 of the clavulanic acid gene cluster. The specific mechanism of how this enzyme works is still under investigation; however, it is known that this enzyme has the ability to couple together glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate with L-arginine in the presence of thiamine diphosphate (TDP or thiamine pyrophosphate), which is the first step of the clavulanic acid biosynthesis. == History == Clavulanic acid was discovered around 1974-75 by British scientists working at the drug company Beecham from the bacteria Streptomyces clavuligerus. After several attempts, Beecham finally filed for US patent protection for the drug in 1981, and U.S. Patents 4,525,352, 4,529,720, and 4,560,552 were granted in 1985. Clavulanic acid has negligible intrinsic antimicrobial activity, despite sharing the β-lactam ring that is characteristic of β-lactam antibiotics. However, the similarity in chemical structure allows the molecule to interact with the enzyme β-lactamase secreted by certain bacteria to confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Clavulanic acid is a suicide inhibitor, covalently bonding to a serine residue in the active site of the β-lactamase. This restructures the clavulanic acid molecule, creating a much more reactive species that attacks another amino acid in the active site, permanently inactivating it, and thus inactivating the enzyme. This inhibition restores the antimicrobial activity of β-lactam antibiotics against lactamase-secreting resistant bacteria. Despite this, some bacterial strains that are resistant even to such combinations have emerged. == Research == === Neuromodulation === In 2005, it was discovered via screening of 1,040 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and neutraceuticals that many β-lactams, such as ceftriaxone, upregulate astrocytic glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression. Subsequently, it was discovered that clavulanic acid, likewise a β-lactam, shares this action. The associated effects include enhanced GLT-1 expression in the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and spinal cord, modulation of glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurotransmission, and anti-inflammatory effects via modulation of cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Ceftriaxone lacks oral bioavailability, has poor brain permeability, and has concomitant antibiotic activity. These limitations have resulted in more interest in clavulanic acid, which does not share these drawbacks and is more potent than ceftriaxone in vivo. The mechanism of action underlying the upregulation of GLT-1 expression by β-lactams is unknown. However, interactions with the SNARE proteins Munc18-1 and Rab4 may be involved in some of clavulanic acid's effects, such as increased dopamine release. In relation to its central nervous system actions, clavulanic acid has been studied preclinically in models of anxiety, sexual behavior, addiction, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and stroke. In animals, including in rodents and/or monkeys, clavulanic acid has shown anxiolytic-like, antidepressant-like, pro-sexual, memory-enhancing, analgesic, antiaddictive, pro-dopaminergic, pro-oxytocinergic, and neuroprotective effects. The drug has been studied clinically in humans in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, depression, substance dependence, and pain, with positive or mixed preliminary results for these conditions reported. Clavulanic acid was under formal development by Revaax Pharmaceuticals (now Ocuphire Pharma) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, neurodegenerative disorders, and Parkinson's disease. However, development for these indications was discontinued by 2014. The developmental code name of clavulanic acid was RX-10100 and its tentative brand names were Serdaxin and Zoraxel. Although its development was discontinued, interest in clavulanic acid for potential nervous system-related uses has continued as of 2024. == References ==",Clavulanate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4121114822482923e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002302858338225633), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03805587440729141)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Clavulanic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavulanic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"

1871,"('Nitrofurazone', 'Nitrofural', 'Furacilin', 'Furacin', 'Furacillin')",Medical,"Nitrofurazone (INN, trade name Furacin) is an antimicrobial organic compound belonging to the nitrofuran class. It is most commonly used as a topical antibiotic ointment. It is effective against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and can be used in the treatment of trypanosomiasis. Its use in medicine has become less frequent, as safer and more effective products have become available. Nitrofurazone is listed under California Prop 65, and has demonstrated clear evidence to be mutagenic and carcinogenic during animal studies, and has been discontinued for human use in the USA. The substance is pale yellow and crystalline. It was once widely used as an antibiotic for livestock. == Medical uses == === Human use === Nitrofurazone was previously available as a prescription in the U.S., and was indicated as a topical solution, topical cream, or topical ointment for the treatment of bacterial skin infections, wounds, burns, and ulcers. It was also used as a prophylactic measure to prevent infection that could potentially result in skin graft rejection. Nitrofurazone is still very popular as a topical solution for the treatment of tonsillitis in Russia. === Animal use === Nitrofurazone is indicated for topical use in dogs, cats, and horses, for the treatment or prophylactic treatment of superficial bacterial infections, burns, and cutaneous ulcers. Preparations for treating infections, such as fin rot, in ornamental fish are also still commercially available. The use of nitrofurazone, or related compounds, in animals raised for human consumption has been strictly banned. == Pharmacokinetics == The metabolism of topically applied nitrofurazone is thought to be by 5-nitro reduction and cleavage of the -CH=N- linkage to generate a reactive species which can covalently bond to cellular macromolecules, none of the end products are thought to be antimicrobial. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but nitrofurazone's antimicrobial properties are suspected to be due to the interference of DNA synthesis in the microorganism by inhibiting certain enzymes that are involved with glycolysis. Other enzymes this may affect include, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthetase, malate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, and pyruvate decarboxylase. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects for topical use are generally mild and include, erythema, pruritus, dermatitis, rash, edema or inflammation. == Contraindications == People with chronic kidney disease and large total body surface area (TBSA) burns should not use nitrofurazone, as topical preparations commonly contain polyethylene glycol, which is readily absorbed through the skin. Rapid absorption of the medication induces increased serum osmolalities and anion gap, leading to death. Symptoms are similar to ethylene glycol poisoning, in that increased serum calcium levels occur concurrently with decreased ionized calcium. Nitrofurans have been found in honey, meat and seafood. In people who have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD deficiency), ingestion of fish, poultry, or other foodstuff that has been treated with nitrofurans, will likely suffer from hemolysis of red blood cells as a result of eating the contaminated food. == Toxicities == Nitrofurazone is suspected to be a human carcinogen and is included in California's list of toxic chemicals as defined by Proposition 65. Studies demonstrate that nitrofurazone induces mammary tumors (fibroadenoma and adenocarcinoma) in rats and ovarian tumors in mice. In addition, animal studies demonstrated an increased incidence in convulsive seizures, ovarian atrophy, testicular degeneration, and degeneration of articular cartilage. Proper personal protective equipment should be utilized when handling nitrofurazone. == References ==",Furacillin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.37110206484794617), ('U', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.00530822342261672), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.16033022105693817), ('ĠINDU', -0.030246132984757423), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12724047899246216)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5759397745132446), (' INDUSTR', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00336?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Nitrofural: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00336?utm_source=openai')])"
1872,"('Glufosinate (ammonium)', 'Phosphinothricin', 'Glufosinate-ammonium', 'Butanoic acid, 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-', 'Glufosinate [iso]')",Medical,"Glufosinate (also known as phosphinothricin and often sold as an ammonium salt) is a naturally occurring broad-spectrum herbicide produced by several species of Streptomyces soil bacteria. Glufosinate is a non-selective, contact herbicide, with some systemic action. Plants may also metabolize bialaphos and phosalacine, other naturally occurring herbicides, directly into glufosinate. The compound irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase, an enzyme necessary for the production of glutamine and for ammonia detoxification, giving it antibacterial, antifungal and herbicidal properties. Application of glufosinate to plants leads to reduced glutamine and elevated ammonia levels in tissues, halting photosynthesis and resulting in plant death. == Discovery == In the 1960s and early 1970s, scientists at University of Tübingen and at the Meiji Seika Kaisha Company independently discovered that species of Streptomyces bacteria produce a tripeptide they called bialaphos that inhibits bacteria; it consists of two alanine residues and a unique amino acid that is an analog of glutamate that they named ""phosphinothricin"".: 90 They determined that phosphinothricin irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase.: 90 Phosphinothricin was first synthesized by scientists at Hoechst in the 1970s as a racemic mixture; this racemic mixture is called glufosinate and is the commercially relevant version of the chemical.: 91–92 In the late 1980s scientists discovered enzymes in these Streptomyces species that selectively inactivate free phosphinothricin; the gene encoding the enzyme that was isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus was called the ""bialaphos resistance"" or ""bar"" gene, and the gene encoding the enzyme in Streptomyces viridochromogenes was called ""phosphinothricin acetyltransferase"" or ""pat"".: 98 The two genes and their proteins have 80% homology on the DNA level and 86% amino acid homology, and are each 158 amino acids long.: 98 == Use == Glufosinate is a broad-spectrum herbicide that is used to control important weeds such as morning glories, hemp sesbania (Sesbania bispinosa), Pennsylvania smartweed (Polygonum pensylvanicum), and yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus) similar to glyphosate. It is applied to young plants during early development for full effectiveness. It is sold in formulations under brands including Basta, Rely, Finale, Challenge and Liberty. Glufosinate is typically used in three situations as an herbicide: directed sprays for weed control, including in genetically modified crops use as a crop desiccation to facilitate harvesting Glufosinate also has shown to provide some protection against various plant diseases, as it also acts to kill fungi and bacteria on contact. === Genetically modified crops === Genetically modified crops resistant to glufosinate were created by genetically engineering the bar or pat genes from streptomyces into the relevant crop seeds.: 98 In 1995 the first glufosinate-resistant crop, canola, was brought to market, and it was followed by corn in 1997, cotton in 2004, and soybeans in 2011. == Mode of action == Phosphinothricin is a glutamine synthetase inhibitor that binds to the glutamate site. Glufosinate-treated plants die due to a buildup of ammonia in the thylakoid lumen, leading to the uncoupling of photophosphorylation. The uncoupling of photophosphorylation causes the production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and membrane destruction. Elevated levels of ammonia are detectable within one hour after application of phosphinothricin. == Toxicity == === Exposure to humans in foods === As glufosinate is often used as a pre-harvest desiccant, it can be found in foods that humans ingest. Such foods include potatoes, peas, beans, corn, wheat, and barley. In addition, the chemical can be passed to humans through animals who are fed contaminated straw. Flour processed from wheat grain that contained traces of glufosinate was found to retain 10-100% of the chemicals' residues. The herbicide is also persistent; it has been found to be prevalent in spinach, radishes, wheat and carrots that were planted 120 days after the treatment of the herbicide. Its persistent nature can also be observed by its half-life which varies from 3 to 70 days depending on the soil type and organic matter content. Residues can remain in frozen food for up to two years and the chemical is not easily destroyed by cooking the food item in boiling water. The EPA classifies the chemical as 'persistent' and 'mobile' based on its lack of degradation and ease of transport through soil. A study revealed the presence of circulating PAGMF in women with and without pregnancy, paving the way for a new field in reproductive toxicology including nutrition and utero-placental toxicities === Exposure limits === There are no exposure limits established by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The WHO/FAO recommended acceptable daily intake (ADI) for glufosinate is 0.02 mg/kg. The European Food Safety Authority has set an ADI of 0.021 mg/kg. The Acute reference dose (ARfD) for child-bearing women is 0.021 mg/kg. == Regulation == Glufosinate is a United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA registered chemical. It is also a California registered chemical. It is not banned in the country and it is not a PIC pesticide. There are no exposure limits established by OSHA or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. Glufosinate is not approved for use as an herbicide in Europe; it was last reviewed in 2007 and that registration expired in 2018. It has been withdrawn from the French market since October 24, 2017 by the Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail due to its classification as a possible reprotoxic chemical (R1b). == References == == External links == BASF's site of LibertyLink crops ""Basta technical guide"" (PDF).

1873,"('Colchicine', 'Colchisol', 'Colchicin', 'Colchineos', 'Colcin')",Medical,"Colchicine is a medication used to prevent and treat gout, to treat familial Mediterranean fever and Behçet's disease, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. The American College of Rheumatology recommends colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids in the treatment of gout. Other uses for colchicine include the management of pericarditis. Colchicine is taken by mouth. The injectable route of administration for colchicine can be toxic. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration removed all injectable colchicine from the US market. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, so overdosing is a significant risk. Common side effects of colchicine include gastrointestinal upset, particularly at high doses. Severe side effects may include pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) and rhabdomyolysis (damage to skeletal muscle), and the medication can be deadly in overdose. Whether colchicine is safe for use during pregnancy is unclear, but its use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Colchicine works by decreasing inflammation via multiple mechanisms. Colchicine, in the form of the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was used as early as 1500 BC to treat joint swelling. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 197th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Colchicine is used in plant breeding to induce polyploidy, in which the number of chromosomes in plant cells are doubled. This helps produce larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general, more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. == Medical uses == === Gout === Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when treating gout. Low doses (1.2 mg in one hour, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later) appear to be well tolerated and may reduce gout symptoms and pain, perhaps as effectively as NSAIDs. At higher doses, side effects (primarily diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) limit its use. For treating gout symptoms, colchicine is taken orally, with or without food, as symptoms first appear. Subsequent doses may be needed if symptoms worsen. There is preliminary evidence that daily colchicine may be effective as a long-term prophylaxis when used with allopurinol to reduce the risk of increased uric acid levels and acute gout flares; adverse gastrointestinal effects may occur, though overall the risk of serious side effects is low. === Risk of cardiovascular disorders === In June 2023, the US FDA approved a low-dose regimen of colchicine (brand name Lodoco) to reduce the risk of further disorders in adults with existing cardiovascular diseases. As an anti-inflammatory drug, Lodoco in a dose of 0.5 mg per day reduced the rate of cardiovascular events by 31% in people with established atherosclerosis and by 23% in people with recent myocardial infarction. Colchicine was most effective in combination therapy with lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications. The mechanism for this effect of colchicine is unknown. === Other conditions === Colchicine is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for long-term treatment of Behçet's disease. It appears to have limited effect in relapsing polychondritis, as it may only be useful for the treatment of chondritis and mild skin symptoms. It is a component of therapy for several other conditions, including pericarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, biliary cirrhosis, various vasculitides, pseudogout, spondyloarthropathy, calcinosis, scleroderma, and amyloidosis. Research regarding the efficacy of colchicine in many of these diseases has not been performed. It is also used in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, in which it reduces attacks and the long-term risk of amyloidosis. Colchicine is effective for prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. In people with recent myocardial infarction (recent heart attack), it has been found to reduce risk of future cardiovascular events. Its clinical use may grow to include this indication. == Contraindications == Long-term (prophylactic) regimens of oral colchicine are absolutely contraindicated in people with advanced kidney failure (including those on dialysis). About 10–20% of a colchicine dose is excreted unchanged by the kidneys; it is not removed by hemodialysis. Cumulative toxicity is a high probability in this clinical setting, and a severe neuromyopathy may result. The presentation includes a progressive onset of proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Colchicine toxicity can be potentiated by the concomitant use of cholesterol-lowering drugs. == Adverse effects == Deaths – both accidental and intentional – have resulted from overdose of colchicine. Typical side effects of moderate doses may include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and neutropenia. High doses can also damage bone marrow, lead to anemia, and cause hair loss. All of these side effects can result from inhibition of mitosis, which may include neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis. == Toxicity == According to one review, colchicine poisoning by overdose (range of acute doses of 7 to 26 mg) begins with a gastrointestinal phase occurring 10–24 hours after ingestion, followed by multiple organ dysfunction occurring 24 hours to 7 days after ingestion, after which the affected person either declines into multiple organ failure or recovers over several weeks. Colchicine can be toxic when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed in the eyes. It can cause a temporary clouding of the cornea and be absorbed into the body, causing systemic toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine overdose start 2 to 24 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested, and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This can cause hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the gastrointestinal tract, which can be fatal. If the affected persons survive the gastrointestinal phase of toxicity, they may experience multiple organ failure and critical illness. This includes kidney damage, which causes low urine output and bloody urine; low white blood cell counts that can last for several days; anemia; muscular weakness; liver failure; hepatomegaly; bone marrow suppression; thrombocytopenia; and ascending paralysis leading to potentially fatal respiratory failure. Neurologic symptoms are also evident, including seizures, confusion, and delirium; children may experience hallucinations. Recovery may begin within six to eight days and begins with rebound leukocytosis and alopecia as organ functions return to normal. Long-term exposure to colchicine can lead to toxicity, particularly of the bone marrow, kidney, and nerves. Effects of long-term colchicine toxicity include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low white blood cell counts, aplastic anemia, alopecia, rash, purpura, vesicular dermatitis, kidney damage, anuria, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy. No specific antidote for colchicine is known, but supportive care is used in cases of overdose. In the immediate period after an overdose, monitoring for gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysrhythmias, and respiratory depression is appropriate, and may require gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal or gastric lavage. Because colchicine is so toxic, chemists are continuing to try to synthesize derivatives of the molecule that decrease the toxicity. The most important aspect of these derivatives is that they keep the tropolone ring (the ring with the methoxy group and the carbonyl) intact to retain the mechanistic properties of the molecule. === Mechanism of toxicity === With overdoses, colchicine becomes toxic as an extension of its cellular mechanism of action via binding to tubulin. Cells so affected undergo impaired protein assembly with reduced endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular motility, and interrupted function of heart cells, culminating in multiple organ failure. === Epidemiology === In the United States, several hundred cases of colchicine toxicity are reported annually, about 10% of which end with serious morbidity or mortality. Many of these cases are intentional overdoses, but others were accidental; for example, if the drug were not dosed appropriately for kidney function. Most cases of colchicine toxicity occur in adults. Many of these adverse events resulted from the use of intravenous colchicine. == Drug interactions == Colchicine interacts with the P-glycoprotein transporter, and the CYP3A4 enzyme involved in drug and toxin metabolism. Fatal drug interactions have occurred when colchicine was taken with other drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as erythromycin or clarithromycin. People taking macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, or cyclosporine, or those who have liver or kidney disease, should not take colchicine, as these drugs and conditions may interfere with colchicine metabolism and raise its blood levels, potentially increasing its toxicity abruptly. Symptoms of toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, muscle pain, low blood cell counts, and organ failure. People with HIV/AIDS taking atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir may experience colchicine toxicity. Grapefruit juice and statins can also increase colchicine concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === In gout, inflammation in joints results from the precipitation of uric acid as needle-like crystals of monosodium urate in and around synovial fluid and soft tissues of joints. These crystal deposits cause inflammatory arthritis, which is initiated and sustained by mechanisms involving various proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. Colchicine accumulates in white blood cells and affects them in a variety of ways - decreasing motility, mobilization (especially chemotaxis), and adhesion. Under preliminary research are various mechanisms by which colchicine may interfere with gout inflammation: Inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to its constitutive protein, tubulin As availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, colchicine may inhibit mitosis Inhibits activation and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation Interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate interleukin-1β activation, a component of inflammation Inhibits superoxide anion production in response to urate crystals Interrupts mast cell and lysosome degranulation Inhibits release of glycoproteins that promote chemotaxis from synovial cells and neutrophils Generally, colchicine appears to inhibit multiple proinflammatory mechanisms, while enabling increased levels of anti-inflammatory mediators. Apart from inhibiting mitosis, colchicine inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect, which has efficacy for inhibiting or preventing gout inflammation. === Pharmacokinetics === Colchicine appears to be a peripherally selective drug with limited brain uptake due to binding to P-glycoprotein. == History == The plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale), was described for treatment of rheumatism and swelling in the Ebers Papyrus (circa 1500 BC), an Egyptian medical text. It is a toxic alkaloid and secondary metabolite. Colchicum extract was first described as a treatment for gout in De Materia Medica by Pedanius Dioscorides, in the first century AD. Use of the bulb-like corms of Colchicum to treat gout probably dates to around 550 AD, as the ""hermodactyl"" recommended by Alexander of Tralles. Colchicum corms were used by the Persian physician Avicenna, and were recommended by Ambroise Paré in the 16th century, and appeared in the London Pharmacopoeia of 1618. Colchicum use waned over time, likely due to the severe gastrointestinal side effects preparations caused. In 1763, Colchicum was recorded as a remedy for dropsy (now called edema) among other illnesses. Colchicum plants were brought to North America by Benjamin Franklin, who had gout himself and had written humorous doggerel about the disease during his stint as United States Ambassador to France. Colchicine was first isolated in 1820 by French chemists P. S. Pelletier and J. B. Caventou. In 1833, P. L. Geiger purified an active ingredient, which he named colchicine. It quickly became a popular remedy for gout. The determination of colchicine's structure required decades, although in 1945, Michael Dewar made an important contribution when he suggested that, among the molecule's three rings, two were seven-member rings. Its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects for gout were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin. The full synthesis of colchicine was achieved by the Swiss organic chemist Albert Eschenmoser in 1959. === United States === ==== Colcrys, the Unapproved Drugs Initiative, and controversy ==== In 2006, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety program called the Unapproved Drugs Initiative—through which the FDA sought more rigorous testing of efficacy and safety of colchicine and other unapproved drugs. This program was in response to multiple deaths caused by ""unapproved products."". After the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was signed into law in June 24, 1938, the FDA had the regulatory authority to mandate drugs be reviewed for safety prior to approval. Drugs approved before June 24, 1938, were grandfathered, as long as their manufacturing, ingredients, and labeling remained unchanged. In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&C Act gave the FDA the authority to also require efficacy as a condition for drug approval. Drugs approved after June 24, 1938, but before 1962 had a limited time to be reviewed for efficacy to remain on the market. This was known as the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). As of today there are only a handful of drugs still on the DESI list and in 2006, the FDA stated it was not aware of any grandfathered drugs. By 2006, URL Pharma decided to research colchicine to see if this unapproved product could gain legal FDA approval. Colchicine was a narrow therapeutic index drug that was implicated in numerous death leading to the FDA forcefully removing injectable colchicine from the US Market. At this time oral colchicine was being used to treat gout attacks. The only placebo control trial conducted using colchicine for acute gout attacks instructed physicians to give colchicine until pain relief or toxicity. All patients on the colchicine arm had adverse events. Despite its toxicity, unapproved oral colchicine was still prescribed using this dosing regimen. In addition, at this time, oral colchicine was also used to treat the often fatal disease Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). In July 2009, the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares). This resulted in a 3-year regulatory market exclusivity in the acute and chronic gout indications and a 7-year exclusivity on the FMF indication. In addition, there are 17 patents on colchicine, listed in the FDA Orange Book which may confer additional exclusivity. At the time of approval, there were no FDA-approved single-agent colchicine products (brand or generic) in the United States. The unapproved, illegally marketed colchicine products were forcibly removed by the FDA in October 2010. ===== Controversy ===== The events that led to the approval of Colcrys, the clearance of the illegally sold non-FDA approved colchicine products, Colcrys pricing, and the sale of URL Pharma still are controversial today. Before the Colcrys approval, unapproved colchicine products were being illegally sold in the United States for under 10 cents a pill. These products were also labeled in an unsafe manner and not manufactured under FDA inspection. URL conducted one Phase 3 clinical trial and at least 12 other trials to gain the approval of Colcrys. URL Pharma priced Colcrys at $4.85 a pill drawing the ire of many groups. In 2012, Asia's biggest drugmaker, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., acquired URL Pharma for $800 million including the rights to Colcrys. == Sources and uses == === Physical properties === Colchicine has a melting point of 142-150 °C. It has a molecular weight of 399.4 grams per mole. === Structure === Colchicine has one stereocenter located at carbon 7. The natural configuration of this stereocenter is S. The molecule also contains one chiral axis - the single bond between rings A and C. The natural configuration of this axis is aS. Although colchicine has four stereoisomers, the only one found in nature is the aS,7s configuration. === Light sensitivity === Colchicine is a light-sensitive compound, so needs to be stored in a dark bottle. Upon exposure to light, colchicine undergoes photoisomerization and transforms into structural isomers, called lumicolchicine. After this transformation, colchicine is no longer effective in its mechanistic binding to tubulin, so is not effective as a drug. === Regulation === It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002) and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. === Formulations and dosing === Trade names for colchicine are Colcrys or Mitigare, which are manufactured as a dark– and light-blue capsule having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is also prepared as a white, yellow, or purple pill (tablet) having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is typically prescribed to mitigate or prevent the onset of gout, or its continuing symptoms and pain, using a low-dose prescription of 0.6 to 1.2 mg per day, or a high-dose amount of up to 4.8 mg in the first 6 hours of a gout episode. With an oral dose of 0.6 mg, peak blood levels occur within one to two hours. For treating gout, the initial effects of colchicine occur in a window of 12 to 24 hours, with a peak within 48 to 72 hours. It has a narrow therapeutic window, requiring monitoring of the subject for potential toxicity. Colchicine is not a general pain-relief drug, and is not used to treat pain in other disorders. === Biosynthesis === According to laboratory research, the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Giving radioactive phenylalanine-2-14C to C. byzantinum, another plant of the family Colchicaceae, resulted in its incorporation into colchicine. However, the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted from the expansion of the tyrosine ring. Radioactive feeding experiments of C. autumnale revealed that colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from (S)-autumnaline. That biosynthetic pathway occurs primarily through a phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes O-methylation directed by S-adenosylmethionine. Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring lead to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by N-formyldemecolcine. N-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule demecolcine, which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after the addition of acetyl-coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine. === Purification === Colchicine may be purified from Colchicum autumnale (autumn crocus) or Gloriosa superba (glory lily). Concentrations of colchicine in C. autumnale peak in the summer, and range from 0.1% in the flower to 0.8% in the bulb and seeds. === Botanical use and seedless fruit === Colchicine is used in plant breeding by inducing polyploidy in plant cells to produce new or improved varieties, strains, and cultivars. When used to induce polyploidy in plants, colchicine cream is usually applied to a growth point of the plant, such as an apical tip, shoot, or sucker. Seeds can be presoaked in a colchicine solution before planting. Since chromosome segregation is driven by microtubules, colchicine alters cellular division by inhibiting chromosome segregation during mitosis; half the resulting daughter cells, therefore, contain no chromosomes, while the other half contains double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid), and lead to cell nuclei with double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid). While this would be fatal in most higher animal cells, in plant cells, it is not only usually well-tolerated, but also frequently results in larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. For this reason, this type of genetic manipulation is frequently used in breeding plants commercially. When such a tetraploid plant is crossed with a diploid plant, the triploid offspring are usually sterile (unable to produce fertile seeds or spores), although many triploids can be propagated vegetatively. Growers of annual triploid plants not readily propagated vegetatively cannot produce a second-generation crop from the seeds (if any) of the triploid crop and need to buy triploid seed from a supplier each year. Many sterile triploid plants, including some trees and shrubs, are becoming increasingly valued in horticulture and landscaping because they do not become invasive species and do not drop undesirable fruit and seed litter. In certain species, colchicine-induced triploidy has been used to create ""seedless"" fruit, such as seedless watermelons (Citrullus lanatus). Since most triploids do not produce pollen themselves, such plants usually require cross-pollination with a diploid parent to induce seedless fruit production. The ability of colchicine to induce polyploidy can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, for example in breeding triticale (× Triticosecale) from wheat (Triticum spp.) and rye (Secale cereale). Wheat is typically tetraploid and rye diploid, with their triploid hybrid infertile; treatment of triploid triticale with colchicine gives fertile hexaploid triticale. == References == == External links == ""Colchicine : Biotoxin"".

1874,"('Aspartame', 'Nutrasweet', 'Asp-phe-ome', 'Asp-phe methyl ester', 'Aspartam')","Food, Medical","Aspartame is an artificial non-saccharide sweetener commonly used as a sugar substitute in foods and beverages. 200 times sweeter than sucrose, it is a methyl ester of the aspartic acid/phenylalanine dipeptide with brand names NutraSweet, Equal, and Canderel. Discovered in 1965, aspartame was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974 and re-approved in 1981 after its initial approval was briefly revoked. Aspartame is one of the most studied food additives in the human food supply. Reviews by over 100 governmental regulatory bodies found the ingredient safe for consumption at the normal acceptable daily intake limit. == Uses == Aspartame is about 180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces roughly the same energy per gram when metabolized as sucrose does, 4 kcal (17 kJ), the quantity of aspartame needed to produce the same sweetness is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible. The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame potassium to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar. Like many other peptides, aspartame may hydrolyze (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high pH. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in maltodextrin. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on pH. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its half-life is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its half-life is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as syrups for fountain beverages, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as saccharin. Descriptive analyses of solutions containing aspartame report a sweet aftertaste as well as bitter and off-flavor aftertastes. == Acceptable levels of consumption == The acceptable daily intake (ADI) value for food additives, including aspartame, is defined as the ""amount of a food additive, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk"". The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food (later becoming EFSA) have determined this value is 40 mg/kg of body weight per day for aspartame, while the FDA has set its ADI for aspartame at 50 mg/kg per day – an amount equated to consuming 75 packets of commercial aspartame sweetener per day to be within a safe upper limit. The primary source for exposure to aspartame in the US is diet soft drinks, though it can be consumed in other products, such as pharmaceutical preparations, fruit drinks, and chewing gum among others in smaller quantities. A 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml; 12 imp fl oz) can of diet soda contains 0.18 grams (0.0063 oz) of aspartame, and, for a 75-kilogram (165 lb) adult, it takes approximately 21 cans of diet soda daily to consume the 3.7 grams (0.13 oz) of aspartame that would surpass the FDA's 50 mg/kg of body weight ADI of aspartame from diet soda alone. Reviews have analyzed studies which have looked at the consumption of aspartame in countries worldwide, including the US, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame. Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of aspartame, such as children and diabetics, are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption. In a report released on 10 December 2013, the EFSA said that, after an extensive examination of evidence, it ruled out the ""potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer"" and deemed the amount found in diet sodas safe to consume. == Safety and health effects == The safety of aspartame has been studied since its discovery, and it is a rigorously tested food ingredient. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), UK Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Health Canada, and Food Standards Australia New Zealand. === Metabolism and body weight === As of 2017, reviews of clinical trials showed that using aspartame (or other non-nutritive sweeteners) in place of sugar reduces calorie intake and body weight in adults and children. A 2017 review of metabolic effects by consuming aspartame found that it did not affect blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, calorie intake, or body weight. While high-density lipoprotein levels were higher compared to control, they were lower compared to sucrose. In 2023, the World Health Organization recommended against the use of common non-sugar sweeteners (NSS), including aspartame, to control body weight or lower the risk of non-communicable diseases, stating: ""The recommendation is based on the findings of a systematic review of the available evidence which suggests that use of NSS does not confer any long-term benefit in reducing body fat in adults or children. Results of the review also suggest that there may be potential undesirable effects from long-term use of NSS, such as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality in adults."" === Phenylalanine === High levels of the naturally occurring essential amino acid phenylalanine are a health hazard to those born with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Because aspartame contains phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the US must state: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine"" on product labels. In the UK, foods that contain aspartame are required by the Food Standards Agency to list the substance as an ingredient, with the warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine"". Manufacturers are also required to print ""with sweetener(s)"" on the label close to the main product name on foods that contain ""sweeteners such as aspartame"" or ""with sugar and sweetener(s)"" on ""foods that contain both sugar and sweetener"". In Canada, foods that contain aspartame are required to list aspartame among the ingredients, include the amount of aspartame per serving, and state that the product contains phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is one of the essential amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in neurotransmitter levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters to each other in the blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and, while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function. As with methanol and aspartic acid, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption. === Cancer === As of 2023, regulatory agencies, including the FDA and EFSA, and the US National Cancer Institute, have concluded that consuming aspartame is safe in amounts within acceptable daily intake levels and does not cause cancer. These conclusions are based on various sources of evidence, such as reviews and epidemiological studies finding no association between aspartame and cancer. In July 2023, scientists for the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that there was ""limited evidence"" for aspartame causing cancer in humans, classifying the sweetener as Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic). The lead investigator of the IARC report stated that the classification ""shouldn't really be taken as a direct statement that indicates that there is a known cancer hazard from consuming aspartame. This is really more of a call to the research community to try to better clarify and understand the carcinogenic hazard that may or may not be posed by aspartame consumption."" The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) added that the limited cancer assessment indicated no reason to change the recommended acceptable daily intake level of 40 mg per kg of body weight per day, reaffirming the safety of consuming aspartame within this limit. The FDA responded to the report by stating: Aspartame being labeled by IARC as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" does not mean that aspartame is actually linked to cancer. The FDA disagrees with IARC's conclusion that these studies support classifying aspartame as a possible carcinogen to humans. FDA scientists reviewed the scientific information included in IARC's review in 2021 when it was first made available and identified significant shortcomings in the studies on which IARC relied. === Neurological safety === Reviews found no evidence that low doses of aspartame had neurotoxic effects. A 2019 policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that there were no safety concerns about aspartame in fetal or childhood development or as a factor in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. === Headaches === Reviews have found little evidence to indicate that aspartame induces headaches, although certain subsets of consumers may be sensitive to it. === Water quality === Aspartame passes through wastewater treatment plants mainly unchanged. == Mechanism of action == The perceived sweetness of aspartame (and other sweet substances like acesulfame potassium) in humans is due to its binding of the heterodimer G protein-coupled receptor formed by the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3. Rodents do not experience aspartame as sweet-tasting, due to differences in their taste receptors. === Metabolites === Aspartame is rapidly hydrolyzed in the small intestine by digestive enzymes which break aspartame down into methanol, phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and further metabolites, such as formaldehyde and formic acid. Due to its rapid and complete metabolism, aspartame is not found in circulating blood, even following ingestion of high doses over 200 mg/kg. ==== Aspartic acid ==== Aspartic acid (aspartate) is one of the most common amino acids in the typical diet. As with methanol and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. ==== Methanol ==== The methanol produced by aspartame metabolism is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons. The amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from food sources already in diets. With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid, and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic. == Chemistry == Aspartame is a methyl ester of the dipeptide of the natural amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. Under strongly acidic or alkaline conditions, aspartame may generate methanol by hydrolysis. Under more severe conditions, the peptide bonds are also hydrolyzed, resulting in free amino acids. Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected with a formyl group as the formamide, by treatment of aspartic acid with a mixture of formic acid and acetic anhydride. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the N-formyl aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid anhydride links to phenylalanine, with desired and undesired isomer forming in a 4:1 ratio. A process using an enzyme from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried but not scaled for industrial production. == History == Aspartame was discovered by accident in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for G.D. Searle & Company in Skokie, Illinois. Schlatter had synthesized aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone gastrin, for use in assessing an anti-ulcer drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper. Torunn Atteraas Garin participated in the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. In 1975, prompted by issues regarding Flagyl and Aldactone, an FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported ""serious deficiencies in Searle's operations and practices"". The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety. In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and brain cancer. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause brain damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.: 94–96 In 1983, the FDA approved aspartame for use in carbonated beverages and for use in other beverages, baked goods, and confections in 1993. In 1996, the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame, allowing it to be used in all foods. As of May 2023, the FDA stated that it regards aspartame as a safe food ingredient when consumed within the acceptable daily intake level of 50 mg per kg of body weight per day. Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported in 2006 that the previously established Acceptable daily intake (ADI) was appropriate, after reviewing yet another set of studies. === Compendial status === British Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == Commercial uses == Under the brand names Equal, NutraSweet, and Canderel, aspartame is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, instant coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers, and yogurt. It is provided as a table condiment in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for baking than other sweeteners because it breaks down when heated and loses much of its sweetness. === NutraSweet Company === In 1985, Monsanto bought G.D. Searle, and the aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, NutraSweet. In March 2000, Monsanto sold it to J.W. Childs Associates Equity Partners II L.P. European use patents on aspartame expired beginning in 1987, with the US patent following suit in 1992. === Ajinomoto === In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which Ajinomoto, the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40% share, was 14,000 metric tons (15,000 short tons; 14,000 long tons) a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2% a year. Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from Monsanto for $67 million (equivalent to $113 million in 2023). In 2007, Asda was the first British supermarket chain to remove all artificial flavourings and colours in its store brand foods. In 2008, Ajinomoto sued Asda, part of Walmart, for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the substance was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other ""nasties"". In July 2009, a British court ruled in favor of Asda. In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation. Asda said that it would continue to use the term ""no nasties"" on its own-label products, but the suit was settled in 2011 with Asda choosing to remove references to aspartame from its packaging. In November 2009, Ajinomoto announced a new brand name for its aspartame sweetener — AminoSweet. === Holland Sweetener Company === A joint venture of DSM and Tosoh, the Holland Sweetener Company manufactured aspartame using the enzymatic process developed by Toyo Soda (Tosoh) and sold as the brand Sanecta. Additionally, they developed a combination aspartame-acesulfame salt under the brand name Twinsweet. They left the sweetener industry in 2006, because ""global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years"", making the business ""persistently unprofitable"". === PepsiCo. === In 2023, with aspartame already being present in Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Max, PepsiCo. replaced much of the sugar in Pepsi sold in the UK with aspartame, angering many consumers, especially since the company had not made any effort to warn of the change, endangering people with phenylketonuria who are regular consumers of soda. === Competing products === Because sucralose, unlike aspartame, retains its sweetness after being heated, and has at least twice the shelf life of aspartame, it has become more popular as an ingredient. This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to sucralose. In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30 per kilogram ($14/lb) and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300 per kilogram ($140/lb). == See also == Sugar substitute == References == == External links == Media related to Aspartame at Wikimedia Commons",Aspartam,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -2.176947600673884e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0008189899963326752), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.5760459303855896), ('ĠINDU', -0.5835963487625122), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -2.622600959512056e-06), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038082610815763474)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -7.493430894101039e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Aspartame', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartame?utm_source=openai')])"

It is used as an eye drop. Effects begin within three hours and last for at least eight hours. It is also available as the combination dorzolamide/timolol. Common side effects include eye discomfort, eye redness, taste changes, and blurry vision. Serious side effects include Steven Johnson syndrome. Those allergic to sulfonamides may be allergic to dorzolamide. Use is not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and works by decreasing the production of aqueous humor. Dorzolamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1994. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 201st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Dorzolamide is used to lower excessive intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This drug is able to cross the cornea, reach the ciliary body of the eye, and produce systemic effects on the carbonic anhydrase enzyme within the eye. == Side effects == Ocular stinging, burning, itching and bitter taste. It causes shallowing of the anterior chamber and leads to transient myopia. As a second generation carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, dorzolamide avoids systemic effects associated with first generation carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, and dichlorphenamide. == Pharmacodynamics == Dorzolamide lowers intraocular pressure by about 20%. Normally, carbonic anhydrase converts carbonic acid (H2CO3) into bicarbonate (HCO3), releasing a proton (H+) into solution. The H+ is then exchanged for sodium (Na+) ions, which facilitates the production of aqueous humor . By blocking the function of carbonic anhydrase, the Na+/H+ exchange is unable to occur, which leads to a decrease in Na+ in the cell and prevents aqueous humor production . == History == Dorzolamide, developed by Merck, was the first medication in human therapy (market introduction 1995) that resulted from structure-based drug design. It was developed to circumvent the systemic side effects of acetazolamide which has to be taken orally. == References == == Further reading == Kubinyi H (1999).

As of 2017, it was not known whether stiripentol remains useful as children become adolescents or adults. == Contraindications == Stiripentol must not be used in people who have had psychosis (a serious mental state with a distorted sense of reality) with attacks of delirium (a mental state with confusion, excitement, restlessness and hallucinations). == Adverse effects == Very common (more than 10% of people) adverse effects include loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia, drowsiness, ataxia, hypotonia, and dystonia. Common (between 1% and 10% of people) adverse effects include neutropenia (sometimes severe), aggressiveness, irritability, behavior disorders, opposing behavior, hyperexcitability, sleep disorders, hyperkinesias, nausea, vomiting, and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase. == Interactions == Stiripentol inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and so interacts with many anticonvulsants and other medicines. == Pharmacology == As with most anticonvulsants, the precise mechanism of action is unknown. Regardless, stiripentol has been shown to have anticonvulsant effects of its own. Stiripentol increases GABAergic activity. At clinically relevant concentrations, it enhances central GABA neurotransmission through a barbiturate-like effect, since it increases the duration of opening of GABA-A receptor channels in hippocampal slices. It has also been shown to increase GABA levels in brain tissues by interfering with its reuptake and metabolism. Specifically, it has been shown to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase, which is an important enzyme involved in the energy metabolism of neurons. Inhibition of this enzyme can make neurons less prone to fire action potentials, likely through activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Stiripentol also improves the effectiveness of many other anticonvulsants, possibly due to its inhibition of certain enzymes, slowing the drugs' metabolism and increasing blood plasma levels. == Chemistry == Stiripentol is an α-ethylene alcohol; its chemical formula is 4,4-dimethyl-1-[3,4-(methylendioxy)-phenyl]-1penten-3-ol. It is chiral and used medically as the racemate. The R enantiomer appears to be around 2.5 times more active than the S enantiomer. == History == Stiripentol was discovered in 1978 by scientists at Biocodex and clinical trials started over the next few years. It was originally developed for adults with focal seizures, but failed a Phase III trial. In December 2001, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted stiripentol orphan drug status (designation number EU/3/01/071) for the treatment of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI, also known as Dravet's syndrome) in children and in January 2007, the EMA granted the drug a marketing authorisation for use of the drug as an add-on to other anti-seizure drugs. It was approved in Canada for this use in May 2013. As of 2017, it was also approved for this use in Japan. In August 2018, stiripentol was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunctive therapy for Dravet Syndrome. == Society and culture == === Economics === Prior to approval in the US, parents of children with Dravet Syndrome were paying around $1,000 for a month supply to obtain it from Europe. == References ==",Diacomit,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.111314072157256e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001006075763143599)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiripentol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Stiripentol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiripentol?utm_source=openai')])"

1881,"('Phenformin (hydrochloride)', 'Phenethylbiguanide hydrochloride', 'N-phenethylbiguanide', 'Fenformin', 'Phenformine')",Medical,"Phenformin is an antidiabetic drug from the biguanide class. It was marketed as DBI by Ciba-Geigy, but was withdrawn from most markets in the late 1970s due to a high risk of lactic acidosis, which was fatal in 50% of cases. Phenformin was developed in 1957 by Ungar, Freedman and Seymour Shapiro, working for the U.S. Vitamin Corporation. Clinical trials begun in 1958 showed it to be effective, but with gastrointestinal side effects. == Toxicity == Phenformin sales began to decline in the U.S. from 1973 due to negative trial studies and reports of lactic acidosis. By October 1976, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Endocrinology and Metabolism Advisory Committee recommended phenformin be removed from the market. The FDA began formal proceedings in May 1977, leading to Phenformin's eventual withdrawal on November 15, 1978. In 1977, 385,000 patients with early-stage diabetes were taking phenformin in the U.S.. Ralph Nader's Health Research Group put the U.S. government under pressure to ban the drug. Ciba-Geigy Corp resisted, claiming there was no satisfactory alternative for many patients. But in July the FDA declared the drug an ""imminent hazard to the public health"" and gave doctors 90 days to switch to an alternative treatment (such as insulin, dietary restrictions or other drugs). As of 2008, phenformin was still legally available in Italy, Brazil, Uruguay, China, Poland, Greece and Portugal and cases of phenformin-induced lactic acidosis continued to be reported worldwide. In Hong Kong, where phenformin is banned, cases of phenformin-induced lactic acidosis occurred after taking Chinese proprietary medicines, claiming to be herbal, which were adulterated with phenformin. In the U.S., in 2001 the FDA recalled Chinese ""herbal products"" containing phenformin. The related drug metformin is considerably safer than phenformin, with three cases of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient-years compared to 64 cases per 100,000 patient-years, and those are mostly confined to patients with impaired renal function. == Chemistry and pharmacokinetics == Phenformin hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder, with a melting point of 175–178 °C; it is soluble at 1 in 8 parts of water and 1 in 15 of ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Phenformin is less polar and more lipid soluble and exhibits a higher affinity for mitochondrial membranes than metformin. Its dissociation constant (pKa) is 2.7, 11.8 (at 32 °C), and log P = –0.8. Phenformin is well absorbed after oral administration. The major metabolic reaction is aromatic hydroxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenformin, which is then conjugated with glucuronic acid. Up to about 50% of a dose is excreted in the urine in 24 h, about two–thirds in the form of unchanged drug and one–third as the hydroxy metabolite. Following a single oral dose of 50 mg to eight subjects, peak plasma concentrations of 0.08–0.18 mg/L (mean 0.13) were attained in about 3 h; plasma concentrations were higher in four subjects who were poor metabolisers of debrisoquine in comparison with the four extensive metabolisers. Following daily oral doses of 50 mg three times a day to eight subjects, plasma concentrations of 0.10–0.24 mg/L (mean 0.18) were reported 2 h after a dose. Plasma half-life of phenformin is 10–15 h. Phenformin protein binding in plasma is about 12–20%. == Research == Vladimir Dilman first proposed in 1971 that biguanides like metformin and phenformin may have potential to treat cancer, prevent cancer, and to extend life, an idea that was subsequently supported by in vitro and animal studies, as well as an apparent reduction in the incidence of cancer in people taking metformin for diabetes. Laboratory studies attribute these apparent effects to inhibition of mTOR, inhibition of complex I, with phenformin being a more potent inhibitor than metformin, It appears that inhibition of complex I may cause diminished TCA cycle intermediate production and decreased mitochondrial ATP production thus resulting in AMPK activation and lower mTOR activity. == See also == Buformin == References ==",Phenformine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.08139493316411972), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.38704949617385864), (' INDUSTR', -0.0005911595653742552), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.83301836438477e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048609811812639236)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/phenformine,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/DD5K7529CE,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00914 ', [])"
1882,"('Urapidil', 'Ebrantil', 'Eupressyl', 'Mediatensyl', 'Uraprene')",Medical,"Urapidil is a sympatholytic antihypertensive drug. It acts as an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist and as an 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Although an initial report suggested that urapidil was also an α2-adrenoceptor agonist, this was not substantiated in later studies that demonstrated it was devoid of agonist actions in the dog saphenous vein and the guinea-pig ileum. Unlike some other α1-adrenoceptor antagonists, urapidil does not elicit reflex tachycardia, and this may be related to its weak β1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, as well as its effect on cardiac vagal drive. Urapidil is currently not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but it is available in Europe. == Medical uses == === D/T and reperfusion injuries === Urapidil has been determined to aid in the recovery of torsion detorsion (T/D) injuries in ovaries and testes, as well as ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) renal injuries. Both of these conditions are directly associated with one another as T/D injuries commonly lead to ischemia, or the lack of blood flow. Urapidil is able to reduce inflammatory response, apoptosis and act as an antioxidant through a variety of pathways. During the detorsion phase of an injury, reperfusion, or the restoration of blood flow is important, but can also cause injuries to the affected tissue through apoptosis and the generation of ROS. Oxidative stress also plays a vital role in D/T and I/R injuries and is marked by malondialdehyde, or MDA, levels. MDA can also contribute to tissue damage, particularly by encouraging polymerization and cross-linking of the membranes of the affected cells. Through various studies performed within the past decade, it has been found that urapidil can treat T/D and I/R injuries, particularly stemming from autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation, by elevating levels of SOD, TAS, and GPx within the cell. Both SOD and GPx help to counteract the negative effects of ROS which injures tissue through lipid peroxidation and by damaging DNA. Additionally, urapidil has the ability to counteract autophagy by lowering the quantity of autophagosome marker LC3B and caspase-3 which also plays a critical role in autophagy regulation. == See also == Naftopidil == References ==",Ebrantil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.124556289752945e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015166220255196095)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001584850688232109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.halmed.hr/en/Lijekovi/Baza-lijekova/Ebrantil-60-mg-kapsule-s-produljenim-oslobadanjem/12377/,https://www.drugs.com/international/urapidil.html,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/ebrantil ', [])"
