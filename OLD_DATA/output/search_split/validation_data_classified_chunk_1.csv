100,"('Prednisolone (hemisuccinate)', 'Prednisolone 21-hemisuccinate', 'Prednisolone succinate', 'Prednisolut', 'Prednisolone bisuccinate')",Medical," Prednisolone in the form of its hemisuccinate was given intravenously in two different doses (1200 mg and 75 mg). Plasma levels of the ester and prednisolone were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. The results indicate a dose-dependency in the pharmacokinetics of both hemisuccinate and the free alcohol. For the high dose 8 per cent of the administered ester was found unchanged in the urine indicating incomplete conversion of the pro-drug. Comparison with previous studies leads to the conclusion that prednisolone shows doubled non-linear pharmacokinetics with higher total body clearance in the medium dose range than in the low and high dose range. Volume of distribution changes accordingly, but overall elimination rate remains remarkably constant. Saliva levels of prednisolone were low and agree reasonably well with calculated plasma concentrations of free, non-protein-bound prednisolone. No prednisolone hemisuccinate was found in saliva. Plasma levels of prednisolone and prednisolone hemisuccinate of volunteers were measured with HPLC following i.v. injections of 1200 and 75 mg of prednisolone, given as the water-soluble hemisuccinate ester. The hemisuccinate ester is hydrolyzed relatively quickly with a plasma half-life between 18 and 25 min, and the resulting prednisolone has a plasma half-life of 3.5-3.7 h. The dose dependency of the pharmacokinetic parameters indicates a partial saturation of the metabolizing enzymes as consequence of the application of the high dose of prednisolone. In saliva no hemisuccinate could be detected. The prednisolone saliva concentration corresponds with those of non-protein-bound prednisolone in plasma measured at the same time. Only minor quantities of intact ester (1-8%) or intact prednisolone (2-4%) are excreted in urine. Following the application of 1200 mg prednisolone the endogenous cortisol level is partially suppressed only 24 h after the i.v. injection; 48 h later the difference from the basis value is not statistically significant. Leukocytosis and granulocytosis are at maximum 24 h after the injection of the high dose, and after 48 h normal values are observed. Lymphocytes and monocytes fall below normal levels for a longer time after 1200 mg compared to 75 mg, the minimum is between 4 and 8 h. Glucose levels are enhanced dose-dependently. They are normalized even after the extremely high dose at 24 h. Sodium, potassium, calcium, plasma proteins, urea, creatinine, hematocrit and hemoglobin showed no significant differences within 48 h following the injections.",Prednisolone (hemisuccinate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012866322649642825), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0789482444524765)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB14633?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Prednisolone hemisuccinate: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB14633?utm_source=openai')])"

102,"('Tryptamine', 'Indol-3-ethylamine', 'Tryptamin', 'Indole, 3-(2-aminoethyl)-', '(amino-2 ethyl)-3 indole')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Tryptamine is an indolamine metabolite of the essential amino acid tryptophan. The chemical structure is defined by an indole—a fused benzene and pyrrole ring, and a 2-aminoethyl group at the second carbon (third aromatic atom, with the first one being the heterocyclic nitrogen). The structure of tryptamine is a shared feature of certain aminergic neuromodulators including melatonin, serotonin, bufotenin and psychedelic derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, psilocin and others. Tryptamine has been shown to activate serotonin receptors and trace amine-associated receptors expressed in the mammalian brain, and regulates the activity of dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. In the human gut, bacteria convert dietary tryptophan to tryptamine, which activates 5-HT4 receptors and regulates gastrointestinal motility. Multiple tryptamine-derived drugs have been developed to treat migraines, while trace amine-associated receptors are being explored as a potential treatment target for neuropsychiatric disorders. == Natural occurrences == For a list of plants, fungi and animals containing tryptamines, see List of psychoactive plants and List of naturally occurring tryptamines. === Mammalian brain === Endogenous levels of tryptamine in the mammalian brain are less than 100 ng per gram of tissue. However, elevated levels of trace amines have been observed in patients with certain neuropsychiatric disorders taking medications, such as bipolar depression and schizophrenia. === Mammalian gut microbiome === Tryptamine is relatively abundant in the gut and feces of humans and rodents. Commensal bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus and Clostridium sporogenes in the gastrointestinal tract, possess the enzyme tryptophan decarboxylase, which aids in the conversion of dietary tryptophan to tryptamine. Tryptamine is a ligand for gut epithelial serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptors and regulates gastrointestinal electrolyte balance through colonic secretions. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === To yield tryptamine in vivo, tryptophan decarboxylase removes the carboxylic acid group on the α-carbon of tryptophan. Synthetic modifications to tryptamine can produce serotonin and melatonin; however, these pathways do not occur naturally as the main pathway for endogenous neurotransmitter synthesis. === Catabolism === Monoamine oxidases A and B are the primary enzymes involved in tryptamine metabolism to produce indole-3-acetaldehyde, however it is unclear which isoform is specific to tryptamine degradation. === Figure === == Biological activity == === Serotonin receptor agonist === Tryptamine is known to act as a serotonin receptor agonist, although its potency is limited by rapid inactivation by monoamine oxidases. It has specifically been found to act as a full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 7.36 ± 0.56 nM; Emax = 104 ± 4%). Tryptamine was of much lower potency in stimulating the 5-HT2A receptor β-arrestin pathway (EC50 = 3,485 ± 234 nM; Emax = 108 ± 16%). In contrast to the 5-HT2A receptor, tryptamine was found to be inactive at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. ==== Gastrointestinal motility ==== Tryptamine produced by mutualistic bacteria in the human gut activates serotonin GPCRs ubiquitously expressed along the colonic epithelium. Upon tryptamine binding, the activated 5-HT4 receptor undergoes a conformational change which allows its Gs alpha subunit to exchange GDP for GTP, and its liberation from the 5-HT4 receptor and βγ subunit. GTP-bound Gs activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP opens chloride and potassium ion channels to drive colonic electrolyte secretion and promote intestinal motility. === Monoamine releasing agent === Tryptamine has been found to act as a monoamine releasing agent (MRA). It is a releaser of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, in that order of potency (EC50 = 32.6 nM, 164 nM, and 716 nM, respectively). That is, it acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA). === Monoaminergic activity enhancer === Tryptamine is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its serotonin receptor agonism. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The MAE actions of tryptamine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Synthetic and more potent MAEs like benzofuranylpropylaminopentane (BPAP) and indolylpropylaminopentane (IPAP) have been derived from tryptamine. === TAAR1 agonist === Tryptamine is an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). It is a potent TAAR1 full agonist in rats, a weak TAAR1 full agonist in mice, and a very weak TAAR1 partial agonist in humans. Tryptamine may act as a trace neuromodulator in some species via activation of TAAR1 signaling. The TAAR1 is a stimulatory G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is weakly expressed in the intracellular compartment of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. TAAR1 agonists have been implicated in regulating monoaminergic neurotransmission, for instance by activating G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) and reducing neuronal firing via facilitation of membrane hyperpolarization through the efflux of potassium ions. TAAR1 agonists are under investigation as a novel treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, drug addiction, and depression. The TAAR1 is expressed in brain structures associated with dopamine systems, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and serotonin systems in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN). Additionally, the human TAAR1 gene is localized at 6q23.2 on the human chromosome, which is a susceptibility locus for mood disorders and schizophrenia. Activation of TAAR1 suggests a potential novel treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders, as TAAR1 agonists produce antipsychotic-like, anti-addictive, and antidepressant-like effects in animals. === Effects in animals and humans === In a published clinical study, tryptamine, at a total dose of 23 to 277 mg by intravenous infusion, produced hallucinogenic effects or perceptual disturbances similar to those of small doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It also produced other LSD-like effects, including pupil dilation, increased blood pressure, and increased force of the patellar reflex. Tryptamine produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tingling sensations, sweating, and bodily heaviness among others as well. Conversely, there were no changes in heart rate or respiratory rate. The onset of the effects was rapid and the duration was very short. This can be attributed to the very rapid metabolism of tryptamine by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and its very short elimination half-life. In animals, tryptamine, alone and/or in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), produces behavioral changes such as hyperlocomotion and reversal of reserpine-induced behavioral depression. In addition, it produces effects like hyperthermia, tachycardia, myoclonus, and seizures or convulsions, among others. Findings on tryptamine and the head-twitch response in rodents have been mixed, with some studies reporting no effect, some studies reporting induction of head twitches by tryptamine, and others reporting that tryptamine actually antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitches. Another study found that combination of tryptamine with an MAOI dose-dependently produced head twitches. Head twitches in rodents are a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects. Many of the effects of tryptamine can be reversed by serotonin receptor antagonists like metergoline, metitepine (methiothepin), and cyproheptadine. Conversely, the effects of tryptamine in animals are profoundly augmented by MAOIs due to inhibition of its metabolism. Tryptamine seems to also elevate prolactin and cortisol levels in animals and/or humans. The LD50Tooltip median lethal dose values of tryptamine in animals include 100 mg/kg i.p. in mice, 500 mg/kg s.c. in mice, and 223 mg/kg i.p. in rats. == Pharmacokinetics == Tryptamine produced endogenously or administered peripherally is readily able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. This is in contrast to serotonin, which is peripherally selective. Tryptamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Its metabolism is described as extremely rapid and its elimination half-life and duration as very short. In addition, its duration is described as shorter than that of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Brain tryptamine levels are increased up to 300-fold by MAOIs in animals. In addition, the effects of exogenous tryptamine are strongly augmented by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Tryptamine is excreted in urine and its rate of urinary excretion has been reported to be pH-dependent. == Chemistry == Tryptamine is a substituted tryptamine derivative and trace amine and is structurally related to the amino acid tryptophan. The experimental log P of tryptamine is 1.55. === Derivatives === The endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine), as well as trace amines like N-methyltryptamine (NMT), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and bufotenin (N,N-dimethylserotonin), are derivatives of tryptamine. A variety of drugs, including both naturally occurring and pharmaceutical substances, are derivatives of tryptamine. These include the tryptamine psychedelics like psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT; tryptamine stimulants, entactogens, psychedelics, and/or antidepressants like α-methyltryptamine (αMT) and α-ethyltryptamine (αET); triptan antimigraine agents like sumatriptan; certain antipsychotics like oxypertine; and the sleep aid melatonin. Various other drugs, including ergolines and lysergamides like the psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the antimigraine agents ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and methysergide, and the antiparkinsonian agents bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, and pergolide; β-carbolines like harmine (some of which are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)); Iboga alkaloids like the hallucinogen ibogaine; yohimbans like the α2 blocker yohimbine; antipsychotics like ciclindole and flucindole; and the MAOI antidepressant metralindole, can all be thought of as cyclized tryptamine derivatives. Drugs very closely related to tryptamines, but technically not tryptamines themselves, include certain triptans like avitriptan and naratriptan; the antipsychotics sertindole and tepirindole; and the MAOI antidepressants pirlindole and tetrindole. == References == == External links == Tryptamine FAQ Tryptamine Hallucinogens and Consciousness Tryptamind Psychoactives, reference site on tryptamine and other psychoactives.

103,"('Amphotericin b', 'Amphotericin', 'Amphotericine b', 'Fungizone', 'Amfotericina b')",Medical,"Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication used for serious fungal infections and leishmaniasis. The fungal infections it is used to treat include mucormycosis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, and cryptococcosis. For certain infections it is given with flucytosine. It is typically given intravenously. Common side effects include a reaction with fever, chills, and headaches soon after the medication is given, as well as kidney problems. Allergic symptoms including anaphylaxis may occur. Other serious side effects include low blood potassium and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart). It appears to be relatively safe in pregnancy. There is a lipid formulation that has a lower risk of side effects. It is in the polyene class of medications and works in part by interfering with the cell membrane of the fungus. Amphotericin B was isolated from Streptomyces nodosus in 1955 at the Squibb Institute for Medical Research from cultures isolated from the streptomycete obtained from the river bed of Orinoco in that region of Venezuela and came into medical use in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Antifungal === One of the main uses of amphotericin B is treating a wide range of systemic fungal infections. Due to its extensive side effects, it is often reserved for severe infections in critically ill, or immunocompromised patients. It is considered first line therapy for invasive mucormycosis infections, cryptococcal meningitis, and certain aspergillus and candidal infections. It has been a highly effective drug for over fifty years in large part because it has a low incidence of drug resistance in the pathogens it treats. This is because amphotericin B resistance requires sacrifices on the part of the pathogen that make it susceptible to the host environment, and too weak to cause infection. === Antiprotozoal === Amphotericin B is used for life-threatening protozoan infections such as visceral leishmaniasis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. === Spectrum of susceptibility === The following table shows the amphotericin B susceptibility for a selection of medically important fungi. == Available formulations == === Intravenous === Amphotericin B alone is insoluble in normal saline at a pH of 7. Therefore, several formulations have been devised to improve its intravenous bioavailability. Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B are no more effective than conventional formulations, although there is some evidence that lipid-based formulations may be better tolerated by patients and may have fewer adverse effects. ==== Deoxycholate ==== The original formulation uses sodium deoxycholate to improve solubility. Amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD) is administered intravenously. As the original formulation of amphotericin, it is often referred to as ""conventional"" amphotericin. ==== Liposomal ==== In order to improve the tolerability of amphotericin and reduce toxicity, several lipid formulations have been developed. Liposomal formulations have been found to have less renal toxicity than deoxycholate, and fewer infusion-related reactions. They are more expensive than amphotericin B deoxycholate. AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B; LAMB) is a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B for injection and consists of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and distearoyl phosphatidylglycerol that in aqueous media spontaneously arrange into unilamellar vesicles that contain amphotericin B. It was developed by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Gilead Sciences in 1999). It was approved by the FDA in 1997. It is marketed by Gilead in Europe and licensed to Astellas Pharma (formerly Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals) for marketing in the US, and Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in Japan. ==== Lipid complex formulations ==== A number of lipid complex preparations are also available. Abelcet was approved by the FDA in 1995. It consists of amphotericin B and two lipids in a 1:1 ratio that form large ribbon-like structures. Amphotec is a complex of amphotericin and sodium cholesteryl sulfate in a 1:1 ratio. Two molecules of each form a tetramer that aggregate into spiral arms on a disk-like complex. It was approved by the FDA in 1996. === By mouth === An oral preparation exists but is not widely available. The amphipathic nature of amphotericin along with its low solubility and permeability has posed major hurdles for oral administration given its low bioavailability. In the past it had been used for fungal infections of the surface of the GI tract such as thrush, but has been replaced by other antifungals such as nystatin and fluconazole. However, recently novel nanoparticulate drug delivery systems such as AmbiOnp, nanosuspensions, lipid-based drug delivery systems including cochleates, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, solid lipid nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles—such as amphotericin B in pegylated polylactide coglycolide copolymer nanoparticles—have demonstrated potential for oral formulation of amphotericin B. The oral lipid nanocrystal amphotericin by Matinas Biopharma is furthest along having completed a successful phase 2 clinical trial in cryptococcal meningitis. == Side effects == Amphotericin B is well known for its severe and potentially lethal side effects, earning it the nickname ""amphoterrible"". Very often, it causes a serious reaction soon after infusion (within 1 to 3 hours), consisting of high fever, shaking chills, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dyspnea and tachypnea, drowsiness, and generalized weakness. The violent chills and fevers have caused the drug to be nicknamed ""shake and bake"". The precise etiology of the reaction is unclear, although it may involve increased prostaglandin synthesis and the release of cytokines from macrophages. Deoxycholate formulations (ABD) may also stimulate the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils. Reactions sometimes subside with later applications of the drug. This nearly universal febrile response necessitates a critical (and diagnostically difficult) professional determination as to whether the onset of high fever is a novel symptom of a fast-progressing disease, or merely the effect of the drug. To decrease the likelihood and severity of the symptoms, initial doses should be low, and increased slowly. Paracetamol, pethidine, diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone have all been used to treat or prevent the syndrome, but the prophylactic use of these drugs is often limited by the patient's condition. Intravenously administered amphotericin B in therapeutic doses has also been associated with multiple organ damage. Kidney damage, including Type I (distal) renal tubular acidosis, is a frequently reported side effect, and can be severe and/or irreversible. Less kidney toxicity has been reported with liposomal formulations (such as AmBisome) and it has become preferred in patients with preexisting renal injury. The integrity of the liposome is disrupted when it binds to the fungal cell wall, but is not affected by the mammalian cell membrane, so the association with liposomes decreases the exposure of the kidneys to amphotericin B, which explains its less nephrotoxic effects. In addition, electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are also common. In the liver, increased liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity (up to and including fulminant liver failure) are common. In the circulatory system, several forms of anemia and other blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, thrombopenia), serious cardiac arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation), and even frank cardiac failure have been reported. Skin reactions, including serious forms, are also possible. The analogue AM-2-19 has been engineered to be less toxic to the kidneys. == Interactions == Drug-drug interactions may occur when amphotericin B is coadministered with the following agents: Flucytosine: Toxicity of flucytosine is increased and allows a lower dose of amphotericin B. Amphotericin B may also facilitate entry of flucystosine into the fungal cell by interfering with the permeability of the fungal cell membrane. Diuretics or cisplatin: Increased renal toxicity and increased risk of hypokalemia Corticosteroids: Increased risk of hypokalemia Imidazole Antifungals: Amphotericin B may antagonize the activity of ketoconazole and miconazole. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Neuromuscular-blocking agents: Amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may potentiate the effects of certain paralytic agents. Foscarnet, ganciclovir, tenofovir, adefovir: Risk of hematological and renal side effects of amphotericin B are increased Zidovudine: Increased risk of renal and hematological toxicity . Other nephrotoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides): Increased risk of serious renal damage Cytostatic drugs: Increased risk of kidney damage, hypotension, and bronchospasms Transfusion of leukocytes: Risk of pulmonal (lung) damage occurs, space the intervals between the application of amphotericin B and the transfusion, and monitor pulmonary function == Mechanism of action == Amphotericin B binds with ergosterol, a component of fungal cell membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of monovalent ions (K+, Na+, H+ and Cl−) and subsequent fungal cell death. This is amphotericin B's primary effect as an antifungal agent. It has been found that the amphotericin B/ergosterol bimolecular complex that maintains these pores is stabilized by Van der Waals interactions. Researchers have found evidence that amphotericin B also causes oxidative stress within the fungal cell, but it remains unclear to what extent this oxidative damage contributes to the drug's effectiveness. The addition of free radical scavengers or antioxidants can lead to amphotericin resistance in some species, such as Scedosporium prolificans, without affecting the cell wall. Two amphotericins, amphotericin A and amphotericin B, are known, but only B is used clinically, because it is significantly more active in vivo. Amphotericin A is almost identical to amphotericin B (having a C=C double bond between the 27th and 28th carbons), but has little antifungal activity. == Mechanism of toxicity == Mammalian and fungal membranes both contain sterols, a primary membrane target for amphotericin B. Because mammalian and fungal membranes are similar in structure and composition, this is one mechanism by which amphotericin B causes cellular toxicity. Amphotericin B molecules can form pores in the host membrane as well as the fungal membrane. This impairment in membrane barrier function can have lethal effects. Ergosterol, the fungal sterol, is more sensitive to amphotericin B than cholesterol, the common mammalian sterol. Reactivity with the membrane is also sterol concentration dependent. Bacteria are not affected as their cell membranes do not usually contain sterols. Amphotericin B administration is limited by infusion-related toxicity. This is thought to result from innate immune production of proinflammatory cytokines. == Biosynthesis == The natural route to synthesis includes polyketide synthase components. The carbon chains of amphotericin B are assembled from sixteen 'C2' acetate and three 'C3'propionate units by polyketide syntheses (PKSs). Polyketide biosynthesis begins with the decarboxylative condensation of a dicarboxylic acid extender unit with a starter acyl unit to form a β-ketoacyl intermediate. The growing chain is constructed by a series of Claisen reactions. Within each module, the extender units are loaded onto the current ACP domain by acetyl transferase (AT). The ACP-bound elongation group reacts in a Claisen condensation with the KS-bound polyketide chain. Ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) and enoyl reductase (ER) enzymes may also be present to form alcohol, double bonds or single bonds. After cyclisation, the macrolactone core undergoes further modification by hydroxylation, methylation and glycosylation. The order of these three post-cyclization processes is unknown. == History == It was originally extracted from Streptomyces nodosus, a filamentous bacterium, in 1955, at the Squibb Institute for Medical Research from cultures of an undescribed streptomycete isolated from the soil collected in the Orinoco River region of Venezuela. Two antifungal substances were isolated from the soil culture, amphotericin A and amphotericin B, but B had better antifungal activity. For decades it remained the only effective therapy for invasive fungal disease until the development of the azole antifungals in the early 1980s. Its complete stereo structure was determined in 1970 by an X-ray structure of the N-iodoacetyl derivative. The first synthesis of the compound's naturally occurring enantiomeric form was achieved in 1987 by K. C. Nicolaou. Amphotericin B was used to treat a patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis who was admitted to the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, Seattle, Washington on January 16, 1957. ""The course was rapidly downhill with a grim prognosis as manifested by positive blood cultures, rising complement fixation titers, and failure of the skin to react to intradermal coccidioidin. Amphotericin B was started eight weeks following the onset of his illness. Following this there was remarkable improvement both objectively and subjectively. A fourteen-month follow-up following discontinuance of the drug revealed stabilization of all laboratory studies except for a re-elevation of the complement fixation titer from 1 to 16 to 1 to 32. The patient was completely asymptomatic except for the production of sputum containing a few spherules. The clinical effect of this drug in this patient has been most encouraging and is in agreement with results obtained by others. The lasting effect of the drug seems suggested by the patient's complete well-being after fourteen months of cessation of treatment. It is reasonable to assume that this drug will play a major part in the specific treatment of this disease."" === Formulations === It is a subgroup of the macrolide antibiotics, and exhibits similar structural elements. Currently, the drug is available in many forms. Either ""conventionally"" complexed with sodium deoxycholate (ABD), as a cholesteryl sulfate complex (ABCD), as a lipid complex (ABLC), and as a liposomal formulation (LAMB). The latter formulations have been developed to improve tolerability and decrease toxicity, but may show considerably different pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to conventional amphotericin B. === Names === Amphotericin's name originates from the chemical's amphoteric properties. It is commercially known as Fungilin, Fungizone, Abelcet, AmBisome, Fungisome, Amphocil, Amphotec, and Halizon. == References == == External links == AmBisome Summaries of Product Characteristics (United Kingdom) Amphotericin B ""Amphotericin B Liposomal Injection"".

It is used both as a form of progestogen-only injectable birth control and in combined injectable birth control formulations. It may be used following childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion. The failure rate per year in preventing pregnancy for the progestogen-only formulation is 2 per 100 women. Each dose of this form lasts two months with only up to two doses typically recommended. Side effects include breast pain, headaches, depression, irregular menstrual periods, and pain at the site of injection. Use in those with liver disease is not recommended as is use during pregnancy due to risk of birth defects. Use appears to be okay during breastfeeding. It does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. NETE is an ester and prodrug of norethisterone, through which it works. It works as a method of birth control by stopping ovulation. Norethisterone was patented in 1951 and NETE came into medical use in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It has been approved by itself in more than 60 countries including the United Kingdom and some in Europe, Central America, and Africa, and in combination with estradiol valerate in at least 36 countries mainly in Latin America. It is not available in the United States. == Medical uses == NETE is used on its own as a long-lasting progestogen-only injectable contraceptive in women. It is administered via intramuscular injection once every two months. == Contraindications == == Side effects == Side effects of NETE may include breast pain, headaches, depression, irregular menstrual periods, and pain at the site of injection. It can cause birth defects in the fetus if used during pregnancy. == Overdose == == Interactions == == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === NETE is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body. Upon reaching circulation, it is rapidly converted into norethisterone by esterases. Hence, as a prodrug of norethisterone, NETE has essentially the same effects as norethisterone, acting as a potent progestogen with additional weak androgenic and estrogenic activity (the latter via its metabolite ethinylestradiol). NETA has some progestogenic activity of its own, but it is unclear if NETE does similarly. NETE is of about 38% higher molecular weight than norethisterone due to the presence of its C17β enanthate ester. A single intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate/norethisterone enanthate (5 mg/50 mg) (Mesigyna) has been found to strongly suppress testosterone levels in men. Levels of testosterone decreased from ~503 ng/dL at baseline to ~30 ng/dL at the lowest point (–94%). === Pharmacokinetics === A single intramuscular injection of 50 to 200 mg NETE in oil solution has been found to have a duration of action of 11 to 52 days in terms of clinical biological effect in the uterus and on body temperature in women. Similarly to oral norethisterone and norethisterone acetate, intramuscular NETE has been found to form ethinylestradiol as an active metabolite. With a single intramuscular injection of 200 mg NETE in premenopausal women, the mean maximum concentration of ethinylestradiol was 32% of that of a combined oral contraceptive containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol, the maximum equivalent oral dose of ethinylestradiol observed in the first few days of exposure was 20.3 μg/day, and the mean equivalent oral dose of ethinylestradiol over 8 weeks was 4.41 μg/day. As such, the exposure to ethinylestradiol was described as markedly lower than that of an oral contraceptive containing 30 μg ethinylestradiol. The estimated conversion rate of NETE into ethinylestradiol was 0.1%, which was much lower than that observed for oral norethisterone and norethisterone enanthate (0.2–1.0%), likely due to the lack of the first pass through the liver with parenteral administration. In accordance with the low levels of ethinylestradiol produced, no increase rates of thromboembolism or hepatic adenoma have been observed in post-authorization data of intramuscular NETE, and the medication does not resemble combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol in its safety profile. == Chemistry == NETE, also known as norethinyltestosterone enanthate, as well as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 17β-enanthate or 17α-ethynylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one 17β-enanthate, is a progestin, or synthetic progestogen, of the 19-nortestosterone group, and a synthetic estrane steroid. It is the C17β enanthate ester of norethisterone. NETE is a derivative of testosterone with an ethynyl group at the C17α position, the methyl group at the C19 position removed, and an enanthate ester attached at the C17β position. In addition to testosterone, it is a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone). Esters related to NETE include norethisterone acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate. == History == NETE was introduced by Schering as Noristerat in 1957. It was the second long-acting progestogen to be used clinically, after hydroxyprogesterone caproate. The medication was the first progestogen-only injectable contraceptive, preceding medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera). == Society and culture == === Generic names === Norethisterone enantate is the generic name of the drug and its INNMTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name. It is also spelled as norethisterone enanthate and is also known as norethindrone enanthate (the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name of norethisterone being norethindrone). NETE is known by its former developmental code name SH-393 as well. === Brand names === NETE has been marketed alone as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive under the brand names Depocon, Doryxas, NET-EN, Noristat, Noristerat, Norigest, and Nur-Isterate, and in combination with estradiol valerate as a combined injectable contraceptive under the brand names Chinese Injectable No. 3, Efectimes, Ginediol, Mesigyna, Mesilar, Meslart, Mesocept, Mesygest, Nofertyl, Nofertyl Lafrancol, Noregyna, Norestrin, Norifam, Norigynon, Nostidyn, Sexseg, and Solouna. === Availability === NETE has been approved for use alone as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive in more than 60 countries throughout the world including in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Specific countries in which NETE as a standalone medication is or has been available include Bangladesh, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. NETE has been approved for use in combination with estradiol valerate as a combined injectable contraceptive in at least 36 countries, mostly in Latin America but also in Africa. It is or has been available in combination with estradiol valerate in Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Kenya, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, St. Lucia, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. NETE is not available in any form in the United States. == Research == NETE was studied by Schering for use as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive at a dose of 25 mg once a month but produced poor cycle control with this regimen and was not marketed. NETE has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with testosterone in men. == See also == Estradiol valerate/norethisterone enantate Estradiol undecylate/norethisterone enanthate == References == == External links == ""Norethisterone Enanthate"".

105,"('Pirmenol (hydrochloride)', 'Cl-845', '(¬±)-pirmenol hydrochlorid', 'Pirmenol (inn)', 'Pirmenol')",Medical," Pirmenol hydrochloride, a novel pyridinemethanol derivative, is a long-acting class Ia antiarrhythmic agent. Preclinical toxicology data were obtained in rat, mouse, dog and rabbit. In acute toxicity studies by oral and intravenous routes, no pathologic changes were observed in surviving mice, rats and dogs. In repeated dose toxicity studies, no drug-related pathologic changes were evident; dryness of the oral mucosa in dogs and body weight gain reductions in rodents were the only significant clinical signs. In a chronic (52 week) toxicity study in rats, pirmenol given in the diet was tolerated clinically at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. No drug-related aberrations in clinical laboratory parameters or ophthalmic or pathologic findings were evident. In a similar study in beagle dogs, pirmenol was tolerated clinically at a dosage up to 30 mg/kg/day. No significant changes in biochemical, hematologic, urinary or bone marrow determinations were found in either species. In reproductive toxicology studies in rats, pirmenol had no significant effect on litter size or embryonic viability. In rabbits pirmenol had no effect on average litter size, embryonic viability or fetal wastage. Given to male rats, pirmenol had no overt effects on fertility. Pirmenol failed to elicit deoxyribonucleic acid damage or induce cytogenetic alterations. Pirmenol appears to be without significant limiting toxicologic properties. The coronary artery-ligated rat was investigated as an experimental model for studying the effects of pirmenol hydrochloride and reference for studying the effects of pirmenol hydrochloride and reference agents on early ventricular arrhythmias. Coronary artery ligation caused 89% lethality (ventricular fibrillation) within 10 min in untreated control rats. Vagal stimulation applied during periods of high-rate ventricular tachycardia reduced sinus, atrioventricular nodal and ventricular ectopic beats, with no uncoupled ectopic beats seen during stimulation. Rats studied with composite epicardial electrodes showed continuous electrical activity throughout diastole. These factors indicate that a reentry mechanism is likely involved. Pretreatment with pirmenol afforded protection in a dose-related fashion. A dose of 1.25 mg/kg increased survival to 58%, and all rats dosed with 2.5 to 10 mg/kg survived. Suppression of ventricular fibrillation was dose related and was complete at 5 mg/kg. The pirmenol plasma levels of 1.2 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml seen after the 5 mg/kg dose are similar to plasma levels seen at clinically effective doses, as well as at doses effective in other experimental arrhythmias. The reference agent quinidine was also highly effective in this model, all rats pretreated with 5 mg/kg survived with reduced premature ventricular beats and without a single episode of ventricular fibrillation or death. Fibrillation and/or death were also reduced by the reference agents, bretylium, lidocaine, propranolol and verapamil. The high efficacy of pirmenol against early ventricular arrhythmias in this study further defines its spectrum of activity, and suggests that pirmenol may be effective in a clinical setting where a reentrant mechanism is operative. Pirmenol hydrochloride (CI-845), a new orally effective antiarrhythmic agent, has undergone a comprehensive preclinical safety evaluation program. Repeated dose studies to evaluate chronic toxicity in rodents revealed few drug-related findings. A dose-related body weight gain suppression occurred in mice receiving up to 160 mg/kg for thirteen weeks. Rats also exhibited decreased body weight in a fifty-two-week study. Depressed fasting glucose levels were seen in rats at 50 mg/kg after thirteen weeks, but this effect was less prominent following fifty-two weeks of dosing. No other drug-related signs of toxicity were seen in rodents. Four-week repeated-dose intravenous studies in rats were uneventful. Occasional emesis and salivation, together with dryness of the oral mucosa, occurred in dogs given 10 mg/kg intravenously for four weeks. Drug-related increased heart rates, increased QRS duration, and reduced ST interval were seen thirty minutes postdose in dogs receiving 5 mg/kg or more intravenously. When dogs received pirmenol orally for fifty-two weeks, electrocardiographic and heart rate changes were variable and less pronounced than seen in the intravenous study. Clinical signs consisted of exaggerated pharmacologic responses similar to those found after intravenous dosing. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits showed that pirmenol is not teratogenic. Reduced food intake and a 50% decrease in body weight gain were seen in rats at the top dose level of 150 mg/kg. Significantly reduced mean fetal weight and increased postimplantation loss indicated that 150 mg/kg was embryotoxic to rats. A top dose of 50 mg/kg in rabbits did not produce any signs of maternal or fetotoxicity, aside from a moderate suppression of maternal weight gain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Pirmenol (hydrochloride),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005440423847176135), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006723637692630291)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D06517?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=69, start_index=6, title='KEGG DRUG: Pirmenol hydrochloride', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D06517?utm_source=openai')])"
106,"('Metolazone', 'Zaroxolyn', 'Diulo', 'Mykrox', 'Microx')",Medical,"Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic marketed under the brand names Zytanix, Metoz, Zaroxolyn, and Mykrox. It is primarily used to treat congestive heart failure and high blood pressure. Metolazone indirectly decreases the amount of water reabsorbed into the bloodstream by the kidney, so that blood volume decreases and urine volume increases. This lowers blood pressure and prevents excess fluid accumulation in heart failure. Metolazone is sometimes used together with loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide, but these highly effective combinations can lead to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. It was patented in 1966 and approved for medical use in 1974. == Medical uses == One of the primary uses of metolazone is for treating edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). In mild heart failure, metolazone or another diuretic may be used alone, or combined with other diuretics for moderate or severe heart failure. In addition to preventing fluid buildup, the use of metolazone may allow the patient to relax the amount of sodium restriction that is required. Although most thiazide diuretics lose their effectiveness in kidney failure, metolazone remains active even when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30–40 mL/min (moderate chronic kidney disease). This gives it a considerable advantage over other thiazide diuretics, since renal and heart failure often coexist and contribute to fluid retention. Metolazone may also be used in kidney disease, such as chronic kidney disease or the nephrotic syndrome. Chronic kidney disease causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Metolazone and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance diuresis over the use of either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the loop of Henle, and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. Metolazone may be used for edema caused by liver cirrhosis as well. The other major use of metolazone is in treating hypertension (high blood pressure). Thiazide diuretics, though usually not metolazone, are very often used alone as first-line treatment for mild hypertension. They are also used in combination with other drugs for difficult-to-treat or more severe hypertension. ""The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure"" (JNC 7) recommends thiazide diuretics as the initial medication for treatment of hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide is by far the most commonly used, as it is both better-studied and cheaper (about four times) than metolazone, although as mentioned above metolazone is used in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease. == Toxicity == Since thiazide diuretics affect the transport of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and angioedema. Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides (""sulfa allergy"") may also be allergic to metolazone. == Mechanism of action == The primary target of all thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, is the distal convoluted tubule, part of the nephron in the kidney, where they inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter. In the kidney, blood is filtered into the lumen, or open space, of the nephron tubule. Whatever remains in the tubule will travel to the bladder as urine and eventually be excreted. The cells lining the tubule modify the fluid inside, absorbing some material and excreting others. One side of the cell (the apical side) faces the lumen; the opposite side (the basolateral side) faces the interstitial space near blood vessels. The other sides are tightly joined to neighboring cells. As with other regions, tubule cells in the distal convoluted tubule possess the ATP-powered sodium-potassium antiporter (Na+/K+-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP to transfer three sodium ions out from the basolateral surface (toward blood vessels) while simultaneously transferring two potassium ions in. The distal convoluted tubule cells also possess a sodium-chloride symporter on the apical side, which passively allows one sodium ion and one chloride ion to diffuse together in from the lumen (where urine is forming) into the cell interior. As sodium is pumped out of the cell by the ATPase, its intracellular concentration falls, and additional sodium begins to diffuse in from the tubule lumen as replacement. The symporter requires chloride to be transported in as well. Water passively follows to maintain isotonicity; excess chloride and potassium passively diffuse out the cell through basolateral channels into the interstitial space, and water accompanies them. The water and chloride, as well as the sodium pumped out by the ATPase, will be absorbed into the bloodstream. Metolazone and the other thiazide diuretics inhibit the function of the sodium-chloride symporter, preventing sodium and chloride, and therefore water too, from leaving the lumen to enter the tubule cell. As a result, water remains in the lumen and is excreted as urine, instead of being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Since most of the sodium in the lumen has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule, thiazide diuretics have limited effects on water balance and on electrolyte levels. Nevertheless, they can be associated with low sodium levels, volume depletion, and low blood pressure, among other adverse effects. == Pharmacokinetics == Metolazone is only available in oral preparations. Approximately 65% of the amount ingested becomes available in the bloodstream. Its half-life is approximately fourteen hours, similar to indapamide but considerably longer than hydrochlorothiazide. Metolazone is around ten times as potent as hydrochlorothiazide. The primary form of excretion is in the urine (around 80%); the remaining fifth is evenly split between biliary excretion and metabolism into inactive forms. == Chemistry == The use of activated anthranilic acid derivatives facilitates the preparation of the amides in those cases where the amines are either unreactive or difficult to obtain. Thus, reaction of (1) with phosgene gives the reactive the isatoic anhydride (2). Condensation of that with ortho-toluidine leads to the acylation product (3) formed with a simultaneous loss of carbon dioxide. This is then converted to the quinazolone (4) by heating with acetic anhydride. Reaction with sodium borohydride in the presence of aluminum chloride selectively reduces the double bond to yield the diuretic agent metolazone (5). === Structure and classification === Metolazone is a quinazoline, a derivative of the similar diuretic quinethazone, as well as a sulfonamide. It is related to analogs of 1,2,4-benzothiadizine-1,1-dioxide (benzothiadiazine). Such drugs are called benzothiadiazides, or thiazides for short; however, in terms of chemistry, metolazone is not a substituted benzothiadiazine, and therefore is not technically a thiazide. Since metolazone (as well as other drugs like indapamide) acts on the same target as thiazides and behave in a similar pharmacologic fashion, it is, however, considered a ""thiazide-like diuretic."" Therefore, metolazone and similar drugs are often categorized with thiazide diuretics despite not being thiazides themselves. == History == Metolazone was developed in the 1970s. Its creator, Indian born chemist Dr. Bola Vithal Shetty has been active in helping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration review drug applications, and in the development of new medicines. Metolazone quickly gained popularity due to its lower kidney toxicity compared to other diuretics (especially thiazides) in patients with chronic kidney disease. == References ==",Microx,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008043871261179447), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001567802974022925)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/M/Microx.html ', [])"

That said, for physiology, nephrology, pulmonology, and anesthesiology, these basic principles often are critically important for mechanistic understanding, medical treatments, and assessing therapy effectiveness. This short introductory perspective focuses on basic chemistry and transport of buffers and acid-base equivalents, provides an outline of basic science acid-base concepts, tools used to monitor intracellular pH, model cellular responses to pH buffer changes, and the more recent development and use of genetically encoded pH-indicators. Examples of newer genetically encoded pH-indicators (pHerry and pHire) are provided, and their use for in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments are described. The continued use and development of these basic tools provide increasing opportunities for both basic and potentially clinical investigations. The aim of creating an orally active non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug was achieved with bempedoic acid, a small linear molecule providing both a significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Bempedoic acid antagonizes ATP citrate-lyase, a cytosolic enzyme upstream of HMGCoA reductase which is the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Bempedoic acid is a pro-drug converted to its active metabolite by very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 which is present mostly in the liver and absent in skeletal muscles. This limits the risk of myalgia and myopathy. The remit of this review is to give clinical insights on the safety and efficacy of bempedoic acid and to understand for whom it should be prescribed. Bempedoic acid with a single daily dose (180 mg) reduces LDL-C by a mean 24.5% when given alone, by 18% when given on top of a major statin and by 38-40% when given in a fixed-dose combination with ezetimibe. Bempedoic acid does not lead to the risk of new-onset diabetes, and moderately improves the glycaemic profile. The extensive knowledge on bempedoic acid mechanism, metabolism and side effects has led to an improved understanding of the potential benefits of this agent and offers a possible alternative to cardiologists and clinical practitioners somewhat worn out today by the occurrence of the muscular side effects of statins. The field of bile acid microbiology in the gastrointestinal tract is going through a current rebirth after a peak of activity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This renewed activity is a result of many factors, including the discovery near the turn of the century that bile acids are potent signalling molecules and technological advances in next-generation sequencing, computation, culturomics, gnotobiology, and metabolomics. We describe the current state of the field with particular emphasis on questions that have remained unanswered for many decades in both bile acid synthesis by the host and metabolism by the gut microbiota. Current knowledge of established enzymatic pathways, including bile salt hydrolase, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases involved in the oxidation and epimerization of bile acid hydroxy groups, the Hylemon-Bjӧrkhem pathway of bile acid C7-dehydroxylation, and the formation of secondary allo-bile acids, is described. We cover aspects of bile acid conjugation and esterification as well as evidence for bile acid C3-dehydroxylation and C12-dehydroxylation that are less well understood but potentially critical for our understanding of bile acid metabolism in the human gut. The physiological consequences of bile acid metabolism for human health, important caveats and cautionary notes on experimental design and interpretation of data reflecting bile acid metabolism are also explored.",(r)-2-amino-3-chloropropanoic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00018761781393550336), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025420039892196655)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([sigmaaldrich.com](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CA/en/product/bldpharmatechcoltd/bl3h9aa502ae?context=bbe&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=132, start_index=6, title='(R)-2-Amino-3-chloropropanoic acid | 2731-73-9', type='url_citation', url='https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/CA/en/product/bldpharmatechcoltd/bl3h9aa502ae?context=bbe&utm_source=openai')])"
109,"('Opicapone', 'Ongentys', 'Ontilyv', 'Ex-a5000', 'Compound 37d [pmid: 20334432]')",Medical,"Opicapone, sold under the brand name Ongentys, is a medication which is administered together with levodopa in people with Parkinson's disease. Opicapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The most common side effects are dyskinesia (difficulty controlling movement), constipation, increased blood creatine kinase, hypotension/syncope, and decreased weight. Opicapone, works to restore the levels of dopamine in the parts of the brain that control movement and coordination. It enhances the effects of levodopa, a precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine that can be taken by mouth. Opicapone blocks an enzyme that breaks down levodopa in the body called catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). It is peripherally selective and does not inhibit COMT in the brain. As a result of its COMT inhibition, levodopa remains active for longer. This helps to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as stiffness and slowness of movement. In June 2016, it was authorised for use in the European Union. It was authorised for use in the United States in April 2020. == Medical uses == In the EU, opicapone is indicated as adjunctive therapy to preparations of levodopa/ DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI) in adults with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations who cannot be stabilised on those combinations. In the US, opicapone is indicated as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing ""off"" episodes. The COMT inhibitor opicapone is used as an additive to a combination of levodopa and a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor to treat patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing end-of-dose motor fluctuations, if they cannot be stabilised with this drug combination. == Contraindications == This drug is contraindicated in people with cancers that secrete catecholamines (for example epinephrine), such as pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, because as a COMT inhibitor it blocks catecholamine degradation. Other contraindications are a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, and combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors that are not used as antiparkinsonians, because of possible drug interactions. NMS and associated rhabdomyolysis have been rarely observed under the older COMT inhibitors tolcapone and entacapone. This typically occurs shortly after the beginning of a COMT inhibitor add-on therapy when the levodopa dose has been reduced, or after discontinuation of a COMT inhibitor. Opicapone is contraindicated in people with concomitant use of non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or people with pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or other catecholamine secreting neoplasms. == Side effects == People taking opicapone very commonly (18%) experience dyskinesia. Other common side effects (in 1 to 10% of patients) include dizziness, strange dreams, hallucinations, constipation, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure), and muscle spasms. Apart from spasms, these side effects are also known from tolcapone and entacapone. As with entacapone, no relevant liver toxicity has been found in studies. This is in contrast to the first COMT inhibitor tolcapone, which could cause – in some cases lethal – liver insufficiency. == Overdose == No specific antidote is known. == Interactions == Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) are another class of drugs blocking catecholamine degradation. Therefore, their combination with opicapone can result in increased catecholamine concentrations in the body and corresponding adverse effects. Combining the antiparkinson MAO inhibitors selegiline or rasagiline with opicapone is considered safe. Potentially, there are also interactions with drugs being metabolised by COMT (for example isoprenaline, epinephrine, dopamine, or dobutamine), tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor type. Possible pharmacokinetic interactions are with substrates of the liver enzyme CYP2C8, such as repaglinide, and the transporter protein SLCO1B1, such as simvastatin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Opicapone blocks the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) effectively (>90% at therapeutic doses), selectively and reversibly, and only outside the central nervous system. It dissociates slowly from COMT, resulting in a duration of action longer than 24 hours despite its short blood plasma half-life. As COMT and DOPA decarboxylase are the main enzymes for degrading levodopa, blocking the two effectively increases its concentrations in the bloodstream. More levodopa reaches the brain, where it is activated to dopamine. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly absorbed from the gut, but only to about 20% of the applied dose. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after 1 to 2.5 hours. When in the bloodstream, it is almost completely (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, but apparently to different binding sites than warfarin, digoxin and other drugs with high plasma protein affinity. It is mainly metabolised to the sulfate, which accounts for 67% of the circulating drug after a single dose, and a methylated derivative, which accounts for 21%. Minor metabolites are a reduced derivative (<10%) and a glucuronide. All of these metabolites are inactive except the reduced derivative. Opicapone is eliminated with a terminal half-life of 0.7 to 3.2 hours. It is mainly excreted via the faeces (67%), and in form of the glucuronide also via the kidney (13%). The sulfate has a much longer half-life of 94 to 122 hours. Opicapone sulfate is transported by SLCO1B1; the possibility that it blocks this transporter has not been excluded. Opicapone itself and the sulfate are also transported by a number of other proteins, but given the low concentrations of the free substances in the blood plasma, this is very unlikely to give rise to drug interactions. Opicapone is a weak inhibitor of the liver enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. The only CYP interaction found in studies that is somewhat likely to be relevant is that with repaglinide, which is metabolised by CYP2C8. The metabolism of warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, is not measurably affected. Opicapone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence is a peripherally selective drug. == History == Opicapone was authorised for medical use in the European Union in June 2016. In February 2017, its developer Bial sold exclusive marketing rights for the United States and Canada to Neurocrine Biosciences for an initial payment of US$30 million. Opicapone was authorised for medical use in the United States in April 2020. Opicapone was approved based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT01568073, and Trial 2/NCT01227655) of 522 participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) whose symptoms were not well controlled while receiving their regular PD treatment. Trial 1 was conducted at 104 sites in 19 European countries, and Trial 2 was conducted at 69 sites in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, Czech Republic, Estonia, India, Israel, South Korea, Russia, South Africa and UK. There were two 12-week trials conducted in Parkinson's disease (PD) participants with inadequate control of their Parkinson's symptom (""off"" time) while receiving carbidopa/levodopa PD medications. Participants were randomly selected to receive either opicapone or a placebo capsule once a day. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until the trial was completed. In all of the trials, the participants kept daily diaries of the number of hours of ""off"" time for the three days before the evaluation visit. The benefit was evaluated by measuring the change from baseline in total daily ""off"" time in opicapone- and placebo-receiving participants. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 16 December 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Ontilyv, intended for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The applicant for this medicinal product is Bial Portela & Companhia S.A. Opicapone was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2022. == References == == Further reading == Rodrigues FB, Ferreira JJ (March 2017).

110,"('Sodium nitroprusside', 'Ro 21-2498', 'Nitroferricyanide', 'Pentacyanidonitrosylferrate(2-)', 'Iron(4+);nitroxyl;pentacyanide')",Medical,"Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), sold under the brand name Nitropress among others, is a medication used to lower blood pressure. This may be done if the blood pressure is very high and resulting in symptoms, in certain types of heart failure, and during surgery to decrease bleeding. It is used by continuous injection into a vein. Onset is nearly immediate and effects last for up to ten minutes. It is available as a generic medication. == Side effects and mechanism == Common side effects include low blood pressure and cyanide toxicity. Other serious side effects include methemoglobinemia. It is not generally recommended during pregnancy due to concerns of side effects. High doses are not recommended for more than ten minutes. It works by increasing nitric oxide levels in the blood, which increases cGMP levels in cells, and causes dilation of blood vessels. == History, society and culture == Sodium nitroprusside was discovered as early as 1850 and found to be useful in medicine in 1928. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Sodium nitroprusside is light sensitive, so it needs to be shielded from light to prevent degradation. == Medical use == Sodium nitroprusside is intravenously infused in cases of acute hypertensive crises. Its effects are usually seen within a few minutes. Nitric oxide reduces both total peripheral resistance and venous return, thus decreasing both preload and afterload. So, it can be used in severe congestive heart failure where this combination of effects can act to increase cardiac output. In situations where cardiac output is normal, the effect is to reduce blood pressure. It is sometimes also used to induce hypotension (to reduce bleeding) for surgical procedures (for which it is also FDA, TGA, and MHRA labelled). The medication is extremely beneficial for use in medical patients because the effects of the medication will directly stop the second that it stops being infused. This is due to the metabolism of the drug, and the rapid inactivation to thiocyanate once conversion of the drug stops. This compound has also been used as a treatment for aortic valve stenosis, oesophageal varices, myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn, shock, and ergot toxicity. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects by incidence and severity Common Unknown frequency Serious Ileus Reduced platelet aggregation Haemorrhage Increased intracranial pressure Metabolic acidosis Methaemoglobinaemia Cyanide poisoning Thiocyanate toxicity === Contraindications === Sodium nitroprusside should not be used for compensatory hypertension (e.g. due to an arteriovenous stent or coarctation of the aorta). It should not be used in patients with inadequate cerebral circulation or in patients who are near death. It should not be used in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, anaemia, severe renal disease, or hypovolaemia. Patients with conditions associated with a higher cyanide/thiocyanate ratio (e.g. congenital (Leber's) optic atrophy, tobacco amblyopia) should only be treated with sodium nitroprusside with great caution. Its use in patients with acute congestive heart failure associated with reduced peripheral resistance is also not recommended. Its use in hepatically impaired individuals is also not recommended, as is its use in cases of pre-existing hypothyroidism. Its use in pregnant women is advised against, although the available evidence suggests it may be safe, provided maternal pH and cyanide levels are closely monitored. Some evidence suggests sodium nitroprusside use in critically ill children may be safe, even without monitoring of cyanide level. === Interactions === The only known drug interactions are pharmacodynamic in nature, that is it is possible for other antihypertensive drugs to reduce the threshold for dangerous hypotensive effects to be seen. === Overdose === Due to its cyanogenic nature, overdose may be particularly dangerous. Treatment of sodium nitroprusside overdose includes the following: Discontinuing sodium nitroprusside administration Buffering the cyanide by using sodium nitrite to convert haemoglobin to methaemoglobin as much as the patient can safely tolerate Infusing sodium thiosulfate to convert the cyanide to thiocyanate. Haemodialysis is ineffective for removing cyanide from the body but it can be used to remove most of the thiocyanate produced from the above procedure. === Toxicology === The cyanide can be detoxified by reaction with a sulfur-donor such as thiosulfate, catalysed by the enzyme rhodanese. In the absence of sufficient thiosulfate, cyanide ions can quickly reach toxic levels. Hydroxocobalamin can be administered to reduce the risk of thiocyanate toxicity induced by nitroprusside. == Mechanism of action == As a result of its breakdown to nitric oxide (NO), sodium nitroprusside has potent vasodilating effects on arterioles and venules (arterial more than venous), whereas other nitrates exhibit more selectivity for veins (e.g. nitroglycerin). Sodium nitroprusside breaks down in circulation to release nitric oxide (NO). It does this by binding to oxyhaemoglobin to release cyanide, methaemoglobin and nitric oxide. NO activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle and increases intracellular production of cGMP. cGMP activates protein kinase G which activates phosphatases which inactivate myosin light chains. Myosin light chains are involved in smooth muscle contraction. The result is vascular smooth muscle relaxation, which allow vessels to dilate. This mechanism is similar to that of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis), which elevate cGMP concentration by inhibiting its degradation by PDE5. A role for NO in various common psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder has been proposed and supported by several clinical findings. These findings may also implicate the potential of drugs that alter NO signalling such as SNP in their treatment. Such a role is also supported by the findings of the recent SNP clinical trial. == Structure and properties == Nitroprusside is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Na2[Fe(CN)5NO], usually encountered as the dihydrate, Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]·2H2O. This red-colored sodium salt dissolves in water or ethanol to give solutions containing the free complex dianion [Fe(CN)5NO]2−. Nitroprusside is a complex anion that features an octahedral iron(II) centre surrounded by five tightly bound cyanide ligands and one linear nitric oxide ligand (Fe-N-O angle = 176.2 °). The anion possesses idealized C4vsymmetry. Due to the linear Fe-N-O angle, the relatively short N-O distance of 113 pm and the relatively high stretching frequency of 1947 cm−1, the complex is formulated as containing an NO+ ligand. Consequently, iron is assigned an oxidation state of 2+. The iron center has a diamagnetic low-spin d6 electron configuration, although a paramagnetic long-lived metastable state has been observed by EPR spectroscopy. The chemical reactions of sodium nitroprusside are mainly associated with the NO ligand. For example, addition of S2− ion to [Fe(CN)5(NO)]2− produces the violet colour [Fe(CN)5(NOS)]4− ion, which is the basis for a sensitive test for S2− ions. An analogous reaction also exists with OH− ions, giving [Fe(CN)5(NO2)]4−. Roussin's red salt (K2[Fe2S2(NO)4]) and Roussin's black salt (NaFe4S3(NO)7) are related iron nitrosyl complexes. The former was first prepared by treating nitroprusside with sulfur. == Preparation == Sodium nitroprusside can be synthesized by digesting a solution of potassium ferrocyanide in water with nitric acid, followed by neutralization with sodium carbonate: K4[Fe(CN)6] + 6 HNO3 → H2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] + CO2 + NH4NO3 + 4 KNO3 H2[Fe(CN)5NO] + Na2CO3 → Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] + CO2 + H2O Alternatively, the nitrosyl ligand can be introduced using nitrite: [Fe(CN)6]4− + H2O + NO−2 → [Fe(CN)5(NO)]2− + CN− + 2 HO− == Other uses == Sodium nitroprusside is often used as a reference compound for the calibration of Mössbauer spectrometers. Sodium nitroprusside crystals are also of interest for optical storage. For this application, sodium nitroprusside can be reversibly promoted to a metastable excited state by blue-green light, and de-excited by heat or red light. In physiology research, sodium nitroprusside is frequently used to test endothelium-independent vasodilation. Iontophoresis, for example, allows local administration of the drug, preventing the systemic effects listed above but still inducing local microvascular vasodilation. Sodium nitroprusside is also used in microbiology, where it has been linked with the dispersal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by acting as a nitric oxide donor. === Analytical reagent === Sodium nitroprusside is also used as an analytical reagent under the name sodium nitroferricyanide for the detection of methyl ketones, amines, and thiols. It is also used as a catalyst in the quantitative determination of ammonia in water samples via the phenate method. ==== Ketones ==== The nitroprusside reaction is used for the identification of ketones in urine testing. Sodium nitroprusside was found to give a reaction with acetone or creatine under basic conditions in 1882. Rothera refined this method by the use of ammonia in place of sodium or potassium hydroxide. The reaction was now specific for methyl ketones. Addition of ammonium salts (e.g. ammonium sulfate) improved the sensitivity of the test, too. In this test, known as Rothera's test, methyl ketones (CH3C(=O)-) under alkaline conditions give bright red coloration (see also iodoform test). Rothera's test was initially applied to detecting ketonuria (a symptom of diabetes) in urine samples. This reaction is now exploited in the form of urine test strips (e.g. ""Ketostix""). ==== Thiols and cysteine ==== The nitroprusside reaction is a chemical test used to detect the presence of thiol groups of cysteine in proteins. Proteins with the free thiol group give a red colour when added to a solution of sodium nitroprusside in aqueous ammonia. Some proteins test positive when denatured, indicating that thiol groups are liberated. Sodium nitroprusside is used in a separate urinalysis test known as the cyanide nitroprusside test or Brand's test. In this test, sodium cyanide is added first to urine and let stand for about 10 minutes. In this time, disulfide bonds will be broken by the released cyanide. The destruction of disulfide bonds liberates cysteine from cystine as well as homocysteine from homocystine. Next, sodium nitroprusside is added to the solution and it reacts with the newly freed sulfhydryl groups. The test will turn a red/purple colour if the test is positive, indicating significant amounts of amino acids were in the urine (aminoaciduria). Cysteine, cystine, homocysteine, and homocystine all react when present in the urine when this test is performed. This test can indicate inborn errors of amino acid transporters such as cystinuria, which results from pathology in the transport of dibasic amino acids. ==== Amines ==== Sodium nitroprusside is also used to detect amines, including those in illicit drugs. This compound is thus used as a stain to indicate amines in thin layer chromatography. Sodium nitroprusside is similarly used as a presumptive test for the presence of alkaloids (amine-containing natural products) common in illicit substances. The test, called Simon's test, is performed by adding 1 volume of a solution of sodium nitroprusside and acetaldehyde in deionized water to a suspected drug, followed by the addition of 2 volumes of an aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The test turns blue for some secondary amines. The most common secondary amines encountered in forensic chemistry include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, the main component in ecstasy) and phenethylamines such as methamphetamine. Sodium nitroprusside is also useful in the identification the mercaptans (thiol groups) in the nitroprusside reaction. == History == Sodium nitroprusside is primarily used as a vasodilator. It was first used in human medicine in 1928. By 1955, data on its safety during short-term use in people with severe hypertension had become available. Despite this, due to difficulties in its chemical preparation, it was not finally approved by the US FDA until 1974 for the treatment of severe hypertension. By 1993, its popularity had grown such that total sales in the US had totalled US$2 million. == References ==",Nitroferricyanide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -2.045823566731997e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.06197967752814293), (' INDUSTR', -0.0004245972086209804), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0021435872185975313), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47410666942596436)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.16022412478923798), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

112,"('Aprepitant',)",Medical,"Aprepitant, sold under the brand name Emend among others, is a medication used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. It may be used together with ondansetron and dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth or administered by intravenous injection. A prodrug, fosaprepitant, is also available for intravenous administration. Common side effects include tiredness, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hiccups, itchiness, pneumonia, and blood pressure changes. Other severe side effects may include anaphylaxis. While use in pregnancy does not appear to be harmful, such use has not been well studied. Aprepitant belongs to the class of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists. It works by blocking substance P from attaching to the NK1 receptors. Aprepitant was approved for medical use in the European Union and the United States in 2003. It is made by Merck & Co. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Aprepitant is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. It may be used together with ondansetron and dexamethasone. == Mechanism of action == Aprepitant is classified as an NK1 antagonist because it blocks signals given off by NK1 receptors. This, therefore, decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients. NK1 is a G protein-coupled receptor located in the central and peripheral nervous system. This receptor has a dominant ligand known as Substance P (SP). SP is a neuropeptide, composed of 11 amino acids, which sends impulses and messages from the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the vomiting center of the brain, and, when activated, it results in a vomiting reflex. In addition to this it also plays a key part in the transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral receptors to the central nervous system. Aprepitant has been shown to inhibit both the acute and delayed emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brain's neurons. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies, have demonstrated that aprepitant can cross the blood brain barrier and bind to NK1 receptors in the human brain. It has also been shown to increase the activity of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. == Pharmacokinetics == Before clinical testing, a new class of therapeutic agent has to be characterized in terms of preclinical metabolism and excretion studies. Average bioavailability is found to be around 60-65%. Aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant can increase plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are metabolized through CYP3A4. Specific interaction has been demonstrated with oxycodone, where aprepitant both increased the efficacy and worsened the side effects of oxycodone; however it is unclear whether this is due to CYP3A4 inhibition or through its NK-1 antagonist action. Following IV administration of a 14C-labeled prodrug of aprepitant (L-758298), which is converted rapidly and completely to aprepitant, approximately 57% of the total radioactivity is excreted in the urine and 45% in feces. No unchanged substance is excreted in urine. == Structure and properties == Aprepitant is made up of a morpholine core with two substituents attached to adjacent ring carbons. These substitute groups are trifluoromethylated 1-phenylethanol and fluorophenyl group. Aprepitant also has a third substituent (triazolinone), which is joined to the morpholine ring nitrogen. It has three chiral centres very close together, which combine to produce an amino acetal arrangement. Its empirical formula is C23H21F7N4O3. == Synthesis == Shortly after Merck initiated research into reducing the severity and likelihood of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, researchers discovered that aprepitant is effective in prevention. Researchers worked on coming up with a process to create aprepitant, and within a short period they came up with effective synthesis of the substance. This original synthesis was deemed to be workable and proved to be a crucial step in achieving commercialization; however, Merck decided that the process was not environmentally sustainable. This was due to the original synthesis requiring six steps, many of which needed dangerous chemicals such as sodium cyanide, dimethyltitanocene, and gaseous ammonia. In addition to this, for the process to be effective cryogenic temperatures were needed for some of the steps and other steps produced hazardous byproducts such as methane. The environmental concerns of the synthesis of aprepitant became so great that Merck research team decided to withdraw the drug from clinical trials and attempt to create a different synthesis of aprepitant. The gamble of taking the drug out of clinical trials proved to be successful when shortly afterwards the team of Merck researchers came up with an alternative and more environmentally friendly synthesis of aprepitant. The new process works by four compounds of similar size and complexity being fused together. This therefore is a much simpler process and requires only three steps, half the number of the original synthesis. The new process begins by enantiopure trifluoromethylated phenyl ethanol being joined to a racemic morpholine precursor. This results in the desired isomer crystallizing on the top of the solution and the unwanted isomer remaining in the solution. The unwanted isomer is then converted to the desired isomer through a crystallization-induced asymmetric transformation. By the end of this step a secondary amine, the base of the drug, is formed. The second step involves the fluorophenyl group being attached to the morpholine ring. Once this has been achieved the third and final step can initiated. This step involved a side chain of triazolinone being added to the ring. Once this step has been successfully completed a stable molecule of aprepitant has been produced. This more streamlined route yields around 76% more aprepitant than the original process and reduces the operating cost by a significant amount. In addition, the new process also reduces the amount of solvent and reagents required by about 80% and saving an estimated 340,000L per ton of aprepitant produced. The improvements in the synthesis process have also decreased the long-term detriment to the natural environment associated with the original procedure, due to eliminating the use of several hazardous chemicals. == History == It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003. In 2008, fosaprepitant, an intravenous form of aprepitant was approved in the United States. == Research == === Major depression === Plans to develop aprepitant as an antidepressant have been withdrawn. Subsequently, other trials with NK1 receptor antagonists, casopitant and orvepitant, have shown promising results. Beyond suggestions that PET receptor occupancy must not be used routinely to cap dosing for new medical indications for this class, or that > 99% human receptor occupancy might be required for consistent psycho-pharmacological or other therapeutic effects, critical scientific dissection and debate of the above data might be needed to enable aprepitant, and the class of NK1 antagonists as a whole, to fulfill preclinically predicted utilities beyond chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (i.e., for other psychiatric disorders, addictions, neuropathic pain, migraine, osteoarthritis, overactive bladder, inflammatory bowel disease and other disorders with suspected inflammatory or immunological components. However, most data remain proprietary and thus reviews on the expanded clinical potential for drugs like aprepitant range from optimistic to poor. === Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome === Aprepitant has been identified as having strong potential in treating protracted vomiting episodes in individuals with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by nausea, cyclical vomiting, and cramping abdominal pain resulting from prolonged, frequent cannabis use. Standard first-line antiemetics such as ondansetron and prochlorperazine are often ineffective in treating cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. == References ==",Aprepitant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.536697689327411e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00026472879108041525)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aprepitant,https://www.drugs.com/pro/aprepitant.html,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/aprepitant ', [])"

A con with ethacrynic acid compared to the other loop diuretic drugs such as furosemide is that it has a significantly steep dose-response curve, which means the drug's dosing is very important as small variance in dose can cause a significant difference in the biological response. Unlike the other loop diuretics, etacrynic acid is not a sulfonamide and may thus be used in individuals with sulfa allergies in whom the sulfonamide loop diuretics would be contraindicated. == Structural features == Ethacrynic acid is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative, and contains an α,β-unsaturated ketone group. == Medical use == Ethacrynic acid is a diuretic that is used to treat edema when a stronger agent is required. It is available as a pill or injected form. The pill is used to treat edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis and renal disease, accumulation of liquid in the belly associated with cancer or edema, and management of hospitalized children with congenital heart disease or nephrotic syndrome. The injected form is used to rapidly remove water from the body when needed – for example in acute pulmonary edema – or when a person cannot take the medicine in pill form. == Adverse effects == As a diuretic, ethacrynic acid can cause frequent urination, but this usually resolves after taking the drug for a few weeks. Ethacrynic acid can also cause low potassium levels, which may manifest as muscle cramps or weakness. It has also been known to cause reversible or permanent hearing loss (ototoxicity) and liver damage when administered in extremely high dosages. On oral administration, it produces diarrhea; intestinal bleeding may occur at higher doses. == Mechanism of action == Ethacrynic acid acts by inhibiting NKCC2 in the thick ascending loop of Henle and the macula densa. Loss of potassium ions is less marked but chances of hypochloremic alkalosis are greater. The dose response curve of ethacrynic acid is steeper than that of furosemide and, in general, it is less manageable; dose range is 50–150 mg. Ethacrynic acid and its glutathione-adduct are potent inhibitors of glutathione S-transferase family members, which are enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. This family of enzymes has been shown to have a high rate of genetic variability. == United States price history == The ethacrynic acid tablet market had U.S. sales of approximately $17 million for the 12 months ending April 2020 according to IQVIA. National Average Drug Acquisition Cost data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows that the average price paid by retail pharmacies for an Edecrin 25 MG tablet was $5.24 as 11/28/13 by Bausch Health US, LLC, formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The price from Bausch Health US, LLC increased to $21.72 per tablet as of 5/18/2016. In 2015, Valeant was involved in a number of controversies surrounding drug price hikes and the use of a specialty pharmacy for the distribution of its drugs. As of September 19, 2018, the price for the generic equivalent was $10.01 per tablet from West-ward Pharmaceuticals Corp., Edenbridge Pharmaceuticals, LLC and Oceanside Pharmaceuticals. As of July 22, 2020 the price decreased to $3.45 with availability from additional generic manufacturers. As of February 17, 2021 the average price paid by pharmacies was $5.69 per 25 MG tablet with 10 generic manufacturers.

However, cancer cells can utilise alternative nutrients to glucose for energy such as lactate, which is often elevated in tumours together with increased acidity. We therefore hypothesised that lactic acidosis may confer resistance to Akt inhibition. The effect of the pan-Akt inhibitor uprosertib (GSK2141795), on HCT116 and LS174T colon cancer cells was evaluated in the presence and absence of lactic acid in vitro. Expression of downstream Akt signalling proteins was determined using a phosphokinase array and immunoblotting. Metabolism was assessed using  Lactic acid-induced resistance to uprosertib was characterised by increased cell survival and reduced apoptosis. Uprosertib treatment reduced Akt signalling and glucose uptake irrespective of lactic acid supplementation. However, incorporation of lactate carbon and enhanced respiration was maintained in the presence of uprosertib and lactic acid. Inhibiting lactate transport or oxidative phosphorylation was sufficient to potentiate apoptosis in the presence of uprosertib. Lactic acidosis confers resistance to uprosertib, which can be reversed by inhibiting lactate transport or oxidative metabolism. This study aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II doses of trametinib plus uprosertib (GSK2141795) in patients with solid tumors likely to be sensitive to MEK and/or AKT inhibition. This was a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study in patients with triple-negative breast cancer or BRAF-wild type advanced melanoma. The primary outcome of the expansion study was investigator-assessed response. Among 126 enrolled patients, 63 received continuous oral daily dosing of trametinib and uprosertib, 29 received various alternative dosing schedules, and 34 were enrolled into expansion cohorts. Doses tested in the expansion cohort were trametinib 1.5 mg once daily (QD) + uprosertib 50 mg QD. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with those reported in monotherapy studies but occurred at lower doses and with greater severity. Diarrhea was the most common dose-limiting toxicity; diarrhea and rash were particularly difficult to tolerate. Overall, 59% and 6% of patients reported AEs with a maximum severity of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Poor tolerability prevented adequate delivery of uprosertib with trametinib at a concentration predicted to have clinical activity. The study was terminated early based on futility in the continuous-dosing expansion cohorts and a lack of pharmacological or therapeutic advantage with intermittent dosing. The objective response rate was < 5% (1 complete response, 5 partial responses). Continuous and intermittent dosing of trametinib in combination with uprosertib was not tolerated, and minimal clinical activity was observed in all schedules tested. While MEK inhibitors demonstrated activity in metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) preclinical studies, preclinical, and clinical studies implicate rapid development of resistance limiting clinical benefit. The purpose of this study was to determine response rate for Trametinib alone and in combination with Uprosertib in patients with mTNBC previously treated with chemotherapy. This was an open-label, two-part, phase II, single-arm, multicenter study. Patients first received Trametinib monotherapy (2 mg daily; Part I) then at progression transitioned to Trametinib (1.5 mg) plus Uprosertib (50 mg; Part II). Between October 2013 and January 2017, 37 patients were enrolled to Part I. Subsequently, 19 patients entered Part II. Of the 37 patients receiving Trametinib monotherapy, 2 patients achieved partial response (PR) for an ORR of 5.4% (2/37) and an additional 6/37 (16.2%) achieved stable disease (SD). The clinical benefit rate (PR+SD) for patients receiving monotherapy was 21.6% (8/37). Of the 19 patients in Part II, 3 patients achieved PR for an ORR to Part II of 15.8% (3/19) and an additional 3 achieved SD. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.7 weeks for Part I and 7.8 weeks for Part II. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) clearance at C2D1 of Trametinib monotherapy was associated with improved PFS and overall survival. In patients with mTNBC, Trametinib monotherapy demonstrated limited efficacy and addition of Uprosertib was associated with numerically greater objective responses but no difference in PFS.

In swine, it is indicated for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Glaesserella parasuis, P. multocida, and Streptococcus suis. Florfenicol is also used in aquaculture, and is licensed for use in the United States for the control of enteric septicemia in catfish. Since the early 2000s, it has been used in the Europe Union, treating mainly primary or secondary colibacillosis in broiler and parent flocks. The use of florfenicol in horses, and likely in other equids, typically causes diarrhea. This has been anecdotally reported to progress to lethal cases of acute colitis.

119,"('Mk 3207',)",Medical," Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has long been hypothesized to play a key role in migraine pathophysiology, and the advent of small-molecule antagonists has clearly demonstrated a clinical link between blocking the CGRP receptor and migraine efficacy. 2-[(8R)-8-(3,5-Difluorophenyl)-10-oxo-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-9-yl]-N-[(2R)-2'-oxo-1,1',2',3-tetrahydrospiro[indene-2,3'-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin]-5-yl]acetamide (MK-3207) represents the third CGRP receptor antagonist to display clinical efficacy in migraine trials. Here, we report the pharmacological characterization of MK-3207, a potent and orally bioavailable CGRP receptor antagonist. In vitro, MK-3207 is a potent antagonist of the human and rhesus monkey CGRP receptors (K(i) = 0.024 nM). In common with other CGRP receptor antagonists, MK-3207 displays lower affinity for CGRP receptors from other species, including canine and rodent. As a consequence of species selectivity, the in vivo potency was assessed in a rhesus monkey pharmacodynamic assay measuring capsaicin-induced changes in forearm dermal blood flow via laser Doppler imaging. MK-3207 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of dermal vasodilation, with plasma concentrations of 0.8 and 7 nM required to block 50 and 90% of the blood flow increase, respectively. The tritiated analog [3H]MK-3207 was used to study the binding characteristics on the human CGRP receptor. [3H]MK-3207 displayed reversible and saturable binding (K(D) = 0.06 nM), and the off-rate was determined to be 0.012 min(-1), with a t(1/2) value of 59 min. In vitro autoradiography studies on rhesus monkey brain slices identified the highest level of binding in the cerebellum, brainstem, and meninges. Finally, as an index of central nervous system penetrability, the in vivo cerebrospinal fluid/plasma ratio was determined to be 2 to 3% in cisterna magna-ported rhesus monkeys. Incorporation of polar functionality into a series of highly potent calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists was explored in an effort to improve pharmacokinetics. This strategy identified piperazinone analogues that possessed improved solubility at acidic pH and increased oral bioavailability in monkeys. Further optimization led to the discovery of the clinical candidate 2-[(8R)-8-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-10-oxo-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-9-yl]-N-[(2R)-2'-oxo-1,1',2',3-tetrahydrospiro[indene-2,3'-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin]-5-yl]acetamide (MK-3207) (4), the most potent orally active CGRP receptor antagonist described to date. This study evaluated the CGRP receptor antagonist MK-3207 for acute treatment of migraine. Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-stage adaptive study with two interim efficacy analyses to facilitate optimal dose selection. Migraine patients were initially randomized to MK-3207 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mg or placebo to treat a moderate/severe migraine. One or more doses were to be discontinued based on the first interim analysis and a lower or higher dose could be added based on the second interim analysis. The primary endpoint was two-hour pain freedom. A total of 547 patients took study medication. After the first interim analysis, the two lowest MK-3207 doses (2.5, 5 mg) were identified as showing insufficient efficacy. Per the pre-specified adaptive design decision rule, only the 2.5-mg group was discontinued and the five highest doses (5, 10, 20, 50, 100 mg) were continued into the second stage. After the second interim efficacy analysis, a 200 mg dose was added due to insufficient efficacy at the top three (20, 50, 100 mg) doses. A positive dose-response trend was demonstrated when data were combined across all MK-3207 doses for two-hour pain freedom (p < .001). The pairwise difference versus placebo for two-hour pain freedom was significant for 200 mg (p < .001) and nominally significant for 100 mg and 10 mg (p < .05). The incidence of adverse events appeared comparable between active treatment groups and placebo, and did not appear to increase with increasing dose.

As such, FAAH inhibitors are being actively sought for pain, addiction, and other indications. This has led to the recent pursuit of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers targeting FAAH. We report herein the preparation and preclinical evaluation of [(11)C-carbonyl]PF-04457845, an isotopologue of the potent irreversible FAAH inhibitor. PF-04457845 was radiolabeled at the carbonyl position via automated [(11)C]CO(2)-fixation. Ex vivo brain biodistribution of [(11)C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 was carried out in conscious rats. Specificity was determined by pre-administration of PF-04457845 or URB597 prior to [(11)C-carbonyl]PF-04457845. In a separate experiment, rats injected with the title radiotracer had whole brains excised, homogenized and extracted to examine irreversible binding to brain parenchyma. The title compound was prepared in 5 ± 1% (n = 4) isolated radiochemical yield based on starting [(11)C]CO(2) (decay uncorrected) within 25 min from end-of-bombardment in >98% radiochemical purity and a specific activity of 73.5 ± 8.2 GBq/μmol at end-of-synthesis. Uptake of [(11)C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 into the rat brain was high (range of 1.2-4.4 SUV), heterogeneous, and in accordance with reported FAAH distribution. Saturable binding was demonstrated by a dose-dependent reduction in brain radioactivity uptake following pre-treatment with PF-04457845. Pre-treatment with the prototypical FAAH inhibitor, URB597, reduced the brain radiotracer uptake in all regions by 71-81%, demonstrating specificity for FAAH. The binding of [(11)C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 to FAAH at 40 min post injection was irreversible as 98% of the radioactivity in the brain could not be extracted. [(11)C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 was rapidly synthesized via an automated radiosynthesis. Ex vivo biodistribution studies in conscious rodents demonstrate that [11C PF-04457845 is a promising candidate radiotracer for imaging FAAH in the brain with PET. These results coupled with the known pharmacology and toxicology of PF-04457845 should facilitate clinical translation of this radiotracer. The endogenous cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) anandamide is principally degraded by the integral membrane enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Pharmacological blockade of FAAH has emerged as a potentially attractive strategy for augmenting endocannabinoid signaling and retaining the beneficial effects of cannabinoid receptor activation, while avoiding the undesirable side effects, such as weight gain and impairments in cognition and motor control, observed with direct cannabinoid receptor 1 agonists. Here, we report the detailed mechanistic and pharmacological characterization of N-pyridazin-3-yl-4-(3-{[5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]oxy}benzylidene)piperidine-1-carboxamide (PF-04457845), a highly efficacious and selective FAAH inhibitor. Mechanistic studies confirm that PF-04457845 is a time-dependent, covalent FAAH inhibitor that carbamylates FAAH's catalytic serine nucleophile. PF-04457845 inhibits human FAAH with high potency (k(inact)/K(i) = 40,300 M(-1)s(-1); IC(50) = 7.2 nM) and is exquisitely selective in vivo as determined by activity-based protein profiling. Oral administration of PF-04457845 produced potent antinociceptive effects in both inflammatory [complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)] and noninflammatory (monosodium iodoacetate) pain models in rats, with a minimum effective dose of 0.1 mg/kg (CFA model). PF-04457845 displayed a long duration of action as a single oral administration at 1 mg/kg showed in vivo efficacy for 24 h with a concomitant near-complete inhibition of FAAH activity and maximal sustained elevation of anandamide in brain. Significantly, PF-04457845-treated mice at 10 mg/kg elicited no effect in motility, catalepsy, and body temperature. Based on its exceptional selectivity and in vivo efficacy, combined with long duration of action and optimal pharmacokinetic properties, PF-04457845 is a clinical candidate for the treatment of pain and other nervous system disorders. AIMS To evaluate the pharmacology and tolerability of PF-04457845, an orally available fatty acid amide hydrolase-1 (FAAH1) inhibitor, in healthy subjects. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled single and multiple rising dose studies and an open-label, randomized, food effect study were conducted. Plasma and urine PF-04457845 concentrations, plasma fatty acid amide concentrations and FAAH1 activity in human leucocytes were measured. Tolerability, including effects on cognitive function, were assessed. PF-04457845 was rapidly absorbed (median t(max) 0.5-1.2 h). Exposure increased supraproportionally to dose from 0.1 to 10 mg and proportionally between 10 and 40 mg single doses. The pharmacokinetics appeared dose proportional following 14 days once daily dosing between 0.5 and 8 mg. Steady-state was achieved by day 7. Less than 0.1% of the dose was excreted in urine. Food had no effect on PF-04457845 pharmacokinetics. FAAH1 activity was almost completely inhibited (>97%) following doses of at least 0.3 mg (single dose) and 0.5 mg once daily (multiple dose) PF-04457845. Mean fatty acid amide concentrations increased (3.5- to 10-fold) to a plateau and then were maintained following PF-04457845. FAAH1 activity and fatty acid amide concentrations returned to baseline within 2 weeks following cessation of dosing at doses up to 4 mg. There was no evidence of effects of PF-04457845 on cognitive function. PF-04457845, at doses up to 40 mg single dose and 8 mg once daily for 14 days, was well tolerated. PF-04457845 was well tolerated at doses exceeding those required for maximal inhibition of FAAH1 activity and elevation of fatty acid amides.",Pf 04457845,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014013137842994183), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004684782586991787), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0619971938431263)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0015023599844425917)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21666860/?utm_source=openai), [jpet.aspetjournals.org](https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/article/S0022-3565%2824%2946431-8/abstract?utm_source=openai), [tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/pf-04457845_6374?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=295, start_index=6, title='Discovery of PF-04457845: A Highly Potent, Orally Bioavailable, and Selective Urea FAAH Inhibitor', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21666860/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=295, start_index=6, title='Mechanistic and Pharmacological Characterization of PF-04457845: A Highly Potent and Selective Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase Inhibitor That Reduces Inflammatory and Noninflammatory Pain - The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics', type='url_citation', url='https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/article/S0022-3565%2824%2946431-8/abstract?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=295, start_index=6, title='PF 04457845 | Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase | Tocris Bioscience', type='url_citation', url='https://www.tocris.com/products/pf-04457845_6374?utm_source=openai')])"

This is the first study of a PDE1 inhibitor in healthy volunteers using behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to examine its effects on neural targets and to provide a safety and tolerability assessment. The primary objectives were to determine whether lenrispodun induces changes in BOLD fMRI signals in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during the stop signal task, and the dorsal anterior insula (dAI) during the extinction phase of a fear conditioning/extinction task. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design, 26 healthy individuals (22 completed all fMRI sessions) received in random order a single oral dose of placebo, lenrispodun 1.0 milligram (mg) or lenrispodun 10.0 mg and completed several tasks in the scanner including the stop signal (n = 24) and fear conditioning/extinction tasks (n = 22). Prespecified region-of-interest analyses for the IFG and dAI were computed using linear mixed models. Lenrispodun induced increases in IFG activity during the stop signal task at 1.0 mg (Cohen's d = 0.63) but not 10.0 mg (Cohen's d = 0.07) vs. placebo. Lenrispodun did not induce changes in dAI activity during fear extinction at either dose. Exploratory outcomes revealed changes in cardiac interoception. Lenrispodun administration was well-tolerated. These results provide evidence that 1.0 mg lenrispodun selectively improved neural inhibitory control without altering fear extinction processing. Future investigations should determine whether lenrispodun improves inhibitory control in target populations such as individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

This includes aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, penicilliosis, and infections by Scedosporium or Fusarium. It can be taken by mouth or used by injection into a vein. Common side effects include vision problems, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, headache, and seeing or hearing things that are not present. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. It is in the triazole family of medications. It works by affecting fungal metabolism and fungal cell membranes. Voriconazole was patented in 1990 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Voriconazole is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients, including people undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), who have hematologic cancers or who undergo organ transplants. It is also used to prevent fungal infection in people as they undergo BMT. It is also the recommended treatment for the CNS fungal infections transmitted by epidural injection of contaminated steroids. It can be taken by mouth or given in a doctor's office or clinic by intravenous infusion. == Contraindications == It is toxic to the fetus; pregnant women should not take it and women taking it should not become pregnant. People who have hereditary intolerance for galactose, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this drug. It should be used with caution in people with arrhythmias or long QT. No dose adjustment is necessary for renal impairment or advanced age, but children seem to clear voriconazole faster than adults and drug levels may need monitoring. == Side effects == The labels carry several warnings of the risk of injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions; kidney, liver, and pancreas damage; trouble with vision; and adverse effects in skin including damage due to phototoxicity, squamous cell skin cancer, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome; in long-term use there is a warning of the risk of bone fluorosis and periostitis especially in elderly patients. Additionally, very common adverse effects, occurring in more than 10% of people, include peripheral edema, headaches, trouble breathing, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, rashes, and fever. Common adverse effects, occurring in between 1 and 10% of people, include sinus infections, low numbers of white and red blood cells (agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia), low blood sugar, reduced amount of potassium and sodium, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, agitation, confusion, convulsions, fainting, tremor, weakness, tingling, sleepiness, dizziness, bleeding retina, irregular heart beats, slow or fast heart beats, low blood pressure, inflamed veins, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, inflamed lips, swollen face, stomach upset, constipation, gingivitis, jaundice, hair loss, flaky skin, itchiness, red skin, back pain, chest pain, and chills. == Interactions == Being metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450, voriconazole interacts with many drugs. Voriconazole should not be used in conjunction with many drugs (including sirolimus, rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, quinidine and ergot alkaloids) and dose adjustments and/or monitoring should be done when coadministered with others (including fluconazole, warfarin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, omeprazole, and phenytoin). Voriconazole may be safely administered with cimetidine, ranitidine, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics, mycophenolate, digoxin and prednisolone. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Voriconazole is well absorbed orally with a bioavailability of 96%, allowing patients to be switched between intravenous and oral administration. == History == Pfizer brought the drug to market as Vfend. A generic version of the tablet form of voriconazole was introduced in the US in 2011 after Pfizer and Mylan settled litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act; a generic version of the injectable form was introduced in 2012.

124,"('Lapatinib', 'Lapatinib ditosylate', 'Tykerb', 'Lapatinib base', 'Gw 572016')",Medical,"Lapatinib (INN), used in the form of lapatinib ditosylate (USAN) (trade names Tykerb and Tyverb marketed by Novartis) is an orally active drug for breast cancer and other solid tumours. It is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which interrupts the HER2/neu and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways. It is used in combination therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. It is used for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 (ErbB2). == Status == In March 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lapatinib in combination therapy for breast cancer patients already using capecitabine (Xeloda). In January 2010, Tykerb received accelerated approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses the HER2 receptor and for whom hormonal therapy is indicated (in combination with letrozole). Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) markets the drug under the proprietary names Tykerb (mostly U.S.) and Tyverb (mostly Europe and Russia). The drug currently has approval for sale and clinical use in the US, Australia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Venezuela, Brazil, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Jordan, the European Union, Lebanon, India and Pakistan. In August 2013, India's Intellectual Property Appellate Board revoked the patent for Glaxo's Tykerb citing its derivative status, while upholding at the same time the original patent granted for lapatinib. The drug lapatinib ditosylate is classified as S/NM (a synthetic compound showing competitive inhibition of the natural product) that is naturally derived or inspired substrate. == Mode of action == === Biochemistry === Lapatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity associated with two oncogenes, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2/neu (human EGFR type 2). Over expression of HER2/neu can be responsible for certain types of high-risk breast cancers in women. Like sorafenib, lapatinib is a protein kinase inhibitor shown to decrease tumor-causing breast cancer stem cells. Lapatinib inhibits receptor signal processes by binding to the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR/HER2 protein kinase domain, preventing self-phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the signal mechanism (see Receptor tyrosine kinase#Signal transduction). === Clinical application === ==== Breast cancer ==== Lapatinib is used as a treatment for women's breast cancer in treatment-naïve, ER+/EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer patients and in patients who have HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that has progressed after previous treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracycline, taxane-derived drugs, or trastuzumab (Herceptin). A 2006 GSK-supported randomized clinical trial on female breast cancer previously being treated with those agents (anthracycline, a taxane and trastuzumab) demonstrated that administrating lapatinib in combination with capecitabine delayed the time of further cancer growth compared to regimens that use capecitabine alone. The study also reported that risk of disease progression was reduced by 51%, and that the combination therapy was not associated with increases in toxic side effects. The outcome of this study resulted in a somewhat complex and rather specific initial indication for lapatinib—use only in combination with capecitabine for HER2-positive breast cancer in women whose cancer have progressed following previous chemotherapy with anthracycline, taxanes and trastuzumab. Early clinical trials have been performed suggesting that high dose intermittent lapatinib might have better efficacy with manageable toxicities in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. == Adverse effects == Like many small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lapatinib is regarded as well tolerated. The most common side effects reported are diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and rashes. Of note, lapatinib related rash is associated with improved outcome. In clinical studies elevated liver enzymes have been reported. QT prolongation has been observed with the use of lapatinib ditosylate but there are no reports of torsades de pointes. Caution is advised in patients with hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, or with coadministration of medicines known to cause QT prolongation. In combination with capecitabine, reversible decreased left ventricular function are common (2%). == Ongoing trials in gastric cancer == Phase III study designed to assess lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy for advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer in 2013 failed to meet the primary endpoint of improved overall survival (OS) against chemotherapy alone. The trial did not discover new safety signals, while the median OS for patients in the lapatinib and chemotherapy group was 12.2 months against 10.5 months for patients in the placebo plus chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints of the randomized, double-blinded study, were progression-free survival (PFS), response rate and duration of response. Median PFS was 6 months, response rate was 53% and the duration of response was 7.3 months in the investigational combination chemotherapy group compared to median PFS of 5.4 months, response rate of 39% and duration of response of 5.6 months for patients in chemotherapy alone group. Diarrhoea, vomiting, anemia, dehydration and nausea were serious adverse events (SAE) reported in over 2% of patients in the investigational combination chemotherapy group, while vomiting was the most common SAE noted in the chemotherapy group. == References == == External links == ""Lapatinib Ditosylate"".

126,"('Cabamiquine', 'M 5717', 'Ex-a3086')",Medical," We report an analysis of the propensity of the antimalarial agent cabamiquine, a Plasmodium-specific eukaryotic elongation factor 2 inhibitor, to select for resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Through in vitro studies of laboratory strains and clinical isolates, a humanized mouse model, and volunteer infection studies, we identified resistance-associated mutations at 11 amino acid positions. Of these, six (55%) were present in more than one infection model, indicating translatability across models. Mathematical modelling suggested that resistant mutants were likely pre-existent at the time of drug exposure across studies. Here, we estimated a wide range of frequencies of resistant mutants across the different infection models, much of which can be attributed to stochastic differences resulting from experimental design choices. Structural modelling implicates binding of cabamiquine to a shallow mRNA binding site adjacent to two of the most frequently identified resistance mutations. The selection and combination of dose regimens for antimalarials involve complex considerations including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions. In this study, we use immediate ex vivo P. falciparum field isolates to evaluate the effect of cabamiquine and pyronaridine as standalone treatments and in combination therapy. We feed the data into a pharmacometrics model to generate an interaction map and simulate meaningful clinical dose ratios. We demonstrate that the pharmacometrics model of parasite growth and killing provides a detailed description of parasite kinetics against cabamiquine-susceptible and resistant parasites. Pyronaridine monotherapy provides suboptimal killing rates at doses as high as 720 mg. In contrast, the combination of a single dose of 330 mg cabamiquine and 360 mg pyronaridine provides over 90% parasite killing in most of the simulated patients. The described methodology that combines a rapid, 3R-compliant in vitro method and modelling to set meaningful doses for new antimalarials could contribute to clinical drug development. Cabamiquine is a novel antimalarial agent that demonstrates the potential for chemoprevention and treatment of malaria. In this article, the dose-exposure-response relationship of cabamiquine was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model, incorporating the effects of cabamiquine on parasite dynamics at the liver and blood stages of malaria infection. Modeling was performed sequentially. First, a three-compartmental population PK model was developed, comprising linear elimination, a transit absorption model in combination with first-order absorption, and a recirculation model. Second, this model was expanded into a PK/PD model using parasitemia data from an induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) human challenge model. To describe the parasite growth and killing in the blood, a turnover model was used. Finally, the liver stage parasite dynamics were characterized using data from a sporozoite challenge model (SpzCh), and system parameters were fixed based on biological plausibility. Cabamiquine concentration in the central compartment was used to drive parasite killing at the blood and liver stages.

128,"('Chlorotrianisene', 'Chlortrianizen', 'Chlortrianisestrol', 'Chlorotrianisine', 'Chlorestrolo')",Medical,"Chlorotrianisene (CTA), also known as tri-p-anisylchloroethylene (TACE) and sold under the brand name Tace among others, is a nonsteroidal estrogen related to diethylstilbestrol (DES) which was previously used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency in women and prostate cancer in men, among other indications, but has since been discontinued and is now no longer available. It is taken by mouth. CTA is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a high-efficacy partial estrogen and shows some properties of a selective estrogen receptor modulator, with predominantly estrogenic activity but also some antiestrogenic activity. CTA itself is inactive and is a prodrug in the body. CTA was introduced for medical use in 1952. It has been marketed in the United States and Europe. However, it has since been discontinued and is no longer available in any country. == Medical uses == CTA has been used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency in women and prostate cancer in men, among other indications. It has been used to suppress lactation in women. CTA has been used in the treatment of acne as well. == Side effects == In men, CTA can produce gynecomastia as a side effect. Conversely, it does not appear to lower testosterone levels in men, and hence does not seem to have a risk of hypogonadism and associated side effects in men. == Pharmacology == CTA is a relatively weak estrogen, with about one-eighth the potency of DES. However, it is highly lipophilic and is stored in fat tissue for prolonged periods of time, with its slow release from fat resulting in a very long duration of action. CTA itself is inactive; it behaves as a prodrug to desmethylchlorotrianisene (DMCTA), a weak estrogen that is formed as a metabolite via mono-O-demethylation of CTA in the liver. As such, the potency of CTA is reduced if it is given parenterally instead of orally. Although it is referred to as a weak estrogen and was used solely as an estrogen in clinical practice, CTA is a high-efficacy partial agonist of the estrogen receptor. As such, it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), with predominantly estrogenic effects but also with antiestrogenic effects, and was arguably the first SERM to ever be introduced. CTA can antagonize estradiol at the level of the hypothalamus, resulting in disinhibition of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and an increase in estrogen levels. Clomifene and tamoxifen were both derived from CTA via structural modification, and are much lower-efficacy partial agonists than CTA and hence much more antiestrogenic in comparison. As an example, chlorotrianisene produces gynecomastia in men, albeit reportedly to a lesser extent than other estrogens, while clomifene and tamoxifen do not and can be used to treat gynecomastia. CTA at a dosage of 48 mg/day inhibits ovulation in almost all women. Conversely, it has been reported that CTA has no measurable effect on circulating levels of testosterone in men. This is in contrast to other estrogens, like diethylstilbestrol, which can suppress testosterone levels by as much as 96%—or to an equivalent extent as castration. These findings suggest that CTA is not an effective antigonadotropin in men. == Chemistry == Chlorotrianisene, also known as tri-p-anisylchloroethylene (TACE) or as tris(p-methoxyphenyl)chloroethylene, is a synthetic nonsteroidal compound of the triphenylethylene group. It is structurally related to the nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol and to the SERMs clomifene and tamoxifen. == History == CTA was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1952, and was subsequently introduced for use throughout Europe. It was the first estrogenic compound of the triphenylethylene series to be introduced. CTA was derived from estrobin (DBE), a derivative of the very weakly estrogenic compound triphenylethylene (TPE), which in turn was derived from structural modification of diethylstilbestrol (DES). The SERMs clomifene and tamoxifen, as well as the antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol, were derived from CTA via structural modification. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Chlorotrianisene is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name. It is also known as tri-p-anisylchloroethylene (TACE). === Brand names === CTA has been marketed under the brand names Tace, Estregur, Anisene, Clorotrisin, Merbentyl, Merbentul, and Triagen among many others. === Availability === CTA is no longer marketed and hence is no longer available in any country.

Flumatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has exhibited superior clinical efficacy compared to its precursor, imatinib. However, with increased clinical use, resistance to flumatinib has emerged as a significant challenge. To investigate the mechanisms of flumatinib resistance in CML, we induced the human CML cell line K562 using a flumatinib concentration gradient method in vitro, successfully establishing a flumatinib-resistant K562/FLM cell line. This cell line exhibited cross-resistance to imatinib and doxorubicin, but remained sensitive to the antiparasitic agent ivermectin, which possesses antitumoural effects. Through cellular experimentation, we explored the resistance mechanisms, which indicated that K562/FLM cells evade flumatinib cytotoxicity by enhancing autophagy, increasing the expression of membrane transport proteins, particularly P-glycoprotein, ABCC1 and ABCC4, as well as enhancing phosphorylation of p-EGFR, p-ERK and p-STAT3 proteins. Moreover, it was found that ivermectin effectively suppressed the expression of autophagy and transport proteins in K562/FLM cells, reduced the activity of the aforementioned phosphoproteins, and promoted apoptotic cell death. Collectively, the increased autophagy, higher expression of drug-efflux proteins and hyperactivation of the EGFR/ERK/STAT3 signalling pathway were identified as pivotal elements promoting resistance to flumatinib. The significant effects of ivermectin might offer a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome flumatinib resistance and optimize the treatment outcomes of CML. There are limited data comprehensively comparing therapy responses and outcomes among nilotinib, dasatinib, flumatinib and imatinib for newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in a real-world setting. Data from patients with chronic-phase CML receiving initial a second-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (2G-TKI, nilotinib, dasatinib or flumatinib) or imatinib therapy from 77 Chinese centers were retrospectively interrogated. Propensity-score matching (PSM) analyses were performed to to compare therapy responses and outcomes among these 4 TKIs. 2,496 patients receiving initial nilotinib (n = 512), dasatinib (n = 134), flumatinib (n = 411) or imatinib (n = 1,439) therapy were retrospectively interrogated in this study. PSM analyses indicated that patients receiving initial nilotinib, dasatinib or flumatinib therapy had comparable cytogenetic and molecular responses (p = .28-.91) and survival outcomes including failure-free survival (FFS, p = .28-.43), progression-free survival (PFS, p = .19-.93) and overall survival (OS) (p values = .76-.78) but had significantly higher cumulative incidences of cytogenetic and molecular responses (all p values < .001) and higher probabilities of FFS (p < .001-.01) than those receiving imatinib therapy, despite comparable PFS (p = .18-.89) and OS (p = .23-.30). Nilotinib, dasatinib and flumatinib had comparable efficacy, and significantly higher therapy responses and higher FFS rates than imatinib in newly diagnosed CML patients. However, there were no significant differences in PFS and OS among these 4 TKIs. These real-world data may provide additional evidence for routine clinical assessments to identify more appropriate therapies. The BCR-ABL mutation is the main cause of tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKI) resistance. The second-generation TKI can overcome most of the mutations. However, both dasatinib and nilotinib have a unique set of mutants with reduced sensitivity. All TKIs are associated with adverse events, which lead to treatment discontinuation and affect the quality of life of patients. Flumatinib showed higher activity against BCR-ABL mutants in vitro. Drug-related adverse events of flumatinib were mainly grade 1 or grade 2 events. There is no study that reported the efficacy of flumatinib against F359V/C mutation.We report two cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia(CML) patients with F359V/C mutation resistance to Imatinib therapy. One patient with F359V mutation was shifted to Dasatinib. Repeated massive pleural effusion and anemia occurred after Dasatinib treatment, forcing drug dosage reduction or withdrawal, affecting drug efficacy and quality of life of patient. Two patients were shifted to Flumatinib. MR4 was achieved and F359V/C mutation was not detected after treatment with Flumatinib. There was no significant side effect. The patients had a high quality of life. Flumatinib is effective against F359V/C mutation, has less drugrelated adverse reactions.

Macozinone was subjected to forced degradation in solid-state and solution-state under oxidative, thermal, hydrolytic (alkaline and acidic) and photolytic conditions. A total of nineteen DPs were detected. When Macozinone in solid-state and solution-state was treated with oxidative degradation condition, seven DPs were detected. Three DPs were found from Macozinone in the solution-state under thermal degradation condition, and five DPs were discovered in the solution-state under alkaline degradation condition. Both the solid-state and solution-state degradation of Macozinone detected two DPs under acidic degradation condition. Macozinone was highly unstable under photolytic degradation condition, as nine DPs in all were found when exposed to strong light in solid-state and solution-state.

A few DprE1 inhibitors are in the clinical trial for tuberculosis (TB), including macozinone. This review highlights the discovery, developmental status, clinical studies, patents, and prospects of macozinone (MCZ). The patent and non-patent literature search was done by entering keywords such as macozinone; MCZ; PBTZ169; PBTZ-169 in Pubmed, Espacenet, Patentscope, and the USPTO databases. However, data on Sci-Finder was searched using CAS registry number: 1377239-83-2. MCZ clinical trial studies were retrieved from the clinicaltrials.gov database using the exact keywords. The chemical structure of MCZ was disclosed in 2009. Accordingly, patents/patent applications published from 2009 to June 12, 2022, have been discussed herein. MCZ and MCZ hydrochloride salt patents were granted in 2014 and 2019, respectively, in the USA. The patent literature and the clinical trial studies suggest capsule, tablet, and suspension formulations of crystalline MCZ and its hydrochloride salt as the possible and prospective dosage forms to treat TB. Some combinations of MCZ with other drugs (chloroquine, telacebec, tafenoquine, TBI-166, and sanfetrinem) with improved anti-TB efficacy have been documented. Based on the literature covered in this review article on the clinical studies and patents applied/granted to MCZ, it can be inferred that MCZ seems to be a promising DprE1 inhibitor and could help to tackle the emerging dilemma of drug-resistant either as a monotherapy or in combination with additional anti-TB agents. Furthermore, the authors anticipate the development of new combinations, salts, and polymorphs of MCZ as anti-TB agents shortly. This review article might prove beneficial to the scientific community as it summarizes chemistry, pharmacology and provides an update on the clinical studies and patents/patent applications of one of the emerging anti-TB drugs in one place. Host heterogeneity in pulmonary tuberculosis leads to varied responses to infection and drug treatment. The present portfolio of anti-TB drugs needs to be boosted with new drugs and drug regimens. Macozinone, a clinical-stage molecule targeting the essential enzyme, DprE1, represents an attractive option. Mice (I/St, B6, (AKRxI/St)F1, B6.I-100 and B6.I-139) genetically diverse susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv infection were subjected to aerosol- or intravenous infection to determine the efficacy of macozinone (MCZ). They were treated with macozinone or reference drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin). Lung and spleen bacterial burdens were measured at four and eight weeks post-infection. Lung histology was evaluated at four weeks of treatment. Treatment with macozinone resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the bacterial load in the lungs and spleen as early as four weeks after treatment initiation in mice susceptible or resistant to Mtb infection. In the TB hypoxic granuloma model, macozinone was more potent than rifampicin in reducing the CFU counts. However, histopathological analysis revealed significant lung changes in I/St mice after eight weeks of treatment initiation. Macozinone demonstrated efficacy to varying degrees across all mouse models of Mtb infection used.

135,"('Palifosfamide', 'Isophosphoramide mustard', 'Ifosfamide mustard', 'Isophosphamide mustard', 'Ifosforamide mustard')",Medical," Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic prodrug used in the treatment of several tumor entities, including bone and soft-tissue sarcoma. However, the application of high-dose ifosfamide is not feasible because of severe side effects caused by metabolites. The active metabolite isophosphoramide mustard is not suitable for administration because of chemical instability. ZIOPHARM Oncology Inc, under license from Dekk-Tec Inc, is developing palifosfamide, a formulation of isophosphoramide mustard with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane salt-stabilization (palifosfamide-tris) and previously with lysine-stabilization (palifosfamide-lys). Preclinical studies and phase I and I/II clinical trials demonstrated that palifosfamide-tris had an antitumor efficiency comparable or superior to that of ifosfamide. Patients treated with palifosfamide-tris did not display any of the neurotoxic or nephrotoxic side effects associated with ifosfamide. At the time of publication, data from phase II trials were being evaluated and phase III trials were being planned. palifosfamide-tris is expected to be a safer and less toxic alternative to ifosfamide; however, considering other new approaches under investigation for tumors such as sarcoma, such as molecular-based treatment strategies, it is unclear what position palifosfamide-tris might occupy on the market. Purpose Palifosfamide is the active metabolite of ifosfamide and does not require prodrug activation, thereby avoiding the generation of toxic metabolites. The PICASSO III trial compared doxorubicin plus palifosfamide with doxorubicin plus placebo in patients who had received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive doxorubicin 75 mg/m Oxazaphosphorines, such as ifosfamide (IFA), are frequently used in the treatment of pediatric sarcomas. They are pro-drugs and undergo hepatic metabolism into the active moiety and potentially toxic by-products such as acrolein and chloracetaldehyde, which may cause hemorrhagic cystitis and encephalopathy, respectively. In addition, resistance to oxazaphosphorines can be mediated by overexpression of enzymes involved in their catabolism. Isophosphoramide mustard (IPM, palifosfamide) is the active moiety of IFA. In the current study, the activity of palifosfamide lysine (ZIO-201), a stable form of palifosfamide, was evaluated in a panel of sarcoma cell lines and tumor xenografts including oxazaphosphorine-resistant xenografts. The cytotoxic effect of palifosfamide lysine was studied in osteosarcoma (OS), Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines using the MTT assay. In vivo, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of palifosfamide lysine was determined in SCID mice based on a 3-day intravenous (IV) administration schedule. The effect on tumor growth and event-free survival was assessed at the MTD in all three sarcoma xenografts. In OS, cyclophosphamide (CPA)-resistant and -sensitive xenografts (OS31 and OS33, respectively) were evaluated for palifosfamide lysine activity. ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 gene expression data for the OS xenografts were mined from the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program gene expression data. ALDH3A1 enzyme levels were compared between the CPA-resistant and -sensitive xenografts. Palifosfamide lysine was cytotoxic against all the cell lines tested with the IC(50) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 microg/ml except for OS222, which had an IC(50) of 7 microg/ml. The IV MTD of palifosfamide lysine in mice was 100 mg/kg per day for three consecutive days. Tumor growth inhibition was seen in both OS31 and OS33 xenografts and the RMS xenograft resulting in a significant difference in event-free survival between the control and the treated groups. Differential gene expression of ALDH3A1 but not ALDH1A1 was noted in the OS31 xenograft. This was confirmed by RT-PCR and the ALDH3A1 enzyme assay. ALDH3A1 enzyme activity was measured at 100 mIU/mg of protein in OS31 xenograft but no significant activity was seen in the OS33 xenograft. We conclude that palifosfamide lysine has broad activity in a panel of sarcoma cell lines. It inhibits tumor growth in OS and RMS xenografts. Furthermore, it is active against the CPA-resistant, ALDH3A1 overexpressing, OS xenograft suggesting that it might have the potential of overcoming this resistance mechanism against oxazaphosphorines and may be an active agent in resistant/relapsed sarcomas in patients.",Palifosfamide,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007636015070602298), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008624804206192493)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([fiercebiotech.com](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/ziopharm-terminates-development-of-palifosfamide-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=164, start_index=6, title='ZIOPHARM Terminates Development of Palifosfamide in Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma | Fierce Biotech', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/ziopharm-terminates-development-of-palifosfamide-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma?utm_source=openai')])"

Darolutamide was patented in 2011 and was approved for medical use in USA in July 2019, in the European Union in March 2020 in Australia in July 2020. and in Canada in 2020, == Medical uses == Darolutamide is approved for use concurrently with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist or bilateral orchiectomy in the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) in men. It is used at a dosage of 600 mg orally twice per day (1,200 mg/day total) with food. In individuals with severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment, darolutamide is used at a dosage of 300 mg orally twice per day (600 mg/day total) with food. No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment, whereas appropriate dosage adjustment for end-stage kidney disease and severe hepatic impairment is unknown. Two 2020 meta-analyses reported that enzalutamide and apalutamide seemed to be more effective than darolutamide in improving metastasis-free survival (MFS), however 2021 matched adjusted indirect comparison showed no significant differences between drugs in terms of MFS. According to 2021 meta-analysis darolutamide was ranked first in terms of improving overall survival (OS). Also, darolutamide showed significantly lower rate of grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) compared to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. === Available forms === Darolutamide is provided in the form of 300 mg oral film-coated tablets. == Contraindications == Darolutamide has no contraindications in men. However, the medication may have teratogenic effects in male fetuses due to its antiandrogenic effects and hence should not be used by women who are pregnant. == Side effects == The most common side effects of darolutamide in clinical trials (≥2% incidence) in castrated men included fatigue and asthenia (16% vs. 11% for placebo), pain in extremities (6% vs. 3% for placebo), and rash (3% vs. 1% for placebo). Darolutamide was also associated with higher incidences of ischemic heart disease (4.0% vs. 3.4% for placebo) and heart failure (2.1% vs. 0.9% for placebo). In terms of laboratory test abnormalities, darolutamide was associated with decreased neutrophil count (20% vs. 9% for placebo), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (23% vs. 14% for placebo; Grade 3–4: 0.5% vs. 0.2% for placebo), and increased bilirubin (16% vs. 7% for placebo). In the clinical studies, 88% of patients treated with darolutamide were age 65 years or older. No seizures have been observed with darolutamide in clinical trials. Darolutamide is an expected teratogen and has a theoretical risk of birth defects in male infants if taken by women during pregnancy. It may impair male fertility. When used as a monotherapy (i.e., without surgical or medical castration) in men, NSAAs are known to produce feminizing breast changes including breast tenderness and gynecomastia. == Overdose == Darolutamide has been studied at a dosage of up to 1,800 mg/day in clinical trials. There were no dose-limiting toxicities seen at this dosage. Due to its saturable absorption and lack of acute toxicity, overdose of darolutamide is not expected to result in systemic toxicity in people with intact hepatic and renal function. There is no specific antidote for overdose of darolutamide. In the event of darolutamide overdose, if there is no toxicity, treatment can be continued as normal. If there is suspicion of toxicity, general supportive measures should be undertaken until clinical toxicity has decreased or resolved and then treatment may be continued. == Interactions == Combined P-glycoprotein and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin may decrease blood levels of darolutamide, while combined P-glycoprotein and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may increase blood levels of darolutamide. Darolutamide is an inhibitor of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporter and can increase blood levels of substrates for BCRP protein, such as rosuvastatin, by approximately 5-fold. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Darolutamide is a second- or third-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA). It acts as a selective competitive silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Its affinity (Ki) for the AR is 11 nM and its functional inhibition (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of the AR is 26 nM. The major metabolite of darolutamide, ketodarolutamide, has similar antiandrogenic activity relative to darolutamide (Ki = 8 nM; IC50 = 38 nM). In addition to its actions as an AR antagonist, darolutamide has been found to act as a silent antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), with approximately 1% of the potency of its AR antagonism. A dosage of darolutamide of 1,200 mg/day has been found to result in a mean decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels of more than 90% in men with prostate cancer. The addition of darolutamide to castration has been found to decrease PSA levels by more than 50% in about 50% of men at 200 mg/day, 69% of men at 400 mg/day, 83% of men at 1,200 mg/day, and 86% of men at 1,400 mg/day. In accordance with its antiandrogenic activity, darolutamide monotherapy (600 mg b.i.d.) has been found to increase testosterone levels in men with prostate cancer by 43.3% on average (range 5.7 to 144.0%), from median 413 ng/dL (range 209–1183 ng/dL) at baseline to median 595 ng/dL (range 260–1500 ng/dL), after 24 weeks of treatment. For comparison, testosterone levels increased by 114.3% with enzalutamide monotherapy and high-dose bicalutamide monotherapy increases testosterone levels by about 59 to 97% in men with prostate cancer. A phase 2 clinical trial directly comparing testosterone increases with darolutamide monotherapy versus enzalutamide monotherapy is underway as of January 2024. Darolutamide shows some advantages in comparison to enzalutamide and apalutamide, two other second-generation NSAAs. It has been claimed to negligibly cross the blood–brain barrier, and hence is thought to have a reduced risk of seizures and other central side effects from off-target GABAA receptor inhibition. However, darolutamide monotherapy has subsequently been found to increase testosterone levels, a centrally mediated antiandrogenic action. Darolutamide has been found to block the activity of all tested/well-known mutant ARs in prostate cancer, including the recently identified clinically-relevant F876L mutation that produces resistance to enzalutamide and apalutamide. The medication shows higher affinity and inhibitory potency at the AR relative to enzalutamide and apalutamide in vitro (Ki = 11 nM relative to 86 nM for enzalutamide and 93 nM for apalutamide; IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 26 nM relative to 219 nM for enzalutamide and 200 nM for apalutamide). Darolutamide inhibits the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. It shows no inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4) at clinically relevant concentrations. Similarly, darolutamide shows no inhibition of a variety of other transporters (P-glycoprotein, MRP2, BSEP, OATs, OCTs, MATEs, OATP2B1, NTCP) at therapeutic concentrations. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absolute bioavailability of darolutamide with oral administration of a single 300-mg dose without food is approximately 30%. The bioavailability of darolutamide is increased by about 2- to 2.5-fold when administered with food, with a similar increase in exposure occurring for ketodarolutamide. Exposure to darolutamide and ketodarolutamide increases in a nearly linear or dose-proportional manner across a dose range of 100 to 700 mg (or about 0.17- to 1.17-fold the recommended 600-mg dosage). No further increase in exposure to darolutamide was observed at a dosage of darolutamide of 900 mg twice per day (or 1.5 times the recommended 600-mg dosage), indicating a saturation of absorption at doses above 700 mg. Following a single 600-mg dose of darolutamide, peak levels of darolutamide occur after approximately 4 hours. Steady-state levels of darolutamide occur after 2 to 5 days of continuous administration with food, during which time an approximate 2-fold accumulation in darolutamide levels occurs. At steady state with 600 mg/day darolutamide, mean levels of darolutamide are 4.79 μg/mL and area-under-the-curve levels of darolutamide over time 0 to 12 hours (AUC0–12) are 52.82 h•μg/mL. Total exposure to ketodarolutamide is approximately 1.7-fold that of darolutamide. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of darolutamide with intravenous administration is 119 L. The plasma protein binding of darolutamide is 92%, with 8% circulating freely, and of ketodarolutamide is 99.8%, with 0.2% circulating unbound. As such, free levels of darolutamide in the circulation are about 40-fold higher than those of ketodarolutamide. Both darolutamide and ketodarolutamide are bound mainly to albumin. Darolutamide and ketodarolutamide has been claimed to negligibly cross the blood–brain barrier both in mice and humans. However, a subsequent study of darolutamide monotherapy in men with prostate cancer found that it increased testosterone levels, a centrally mediated antiandrogenic action. Darolutamide is a known substrate of P-glycoprotein and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). P-Glycoprotein is known to play a major role in excluding drugs from the brain due to efflux back across the blood–brain barrier. ==== Metabolism ==== Darolutamide is primarily metabolized into ketodarolutamide via dehydrogenation by CYP3A4 in the liver. The medication is also conjugated via glucuronidation by UGT1A9 and UGT1A1. The elimination half-life of darolutamide and ketodarolutamide has been reported to be approximately 20 hours. A clinical study found that the elimination half-lives of darolutamide and ketodarolutamide at steady-state were 15.8 hours and 10.0 hours, respectively, with these half-lives being independent of dosage across a dose range of darolutamide of 200 to 1,800 mg/day. The elimination half-life of darolutamide is far shorter than that of enzalutamide (e.g., 1.6 hours vs. 18.3 hours in mice). The clearance of darolutamide following intravenous administration is 116 mL/min. ==== Excretion ==== After a single oral dose of darolutamide, more than 95% of the dose is excreted in urine and feces within one week following administration. A total of 63.4% darolutamide-related material is recovered in urine (about 7% as unchanged darolutamide) and a total of 32.4% darolutamide-related material (about 30% as unchanged darolutamide) is recovered in feces. ==== Variability ==== No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide have been observed in men with nmCRPC on the basis of age (48 to 95 years), race (white, Asian, black), mild-to-moderate renal impairment, or mild hepatic impairment. In non-nmCRPC individuals with severe renal impairment not on dialysis, exposure to darolutamide was increased by about 2.5-fold relative to healthy people. In non-nmCRPC individuals with moderate hepatic impairment, darolutamide exposure was increased by about 1.9-fold compared to healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of darolutamide have not been assessed in end-stage kidney disease or severe hepatic impairment. == Chemistry == Darolutamide is a nonsteroidal compound and is structurally distinct from other marketed NSAAs, including enzalutamide and apalutamide. == History == Darolutamide was developed by Orion Corporation and Bayer HealthCare. Orion Corporation applied for a patent on darolutamide in October 2010, and this patent was published in May 2011. Darolutamide entered phase I clinical trials in April 2011, with the results of the first clinical study of darolutamide initially published in 2012. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved darolutamide in July 2019, under the agency's priority review designation. Approval was based on ARAMIS, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 1,509 patients with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either 600 mg darolutamide orally twice daily (n=955) or matching placebo (n=554). All patients received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or had a previous bilateral orchiectomy. Twelve patients with previous seizure histories were treated on the darolutamide arm. The primary endpoint was metastasis free survival (MFS), defined as the time from randomization to first evidence of distant metastasis or death from any cause within 33 weeks after the last evaluable scan, whichever occurred first. The median MFS was 40.4 months (95% CI: 34.3, not reached) for patients treated with darolutamide compared with 18.4 months (95% CI: 15.5, 22.3) for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio 0.41; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.50; p<0.0001). Darolutamide was associated with greater benefits than placebo for all secondary end points, including overall survival (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53-0.88; P=0.003), time to pain progression (median 40.3 months vs. 25.4 months; hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53-0.79; P<0.001), time to cytotoxic chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.43; 95% CI: 0.31-0.60), and time to a symptomatic skeletal event (hazard ratio 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.84). == Society and culture == === Generic names === Darolutamide is the generic name of the medication and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. It is also known by its developmental code names ODM-201 and BAY-1841788. === Brand names === Darolutamide is marketed under the brand name Nubeqa. === Availability === Darolutamide is available in the United States, Canada and the European Union. == Research == Darolutamide monotherapy is being studied in comparison to androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH agonist or antagonist monotherapy in men with treatment-naive prostate cancer. As of 2018, it is entering a phase II clinical trial for this indication. In 2020, completion of this study had been expected in 2021 or 2022. Darolutamide is being studied for the treatment of breast cancer in women. As of November 2019, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication. == References == == External links == ""Darolutamide"". Drug Information Portal.

137,"('Terconazole', 'Terazol 3', 'Terazol 7', 'Triaconazole', 'Fungistat')",Medical,"Terconazole is an antifungal drug used to treat vaginal yeast infection. It comes as a lotion or a suppository and disrupts the biosynthesis of fats in a yeast cell. It has a relatively broad spectrum compared to azole compounds but not triazole compounds. Testing shows that it is a suitable compound for prophylaxis for those that suffer from chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis. == Medical uses == Terconazole is approved to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal thrush). It works as a broad spectrum antifungal and has shown to be an effective first-line treatment against other Candida species. It also shows effectiveness against dermatomycoses in animal models. A review found that short-term rates for intravaginally administered azole treatments shows cure in 80% of cases in a short term follow-up and 66% over long term follow-up. In a double-blind study by Slavin in 1992, terconazole showed a 75% mycological cure over a short-term period (7–14 days) and 100% mycological cure over a long-term period (28–34 days). This study focused on the drug as an 80 mg vaginal suppository, taken three times overnight by 10 women. In another placebo-controlled, double blind study by Schmidt et al., the efficacy of different concentrations of terconazole creams were tested. Cream was applied for three days to 24 women between the ages of 18 and 60. The results showed 0.8% terconazole mycologic cure rates were 83.3% within 1–3 days of starting treatment, 83.3% within 8–11 days of treatment and 58.3% within 30–35 days of treatment. The suppository is more effective after a long-term follow-up than terconazole as a cream or other intravaginal treatments. == Side effects == The most common side effects of terconazole include headaches, vulvar/vaginal irritation, rash, itching, burning or discomfort. Other side effects may include abdominal pain or cramps, dysmenorrhea, chills, fever and allergic reactions. Flu-like symptoms have been recorded in those that take suppositories greater than 160 mg. May cause birth defects if used in the first trimester. Terconazole is not considered hazardous when handled under normal conditions. It is generally non-flammable and non-carcinogenic. Generally is non-toxic, however, can emit toxic fumes when dust is set alight. Can cause respiratory distress as dust. Can be absorbed by embryo within the first trimester of pregnancy and cause birth defects. Cross inhibition shows that there may be some toxicity. == Interactions == Terconazole may interact with the spermicide nonoxynol-9. A precipitate is formed upon combination of both drugs. Terconazole may weaken latex-based condoms. == Chemistry == Terconazole is a triazole ketal with broad-spectrum antifungal/antimycotic tendencies. Terconazole synthesis synologous with ketoconazole except for the fact that triazole and not imidazole heterocyclic ring is used, and that isopropyl group instead of acetamide. Terconazole has the chemical formula C26H31Cl2N5O3. The chemical name for terconazole is 1-{[(2S,4S)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-{[p-(4-isopropyl-1-piperazinyl)phenoxy]methyl}-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl}-1H-1,2,4-triazole. Terconazole has a melting point of 126.3 °C (259.34 °F). The molecular weight of terconazole is 532.462 g/mol. Terconazole is synthesized using two chemical compounds: cis-[2(bromomethyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methyl benzoate and the sodium salt of triazole, created by mixing triazole with sodium hydride. These are put in a solution and catalyzed using dimethyl sulfate at 1300 °C (2372 °F) to give many different types of triazole derivatives. These are purified using alcohol and chromatography. Terconazole is non-reactive except when exposed to strong oxidizing agents or strong bases due to the nitrogen attached to the triazole ring. It has been found to be photosensitive. == Mechanism of action == Terconazole binds to the heme iron component on the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol of fungi, also known as CYP3A4. The gene ERG11 controls lanosterol creation. Lanosterol is found within the yeast plasma membrane. It is a class of methylsterol. Within a normal yeast cell, lanosterol is demethylated using 14α-demethylation. This process creates zymosterol: a major constituent in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway for the creation of cell membrane constituents in yeast. This structure provides the membrane with fluidity. This occurs by transforming lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-β-ol. This stops respiration by prohibiting reduction of NADH to NAD. This stops biosynthesis of cell membrane products as well as transport and catabolism. Eventually, membrane fluidity and activity of membrane bound enzymes become depleted. It has also been shown to inhibit morphologic change of yeast as well as cell adherence and is directly toxic to yeast. Terconazole targets fungi specifically since humans do not use lanosterol in this pathway. This process does not affect all fungi such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which lacks lanosterol. == Metabolism == Absorption of terconazole is 5–8% in patients that have had a hysterectomy and 12–16% in other patients. In those that administered 0.8% terconazole, plasma concentrations of the drug remained quite low with the peak plasma concentration being 0.006 mcg at 6.6 hours. Those metabolism rates show similar results in pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis, non-pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis and healthy women. The half-life of terconazole in blood is recorded to be around 6.9 hours over a range of 4–11.3 hours). Radioactivity of plasma terconazole is low compared to terconazole at 0.6%. Excretion of radioactivity is via two routes, renal (32–53%) and fecal (47–52%). Metabolism is extensive and is highly protein bound (94.9%) with the degree of binding being independent of drug concentration. == History == In 1940, the first commercial antifungal drug, called amphotericin B, was available on the market, replacing rare and expensive treatments. It was effective in its function but was very toxic and only used for serious infections. The drug was infused into the bloodstream and could cause kidney damage and other side effects. The first azole compounds to replace this treatment were synthesized in the late 1960s and early 1970s and administered to humans under strict care. These compounds were imidazoles, a molecule containing two non-adjacent nitrogen atoms in a 5 membered ring. The first oral antimycotic imidazole, called ketoconazole, was available on the market in 1981. Triazole based drugs came shortly after and quickly gained popularity due to its broader spectrum of antifungal activity and less toxicity. Terconazole was the first triazole-based antifungal drug synthesized for human use. Janssen Pharmaceutica developed it in 1983. Previously, all triazole based drugs targeted fungal infections related to plants from Candida species. Since creation, terconazole has been superseded by second-generation triazoles due to their even broader spectrum and higher activity levels against resistant pathogens like Aspergillus spp. It is still used as a treatment in cases of resistance to other drugs. == Available forms == Terconazole is a white, odourless powder. It can be purchased commercially in the following forms: Terconazole 0.4% cream 5 g applied intravaginally once a day for 7 days; Terconazole 0.8% cream 5 g applied intravaginally once a day for 3 days; Terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository used once daily for 3 days. == References == == External links == Information about terconazole from the United States Government",Fungistat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006512607913464308), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002539031207561493)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors that disrupt BCR signaling have received regulatory approvals in therapy of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). However, responses are incomplete and patients who experience BTK inhibitor therapy failure have dire outcomes. CG-806 (luxeptinib) is a dual BTK/SYK inhibitor in clinical development in hematologic malignancies. Here we investigated the pre-clinical activity of CG-806 in MCL. In vitro treatment with CG-806 thwarted survival of MCL cell lines and patient-derived MCL cells in a dose-dependent manner. CG-806 blocked BTK and SYK activation and abrogated BCR signaling. Contrary to ibrutinib, CG-806 downmodulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, abrogated survival of ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines, and partially reversed the pro-survival effects of stromal microenvironment-mimicking conditions in primary MCL cells. Dual BTK/SYK inhibition led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization accompanied by mitophagy and metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis. In vivo studies of CG-806 demonstrated improved survival in one of the two tested aggressive MCL PDX models. While suppression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and NFκB signaling correlated with in vivo drug sensitivity, OxPhos and MYC transcriptional programs were upregulated in the resistant model following treatment with CG-806. BAX and NFKBIA were implicated in susceptibility to CG-806 in a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 library screen (in a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line). A high-throughput in vitro functional drug screen demonstrated synergy between CG-806 and Bcl-2 inhibitors. In sum, dual BTK/SYK inhibitor CG-806 disrupts BCR signaling and induces metabolic reprogramming and apoptosis in MCL. The Bcl-2 network is a key mediator of sensitivity to CG-806 and combined targeting of Bcl-2 demonstrates synergy with CG-806 warranting continued exploration in lymphoid malignancies. Luxeptinib (CG-806) simultaneously targets FLT3 and select other kinase pathways operative in myeloid malignancies. We investigated the range of kinases it inhibits, its cytotoxicity landscape ex vivo with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples, and its efficacy in xenograft models. Luxeptinib inhibits wild-type (WT) and many of the clinically relevant mutant forms of FLT3 at low nanomolar concentrations. It is a more potent inhibitor of the activity of FLT3-internal tandem duplication, FLT3 kinase domain and gatekeeper mutants than against WT FLT3. Broad kinase screens disclosed that it also inhibits other kinases that can drive oncogenic signaling and rescue pathways, but spares kinases known to be associated with clinical toxicity. In vitro profiling of luxeptinib against 186 AML fresh patient samples demonstrated greater potency relative to other FLT3 inhibitors, including cases with mutations in FLT3, isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/2, ASXL1, NPM1, SRSF2, TP53, or RAS, and activity was documented in a xenograft AML model. Luxeptinib administered continuously orally every 12 hours at a dose that yielded a mean Cmin plasma concentration of 1.0 ± 0.3 μmol/L (SEM) demonstrated strong antitumor activity but no myelosuppression or evidence of tissue damage in mice or dogs in acute toxicology studies.

A formulation of marbofloxacin combined with clotrimazole and dexamethasone is available under the name Aurizon (CAS number 115550-35-1). == Mechanism of action == Its mechanism of action is not thoroughly understood, but it is believed to be similar to the other fluoroquinolones by impairing the bacterial DNA gyrase which results in rapid bactericidal activity. The other proposed mechanisms include that it acts against nondividing bacteria and does not require protein and RNA synthesis, which block protein and RNA synthesis respectively. == Activity == Marbofloxacin is a synthetic, broad spectrum bactericidal agent. The bactericidal activity of marbofloxacin is concentration dependent, with susceptible bacteria cell death occurring within 20–30 minutes of exposure. Like other fluoroquinolones, marbofloxacin has demonstrated a significant post-antibiotic effect for both gram– and + bacteria and is active in both stationary and growth phases of bacterial replication. It has good activity against many gram-negative bacilli and cocci, is effective against: == Application == Marbofloxacin can be used both orally and topically. It is particularly used for infections of the skin, respiratory system and mammary glands in dogs and cats, as well as with urinary tract infections. For dogs, a dose ranges from 2.75 - 5.5 mg/kg once a day. The duration of treatment is usually at least five days, longer if there is a concurrent fungal or yeast infection. Maximum duration of treatment is 30 days. == Contraindications and side effects == Marbofloxacin should usually be avoided in young animals because of potential cartilage abnormalities. In rare occasion, it can cause central nervous system (CNS) stimulation and should be used with caution in patients with seizure disorders. Under certain conditions it can cause discomfort such as cramps, treatable with diazepam. Other adverse effects are usually limited to gastrointestinal tract (GI) distress (vomiting, anorexia, soft stools, diarrhoea) and decreased activity. == References ==",Marbocyl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.8114868998527527), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.13472849130630493), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6933311223983765)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbofloxacin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=6, title='Marbofloxacin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbofloxacin?utm_source=openai')])"

The approval of vismodegib on January 30, 2012, represents the first Hedgehog signaling pathway targeting agent to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The drug is also undergoing clinical trials for metastatic colorectal cancer, small-cell lung cancer, advanced stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, medulloblastoma and chondrosarcoma as of June 2011. The drug was developed by the biotechnology/pharmaceutical company Genentech. == Indication == Vismodegib is indicated for people with basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) which has metastasized to other parts of the body, relapsed after surgery, or cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. == Mechanism of action == The substance acts as a cyclopamine-competitive antagonist of the smoothened receptor (SMO) which is part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. SMO inhibition causes the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2 to remain inactive, which prevents the expression of tumor mediating genes within the hedgehog pathway. This pathway is pathogenetically relevant in more than 90% of basal-cell carcinomas. == Side effects == In clinical trials, common side effects included gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation), muscle spasms, fatigue, hair loss, and dysgeusia (distortion of the sense of taste). == Development == Vismodegib has undergone several promising phase I and phase II clinical trials for its use in treating medulloblastoma. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Vismodegib"".

142,"('Rosuvastatin (calcium)', 'Rosuvastatin hemicalcium', 'Zd 4522 calcium', 'Rosuvastatin', 'Crestor')",Medical,"Rosuvastatin, sold under the brand name Crestor among others, is a statin medication, used to prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and treat abnormal lipids. It is recommended to be used together with dietary changes, exercise, and weight loss. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headaches, and muscle pains. Serious side effects may include rhabdomyolysis, liver problems, and diabetes. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Like all statins, rosuvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme found in the liver that plays a role in producing cholesterol. Rosuvastatin was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 37 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == The primary use of rosuvastatin is for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and the treatment of abnormal lipids. === Effects on cholesterol levels === The effects of rosuvastatin on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin. Meta-analysis showed that rosuvastatin can modestly increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as with other statins. A 2014 Cochrane review determined there was good evidence for rosuvastatin lowering non-HDL levels linearly with dose. == Side effects and contraindications == Side effects are uncommon: constipation heartburn dizziness sleeplessness depression joint pain cough memory loss or forgetfulness confusion The following rare side effects are more serious. Like all statins, rosuvastatin can possibly cause myopathy, rhabdomyolysis: muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness lack of energy fever chest pain jaundice: yellowing of the skin or eyes dark colored, or foamy urine pain in the upper right part of the abdomen nausea extreme tiredness weakness unusual bleeding or bruising loss of appetite flu-like symptoms sore throat, chills, or other signs of infection Allergic reactions can develop: rash hives itching difficulty breathing or swallowing swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs hoarseness numbness or tingling in fingers or toes Rosuvastatin has multiple contraindications, including hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any component of the formulation, active liver disease, elevation of serum transaminases, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Rosuvastatin is not prescribed nor used while pregnant, as it can cause serious harm to the fetus. In the case of breastfeeding, it is unknown whether rosuvastatin is passed through breast milk. The risk of myopathy may be increased in Asian Americans: ""Because Asians appear to process the drug differently, half the standard dose can have the same cholesterol-lowering benefit in those patients, though a full dose could increase the risk of side effects, a study by the drug's manufacturer, AstraZeneca, indicated."" Therefore, the lowest dose is recommended in Asians. === Myopathy === As with all statins, there is a concern of rhabdomyolysis, a severe undesired side effect. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has indicated that ""it does not appear that the risk [of rhabdomyolysis] is greater with Crestor than with other marketed statins"", but has mandated that a warning about this side-effect, as well as a kidney toxicity warning, be added to the product label. === Diabetes mellitus === Statins increase the risk of diabetes, consistent with FDA's review, which reported a 27% increase in investigator-reported diabetes mellitus in rosuvastatin-treated people. == Drug interactions == The following drugs can have negative interactions with rosuvastatin and should be discussed with the prescribing doctor: Coumadin anticoagulants ('blood thinners', e.g. warfarin) can affect the removal of rosuvastatin Ciclosporin, colchicine Drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones, e.g. cimetidine, ketoconazole, and spironolactone Additional medications for high cholesterol such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and niacin (when taken in lipid-modifying doses of 1 g/day and above) Specific protease inhibitors including atazanavir (when taken with ritonavir), lopinavir/ritonavir and simeprevir Alcohol intake should be reduced while on rosuvastatin to decrease the risk of developing liver damage Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide antacids should not be taken within two hours of taking rosuvastatin Coadministration of rosuvastatin with eluxadoline may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy Grapefruit juice negatively interacts with several specific drugs in the statin class, but it has little or no effect on rosuvastatin. == Structure == Rosuvastatin has structural similarities with most other statins, e.g., atorvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin, but unlike other statins, rosuvastatin contains sulfur (in sulfonyl functional group). Crestor is a calcium salt of rosuvastatin, i.e. rosuvastatin calcium, in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group on the right of the skeletal formula at the top right of this page. == Mechanism of action == Rosuvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, having a mechanism of action similar to that of other statins. Putative beneficial effects of rosuvastatin therapy on chronic heart failure may be negated by increases in collagen turnover markers as well as a reduction in plasma coenzyme Q10 levels in patients with chronic heart failure. == Pharmacodynamics == The dose-related magnitude of rosuvastatin on blood lipids was determined in a Cochrane systematic review in 2014. Over the dose range of 1 to 80 mg/day strong linear dose‐related effects were found; total cholesterol was reduced by 22.1% to 44.8%, LDL cholesterol by 31.2% to 61.2%, non-HDL cholesterol by 28.9% to 56.7% and triglycerides by 14.4% to 26.6%. == Pharmacokinetics == Absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is about 20% and Cmax is reached in 3 to 5 hours; administration with food did not affect the AUC according to the original sponsor submitted clinical study and as per product label. However, a subsequent clinical study has shown a marked reduction in rosuvastatin exposure when administered with food. It is 88% protein bound, mainly to albumin. Fraction absorbed of rosuvastatin is frequently misquoted in the literature as approximately 0.5 (50%) due to a miscalculated hepatic extraction ratio in the original submission package subsequently corrected by the FDA reviewer. Rosuvastatin is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9 and not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% is recovered as metabolite N-desmethyl rosuvastatin. It is excreted in feces (90%) primarily and the elimination half-life is approximately 19 hours. Both AUC and Cmax are approximately 2-fold higher in Asian patients compared to Caucasian patients given the same dose of rosuvastatin. == Society and culture == Rosuvastatin is the international nonproprietary name (INN). === Economics === Because low- to moderate dose statins are strongly recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 40–75 years who are at risk, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States requires most health insurance plans to cover the costs of these drugs without charging the insured patient a copayment or coinsurance, even if he or she has not yet reached his or her annual deductible. Rosuvastatin 5 mg and 10 mg are examples of regimens meeting the USPSTF guideline; however, insurers have discretion as to which low- and moderate-dose statin regimens to cover under this requirement, and some only cover other statins. The drug was billed as a ""super-statin"" during its clinical development; the claim was that it offered high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to rosuvastatin are atorvastatin and simvastatin. However, people can also combine ezetimibe with either simvastatin or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. As of 2006 some published information for comparing rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results are available, but many of the relevant studies are still in progress. First launched in 2003, sales of rosuvastatin were $129 million and $908 million in 2003, and 2004, respectively, with a total patient treatment population of over 4 million by the end of 2004. Annual cost to the UK National Health Service (NHS) in 2018, for 5–40 mg rosuvastatin daily (of one person) was £24-40, compared to £10-20 for 20–80 mg simvastatin. In 2013, it was the fourth-highest-selling drug in the United States, accounting for approximately $5.2 billion in sales. In 2021, it was the thirteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 32 million prescriptions. === Legal status === Rosuvastatin is approved in the United States for the treatment of high LDL cholesterol (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), and/or triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia). In February 2010, rosuvastatin was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. As of 2004, rosuvastatin had been approved in 154 countries and launched in 56. Approval in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) came on 13 August 2003. === Patent protection and generic versions === The main patent that protected rosuvastatin (RE37,314, which expired in 2016) was challenged as being an improper reissue of an earlier patent. This challenge was rejected in 2010, and thus patent protection continued until 2016. In April 2016, the FDA approved the first generic version of rosuvastatin (from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc). In July 2016, Mylan gained approval for its generic rosuvastatin calcium. === Debate and criticisms === In October 2003, several months after its introduction in Europe, Richard Horton, the editor of the medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. ""AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines,"" according to his editorial. The Lancet's editorial position is that the data for Crestor's superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in The Lancet, AstraZeneca's CEO Tom McKillop called the editorial ""flawed and incorrect"" and slammed the journal for making ""such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine."" In 2004, the consumer interest organization Public Citizen filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA, asking that Crestor be withdrawn from the US market. On 11 March 2005, the FDA issued a letter to Sidney M. Wolfe of Public Citizen both denying the petition and providing an extensive detailed analysis of findings that demonstrated no basis for concerns about rosuvastatin compared with the other statins approved for marketing in the United States. In 2015, Wolfe explained why he thought that ""the drug should have been withdrawn and why it should not be used"", due to the incidence of rhabdomyolysis, renal problems, and significant increase in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting insulin levels, and decreased insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients. Rosuvastatin indeed lowered cholesterol more than other statins, but Wolfe asked ""what about actually improving health, preventing heart attacks and strokes?"" == References ==",Crestor,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.410734163684538e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034517052699811757)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/crestor.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Crestor Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/crestor.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Atovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of both ubiquinone and lawsone. == Medical uses == Atovaquone is a medication used to treat or prevent: For pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), it is used in mild cases, although it is not approved for treatment of severe cases. For toxoplasmosis, the medication has antiparasitic and therapeutic effects. For malaria, it is one of the two components (along with proguanil) in the drug Malarone. Malarone has fewer side effects and is more expensive than mefloquine. Resistance has been observed. For babesia, it is often used in conjunction with oral azithromycin. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim) is generally considered first-line therapy for PCP (not to be confused with sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, which is first line for toxoplasmosis). However, atovaquone may be used in patients who cannot tolerate, or are allergic to, sulfonamide medications such as TMP-SMX. In addition, atovaquone has the advantage of not causing myelosuppression, which is an important issue in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation. Atovaquone is given prophylactically to kidney transplant patients to prevent PCP in cases where Bactrim is contraindicated for the patient. === Malaria === Atovaquone, as a combination preparation with proguanil, has been commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline since 2000 as Malarone for the treatment and prevention of malaria. == Research == === COVID-19 === Preliminary research found that atovaquone could inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Clinical trials of atovaquone for the treatment of COVID-19 are planned, and ongoing in United States in December 2021. Atovaquone has also been found to inhibit human coronavirus OC43 and feline coronavirus in vitro.

In phase III clinical trials, the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib was tested in participants with BRAFV600-mutated metastatic melanoma, which resulted in significant improvement in progression-free survival in participants, but also produced some increase in toxicity. The combination increased progression-free survival to an average of 12.3 months, compared to 7.2 months for vemurafenib alone. This clinical data also showed that the combination treatment resulted in 65% survival rate of participants 17 months after beginning the treatment, increased rates from the 50% of participants on vemurafenib treatment alone. Adding cobimetinib also increased the median overall survival to 25.6 months, compared to the 18 months for vemurafenib alone.

Moreover, preclinical findings suggest that the combined inhibition of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters synergistically enhances antiobesity activity. (1R,5S)-(+)-1-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo-[3.1.0] hexane hydrochloride (DOV 21947) inhibits norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and dopamine uptake, and it reduces body weight in rodent models of diet-induced obesity (DIO). DIO rats treated orally with DOV 21947 for 1 to 24 days showed significantly lower body weights than vehicle-treated DIO rats. The decrease in body weight resulted specifically from a loss of retroperitoneal and mesenteric depots of white adipose tissue. DOV 21947 also reduced daily food intake in DIO rats, but consumption returned to control levels after 11 days of treatment. With the exception of a decrease in triglyceride levels, blood chemistry was unaltered after 24 days of DOV 21947 treatments. DOV 21947 had no effect on motor activity. Although DOV 21947 increased respiratory rate and decreased the tidal volume of normal rats, it did not alter the minute volume. In addition, DOV 21947 did not significantly affect blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiographic indices or body temperature in telemeterized dogs. However, it caused a sustained, but reversible reduction in the rate of body weight gain for as long as 6 months in normal rats, and for up to 1 year in normal dogs.

The benefit of bexagliflozin was evaluated by the change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between the bexagliflozin and the comparator (either placebo or another diabetes medicine) at the end of the treatment period. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Bexagliflozin was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2023. == Research == A 96-week phase II clinical study of adults with type 2 diabetes showed that bexagliflozin monotherapy provided a durable, clinically meaningful improvement of glycemic control, with a substantial reduction in weight and blood pressure, but no increase in the rate of significant adverse events. In a clinical study of patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 3a/3b chronic kidney disease, bexagliflozin was well tolerated and shown to reduce hemoglobin A1c levels, body weight, systolic blood pressure and albuminuria. == Veterinary uses == The data from two six-month field studies and an extended use field study demonstrated that bexagliflozin was over 80% effective in improving glycemic control in cats with diabetes mellitus. Bexagliflozin, sold under the brand name Bexacat, is an antidiabetic medication used to improve glycemic control in cats with diabetes. Bexacat is the first sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor new animal drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in any animal species. It was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2022. Bexacat is sponsored by Increvet Inc., based in Boston, Massachusetts.

It is a imidazolopiperazine derivative. It has shown activity against the Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax forms of the malaria parasite. == Clinical development == The antimalarial activity of the imidazolopiperazine compound class was initially discovered through a series of sensitive phenotypic antimalarial screens that were developed and run in 2007 and 2008 by a group of biologists working at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and the Scripps Research Institute. The lead product was published in 2012 as a leader of the imidazolopiperazine class. This was followed by studies in animal models published in 2014. Preclinical studies found no significant in vitro safety liabilities. A Phase 1 study found some gastrointestinal and neurological effects but these were self-limited in 70 healthy males and established dosing for a future Phase 2 Trial. The just completed Phase 2 Trial was completed with 4 study locations in Thailand and one study location in Vietnam. This study looked at the effect of 400 mg given daily for 3 days as well as a single 800 mg dose. In the 21 Patients who received a single 800 mg dose 67% of patients cleared the infection which is comparable to other antimalarial medications. More than half of the patients had some reported adverse event and the rate was higher in patients who received a single 800 mg dose over patients who received 3 400 mg doses. The most common effect was asymptomatic bradycardia where patients heart rates fell below 60 Beats Per Minute. Other reported events include hypokalemia, elevated liver enzymes as well as anemia. == Pharmacology == The mechanism of this drug is currently unknown. Resistance is conferred by mutations in PfCARL, a protein with 7 transmembrane domains, as well as by mutations in the P. falciparum acetyl-CoA transporter and the UDP-galactose transporter. None of these are thought to be the target of ganaplacide. Initial functional studies were performed with the closely related chemotype, GNF179 that differs from the clinical candidate by a single halogen. == Society and culture == === Economics === Novartis is an international drug company based in Switzerland and is developing ganaplacide as a drug for the treatment of malaria. This drug was identified by a high throughput screen of over 2 million compounds. This drug is being developed with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation via their Medicine for Malaria Venture. It will also be a part of the Novartis Malaria Initiative which has been providing 750 million treatments without producing any profit for the larger company. === Intellectual property === Ganaplacide is protected by the granted United States Patent 20130281403 held by the inventors, Arnab Chatterjee, Advait Nagle, Tao Wu, David Tully, and Kelli Kuhen, and filed June 7, 2013. There are previous US patent applications but only this one has been granted. == References ==",Ganaplacide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.8265450712060556e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000714523543138057)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([novartis.com](https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-and-medicines-malaria-venture-announce-decision-move-phase-3-study-novel-ganaplacidelumefantrine-sdf-combination-adults-and-children-malaria?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=239, start_index=9, title='Novartis and Medicines for Malaria Venture announce decision to move to Phase 3 study for novel ganaplacide/lumefantrine-SDF combination in adults and children with malaria | Novartis', type='url_citation', url='https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-and-medicines-malaria-venture-announce-decision-move-phase-3-study-novel-ganaplacidelumefantrine-sdf-combination-adults-and-children-malaria?utm_source=openai')])"

154,"('Miconazole (nitrate)', 'Miconazole', 'Monistat', 'Monistat iv', 'Daktarin iv')",Medical,"Miconazole, sold under the brand name Monistat among others, is an antifungal medication used to treat ring worm, pityriasis versicolor, and yeast infections of the skin or vagina. It is used for ring worm of the body, groin (jock itch), and feet (athlete's foot). It is applied to the skin or vagina as a cream or ointment. Common side effects include itchiness or irritation of the area in which it was applied. Use in pregnancy is believed to be safe for the baby. Miconazole is in the imidazole family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make ergosterol, an important part of their cell membrane. Miconazole was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Miconazole is used externally for the treatment of ringworm, jock itch, and athlete's foot. Internal application is used for oral candidiasis or vaginal thrush (yeast infection). == Side effects == Miconazole is generally well tolerated. The oral gel can cause dry mouth, nausea and an unpleasant taste in about 1–10% of people. Anaphylactic reactions are rare. The drug prolongs the QT interval. == Interactions == Miconazole is partly absorbed in the intestinal tract when used orally, as with the oral gel, and possibly when used vaginally. This can lead to increased concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, because miconazole inhibits these enzymes. Such interactions occur for example with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, phenytoin, some newer atypical antipsychotics, ciclosporin, and most statins used to treat hypercholesterolemia. These interactions are not relevant for miconazole that is applied to the skin. == Contraindications == Miconazole is contraindicated for people who use certain drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, for the reasons mentioned above: drugs that also prolong the QT interval because of potential problems with the heart rhythm ergot alkaloids statins triazolam and oral midazolam sulfonamides with a potential to cause hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Miconazole inhibits the fungal enzyme 14α-sterol demethylase, resulting in a reduced production of ergosterol. In addition to its antifungal actions, miconazole, similarly to ketoconazole, is known to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. === Pharmacokinetics === After application to the skin, miconazole can be measured in the skin for up to four days, but less than 1% is absorbed into the bloodstream. When applied to the oral mucosa (and possibly also for vaginal use), it is significantly absorbed. In the bloodstream, 88.2% are bound to plasma proteins and 10.6% to blood cells. The substance is partly metabolized via the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and mainly eliminated via the faeces. == Chemistry == The solubilities of miconazole nitrate powder are 0.03% in water, 0.76% in ethanol and up to 4% in acetic acid. Miconazole crystallises as colourless prisms in the monoclinic space group P21/c. == Other uses == Miconazole is also used in Ektachrome film developing in the final rinse of the Kodak E-6 process and similar Fuji CR-56 process, replacing formaldehyde. Fuji Hunt also includes miconazole as a final rinse additive in their formulation of the C-41RA rapid access color negative developing process. == Brands and formulations == Oral treatment: (brand names Daktarin in UK, Fungimin Oral Gel in Bangladesh): In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Oravig (miconazole) buccal tablets for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, more commonly known as thrush, in adults and children age 16 and older.

It is applied to the skin as a cream, foam, gel, liquid, solution, ointment, or shampoo. Clobetasol propionate is a propionate ester of the corticosteroid clobetasol. Common side effects include skin irritation, dry skin, redness, pimples, and telangiectasia. Serious side effects may include adrenal suppression, allergic reactions, cellulitis, and Cushing's syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Clobetasol is believed to work by activating steroid receptors. Clobetasol propionate was patented in 1968 and came into medical use in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 156th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clobetasol propionate is used for the treatment of various skin disorders including eczema, herpes labialis, psoriasis, and lichen sclerosus. It is also used to treat several auto-immune diseases including alopecia areata, lichen planus (auto immune skin nodules), and mycosis fungoides (T-cell skin lymphoma). It is used as a first-line treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD of the skin. Clobetasol propionate is used cosmetically for skin whitening, although this use is controversial. The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved it for that purpose, and sales without a prescription are illegal in the US. Nonetheless, skin-whitening creams containing this ingredient can sometimes be found in beauty supply stores in New York City and on the internet. It is also sold internationally and does not require a prescription in some countries. Whitening creams with clobetasol propionate, such as Hyprogel, can make skin thin and easily bruised, with visible capillaries, and acne. It can also lead to hypertension, elevated blood sugar, suppression of the body's natural steroids, and stretch marks, which may be permanent.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors anti-HCC activities have been shown to promote Snail-induced metastasis. In the present study, it was shown that BAY 87-2243, a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1α inhibitor, could enhance the anti-HCC effects of HDAC inhibitors, including trichostatin A and vorinostat. In addition, BAY 87-2243 plus HDAC inhibitors exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity and induced significant cell death in Hep3B cells. Additionally, BAY 87-2243 combined with HDAC inhibitors-treated Hep3B cells formed fewer and smaller colonies as compared with either the control or single agent-treated cells. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase-3β might be involved in the enhanced cell death induced by BAY 87-2243 plus HDAC inhibitors. The present data also indicated that BAY 87-2243 combined with HDAC inhibitors could suppress the migration of Hep3B cells, and BAY 87-2243 could reverse the HDAC inhibitor-induced Snail activation in Hep3B cells. In conclusion, BAY 87-2243 combined with HDAC inhibitors might be an attractive chemotherapy strategy for HCC therapy. A number of erythropoiesis stimulants are entering the final stage of clinical trials due to recent scientific progress in hypoxia-regulated erythropoiesis. Considering how erythropoiesis-stimulating compounds enhance the capacity of the organism to transport oxygen, they pose a great risk of being misused as performance enhancers. In this paper, we report the metabolic fate of three popular hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase Inhibitors (HIF-PHI) compounds, namely, BAY 87-2243, MK-8617, and PT-2385 in equine liver microsomes using Q-Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometry. This study found 22 metabolites for BAY 87-2243 (19 phase I and three phase II), three metabolites for MK-8617 (all phase I), and five metabolites for PT-2385 (two phase I and three phase II). The major findings of the present study are as follows: (1) all three potential HIF-PHI drug candidates, namely, BAY 87-2243, MK-8617, and PT-2385 are susceptible to oxidation, producing their corresponding hydroxylated metabolites; (2) the ring dissociated metabolites were detected for BAY 87-2243 and PT-2385; (3) in the case of BAY 87-2243 and PT-2385, glucuronic acid conjugated metabolites were detected; and (4) none of the drugs produced sulfonic acid conjugated metabolites. Numerous studies have demonstrated that functional mitochondria are required for tumorigenesis, suggesting that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) might be a potential target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the effects of BAY 87-2243, a small molecule that inhibits the first OXPHOS enzyme (complex I), in melanoma in vitro and in vivo. BAY 87-2243 decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and induced partial depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lowering of total cellular ATP levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and reduced cell viability. The latter was rescued by the antioxidant vitamin E and high extracellular glucose levels (25 mM), indicating the involvement of ROS-induced cell death and a dependence on glycolysis for cell survival upon BAY 87-2243 treatment. BAY 87-2243 significantly reduced tumor growth in various BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenografts and patient-derived melanoma mouse models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that inhibition of mutated BRAF using the specific small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib increased the OXPHOS dependency of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. As a consequence, the combination of both inhibitors augmented the anti-tumor effect of BAY 87-2243 in a BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenograft model. Taken together, our results suggest that complex I inhibition has potential clinical applications as a single agent in melanoma and also might be efficacious in combination with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma.",Bay-87-2243,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003805064770858735), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.010533922351896763), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0789043977856636)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0626349151134491)])","('INFO; ([bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/p/small-molecules-peptides/bay-87-2243_6980?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26500770/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=202, start_index=6, title='BAY 87-2243 (6980) by Tocris, Part of Bio-Techne', type='url_citation', url='https://www.bio-techne.com/p/small-molecules-peptides/bay-87-2243_6980?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=202, start_index=6, title='Targeting mitochondrial complex I using BAY 87-2243 reduces melanoma tumor growth', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26500770/?utm_source=openai')])"

At the center of the controversy are data obtained after administration of SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK. Whereas several studies have reported that SB 203580 abolishes the cardioprotective effect of PC, others claim that this compound is actually cardioprotective against ischemia. Many of these latter observations have been made in isolated myocardial cells. Accordingly the present study was designed to test the effect of SB 203580 in a model of preconditioning in intact rabbit hearts in which infarct size was the end-point. Isolated hearts experienced 30 min of regional ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Infarct size was measured with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. In control hearts infarction was 30.2 +/- 3.3% of the risk zone. PC with 5 min of global ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion before the 30-min period of ischemia significantly reduced infarct size to 10.2 +/- 2.4% (P < 0.05 vs. control). SB 203580 (2 microM) added to the perfusate for 20 min starting 5 min before the index ischemia totally blocked the protection from PC (27.4 +/- 3.3% infarction). SB 203580 alone had no effect on infarct size (28.6 +/- 4.6% infarction). These results reveal that SB 203580 does not affect infarct size on its own, but selectively blocks preconditioning's anti-infarct effect in the intact rabbit heart. Small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases have contributed immensely to our understanding of biological signaling pathways and have been exploited therapeutically for the treatment of cancers and other disease states. The pyridinyl imidazole compounds SB 203580 and SB 202190 were identified as ATP competitive antagonists of the p38 stress-activated protein kinases and have been widely used to elucidate p38-dependent cellular processes. Here, we identify SB 203580 and SB 202190 as potent inhibitors of stress-induced CREB phosphorylation on Serine 111 (Ser-111) in intact cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the inhibitory activity of SB 203580 and SB 202190 on CREB phosphorylation was independent of p38, but instead correlated with inhibition of casein kinase 1 (CK1) in vitro. The inhibition of CK1-mediated CREB phosphorylation by concentrations of pyridinyl imidazoles commonly employed to suppress p38, suggests that in some cases conclusions of p38-dependence derived solely from the use of these inhibitors may be invalid. p38 MAPK is a Ser/Thr protein kinase activated by various inflammatory cytokines and a variety of stress stimuli. It is involved in many physiological processes, including the production of inflammatory cytokines. We have previously reported the design and synthesis of a series of pyridinylimidazole compounds that are selective inhibitors of p38 MAPK. These compounds, exemplified by SB 203580, are exceptionally effective in cell-based assays, including the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production. SB 203580 is widely used as a tool to dissect the role of p38 MAPK in various physiological processes. It has previously been established that SB 203580 acts primarily to block the catalytic activity of p38 MAPK. However, it has been suggested that in cells, the compounds could also inhibit p38 MAPK activation by virtue of their ability to bind to the inactive enzyme. We undertook careful studies to definitively demonstrate that treatment with SB 203580 had no effect on Thr(180) and Tyr(182) phosphorylation, and hence activation of p38 in vivo. SB 203580, however, potently inhibited the activity of p38 MAPK as demonstrated by the inhibition of the activation of MAPKAP K2, a specific physiological substrate of p38 MAPK. This was observed regardless of stimuli or cell type. Identical results were obtained when the p38 MAPK cascade was partially reconstituted in vitro. Thus, our data clearly indicate that SB 203580 specifically inhibits the activity of p38 MAPK but not its activation by upstream MAPKK.",Sb 203580,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.38698235154151917), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.2520297169685364), (' INDUSTR', -8.2994620242971e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.13454177975654602), ('ICAL', -6.556489552167477e-06), (',', -0.5759822130203247), ('ĠINDU', -0.06927584856748581), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00249301316216588)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.16150417923927307), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_203580?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='SB 203580', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_203580?utm_source=openai')])"

The most common side effects include alopecia (hair loss), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia (muscle pain), diarrhea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (a skin reaction in the palms and soles) and vomiting. Ripretinib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020, in Australia in July 2020, and in the European Union in November 2021. Ripretinib is the first new drug specifically approved in the United States as a fourth-line treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). == Medical uses == Ripretinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a type of tumor that originates in the gastrointestinal tract, who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitor therapies, including imatinib. GIST is type of stomach, bowel, or esophagus tumor. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects include alopecia (hair loss), fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, myalgia (muscle pain), diarrhea, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (a skin reaction in the palms and soles) and vomiting.

The approval of ripretinib was based on the results of an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (INVICTUS/NCT03353753) that enrolled 129 participants with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who had received prior treatment with imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. The trial compared participants who were randomized to receive ripretinib to participants who were randomized to receive placebo, to determine whether progression free survival (PFS) – the time from initial treatment in the clinical trial to growth of the cancer or death – was longer in the ripretinib group compared to the placebo group. During treatment in the trial, participants received ripretinib 150 mg or placebo once a day in 28-day cycles, repeated until tumor growth was found (disease progression), or the participant experienced intolerable side effects. After disease progression, participants who were randomized to placebo were given the option of switching to ripretinib. The trial was conducted at 29 sites in the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The major efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) based on assessment by blinded independent central review (BICR) using modified RECIST 1.1 in which lymph nodes and bone lesions were not target lesions and a progressively growing new tumor nodule within a pre-existing tumor mass must meet specific criteria to be considered unequivocal evidence of progression. Additional efficacy outcome measures included overall response rate (ORR) by BICR and overall survival (OS). The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for participants in the ripretinib arm compared with those in the placebo arm (HR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.25; p<0.0001). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for ripretinib priority review and fast track designations, as well as breakthrough therapy designation and orphan drug designation.

163,"('Nitenpyram', '(e)-nitenpyram', 'Niterndipoine', 'Bestguard', 'Capstar')",Medical,"Nitenpyram is a chemical frequently used as an insecticide in agriculture and veterinary medicine. The compound is an insect neurotoxin belonging to the class of neonicotinoids which works by blocking neural signaling of the central nervous system. It does so by binding irreversibly to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACHr) causing a stop of the flow of ions in the postsynaptic membrane of neurons leading to paralysis and death. Nitenpyram is highly selective towards the variation of the nACHr which insects possess, and has seen extensive use in targeted, insecticide applications. Known under the codename TI 304 during field testing starting in 1989, the compound's first documented commercial use was in 1995 under the name ""Bestguard"" as an agricultural insecticide. Later, nitenpyram was expanded for use as a flea treatment by the Novartis company under the trade name ""Capstar"", with a subsequent FDA approval for non-food producing animals in October 2000. The current producer of nitenpyram itself is the Sumitomo chemical company. Nitenpyram continues to be used commercially, though data from market surveys indicate a significant decrease in the global usage compared to other insecticides or neonicotinoids. Due to its use as an insecticide and treatment of non-food producing animals, it was not deemed necessary to research the human toxicology during its main use, and, as such, not much is known about the details of nitenpyram's effects on humans. Looking at rat experiments however, the lethal amount of nitenpyram is quite high (on the order of grams) in mammals in general, whereas invertebrates will die with only micro or nanograms of the substance. Neonicotinoids, in general, have a low degradation rate when used for agricultural purposes, which allows for long-lasting protection of the crops against plant-sucking insects and indirectly the plant diseases these insects might carry. == Structure == Nitenpyram ( (E)-N-(6-Chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)- N-ethyl-N'-methyl-2-nitrovinylidenediamine) is an open-chain chloropyridyl neonicotinoid. Nitenpyram consists of a chloronicotinyl heterocyclic group common to all first generation neonicotinoids and a pharmacophore, the reactive group of the molecule. Nitenpyram possesses a nitroamine pharmacophore which is known to be the main reaction site in the binding of the compound to the nACh receptor, though the specificity of the reaction is not yet fully understood for neonicotinoids in general. Due to its polar groups, nitenpyram is quite hydrophilic, with an extremely high water solubility. == Mechanism of action == Though neonicotinoids are the largest group of insecticides used in today's agricultural world and prevalent in veterinary treatments, toxicity in general, e.g., genotoxicity and biotransformation, remains among the most controversial matters on the topic of neonicotinoids. This is primarily due to the lack of concrete systematic work. However, studies have been done on binding phenomena between neonicotinoids and proteins, serving as an indicator to its likely behavior in human physiological conditions. Nitenpyram, a synthetic, nicotine-related chemical (neonicotinoid), has an effect on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and, for this reason, is considered similar to nicotine (agonists). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are involved in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, present on the muscle cells where the cells from the nervous systems and the muscle cells form synapses. Variations in nicotinic-acetylcholine-receptor-binding affinity persists between species. Although nitenpyram is an agonist of nicotine for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, it has a much lower affinity for the nicotine acetylcholine receptor in mammals. For most insects nitenpyram is a very lethal compound. Nitenpyram will bind irreversibly to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, paralysing those exposed to the compound. Despite lower affinity levels, mammals can still get a nicotine poisoning response from too much neonicotinoids, hence it is of importance to provide the appropriate dose for a flea-infested pet and it's always best to consult a vet. Nitenpyram itself and its metabolites, apart from 6-chloronicotinic acid, have not been through in-depth toxicological investigations. Similarly genotoxicity effects remain ambiguous. 6-chloronicotinic acid, according to a research group, is non-carcinogenic and is not considered a developmental toxicant. == Metabolism == The literature on the biotransformation of nitenpyram has been scarce. However, some studies have been conducted. Toxicokinetic studies have shown that human intestinal caco-2 cell line can absorb imidacloprid at a very high rate of efficiency. The compound completely absorbs (>92%) from the gastrointestinal tract, rapidly distributes from the intravascular space to the peripheral tissues and organs, like the kidney, liver and lungs, proceeding biotransformation. Vets and pet owners have reported the effect of nitenpyram on flea-infested pets starting within 30 minutes after administering the neonicotinoid. Nitenpyram has been reported to metabolize into 6-chloronicotinic acid. Nitenpyram in mice metabolizes into nitenpyram-COOH, nitenpyram-deschloropyridine, desmethyl-nitenpyram, nitenpyram-CN, and nitenpyram-deschloropyridine derivatives. The nitenpyram metabolites have not been through in-depth study. However, these metabolites can undergo oxidation reactions like the cyano group into a carboxylic group. 6-chloronicotinic acid can make hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen atom of amino groups. Cytochrome P450 enzymes in humans could generate some metabolites with greater toxicity than the parent compound, certified to cause tumors in combination with nitrates and induce genetic damage. A precautionary approach to anything understudied would be advised, until the biotransformation is better and its effects are better studied and understood. == Synthesis == Nitenpyram is synthesized in a multistage reaction. The precursor compound of this reaction is 2-chloro-5-chloromethylpyridine, which is also used in the preparation of other neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid. The reaction of this compound undergoes three reaction steps. First step, 2-chloro-5-chloromethylpyridine reacts with ethylamine on its phase boundary acquiring the molecule N-ethyl-2-chloro-5-pyridylmethyl amine. Synthesis can then proceed with a condensation reaction (step 2), adding the solvents dichloromethane and trichloronitromethane will yield the intermediate N-ethyl-2-chloro-5-pyridylmethyl amine with an additional nitroethylene group. In the last step methylamine is added and reacts with the intermediate, replacing the pharmacophore chloride group, obtaining nitenpyram as the final end product. == Derivatives == Being a first generation neonicotinoid, nitenpyram has been subject to a variety of modifications to its original structure, to either increase the effectiveness or specificity of the compound. One such variation is on the configuration of the reactive group/pharmacophore, from cis (E) to trans (Z) configuration. It has been shown that this type of modification can substantially increase the affinity of nitenpyram to bind to the insect nACh receptor, allowing for more directed and ecologically friendly pest control. Changes to these compounds could also help circumvent the growing resistance in nitenpyram. == Toxicology == === Invertebrates === In a 2015 study, neonicotinoids toxicity was tested on the egg parasitoid trichogramma. Nitenpyram specifically was found to have the lowest toxicity, making it useful in IPM (integrated pest management) treatment. In 2015, researchers conducted a study on the toxicity of nitenpyram on the earthworm E.fetida. E.fetida is a common earthworm, which is partly responsible for the natural aeration of soil, including agricultural soil. In a 14-day exposure period, the Toxicity in LC50 of nitenpyram on e.fetida was found to be 4.34 mg/kg soil, showing an inhibition of cellulase activity and damage to the epidermal cells and gut cells. This, however, was significantly less toxic than similar insecticides such as imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin, making nitenpyram a viable substitute for many other neonicotinoids used. Ecologic effects of nitenpyram on bee populations is under controversy, as contradicting studies show the presence of nitenpyram in honey bees and their honey, while others do not detect nitenpyram at all. This, however, may be due to the decrease in usage of nitenpyram, as the global market share has been steadily decreasing. Nitenpyram is also commonly used in the elimination of and protection from mosquitoes. Specifically, the toxicity of nitenpyram on Culex quinquefasciatus or the southern house mosquito was tested. The LC50 of the compound was found to be 0.493 ug/ml. === Vertebrates === ==== Aquatic animals ==== In a study a 60-day chronic toxicity test was conducted on Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) as a general fish model. Of the neonicotinoids tested (imidacloprid, nitenpyram, and dinotefuran), nitenpyram was shown to not have much genotoxic effects or adversely affect the immune system, either through short or chronic exposure in comparison to the other compounds. In a similar study, nitenpyram was shown to have adverse effects on the DNA of Zebrafish. Enzymes inhibiting the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were severely affected, causing oxidative DNA damage increasing with chronic exposure. ==== Mammals ==== The Oxford University chemical safety data documents an LD50 toxicology test on rats, both male and female, where doses are recorded as 1680 mg and 1575 mg per kg body weight respectively. As such, the overdose limits for humans and animals are quite high, reaching into grams, and the compound is seen as safe for daily use for animals. Human consumption is not recommended, though no side effects of indirect exposure (such as eating treated plants) are known to occur. == Degradation == In the hope to understand neonicotinoid degradation in various types of water, an interesting find was made. In testing ground water, surface water and finished drinking water, researchers found degradation of nitenpyram was occurring primarily in the drinking water, which was attributed to hydrolysis of the compound. Some of these degradation products are thought to have toxic properties in non-target organisms, though the actual toxicities are not known. Nitenpyram is also degraded under the effect of UV light, suggesting that exposure to the sun will also degrade the compound into various degradation products. == Veterinary applications == Nitenpyram tablets, brand name Capstar, are used to treat flea infestations in cats and dogs. After oral administration of the tablet the drug is readily and quickly absorbed into the blood. If a flea bites the animal it will ingest with the blood the nitenpyram. The effect of nitenpyram can be observed half an hour after the administration. At this time a high concentration in the plasma can be detected and the first fleas dislodge from the pet host. A study showed that six hours after application the infestation of fleas on decreased by 96.7% for dogs and 95.2% for cats. The adult fleas present on the hosts are severely interrupted, hence, egg production is reduced. Eggs are not directly affected by nitenpyram, only after they come out. Administering nitenpyram might have to be repeated or continued until the pest infestation has subsided. The half life of nitenpyram is around eight hours. Thus, 24 hours after treatment roughly 100% of the adult fleas were killed. Between 24 hours and 48 hours the efficacy is highly decreased and after 72 hours no effect could be shown anymore in studies. === Side effects === One observed side effect is itchiness, suspected to be from the fleas dislodging. In the five hours after the treatment it was observed that cats were grooming themselves more, i.e. scratching, biting, licking, and twitching. This will stop when the fleas have either flagged or have died. Other reported side effects are hyperactivity, panting, lethargy, vomiting, fever, decreased appetite, nervousness, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, salivation, incoordination, seizures, pupil dilation, increased heart rate, trembling and nervousness. In other studies no adverse effects were observed. == Agricultural applications == Being one of the first generation neonicotinoids, nitenpyram has seen extensible commercial use since its introduction, including pest control in agriculture. While the development of newer generation nicotinoids has caused a decrease in its use, a Worldwide Integrated Assessment (WIA) report still judged it as an ecologically viable treatment in pest control projects such as Integrated Pest management (IPM). This is due to its lower toxicity and high uptake in plants in relation to soil as opposed to other commercially used neonicotinoids. Nitenpyram has been used on many commercial crops, such as cotton and corn, and can be applicated in various ways. Commonly used techniques are dusting and seed treatment. Seed treatment allows for a long lasting immunity to insects damaging the crops. The use of nitenpyram has been shown to be highly effective in protecting crops, as it is generally less toxic for non-target organisms, while killing off crop-destroying insects. While usage is still common, unlike other neonicotinoids, the global market share for nitenpyram seems to decrease based on product sale data from 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009. The reason for this is not yet fully understood, as other first generation neonicotinoids do not seem to follow the same trend, and nitenpyram is known to be less toxic to non-target organisms as compared to the compounds of the same generation. However, the decrease of use could possibly be explained through the formation of resistance in various insect species. In a study conducted on nine commonly used nicotinoids, nitenpyram was found to have the greatest increase in resistance of the group within brown planthoppers, a common agricultural pest, between 2011 and 2012. A substantial increase of resistance was also found in Aphis gossypii or the cotton aphid, as compared to other compounds such as imidacloprid. === Side effects === Due to its use on pollen carrying plants, nitenpyram has been linked to a decrease in population of pollinators such as honey bees, wild bees and butterflies. Other non-target organisms, such as earthworms, are also reported to be negatively affected by nitenpyram. Plants themselves do not seem to have a negative response, as they do not possess nicotine nACh receptors. == References == == External links == Nitenpyram in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Capstar,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.49115532636642456), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.47416338324546814), (' PERSONAL', -0.47497299313545227), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.33043172955513), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.011063541285693645), ('ĠINDU', -0.0033201829064637423), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00862846802920103)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.drugs.com/vet/capstar.html,https://www.petmd.com/pet-medication/capstar,https://www.drugs.com/pro/capstar.html ', [])"

More than 50% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients display a hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. We investigated the anti-proliferative effect of omipalisib in AML cell lines with varied genetic backgrounds. The OCI-AML3 and THP-1 cell lines had a significant response to omipalisib, with IC Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway occurs frequently in a wide range of human cancers and is a main driver of cell growth, proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance of cancer cells. Compounds targeting this pathway are under active development as anticancer therapeutics and some of them have reached advanced clinical trials or been approved by the FDA. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors combine multiple therapeutic efficacies in a single molecule by inhibiting the pathway both upstream and downstream of AKT. Herein, we report our efforts on the exploration of novel small molecule macrocycles (MCXs) as dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Macrocyclization is an attractive approach used in drug discovery, as the semi-rigid character of these structures could provide improved potency, selectivity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Importantly, this strategy allows access to new chemical space thus obtaining a better intellectual property position. A series of MCXs based on GSK-2126458, a known clinical PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is described. These molecules showed potent biochemical and cellular dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition, demonstrated strong antitumoral effects in human cancer cell lines, and displayed good drug-like properties. Among them, MCX 83 presented remarkable selectivity against a panel of 468 kinases, high in vitro metabolic stability, and favorable pharmacokinetic parameters without significant CYP450 and h-ERG binding inhibition. This profile qualified this compound as a suitable candidate for future in vivo PK-PD and efficacy studies in mouse cancer models. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Omipalisib (GSK2126458) is a potent inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR.A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeat dose escalation, experimental medicine study of omipalisib in subjects with IPF was conducted (NCT01725139) to test safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Omipalisib was dosed at 0.25 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg twice daily for 8 days in four cohorts of four subjects randomised 3:1 to receive omipalisib or placebo (two cohorts received 2 mg twice daily).17 subjects with IPF were enrolled. The most common adverse event was diarrhoea, which was reported by four participants. Dose-related increases in insulin and glucose were observed. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that exposure in the blood predicts lung exposure. Exposure-dependent inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate and pAKT confirmed target engagement in blood and lungs.

166,"('Indomethacin', 'Indometacin', 'Indocin', 'Indomethacine', 'Indometacine')",Medical,"Indometacin, also known as indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins. It was patented in 1961 and approved for medical use in 1963. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 256th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == As an NSAID, indometacin is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Clinical indications for indometacin include: Joint diseases rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis osteoarthritis gouty arthritis acute painful shoulder bursitis or tendinitis Headaches Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias Paroxysmal hemicranias Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania Episodic paroxysmal hemicrania Hemicrania continua Valsalva-induced headaches Primary cough headache Primary exertional headache Primary headache associated with sexual activity (preorgasmic and orgasmic) Primary stabbing headache (jabs and jolts syndrome) Hypnic headache Others Patent ductus arteriosus == Contraindications == Concurrent peptic ulcer, or history of ulcer disease Allergy to indometacin, aspirin, or other NSAIDs Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and gastric sleeve patients Patients with nasal polyps reacting with an angioedema to other NSAIDs Children under 2 years of age (with the exception of neonates with patent ductus arteriosus) Severe pre-existing renal and liver damage Caution: pre-existing bone marrow damage (frequent blood cell counts are indicated) Caution: bleeding tendencies of unknown origin (indometacin inhibits platelet aggregation) Caution: Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, psychotic disorders (indometacin may worsen these conditions) Concurrent with potassium sparing diuretics Patients who have a patent ductus arteriosus dependent heart defect (such as transposition of the great vessels) Significant hypertension (high blood pressure) Concomitant administration of lithium salts (such as lithium carbonate) == Adverse effects == In general, the adverse effects of indometacin are similar to those of all other NSAIDs. For instance, indometacin inhibits both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which then inhibits the production of prostaglandins in the stomach and intestines responsible for maintaining the mucous lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Indometacin, therefore, like other non-selective COX inhibitors, can cause peptic ulcers. These ulcers can result in serious bleeding or perforation, requiring hospitalization of the patient. To reduce the possibility of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50 and 200 mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150 mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin. Many NSAIDs, but particularly indometacin, cause lithium retention by reducing its excretion by the kidneys. Thus indometacin users have an elevated risk of lithium toxicity. For patients taking lithium (e.g. for treatment of depression or bipolar disorder), less toxic NSAIDs such as sulindac or aspirin are preferred. All NSAIDs, including indometacin, also increase plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, and increase sodium and potassium retention. Vasopressin activity is also enhanced. Together these may lead to: Edema (swelling due to fluid retention) Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) Hypernatremia (high sodium levels) Hypertension Elevations of serum creatinine and more serious renal damage such as acute kidney failure, chronic nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and high potassium levels in the blood. Paradoxically yet uncommonly, indometacin can cause headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including angioedema, sweating, severe hypotension and tachycardia as well as acute bronchospasm), severe or lethal hepatitis and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and photosensitivity are also possible side effects. The frequency and severity of side effects and the availability of better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute gout attacks and in dysmenorrhea is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur. People should undergo regular physical examination to detect edema and signs of central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes as well as of creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if Indometacin is given together with an ACE inhibitor or with potassium-sparing diuretics, because these combinations can lead to hyperkalemia and/or serious kidney failure. No examinations are necessary if only the topical preparations (spray or gel) are applied. Rare cases have shown that use of this medication by pregnant women can have an effect on the fetal heart, possibly resulting in fetal death via premature closing of the Ductus arteriosus. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Mechanism of action == Indometacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has similar mode of action when compared to other drugs in this group. It is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, the enzymes that participate in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins are hormone-like molecules normally found in the body, where they have a wide variety of effects, some of which lead to pain, fever, and inflammation. By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin can reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. Mechanism of action of indomethacin, along with several other NSAIDs that inhibit COX, was described in 1971. Additionally, indometacin has recently been found to be a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. By enhancing the binding and signalling of endogenous cannabinoids such as anandamide, PAMs may elicit increased cannabinergic signalling in a tissue specific manner, reducing the incidence of problematic side effects such as psychoactivity while maintaining some antinociceptive activity. Indometacin has a logarithmic pKa of 3 to 4.5. Since the physiologic body pH is well above the pKa range of indometacin, most of the indometacin molecules will be dissociated into ionized form, leaving very little un-ionized form of indometacin to cross a cell membrane. If the pH gradient across a cell membrane is high, most of the indometacin molecules will be trapped in one side of the membrane with higher pH. This phenomenon is called ""ion trapping"". The phenomenon of ion trapping is particularly prominent in the stomach as pH at the stomach mucosa layer is extremely acidic, while the parietal cells are more alkaline. Therefore, indometacin are trapped inside the parietal cells in ionized form, damaging the stomach cells, causing stomach irritation. This stomach irritation can reduce if the stomach acidity is reduced, as the GI side effects from NSAIDs are generally reduced by decreasing stomach acidity. Indometacin's role in treating certain headaches is unique compared to other NSAIDs. In addition to the class effect of COX inhibition, there is evidence that indometacin has the ability to reduce cerebral blood flow not only through modulation of nitric oxide pathways but also via intracranial precapillary vasoconstriction. The indometacin property of reducing cerebral blood flow is useful in treating raised intracranial pressure. A case report has shown that an intravenous bolus dose of indometacin given with 2 hours of continuous infusion is able to reduce intracranial pressure by 37% in 10 to 15 minutes and increases cerebral perfusion pressure by 30% at the same time. This reduction in cerebral pressure may be responsible for the remarkable efficacy in a group of headaches that is referred to as ""indometacin-responsive headaches"", such as idiopathic stabbing headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicranial, and exertional headaches. On the other hand, the activation of superior salivary nucleus in the brainstem is used to stimulate the trigeminal autonomic reflex arc, causing a type of headache called trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Indometacin inhibits the superior salivatory nucleus, thus relieving this type of headache. Prostaglandins also cause uterine contractions in pregnant women. Indometacin is an effective tocolytic agent, able to delay premature labor by reducing uterine contractions through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the uterus and possibly through calcium channel blockade. Indometacin readily crosses the placenta and can reduce fetal urine production to treat polyhydramnios. It does so by reducing renal blood flow and increasing renal vascular resistance, possibly by enhancing the effects of vasopressin on the fetal kidneys. Other modes of action for indometacin are: it inhibits motility of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, similar to colchicine it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, like salicylates it has been found to specifically inhibit MRP (multidrug resistance proteins) in murine and human cells == Nomenclature == Indometacin is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of the drug while indomethacin is the USANTooltip United States Approved Name, and former AANTooltip Australian Approved Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name. == References ==",Indocin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.748303323751315e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018173374235630035)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19440-indomethacin-capsules,https://www.drugs.com/mtm/indomethacin.html,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/indomethacin-oral-route/description/drg-20069700 ', [])"

Betamethasone was patented in 1958, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. The cream and ointment are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 263rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is available as a pill, by injection, and as an ointment, cream, lotion, gel, or aerosol (spray) for the skin, and a foam for the scalp. When given by injection, anti-inflammatory effects begin in around two hours and last for seven days. It is used as a topical cream to relieve skin irritation, such as itching and flaking from eczema. It is used as a treatment for local psoriasis, as betamethasone dipropionate and salicylic acid, or as the combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate. Betamethasone sodium phosphate is used orally and via injection with the same indications as other steroids. Many betamethasone-based pharmaceuticals include the steroid as the valerate ester. In a randomized controlled trial betamethasone was shown to reduce some of the ataxia (poor coordination) symptoms associated with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) by 28-31%. Betamethasone is also used to stimulate fetal maturation of the lungs and cerebral blood vessels. A cream with 0.05% betamethasone appears effective in treating phimosis in boys, and often averts the need for circumcision. Longer-term research is needed on this treatment method. This approach has replaced circumcision as the preferred treatment method for some physicians in the British National Health Service. == Side effects == Euphoria Depression Adrenal suppression Hypertension Groupings of fine blood vessels becoming prominent under the skin, petechiae Excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) Ecchymoses Betamethasone crosses the placenta. When injected into the epidural space or the spine, it may cause serious side effects like loss of vision, stroke, and paralysis. == Pharmacology == == Forms == Betamethasone is available in a number of compound forms: betamethasone dipropionate (branded as Diprosone, Diprolene, Celestamine, Procort (in Pakistan), and others), betamethasone sodium phosphate (branded as Bentelan in Italy) and betamethasone valerate (branded as Audavate, Betnovate, Celestone, Fucibet, and others). In the United States and Canada, betamethasone is mixed with clotrimazole and sold as Lotrisone and Lotriderm. It is also available in combination with salicylic acid (branded as Diprosalic) for using in psoriatic skin conditions. In some countries, it is also sold mixed with both clotrimazole and gentamicin to add an antibacterial agent to the mix. Betamethasone sodium phosphate mixed with betamethasone acetate is available in the United States as Celestone Soluspan. == See also == Betamethasone/dexchlorpheniramine == References ==",Diprolene af,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004631400224752724), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0052668387070298195)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/diprolene-af.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Diprolene AF: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/diprolene-af.html?utm_source=openai')])"
169,"('Benfluorex (hydrochloride)', 'Benfluorex', 'Benfluramate', 'Mediator', 'Minolip')",Medical,"Mediation is a negotiation facilitated by a third-party neutral. It is a structured, interactive process where an independent third party, the mediator, assists disputing parties in resolving conflict through the use of specialized communication and negotiation techniques. All participants in mediation are encouraged to participate in the process actively. Mediation is a ""party-centered"" process in that it is focused primarily on the needs, rights, and interests of the parties. The mediator uses a wide variety of techniques to guide the process in a constructive direction and to help the parties find their optimal solution. A range of mediation styles are available. This ranges from facilitative (the standard usually taught in initial training) where the mediator facilitates the interaction between parties and encourages open communication. Mediation can be evaluative in that the mediator analyzes issues and relevant norms (""reality-testing""), while refraining from providing prescriptive advice to the parties (e.g., ""You should do...""). Mediators do not have the power to determine the outcome of a dispute the way that a judge or other judicial officer may do. Mediation is a form of dispute resolution that resolves disputes between two or more parties with concrete effects. Typically, a third party, the mediator, assists the parties to negotiate a resolution or settlement. Disputants may mediate disputes in a variety of domains, such as commercial, legal, diplomatic, workplace, community, and family matters. The term mediation broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps others reach an agreement. More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable, and dynamics that ""ordinary"" negotiation lacks. The process is private and confidential, possibly enforced by law. Participation is typically voluntary. The mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs what the outcome of the process must be. Mediation is becoming an internationally accepted way to end disputes. The Singapore Mediation Convention offers a relatively fast, inexpensive and predictable means of enforcing settlement agreements arising out of international commercial disputes. Mediation can be used to resolve disputes of any magnitude. Mediation is not identical in all countries. In particular, there are some differences between mediation in countries with Anglo-Saxon legal traditions and countries with civil law traditions. Mediators use various techniques to open, or improve, dialogue and empathy between disputants, aiming to help the parties reach an agreement. Much depends on the mediator's skill and training. As the practice has gained popularity, training programs, certifications and licensing have produced trained and professional mediators committed to their discipline. == History == The activity of mediation appeared in very ancient times. The practice developed in Ancient Greece which knew the non-marital mediator as a proxenetas(προ - pro = before + ξενος - xenos =strangers), then in Roman civilization. (Roman law, starting from Justinian's Digest of 530–533 CE) recognized mediation. The Romans called mediators by a variety of names, including internuncius, medium, intercessor, philantropus, interpolator, conciliator, interlocutor, interpres, and finally mediator. Following the war against Rome, the Kushites sent mediators to Augustus, who was in Samos, and in the year 21/20 BC, a peace treaty was concluded. Now mediation is a form of professional service, and mediators are professionally trained for mediation. == Benefits == The benefits of mediation include: Cost While a mediator may charge a fee comparable to that of an attorney, the mediation process generally takes much less time than moving a case through standard legal channels. While a case in the hands of a lawyer or a court may take months or years to resolve, mediation usually achieves a resolution in a matter of hours. Taking less time means expending less money on hourly fees and costs. Confidentiality While court hearings are public, mediation remains strictly confidential. No one but the parties to the dispute and the mediator or mediators know what happened. Confidentiality in mediation has such importance that in most cases the legal system cannot force a mediator to testify in court as to the content or progress of mediation. Many mediators destroy their notes taken during a mediation once that mediation has finished. The only exceptions to such strict confidentiality usually involve child abuse or actual or threatened criminal acts. Control Mediation increases the control the parties have over the resolution. In a court case, the parties obtain a resolution, but control resides with the judge or jury. Often, a judge or jury cannot legally provide solutions that emerge in mediation. Thus, mediation is more likely to produce a result that is mutually agreeable for the parties. Compliance Because the result is attained by the parties working together and is mutually agreeable, compliance with the mediated agreement is usually high. This further reduces costs, because the parties do not have to employ an attorney to force compliance with the agreement. The mediated agreement is, however, fully enforceable in a court of law. Mutuality Parties to a mediation are typically ready to work mutually toward a resolution. In most circumstances the mere fact that parties are willing to mediate means that they are ready to ""move"" their position. The parties thus are more amenable to understanding the other party's side and work on underlying issues to the dispute. This has the added benefit of often preserving the relationship the parties had before the dispute. Parties as a part of the mediation are encouraged to negotiate on the basis of interests rather than positions that they hold. The object of this is to have deeper conversations which can give rise to a wider ambit of solutions considering more than just the items up for discussion in the session. Some mediators are also of the opinion that it is their responsibility to bring the parties to think this way, commonly called interest-based negotiation. Support Mediators are trained in working with difficult situations. The mediator acts as a neutral facilitator and guides the parties through the process. The mediator helps the parties think ""outside of the box"" for possible solutions to the dispute, broadening the range of possible solutions. == Uses == In addition to dispute resolution, mediation can function as a means of dispute prevention, such as facilitating the process of contract negotiation. Governments can use mediation to inform and to seek input from stakeholders in formulation or fact-seeking aspects of policy-making. Mediation is applicable to disputes in many areas: Within business and commercial mediation, frequently a distinction is made between business-to-business (B2B), business-to-employee (B2E) and business-to-consumer (B2C) situations. === Industrial relations === ==== Australia ==== ADR, Alternative Dispute Resolution, began in industrial relations in Australia long before the arrival of the modern ADR movement. One of the first statutes passed by the Commonwealth parliament was the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 (Cth). This allowed the Federal Government to pass laws on conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one state. Conciliation has been the most prominently used form of ADR, and is generally far removed from modern mediation. Significant changes in state policy took place from 1996 to 2007. The 1996 Workplace Relations Act (Cth) sought to shift the industrial system away from a collectivist approach, where unions and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) had strong roles, to a more decentralized system of individual bargaining between employers and employees. The Act diminished the traditional role of the AIRC by placing the responsibility of resolving disputes at the enterprise level. This allowed mediation to be used to resolve industrial relations disputes instead of traditional conciliation. In industrial relations under the 2006 WorkChoices amendments to the Workplace Relations Act. Examples of this use of mediation can be seen in recent enterprise bargaining negotiations. The Australian government claimed the benefits of mediation to include the following: Cost saving Reduced polarization Education Broader issues vs the courts Greater access to justice More control by disputant over the process === Workplace matters === The implementation of human resource management (HRM) policies and practices has evolved to focus on the individual worker, and rejects all other third parties such as unions and AIRC. HRM together with the political and economic changes undertaken by Australia's Howard government created an environment where private ADR can be fostered in the workplace. The decline of unionism and the rise of the individual encouraged the growth of mediation. This is demonstrated in the industries with the lowest unionization rates such as in the private business sector having the greatest growth of mediation. The 2006 Work Choices Act made further legislative changes to deregulate industrial relations. A key element of the new changes was to weaken the AIRC by encouraging competition with private mediation. A great variety of disputes occur in the workplace, including disputes between staff members, allegations of harassment, contractual disputes and workers compensation claims. At large, workplace disputes are between people who have an ongoing working relationship within a closed system, which indicate that mediation or a workplace investigation would be appropriate as dispute resolution processes. However the complexity of relationships, involving hierarchy, job security and competitiveness can complicate mediation. Party-directed mediation (PDM) is an emerging mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep-seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The negotiated performance appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion. === Community mediation === Disputes involving neighbors often have no official resolution mechanism. Community mediation centers generally focus on neighborhood conflict, with trained local volunteers serving as mediators. Such organizations often serve populations that cannot afford to utilize the courts or professional ADR-providers. Community programs typically provide mediation for disputes between landlords and tenants, members of homeowners associations and small businesses and consumers. Many community programs offer their services for free or at a nominal fee. Experimental community mediation programs using volunteer mediators began in the early 1970s in several major U.S. cities. These proved to be so successful that hundreds of programs were founded throughout the country in the following two decades. In some jurisdictions, such as California, the parties have the option of making their agreement enforceable in court. In Australia mediation was incorporated extensively into family law Family Law Act 1975 and the 2006 Amendments Mandatory, subject to certain exceptions, Family Dispute Resolution Mediation is required before courts will consider disputed parenting arrangements. The Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners who provide this service are accredited by the Attorney-General's Department. Community accountability is a community-based strategy for a group of friends, a family, a neighborhood, etc. come together outside of the criminal justice system or any punitive system and hold people accountable as a community using transformative justice, which may or may not include mediation. === Peer mediation === A peer mediator is one who resembles the disputants, such as being of similar age, attending the same school or having similar status in a business. Purportedly, peers can better relate to the disputants than an outsider. Peer mediation promotes social cohesion and aids development of protective factors that create positive school climates. The National Healthy School Standard (Department for Education and Skills, 2004) highlighted the significance of this approach to reducing bullying and promoting pupil achievement. Schools adopting this process recruit and train interested students to prepare them. Peace Pals is an empirically validated peer mediation program. It was studied over a 5-year period and revealed several positive outcomes including a reduction in elementary school violence and enhanced social skills, while creating a more positive, peaceful school climate. Peer mediation helped reduce crime in schools, saved counselor and administrator time, enhanced self-esteem, improved attendance and encouraged development of leadership and problem-solving skills among students. Such conflict resolution programs increased in U.S. schools 40% between 1991 and 1999. Peace Pals was studied in a diverse, suburban elementary school. Peer mediation was available to all students (N = 825). Significant and long-term reductions in school-wide violence over a five-year period occurred. The reductions included both verbal and physical conflict. Mediator knowledge made significant gains pertaining to conflict, conflict resolution and mediation, which was maintained at 3-month follow-up. Additionally, mediators and participants viewed the Peace Pals program as effective and valuable, and all mediation sessions resulted in successful resolution. === Commercial disputes === The commercial domain remains one of the most common applications of mediation, as measured by the number of mediators and the total value of disputes. The result of business mediation is typically a bilateral contract. Commercial mediation includes work in finance, insurance, ship-brokering, procurement and real estate. In some areas, mediators have specialized designations and typically operate under special laws. Generally, mediators cannot themselves practice commerce in markets for goods in which they work as mediators. Procurement mediation comprises disputes between a public body and a private body. In common law jurisdictions only regulatory stipulations on creation of supply contracts that derive from the fields of State Aids (EU Law and domestic application) or general administrative guidelines extend ordinary laws of commerce. The general law of contract applies in the UK accordingly. Procurement mediation occurs in circumstances after creation of the contract where a dispute arises in regard to the performance or payments. A Procurement mediator in the UK may choose to specialise in this type of contract or a public body may appoint an individual to a specific mediation panel. === Native-title mediation === In response to the Mabo decision, the Australian Government sought to engage the population and industry on Mabo's implications for land tenure and use by enacting the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), which required mediation as a mechanism to determine future native title rights. The process incorporated the Federal Court and the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT). Mediation can occur in parallel with legal challenges, such as occurred in Perth. Some features of native title mediation that distinguish it from other forms include lengthy time frames, the number of parties (ranging on occasion into the hundreds) and that statutory and case law prescriptions constrain some aspects of the negotiations. === Global relevance === Mediation's effectiveness in trans-border disputes has been questioned, but an understanding of fundamental mediation principles points to the unlimited potential of mediation in such disputes. Mediators explicitly address and manage cultural and language differences in detail during the process. Voluntary referral to mediation is not required—much mediation to reach the table through binding contractual provisions, statutes, treaties, or international agreements and accords. The principle of voluntariness applies to the right of parties to self-determination once they are in the mediation—not to the mechanism for initiating the mediation process. Much mediation also results form mutual consent because they are non-binding and they encourage the exploration of interests and mutual benefits of an agreement. Because the parties, themselves, create the terms of agreement, compliance with mediated settlement agreements is relatively high. Any compliance or implementation issues can be addressed by follow-up mediation, regular compliance monitoring, and other processes. == Process == === Roles === Mediation is in contrast to the process common in a court of law where advocates engage in contentious litigation on behalf of their clients, arguing before a parental figure such as a judge or arbitrator. Both advocates and arbitrator effectively deprive the disputants of any responsibility for the outcome.by imposing a solution. During mediation the participants have to take personal responsibility for resolving their issues. The mediator takes no part other than to reduce the emotional temperature and facilitate full and frank exchange of views, ""reframing"" aggressive or insulting language into a rational, neutral statement of fact. ==== Mediator ==== The mediator's primary role is to act as a neutral third party who facilitates discussions between the parties. In addition, a mediator serves in an evaluative role when they analyze, assess the issues, and engage in reality-testing. A mediator is neutral and they are not the agent of any party. In their role, mediators do not offer prescriptive advice (e.g., ""You should settle this case,"" or, ""Your next offer should be X.""). Mediators also manage the interaction between the parties and encourage constructive communication through the use of specialized communication techniques. Finally, the mediator should restrict pressure, aggression and intimidation, demonstrate how to communicate through employing good speaking and listening skills, and paying attention to non-verbal messages and other signals emanating from the context of the mediation and possibly contributing expertise and experience. The mediator should direct the parties to focus on issues and stay away from personal attacks. ==== Parties ==== The role of the parties varies according to their motivations and skills, the role of legal advisers, the model of mediation, the style of mediator and the culture in which the mediation takes place. Legal requirements may also affect their roles. Party-directed mediation (PDM) is an emerging approach involving a pre-caucus between the mediator and each of the parties before going into the joint session. The idea is to help the parties improve their interpersonal negotiation skills so that in the joint session they can address each other with little mediator interference. ===== Authority ===== One of the general requirements for successful mediation is that those representing the respective parties have full authority to negotiate and settle the dispute. If this is not the case, then there is what Spencer and Brogan refer to as the ""empty chair"" phenomenon, that is, the person who ought to be discussing the problem is simply not present. ===== Preparation ===== The parties' first role is to consent to mediation, possibly before preparatory activities commence. Parties then prepare in much the same way they would for other varieties of negotiations. Parties may provide position statements, valuation reports and risk assessment analysis. The mediator may supervise/facilitate their preparation and may require certain preparations. ===== Disclosure ===== Agreements to mediate, mediation rules, and court-based referral orders may have disclosure requirements. Mediators may have express or implied powers to direct parties to produce documents, reports and other material. In court-referred mediations parties usually exchange with each other all material which would be available through discovery or disclosure rules were the matter to proceed to hearing, including witness statements, valuations and statement accounts. ===== Participation ===== Mediation requires direct input from the parties. Parties must attend and participate in the mediation meeting. Some mediation rules require parties to attend in person. Participation at one stage may compensate for absence at another stage. === Meeting === The typical mediation has no formal compulsory elements, although some elements usually occur: establishment of ground rules framing the boundaries of mediation parties detail their stories identification of issues identify options discuss and analyze solutions adjust and refine proposed solutions record agreement in writing Individual mediators vary these steps to match specific circumstances, given that the law does not ordinarily govern mediators' methods. === Post-mediation activities === ==== Ratification and review ==== Ratification and review provide safeguards for mediating parties. They also provide an opportunity for persons not privy to the mediation to undermine the result. Some mediated agreements require ratification by an external body—such as a board, council or cabinet. In some situations, the sanctions of a court or other external authority must explicitly endorse a mediation agreement. Thus if a grandparent or other non-parent is granted residence rights in a family dispute, a court counselor will be required to furnish a report to the court on the merits of the proposed agreement to aid the court's ultimate disposition of the case. In other situations, it may be agreed to have agreements reviewed by lawyers, accountants or other professional advisers. The implementation of mediated agreements must comply with the statues and regulations of the governing jurisdiction. Parties to a private mediation may also wish to obtain court sanction for their decisions. Under the Queensland regulatory scheme on court-connected mediation, mediators are required to file with a registrar a certificate about the mediation in a form prescribed in the regulations. A party may subsequently apply to a relevant court an order giving effect to the agreement reached. Where court sanction is not obtained, mediated settlements have the same status as any other agreements. ==== Referrals ==== Mediators may at their discretion refer one or more parties to psychologists, accountants, social workers or others for post-mediation professional assistance. ==== Mediator debriefing ==== In some situations, a post-mediation debriefing and feedback session is conducted between co-mediators or between mediators and supervisors. It involves a reflective analysis and evaluation of the process. In many community mediation services debriefing is compulsory and mediators are paid for the debriefing session. ==== Measuring effectiveness ==== In addition to the fact of reaching a settlement, party satisfaction and mediator competence can be measured. Surveys of mediation parties reveal strong levels of satisfaction with the process. Of course, if parties are generally satisfied post-settlement, then such measures may not be particularly explanatory. == Mediators == === Education and training === The educational requirements for accreditation as a mediator differ between accrediting groups and from country to country. In some cases legislation mandates requirements; in others professional bodies impose accreditation standards. Many US universities offer graduate studies in mediation. ==== Australia ==== In Australia, there are two educational standards. One for entry level mediators and another for professionals wanting to become Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners (Family Law Mediators). Australian Mediator and Dispute Resolution Accreditation Standards (AMDRAS) replaced the National Mediator Accreditation System (NMAS) in 2024. The standards establish requirements for training, assessment, accreditation and ongoing professional practice. Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners (FDRPs) FDRPs must undertake a specific qualification CHC81115 - Graduate Diploma of Family Dispute Resolution or if they meet other specific educational requirements such as a qualification in law, social work or psychology and the core units from the Graduate Diploma. An equivalent to the core units course is available from some higher education providers. The qualification is approximately 800 hours and requires a 50 hour work placement. Both levels of accreditation have requirements regarding ongoing professional development, professional indemnity insurance and good character. Not all kinds of mediation-work require academic qualifications, as some deal more with practical skills than with theoretical knowledge. Membership organizations can be recognised under AMDRAS to provide training courses. Internationally a similar approach to the training of mediators is taken by organizations such as the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, CEDR. Based in London, it has trained over 5000 CEDR mediators from different countries to date. No legislated national standards on the level of education apply to all practitioners' organizations. However, organizations such as the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council (NADRAC) advocate for a wide scope on such issues. Other systems apply in other jurisdictions such as Germany, which advocates a higher level of educational qualification for practitioners of mediation. === Codes of conduct === Common elements of codes of conduct include: informing participants as to the process of mediation adopting a neutral stance revealing any potential conflicts of interest maintaining confidentiality within the bounds of the law mindfulness of the psychological and physical wellbeing of all participants directing participants to appropriate sources for legal advice engaging in ongoing training practising only in those fields in which they have expertise. ==== Australia ==== In Australia mediation codes of conduct are articulated in the AMDRAS which includes practice expectations and a code of conduct superseding the NMAS in 2025. A number of professional associations for mediators and law societies also have developed Codes of Conduct or similar. Europe The CPR/Georgetown Ethics Commission, the Mediation Forum of the Union International des Avocats, and the European Commission have promulgated codes of conduct for mediators. ==== Canada ==== In Canada codes of conduct for mediators are set by professional organizations. In Ontario three distinct professional organizations maintain codes of conduct for mediators. The Family Dispute Resolution Institute of Ontario and the Ontario Association of Family Mediators set standards for their members who mediate family matters and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute of Ontario who sets standards for their members. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute of Ontario, a regional affiliate of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Institute of Canada, uses the code of conduct from the federal organization to regulate the conduct of its members. The Code's three objectives are to provide guiding principles for the conduct of mediators; to promote confidence in mediation as a process for resolving disputes; and to provide protection for members of the public who use mediators who are members of the institute. In British Columbia, Mediate BC Society sets and maintains Standards of Conduct for its Registered Roster Mediators (RRMs) and Associates and Standards of Conduct for Med-Arbitrators on its Med-Arb roster. Mediate BC Society is a non-profit society that ""serves and protects the public by promoting professionalism and quality in mediation and other collaborative dispute resolution processes."" ==== France ==== In France, professional mediators have created an organization to develop a rational approach to conflict resolution. This approach is based on a ""scientific"" definition of a person and a conflict. These definitions help to develop a structured mediation process. Mediators have adopted a code of ethics which guarantees professionalism. ==== Germany ==== In Germany, the process and responsibilities of a mediator are legally defined in the Mediation Act 2012 (Mediationsgesetz). The Act codifies the general process (facilitation by a neutral, 3rd-party mediator without evaluation or solution proposals) and specific terms (e.g. funktionaler Mediator). Mediators have certain information and disclosure obligations as well as limitations of practice. In particular, a person who has previously provided any form of counseling to any party in the conflict (legal, social, financial, etc.) may not act as a mediator in the case. The Act applies to practitioners even if they refer to their approach not as mediation, but facilitation (Prozessbegleitung), conciliation (Schlichtung), conflict counseling (Konflikt-Beratung) or anything else. === Accreditation === ==== Australia ==== A range of organisations within Australia accredit mediators under the standards set by AMDRAS. The National Mediator Accreditation System (NMAS) commenced operation on 1 January 2008. It is an industry-based scheme which relies on voluntary compliance by mediator organisations that agree to accredit mediators in accordance with the requisite standards. It was replaced in 2024 - 2025 by the AMDRAS. Mediator organisations have varying ideals of what makes a good mediator which reflect the training and accreditation of that particular organisation but to be recognised as AMDRAS training they must comply to certain norms. ==== Germany ==== According to sec. 6 German Mediation Act the German government on June 21, 2016 has released the German regulation about education and training of the so-called (legal term) ""certified mediators"" which from Sept. 1, 2017 postulates a minimum of 120 hours of initial specialized mediator training as well as case supervision and further ongoing training of 40 hours within 4 years. Beyond this basic qualification, the leading mediation associations (BAFM, BM, BMWA and DGM) have agreed on quality standards higher than the minimum standards of the national regulation to certify their mediators. To become an accredited mediator of these associations one has to complete an accredited mediation training program of a minimum of 200 hours incl. 30 hours of supervision as well as ongoing training (30–40 hours within three years)."" === Selection === Mediator selection is of practical significance given varying models of mediation, mediators' discretion in structuring the process and the impact of the mediator's professional background and personal style on the result. In community mediation programs the director generally assigns mediators. In New South Wales, for example, when the parties cannot agree on a mediator, the registrar contacts a nominating entity, such as the Bar Association which supplies the name of a qualified and experienced mediator. As of 2006, formal mechanisms for objecting to the appointment of a particular mediator had not been established. Parties could ask the mediator to withdraw for reasons of conflict of interest. In some cases, legislation establishes criteria for mediators. The Australian Attorney Generals Department maintains a register of registered Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners and Government Funded FDR Services located at www.fdrr.ag.gov.au ==== Criteria ==== The following are useful criteria for selecting a mediator: Personal attributes—patience, empathy, intelligence, optimism and flexibility Accreditation / Registration - In Australia - Registration as a FDRP for Family Law, Accreditation as a Mediator for other types of mediation Qualifications—knowledge of the theory and practice of conflict, negotiation and mediation, mediation skills. Experience— mediation experience, experience in the substantive area of dispute and personal life experience Training Professional background Certification and its value Suitability of the mediation model Disclosure of potential Conflicts of Interest Cost/fee ==== Third party nomination ==== Contracts that specify mediation may also specify a third party to suggest or impose an individual. Some third parties simply maintain a list of approved individuals, while others train mediators. Lists may be ""open"" (any person willing and suitably qualified can join) or a ""closed"" panel (invitation only). In the UK and internationally, lists are generally open, such as The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution. Alternatively, private panels co-exist and compete for appointments e.g., Savills Mediation. === Liability === Legal liability may stem from a mediation. For example, a mediator could be liable for misleading the parties or for even inadvertently breaching confidentiality. Despite such risks, follow-on court action is quite uncommon. Only one case reached that stage in Australia as of 2006. Damage awards are generally compensatory in nature. Proper training is mediators' best protection. Liability can arise for the mediator from Liability in Contract; Liability in Tort; and Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Obligations. Liability in Contract arises if a mediator breaches (written or verbal) contract with one or more parties. The two forms of breach are failure to perform and anticipatory breach. Limitations on liability include the requirement to show actual causation. Liability in Tort arises if a mediator influences a party in any way (compromising the integrity of the decision), defames a party, breaches confidentiality, or most commonly, is negligent. To be awarded damages, the party must show actual damage, and must show that the mediator's actions (and not the party's actions) were the actual cause of the damage. Liability for Breach of Fiduciary Obligations can occur if parties misconceive their relationship with a mediator as something other than neutrality. Since such liability relies on a misconception, court action is unlikely to succeed. ==== Tapoohi v Lewenberg (Australia) ==== As of 2008 Tapoohi v Lewenberg was the only case in Australia that set a precedent for mediators' liability. The case involved two sisters who settled an estate via mediation. Only one sister attended the mediation in person: the other participated via telephone with her lawyers present. An agreement was executed. At the time it was orally expressed that before the final settlement, taxation advice should be sought as such a large transfer of property would trigger capital gains taxes. Tapoohi paid Lewenberg $1.4 million in exchange for land. One year later, when Tapoohi realized that taxes were owed, she sued her sister, lawyers and the mediator based on the fact that the agreement was subject to further taxation advice. The original agreement was verbal, without any formal agreement. Tapoohi, a lawyer herself, alleged that the mediator breached his contractual duty, given the lack of any formal agreement; and further alleged tortious breaches of his duty of care. Although the court dismissed the summary judgment request, the case established that mediators owe a duty of care to parties and that parties can hold them liable for breaching that duty of care. Habersberger J held it ""not beyond argument"" that the mediator could be in breach of contractual and tortious duties. Such claims were required to be assessed at a trial court hearing. This case emphasized the need for formal mediation agreements, including clauses that limit mediators' liability. ==== United States ==== Within the United States, the laws governing mediation vary by state. Some states have clear expectations for certification, ethical standards and confidentiality. Some also exempt mediators from testifying in cases they've worked on. However, such laws only cover activity within the court system. Community and commercial mediators practising outside the court system may not have such legal protections. State laws regarding lawyers may differ widely from those that cover mediators. Professional mediators often consider the option of liability insurance. == Variants == === Evaluative mediation === Evaluative mediation is focused on providing the parties with an evaluation of their case and directing them toward settlement. During an evaluative mediation process, when the parties agree that the mediator should do so, the mediator will express a view on what might be a fair or reasonable settlement. The Evaluative mediator has somewhat of an advisory role in that he/she evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each side's argument and make some predictions about what would happen should they go to court. Facilitative and transformative mediators do not evaluate arguments or direct the parties to a particular settlement. In Germany, due to national regulation ""evaluative mediation"" is seen as an oxymoron and not allowed by the German mediation Act. Therefore, in Germany mediation is purly facilitative. In Australia, the industry accepted definition of mediation involves a mediator adopting a non advisory and non determinative approach. However, there is also provision under the National Mediator Accreditation Standards for mediators to offer a 'blended' approach provided that participants consent to such a process in writing, the mediator is appropriately insured and has the expertise required. === Facilitative mediation === Facilitative mediators typically do not evaluate a case or direct the parties to a particular settlement. Instead, the Facilitative mediator facilitates the conversation. These mediators act as guardian of the process, not the content or the outcome. During a facilitative mediation session the parties in dispute control both what will be discussed and how their issues will be resolved. Unlike the transformative mediator, the facilitative mediator is focused on helping the parties find a resolution to their dispute and to that end, the facilitative mediator provides a structure and agenda for the discussion. === Transformative mediation === Transformative mediation looks at conflict as a crisis in communication. Success is not measured by settlement but by the parties shifts toward (a) personal strength, (b) interpersonal responsiveness, (c) constructive interaction, (d) new understandings of themselves and their situation, (e) critically examining the possibilities, (f) feeling better about each other, and (g) making their own decisions. Those decisions can include settlement agreements or not. Transformative mediation practice is focused on supporting empowerment and recognition shifts, by allowing and encouraging deliberation, decision-making, and perspective-taking. A competent transformative mediator practices with a microfocus on communication, identifying opportunities for empowerment and recognition as those opportunities appear in the parties' own conversations, and responding in ways that provide an opening for parties to choose what, if anything, to do with them. === Narrative mediation === The narrative approach to mediation shares with narrative therapy an emphasis on constructing stories as a basic human activity in understanding our lives and conflict. This approach emphasizes the sociological/psychological nature of conflict-saturated narratives, and values human creativity in acting and reacting to these narratives. ""The narrative metaphor draws attention to the ways in which we use stories to make sense of our lives and our relationship."" Narrative mediation advocates changing the way we speak about conflicts. In objectifying the conflict narrative, participants become less attached to the problem and more creative in seeking solutions. ""The person is not the problem; the problem is the problem"" according to narrative mediation. === Mediation with arbitration === Mediation has sometimes been utilized to good effect when coupled with arbitration, particularly binding arbitration, in a process called 'mediation/arbitration'. The process begins as a standard mediation, but if mediation fails, the mediator becomes an arbiter. This process is more appropriate in civil matters where rules of evidence or jurisdiction are not in dispute. It resembles, in some respects, criminal plea-bargaining and Confucian judicial procedure, wherein the judge also plays the role of prosecutor—rendering what, in Western European court procedures, would be considered an arbitral (even 'arbitrary') decision. Mediation/arbitration hybrids can pose significant ethical and process problems for mediators. Many of the options and successes of mediation relate to the mediator's unique role as someone who wields no coercive power over the parties or the outcome. The parties awareness that the mediator might later act in the role of judge could distort the process. Using a different individual as the arbiter addresses this concern. === Online === Online mediation employs online technology to provide disputants access to mediators and each other despite geographic distance, disability or other barriers to direct meeting. Online approaches also facilitate mediation when the value of the dispute does not justify the cost of face-to-face contact. Online mediation can also combine with face-to-face mediation—to allow mediation to begin sooner and/or to conduct preliminary discussions. The global pandemic provided the opportunity for online mediation to expand and thrive with many mediators continue to offer their services fully or partially via online mediation. === Biased mediation === Neutral mediators enter into a conflict with the main intention in ending a conflict. This goal tends to hasten a mediator to reach a conclusion. Biased mediators enter into a conflict with specific biases in favor of one party or another. Biased mediators look to protect their parties interest thus leading to a better, more lasting resolution. == Alternatives == Mediation is one of several approaches to resolving disputes. It differs from adversarial resolution processes by virtue of its simplicity, informality, flexibility, and economy. Mediation provides the opportunity for parties to agree terms and resolve issues by themselves, without the need for legal representation or court hearings. Not all disputes lend themselves well to mediation. Success is unlikely unless: All parties are ready and willing to participate. All (or no) parties have legal representation. Mediation includes no right to legal counsel. All parties are of legal age (although see peer mediation) and are legally competent to make decisions. === Conciliation === Conciliation sometimes serves as an umbrella term that covers mediation and facilitative and advisory dispute-resolution processes. Neither process determines an outcome, and both share many similarities. For example, both processes involve a neutral third-party who has no enforcing powers. One significant difference between conciliation and mediation lies in the fact that conciliators possess expert knowledge of the domain in which they conciliate. The conciliator can make suggestions for settlement terms and can give advice on the subject-matter. Conciliators may also use their role to actively encourage the parties to come to a resolution. In certain types of dispute the conciliator has a duty to provide legal information. This helps ensure that agreements comply with relevant statutory frameworks. Therefore, conciliation may include an advisory aspect. Mediation is purely facilitative: the mediator has no advisory role. Instead, a mediator seeks to help parties to develop a shared understanding of the conflict and to work toward building a practical and lasting resolution. Both mediation and conciliation work to identify the disputed issues and to generate options that help disputants reach a mutually satisfactory resolution. They both offer relatively flexible processes. Any settlement reached generally must have the agreement of all parties. This contrasts with litigation, which normally settles the dispute in favour of the party with the strongest legal argument. In-between the two operates collaborative law, which uses a facilitative process where each party has counsel. === Counselling === A counsellor generally uses therapeutic techniques. Some—such as a particular line of questioning—may be useful in mediation. But the role of the counsellor differs from the role of the mediator. The list below is not exhaustive but it gives an indication of important distinctions: A mediator aims for clear agreement between the participants as to how they will deal with specific issues. A counsellor is more concerned with the parties gaining a better self-understanding of their individual behaviour. A mediator, while acknowledging a person's feelings, does not explore them in any depth. A counsellor is fundamentally concerned about how people feel about a range of relevant experiences. A mediator focuses upon participants' future goals rather than a detailed analysis of past events. A counsellor may find it necessary to explore the past in detail to expose the origins and patterns of beliefs and behaviour. A mediator controls the process but does not overtly try to influence the participants or the actual outcome. A counsellor often takes an intentional role in the process, seeking to influence the parties to move in a particular direction or consider specific issues. A mediator relies on all parties being present to negotiate, usually face-to-face. A counsellor does not necessarily see all parties at the same time. A mediator is required to be neutral. A counsellor may play a more supportive role, where appropriate. Mediation requires both parties to be willing to negotiate. Counselling may work with one party even if the other is not ready or willing to participate. Mediation is a structured process that typically completes in one or a few sessions. Counselling tends to be ongoing, depending upon participants' needs and progress. === Early neutral evaluation === The technique of early neutral evaluation (ENE) have focus on market ineterships, and—based on that focus—offers a basis for sensible case-management or a suggested resolution of the entire case in its very early stages. In early neutral evaluation, an evaluator acts as a neutral person to assess the strengths and weaknesses of each of the parties and to discuss the same with parties jointly or in caucuses, so that parties gain awareness (via independent evaluation) of the merits of their case. Parties generally call on a senior counsel or on a panel with expertise and experience in the subject-matter under dispute in order to conduct ENE. === Arbitration === Binding Arbitration is a more direct substitute for the formal process of a court. Binding Arbitration is typically conducted in front of one or three arbitrators. The process is much like a mini trial with rules of evidence, etc. Arbitration typically proceeds faster than court and typically at a lower cost. The Arbiter makes the ultimate decision rather than the parties. Arbiters' decisions are typically final and appeals are rarely successful even if the decision appears to one party to be completely unreasonable. === Litigation === In litigation, courts impose their thoughts to both parties Courts in some cases refer litigants to mediation. Mediation is typically less costly, less formal and less complex. Unlike courts, mediation does not ensure binding agreements and the mediator does not decide the outcome. === Shuttle diplomacy === While mediation implies bringing disputing parties face-to-face with each other, the strategy of ""shuttle diplomacy"", where the mediator serves as a liaison between disputing parties, also sometimes occurs as an alternative. == Philosophy == === Conflict prevention === Mediation can anticipate difficulties between parties before conflict emerges. Complaint handling and management is a conflict prevention mechanism designed to handle a complaint effectively at first contact, minimising the possibility of a dispute. One term for this role is ""dispute preventer"". === Confidentiality === One of the hallmarks of mediation is that the process is strictly confidential. Two competing principles affect confidentiality. One principle encourages confidentiality to encourage people to participate, while the second principle states that all related facts should be available to courts. The mediator must inform the parties of their responsibility for confidentiality. Steps put in place during mediation to help ensure this privacy include: All sessions take place behind closed doors. Outsiders can observe proceedings only with both parties' consent. The meeting is not recorded. Publicity is prohibited. Confidentiality is a powerful and attractive feature of mediation. It lowers the risk to participants of disclosing information and emotions and encourages realism by eliminating the benefits of posturing. In general, information discussed in mediation cannot be used as evidence in the event that the matter proceeds to court, in accord with the mediation agreement and common law. Few mediations succeed unless the parties can communicate fully and openly without fear of compromising a potential court case. The promise of confidentiality mitigates such concerns. Organisations often see confidentiality as a reason to use mediation in lieu of litigation, particularly in sensitive areas. This contrasts with the public nature of courts and other tribunals. However mediation need not be private and confidential. In some circumstances the parties agree to open the mediation in part or whole. Laws may limit confidentiality. For example, mediators must disclose allegations of physical or other abuse to authorities. The more parties in a mediation, the less likely that perfect confidentiality will be maintained. Some parties may even be required to give an account of the mediation to outside constituents or authorities. Most countries respect mediator confidentiality. ==== Without-prejudice privilege ==== The without-prejudice privilege in common law denotes that in honest attempts to reach settlement, any offers or admissions cannot be used in court when the subject matter is the same. This applies to the mediation process. The rule comes with exceptions. The without-prejudice privilege does not apply if it was excluded by either party or if the privilege was waived in proceedings. Although mediation is private and confidential, the disclosure of privileged information in the presence of a mediator does not represent a waiver of the privilege. === Legal implications === Parties who enter into mediation do not forfeit legal rights or remedies. If mediation does not result in settlement, each side can continue to enforce their rights through appropriate court or tribunal procedures. However, if mediation produces a settlement, legal rights and obligations are affected in differing degrees. In some situations, the parties may accept a memorandum or moral force agreement; these are often found in community mediations. In other instances, a more comprehensive deed of agreement, when registered with a court, is legally binding. It is advisable to have a lawyer draft or provide legal advice about the proposed terms. ""Court systems are eager to introduce mandatory mediation as a means to meet their needs to reduce case loads and adversarial litigation, and participants who understand the empowerment of mediation to self-determine their own agreements are equally as eager to embrace mediation as an alternative to costly and potentially harmful litigation."" == Principles == Principles of mediation include non-adversarialism, responsiveness, self-determination and party autonomy. Non-adversarialism is based on the actual process of mediation. It treats the parties as collaborating in the construction of an agreement. By contrast, litigation is explicitly adversarial in that each party attempts to subject the other to its views. Mediation is designed to conclude with an agreement rather than a winner and loser. Responsiveness reflects the intent to allow the parties to craft a resolution outside of the strict rules of the legal system. A responsive mediation process also is informal, flexible and collaborative. Self-determination and party autonomy allow and require parties to choose the area of agreement, rather than ceding the decision to an outside decision-maker such as a judge. This turns the responsibility for the outcome onto the parties themselves. In the United States, mediator codes-of-conduct emphasize ""client-directed"" solutions rather than imposed solutions. This has become a common, definitive feature of mediation in the US and UK. == Ethics == Theorists, notably Rushworth Kidder, who founded the Institute for Global Ethics in 1980, claimed that mediation is the foundation of a 'postmodern' ethics—and that it sidesteps traditional ethical issues with pre-defined limits of morality. Mediation can also be seen as a form of harm reduction or de-escalation, especially in its large-scale application in peace and similar negotiations, or the bottom-up way it is performed in the peace movement where it is often called mindful mediation. This form derived from methods of Quakers in particular. == Conflict management == Society perceives conflict as something that one should resolve as quickly as possible. Mediators see conflict as a fact of life that when properly managed can benefit the parties. The benefits of conflict include the opportunity to renew relationships and make positive changes for the future. == See also == == Notes == == References == Agardy, Peter (2009), 'Mediation and the insolvency practitioner,' Insolvency Law Journal, Thomson Reuters, Vol 17.

170,"('Fluvoxamine (maleate)', 'Fluvoxamine', 'Fluvoxaminum', 'Fluvoxamina', 'Fluvoxaminum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Fluvoxamine, sold under the brand name Luvox among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and, perhaps more-especially, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), but is also used to treat anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Fluvoxamine's side-effect profile is similar to that of other SSRIs. Common adverse effects include constipation, gastrointestinal problems, headache, anxiety, irritation, sexual problems, dry mouth, sleep problems and an increased risk of suicide at the start of treatment. These effects appear to be significantly weaker than with other SSRIs, with the exception of gastrointestinal side-effects. Fluvoxamine appears to be more tolerable than other SSRIs, particularly with respect to cardiovascular complications. Compared to escitalopram and sertraline, fluvoxamine's gastrointestinal profile may be less intense, often being limited to nausea. Mosapride has demonstrated efficacy in treating fluvoxamine-induced nausea. It is also advised practice to divide total daily doses of fluvoxamine greater than 100 milligrams, with the higher fraction being taken in the evening (e.g., 50 mg at the beginning of the waking day and 200 mg at bedtime). In any case, high starting daily doses of fluvoxamine rather than the recommended gradual titration (starting at 50 milligrams and gradually titrating, up to 300 if necessary) may increase the likelihood of nausea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == In many countries (e.g., Australia, the United Kingdom, and Russia) it is commonly used for major depressive disorder. Fluvoxamine is also approved in the United States for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. In Japan, it is also approved to treat OCD, social anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Fluvoxamine is indicated for children and adolescents with OCD. The NICE guidelines in the United Kingdom have, as of 2005, authorized its use for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and adolescents of any age and children over the age of 7. There is evidence that fluvoxamine is effective for generalised social anxiety in adults, although, as with other SSRIs, some of the results may be compromised by having been funded by pharmaceutical companies. Of the SSRIs, however, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline do appear consistent as viable treatments for generalised social anxiety. Fluvoxamine is also effective for treating a range of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, including generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and separation anxiety disorder. The drug works long-term, and retains its therapeutic efficacy for at least one year. The average therapeutic dose for fluvoxamine is 100 to 300 mg/day, with 300 mg being the upper daily limit normally recommended. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, however, often requires higher doses; doses of up to 450 mg/day may be prescribed in this case. The (off-label) upper daily limits for other serotonin-reuptake inhibitors used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, by analogy, are 400mg for sertraline, 100 mg for paroxetine, 120 mg for both fluoxetine and citalopram, 60 mg for escitalopram and 300 mg for clomipramine. In any case with fluvoxamine, treatment is generally begun at 50 mg and increased in 50 mg increments every 4 to 7 days until a therapeutic optimum is reached. == Adverse effects == Fluvoxamine's side-effect profile is very similar to other SSRIs. Gastrointestinal side effects are characteristic of those receiving treatment with fluvoxamine. === Common === Common side effects occurring with 1–10% incidence: === Uncommon === Uncommon side effects occurring with 0.1–1% incidence: === Rare === Rare side effects occurring with 0.01–0.1% incidence: === Unknown frequency === == Interactions == Fluvoxamine inhibits the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2 (strongly) which metabolizes agomelatine, amitriptyline, caffeine, clomipramine, clozapine, duloxetine, haloperidol, imipramine, phenacetin, tacrine, tamoxifen, theophylline, olanzapine, etc. CYP3A4 (moderately) which metabolizes alprazolam, aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, quetiapine, pimozide, ziprasidone, etc. CYP2D6 (weakly) which metabolizes aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, clozapine, codeine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, olanzapine, oxycodone, paroxetine, perphenazine, pethidine, risperidone, sertraline, thioridazine, zuclopenthixol, etc. CYP2C9 (moderately) which metabolizes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, etc. CYP2C19 (strongly) which metabolizes clonazepam, diazepam, phenytoin, etc. CYP2B6 (weakly) which metabolizes bupropion, cyclophosphamide, sertraline, tamoxifen, valproate, etc. By so doing, fluvoxamine can increase serum concentration of the substrates of these enzymes. Fluvoxamine may also elevate plasma levels of olanzapine by approximately two times. Combined olanzapine and fluvoxamine, which may cause increased sedation, should be used cautiously and controlled clinically and by therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid olanzapine induced adverse effects and/or intoxication. The plasma levels of oxidatively metabolized benzodiazepines (e.g., triazolam, midazolam, alprazolam and diazepam) are likely to be increased when co-administered with fluvoxamine. However, the clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., lorazepam; oxazepam, which is coincidentally a metabolite of diazepam; temazepam) are not affected by fluvoxamine and may be safely taken alongside fluvoxamine should concurrent treatment with a benzodiazepine be necessary. Additionally, it appears that benzodiazepines metabolized by nitro-reduction (clonazepam, nitrazepam) may also, in a somewhat similar vein, be unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine. Using fluvoxamine and alprazolam together can increase alprazolam plasma concentrations. If alprazolam is coadministered with fluvoxamine, the initial alprazolam dose should be reduced to the lowest effective dose. Fluvoxamine and ramelteon coadministration is not indicated. Fluvoxamine has been observed to increase serum concentrations of mirtazapine, which is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, by three- to four-fold in humans. Caution and adjustment of dosage as necessary are warranted when combining fluvoxamine and mirtazapine. Fluvoxamine seriously affects the pharmacokinetics of tizanidine and increases the intensity and duration of its effects. Because of the potentially hazardous consequences, the concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, or other potent inhibitors of CYP1A2, should be avoided. When a beta-blocker is required, atenolol, pindolol and, possibly, metoprolol may be safer choices than propranolol, as the latter's metabolism is seriously, potentially dangerously, inhibited by fluvoxamine. Indeed, fluvoxamine may increase propranolol blood-levels by five-fold. Clomipramine increases fluvoxamine levels and, conversely-likewise, fluvoxamine increases clomipramine levels (thereby its serotoninergic potential) and inhibits its metabolism to its strongly-noradrenergic metabolite, norclomipramine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Fluvoxamine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with around 100-fold affinity for the serotonin transporter over the norepinephrine transporter. It has negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter or any other site, with the sole exception of the σ1 receptor. It behaves as a potent agonist at this receptor and has the highest affinity (36 nM) of any SSRI for doing so. This may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and may also afford it some efficacy in treating the cognitive symptoms of depression. It increases concentrations of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, which may also contribute to its anxiolytic effects. Unlike some other SSRIs, fluvoxamine's metabolites are pharmacologically neutral. === Pharmacokinetics === Literature reviews have stated that fluvoxamine is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and to a minor extent by CYP1A2. However, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers do not have considerably higher fluvoxamine levels than extensive metabolizers. The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) label (last revised 2023) states that the specific enzymes involved in fluvoxamine are not definitively known and that in vitro data suggest that it is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2 and may also be metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 to a much lesser extent. == History == Fluvoxamine was developed by Kali-Duphar, part of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Belgium, now Abbott Laboratories, and introduced as Floxyfral in Switzerland in 1983. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994, and introduced as Luvox in the US. In India, it is available, among several other brands, as Uvox by Abbott. It was one of the first SSRI antidepressants to be launched, and is prescribed in many countries to patients with major depression. It was the first SSRI, a non-TCA drug, approved by the U.S. FDA specifically for the treatment of OCD. At the end of 1995, more than ten million patients worldwide had been treated with fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be registered for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder in children by the FDA in 1997. In Japan, fluvoxamine was the first SSRI to be approved for the treatment of depression in 1999 and was later in 2005 the first drug to be approved for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Fluvoxamine was the first SSRI approved for clinical use in the United Kingdom. Manufacturers include BayPharma, Synthon, and Teva, among others. == Research directions == A 2022 review concluded that according to low-certainty evidence, fluvoxamine may slightly decrease all-cause mortality by day 28 and potentially reduce the risk of hospitalization or death in outpatients with mild COVID-19. While early studies have suggested potential benefits for fluvoxamine as an anti-inflammatory agent and a possible impact on reducing cytokine storms, further studies did not confirm this expected benefit on COVID-19 patients. A cytokine storm refers to an excessive immune response characterized by a release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In May 2022, based on a review of available scientific evidence, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chose not to issue an emergency use authorization covering the use of fluvoxamine to treat COVID-19, saying that, at the time, the data was not sufficient to conclude that fluvoxamine may be effective in treating non-hospitalized people with COVID-19 to prevent serious illness or hospitalization. The agency stated that study results suggest that further clinical trials may be warranted. Reviews published in 2024 indicate that clinical trials have shown fluvoxamine to be more effective than a placebo in reducing clinical deterioration and hospitalization in COVID-19 patients, particularly those taking 200 mg or more daily. == Environment == Fluvoxamine is a common finding in waters near human settlement. Christensen et al. 2007 finds it is ""very toxic to aquatic organisms"" by European Union standards. == References ==",Fluvoxamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.079655122448457e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002669931564014405)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Fluvoxamine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine?utm_source=openai')])"

It is of clinical significance only in those patients who were enrolled in clinical trials to evaluate loviride (e.g., CAESAR and AVANTI), because in those trials loviride was often given alone and with no companion drug, leading to a high probability of developing reverse transcriptase mutations such as K103N which result in cross-class resistance to the NNRTIs efavirenz and nevirapine. == References ==",Loveride,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.126929372549057)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016258825780823827), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006729558110237122)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.tramstrasse100.ch/500685a75e0bec7d7/500685a75e0c7c7f0/index.html ', [])"

The standard starting material for many benzimidazoles consists of phenylenediamine, or its derivatives. Reaction of that compound with chloroacetic acid can be rationalized by invoking initial formation of the chloromethyl amide. Imide formation with the remaining free amino group closes the ring to afford 2-chloromethyl benzimidazole (3). Displacement of halogen with pyrrolidine affords the alkylation product.

The compound was developed at the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases in Singapore, through a collaboration with the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), the Biomedical Primate Research Centre and the Swiss Tropical Institute. Cipargamin is a synthetic antimalarial molecule belonging to the spiroindolone class, awarded MMV Project of the Year 2009. It is structurally related to GNF 493, a compound first identified as a potent inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum growth in a high throughput phenotypic screen of natural products conducted at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation in San Diego, California in 2006. Cipargamin was discovered by screening the Novartis library of 12,000 natural products and synthetic compounds to find compounds active against Plasmodium falciparum. The first screen turned up 275 compounds and the list was narrowed to 17 potential candidates. The current spiroindolone was optimized to address its metabolic liabilities leading to improved stability and exposure levels in animals. As a result, cipargamin is one of only a handful of molecules capable of completely curing mice infected with Plasmodium berghei (a model of blood-stage malaria). Given its good physicochemical properties, promising pharmacokinetic and efficacy profile, the molecule was recently approved as a preclinical candidate and is now entering GLP toxicology studies with the aim of entering Phase I studies in humans in late 2010. If its safety and tolerability are acceptable, cipargamin would be the first antimalarial not belonging to either the artemisinin or peroxide class to go into a proof-of-concept study in malaria. If cipargamin behaves similarly in people to the way it works in mice, it may be possible to develop it into a drug that could be taken just once - far easier than current standard treatments in which malaria drugs are taken between one and four times a day for up to seven days. Cipargamin also has properties which could enable it to be manufactured in pill form and in large quantities.

It is a small molecule BRAF inhibitor that targets key enzymes in the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway occurs in many different cancers including melanoma and colorectal cancers. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Encorafenib was developed by Novartis and Array BioPharma. In June 2018, it was approved by the FDA in combination with binimetinib for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. == Medical uses == Encorafenib is indicated in combination with binimetinib, for the treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test; in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adults with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy; in combination with binimetinib, for the treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. Encorafenib is not indicated for treatment of people with wild-type BRAF melanoma, wild-type BRAF CRC, or wild-type BRAF NSCLC. In December 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to encorafenib with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) for people with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. == Pharmacology == Encorafenib acts as an ATP-competitive RAF kinase inhibitor, decreasing ERK phosphorylation and down-regulation of CyclinD1. This arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, inducing senescence without apoptosis. Therefore, it is only effective in melanomas with a BRAF mutation, which make up 50% of all melanomas. The plasma elimination half-life of encorafenib is approximately 6 hours, occurring mainly through metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes. == History == Approval of encorafenib in the United States was based on a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453) in 577 participants with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to receive binimetinib 45 mg twice daily plus encorafenib 450 mg once daily, encorafenib 300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy measure was progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1 response criteria and assessed by blinded independent central review. The median PFS was 14.9 months for participants receiving binimetinib plus encorafenib, and 7.3 months for the vemurafenib monotherapy arm (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.71, p<0.0001). The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America, and various countries around the world. Efficacy for encorafenib with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was evaluated in BREAKWATER (NCT04607421), an active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial. Participants were required to have treatment naïve BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic colorectal cancer, detected by the Qiagen therascreen BRAF V600E RGQ polymerase chain reaction kit. Participants were initially randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms: encorafenib orally once daily with cetuximab IV infusion every 2 weeks (encorafenib+cetuximab arm); encorafenib orally once daily with cetuximab IV infusion every 2 weeks and mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks (encorafenib+cetuximab+mFOLFOX6 arm); or mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI (both every 2 weeks) or CAPOX (every 3 weeks)-each with or without bevacizumab (control arm). The trial was subsequently amended to limit randomization (1:1) to the encorafenib +cetuximab+mFOLFOX6 arm and the control arm. Treatment in all arms continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, lost to follow-up, or death. The results of the encorafenib + cetuximab + mFOLFOX6 arm compared to the control arm served as the basis of this accelerated approval and are described below. === Clinical trials === Several clinical trials of LGX818, either alone or in combinations with the MEK inhibitor MEK162, are being run.

Its development was halted in 2006 when phase III studies showed excessive all-cause mortality in the treatment group receiving a combination of atorvastatin (Lipitor) and torcetrapib. == Medical uses == Torcetrapib has not been found to reduce either cardiovascular disease or risk of death in those already taking a statin drug. == Mechanism == Torcetrapib acts (as a CETP inhibitor) by inhibiting cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP), which normally transfers cholesterol from HDL cholesterol to very low density or low density lipoproteins (VLDL or LDL). Inhibition of this process results in higher HDL cholesterol levels and reduces LDL cholesterol levels. According to Harvard Heart Letter: ""HDL cholesterol is turning out to be a much more complex substance than we once believed. Instead of a single kind of particle, HDL cholesterol is a family of different particles. Although they all contain lipids (fats), cholesterol, and proteins called apolipoproteins, some types are spherical while others are doughnut-shaped. Some types of HDL are great at plucking cholesterol from LDL and artery walls while other types are indifferent to cholesterol, and some even transfer cholesterol the wrong way — into LDL and cells"" == Development == The first step in the synthesis was a recently created reaction of amination to p-chlorotrifluoryltoluene, a reaction that was created by Dr. Stephen Buchwald at MIT. Development of the drug began around 1990; it was first administered in humans in 1999, and manufacturing at production scale began in Ireland in 2005. Pfizer had previously announced that torcetrapib would be sold in combination with Pfizer's statin, atorvastatin (Lipitor); however, following media and physician criticism, Pfizer had subsequently planned for torcetrapib to be sold independently of Lipitor. == Clinical trials == A 2004 trial (19 subjects, non-randomised) showed that torcetrapib could increase HDL and lower LDL with and without an added statin. Nine phase III studies were completed. === Early termination of study === On December 2, 2006, Pfizer cut off torcetrapib's phase III trial because of ""an imbalance of mortality and cardiovascular events"" associated with its use. This was a sudden and unexpected event and as late as November 30, 2006 Jeff Kindler, Pfizer's chief executive, was quoted, ""This will be one of the most important compounds of our generation."" In the terminated trial, a 60% increase in deaths was observed among patients taking torcetrapib and atorvastatin versus taking atorvastatin alone. Pfizer recommended that all patients stop taking the drug immediately. Six studies were terminated early. One of the completed studies found it raised systolic blood pressure and concluded ""Torcetrapib showed no clinical benefit in this or other studies, and will not be developed further."" The drug cost $800m+ to bring into Phase III development. == Synthesis == Dietary cholesterol needs be esterified in order to be absorbed from the gut. The enzyme, cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP), then completes the absorption of cholesterol. Drugs that interfere with the action of these peptides would aid in lowering cholesterol levels by complementing the action of the statins that inhibit the endogenous production of cholesterol. The CETP inhibitor torcetrapib (8) proved very effective in lowering cholesterol levels in humans; the drug not only lowered low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) but also raised levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL). This agent, which had only a brief time on the market due to adverse safety reports, is included here to illustrate an unusual method for preparing tetrahydroquinolines. Reaction of the trifluoromethylaniline (1) with propanal in the presence of benzotriazole (2) affords the aminal (3). Condensation of (3) with the vinyl carbamate (4) yields the tetrahydroquinoline ring (5) with expulsion of the benzotriazole fragment. The ring nitrogen is then protected as its ethyl carbamate by acylation with ethyl chloroformate (6). The benzyl carbamate function on nitrogen at the 4 position is next removed by reduction with ammonium formate over palladium to afford the primary amine; this compound is then resolved as its dibenzyl tartrate salt to afford the 2R,4S isomer (7). Reductive amination with the bis-trifuoromethyl benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium triacetoxyborohydride followed by acylation with methyl chloroformate completes the synthesis of torcetrapib (8). == See also == CETP inhibitor Anacetrapib, CETP inhibitor undergoing development by Merck Dalcetrapib, CETP inhibitor which also failed in clinical trials == References == Clark, RW; Sutfin TA; Ruggeri RB; Willauer AT; Sugarman ED; Magnus-Aryitey G; Cosgrove PG; Sand TM; Wester RT; Williams JA; Perlman ME; Bamberger MJ (January 22, 2004).

Potent small molecule inhibitors of one biosynthetic enzyme, Oxidosqualene Cyclase (OSC), have been identified, and RO 48-8071 (4'-[6-(allylmethylamino)hexyloxy]-4-bromo-2'-fluorobenzophenone fumarate) (RO), has emerged as a useful chemotherapeutic agent for breast and prostate cancer. Cell viability assays were performed to determine effects of RO 48-8071 on growth of EOC cells. Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay was conducted to determine the effects of drug on reducing stem cell like properties of EOC cells. Finally, xenograft studies were performed to assess the ability of RO 48-8071 to inhibit the growth of EOC cells in vivo. We found that short-term (24-48 h) administration of pharmacological doses of RO effectively reduced the viability of drug-resistant EOC cells (SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3), as determined with sulforhodamine B colorimetric assays. In 7-day assays, nanomolar concentrations of RO effectively inhibited the growth of EOC cells. RO also suppressed ALDH activity, a marker of stem cells. Importantly, RO significantly suppressed growth of xenografts derived from EOC cells when given to mice intraperitoneally (20-40 mg kg Cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor RO 48-8071 is thus a novel and potent inhibitor of human EOC, including EOC stem cells. The morbidity and mortality of pancreatic cancer have been continuously increasing, causing seven deaths per 100,000 individuals/year. At present, effective therapies are severely lacking, thus, highlighting the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches. The present study aimed to investigate the inhibitory roles of the 2,3‑oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitor, RO 48‑8071 (RO), on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. RO was used to treat the pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC‑1)  Standard treatment for primary prostate cancer includes systemic exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs that target androgen receptor or antihormone therapy (chemical castration); however, drug-resistant cancer cells generally emerge during treatment, limiting the continued use of systemic chemotherapy. Patients are then treated with more toxic standard therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel and more effective treatments for prostate cancer. The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is an attractive therapeutic target for treating endocrine-dependent cancers because cholesterol is an essential structural and functional component of cell membranes as well as the metabolic precursor of endogenous steroid hormones. In this study, we have examined the effects of RO 48-8071 (4'-[6-(allylmethylamino)hexyloxy]-4-bromo-2'-fluorobenzophenone fumarate; Roche Pharmaceuticals internal reference: RO0488071) (RO), which is an inhibitor of 2, 3-oxidosqualene cyclase (a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway), on prostate cancer cells. Exposure of both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant human prostate cancer cells to RO reduced prostate cancer cell viability and induced apoptosis in vitro. RO treatment reduced androgen receptor protein expression in hormone-dependent prostate cancer cells and increased estrogen receptor β (ERβ) protein expression in both hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. Combining RO with an ERβ agonist increased its ability to reduce castration-resistant prostate cancer cell viability. In addition, RO effectively suppressed the growth of aggressive castration-resistant human prostate cancer cell xenografts in vivo without any signs of toxicity to experimental animals. Importantly, RO did not reduce the viability of normal prostate cells in vitro. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor RO effectively suppresses growth of human prostate cancer cells. Our findings suggest that cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors such as RO, when used in combination with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs or ERβ specific ligands, could represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the growth of prostate cancer tumors.",Ro 48-8071,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0016280265990644693), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029779113829135895)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00010247035970678553)])","('INFO; https://www.enzo.com/product/ro-48-8071/,https://www.scbt.com/p/ro-48-8071-161582-11-2,https://www.bio-techne.com/p/small-molecules-peptides/ro-48-8071-fumarate_5389 ', [])"

It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Schering-Plough. Merck decided to not pursue regulatory approval for use in treatment-experienced patients because the drug did not meet primary efficacy endpoints in late stage trials. Clinical trials continue in patients previously untreated for HIV. == HIV-1 background == The mechanisms of a number of available anti-HIV drugs prevent either viral reverse transcriptase enzyme or protease enzyme, allowing the virus to enter the cell before these drugs take effect. However, CCR5 inhibitors such as vicriviroc, as well as other entry inhibitors of HIV-1, inhibit the initial stages of the virus life cycle. === HIV-1 entry === HIV binds to and fuses with the target T-cells or macrophages with the help of gp120 and gp41, the only two proteins that are currently known to be exhibited on the surface of the viral envelope. One molecule of each protein associates noncovalently with the other on the viral membrane, and three of these units aggregate to form the gp120/gp41 heterotrimer, which traps the gp41 in a conformationally metastable state. Membrane fusion begins with the binding of gp120 to CD4, a glycoprotein which is expressed on the surface of the target cell. Upon binding, gp120 undergoes a conformational change, which causes the formation of the coreceptor binding site on gp120. All strains of HIV-1 use one of two coreceptors: CCR5 or CXCR4; coreceptor specificity will be described below. Once gp120 binds to the coreceptor, gp41 undergoes a conformational change that releases it from its once-metastable position. This change causes the hydrophobic N-terminus of the gp41 protein, also known as the fusion domain, to insert into the host cell membrane and anchor the virus into place. The insertion of gp41 into the target cell causes a subtle rearrangement in the gp41 protein that brings together two trimeric coiled coils, HR1 and HR2, to form a six-helix bundle. The bundle allows the viral and cellular membranes to approximate and eventually fuse together, leading to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the target cell. === Coreceptors and tropism === The two coreceptors involved in the entry of HIV-1, CCR5 and CXCR4, belong to the larger family of 7-transmembrane segment (7TM) G-protein coupled receptors. HIV-1 can thus be classified according to specificity for one coreceptor or the other. R5 virus, also known as M-tropic HIV-1, targets macrophages and uses CCR5 as the coreceptor. X4 virus, or T-tropic HIV-1, targets T-cells and uses CXCR4 as the coreceptor. Dual-tropic strains of HIV-1, which utilize both receptors, also exist. Selectivity for one coreceptor or the other is especially dependent upon the V3 loop, a highly variable and structurally flexible region of gp120 that is composed of approximately 35 amino acids. Tropism can be predicted through the 11/25 method, which looks for basic amino acids at positions 11 and 25 in the V3 loop and suggests the presence of an X4 virus. Coreceptor usage, however, can change throughout the course of infection. 90% of patients in early phases of HIV-1 infection have R5 virus. However, after five years of infection, about 50% of all patients have detectable amounts of X4 virus. Causes for this switch are currently unclear. However, viral changes from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor usage have been associated with a faster rate of CD4+ T-cell loss, rapid viral progression, and an increased rate of development of AIDS and death. === CCR5-Δ32 === A focus on the CCR5 co-receptor as a potential target for anti-HIV medications began in 1996 with the discovery of CCR5-Δ32, or CCR5 delta-32, a mutational variant of the CCR5 coding gene. The deletion of 32 base pairs in this gene results in nonfunctional CCR5 receptors. While the frequency of this mutation within Caucasian populations is 0.0808, people of African or Asian descent do not appear to possess this allele. Δ32 homozygotes, or individuals who possess two copies of the Δ32 variant, have no functional CCR5 receptors and are consequently highly resistant to HIV infection. Individuals who inherit one copy of Δ32 variant and one copy of the normal CCR5 gene are CCR5 heterozygotes. Δ32 heterozygotes are still susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but the progression of the disease is significantly delayed compared to those with two normal copies of the CCR5 gene. CCR5 antagonists have been developed which cause deformation in the CCR5 co-receptor, leading to the cell's failure to bind with the HIV gp120 protein. == SCH-C and vicriviroc == In 2001, Schering-Plough developed one of the first small molecule CCR5 antagonists, SCH-C or SCH 351125, which inhibited replication of a number of HIV-1 isolates that used CCR5 as a coreceptor for binding. However, SCH-C caused a modest but dose-dependent prolongation of the corrected cardiac QT interval (QTc), leading to examination of alternative compounds whose antiviral and pharmacokinetic properties exceeded those of first-generation compounds like SCH-C. Vicriviroc was discovered in high-throughput screening and structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis. When compared with SCH-C, vicriviroc consistently and more actively inhibits viral replication, binds with higher affinity to CCR5 than SCH-C, and possesses a lower affinity for the human ether-a-go-go-related gene transcript ion channel, which may suggest a lower risk of cardiac effects. == Method of action == Vicriviroc is a noncompetitive allosteric antagonist of CCR5. It is orally administered and, because it is effective at nanomolar concentrations, it can be administered once daily. Vicriviroc binds to a small hydrophobic pocket between the transmembrane helices near the extracellular surface of the CCR5 receptor. Binding to this pocket induces a conformational change of the extracellular segment of CCR5 and prevents binding of gp120 to the target cell, consequently preventing the virus from entering the target cell at all. Specific binding interactions between CCR5 and vicriviroc were first described in 2008. Specifically, the trifluoromethyl phenyl group of vicriviroc may interact strongly with I198 residue on the fifth transmembrane helix (TM5) of CCR5 through hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, electrostatic interactions may form between the positively charged tertiary nitrogen group of vicriviroc and the hydrophilic region provided by E238 residue on TM7 of CCR5. Other strong interactions predicted by the group include the Y108 residue on TM3 and Y251 on TM6. == Clinical trials == Currently, vicriviroc is undergoing critical trials. Vicriviroc demonstrated a significant decrease of HIV RNA in R5-infected subjects. The mean decline from baseline of HIV RNA achieved 1.5 log10 or greater in all treatment groups (10, 25, 50 mg, b.i.d.) in a 14-day monotherapy trial in HIV-infected adults. A phase II trial in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects was discontinued after the rate of virologic relapse in those subjects who were administered vicriviroc increased compared to control subjects; however, further investigations suggest that the administered dosage of vicriviroc may have been too low. A new Phase II trial of treatment-naive HIV-1 patients is currently underway. A 48-week phase II trial (ACTG5211) examining the safety and efficacy of 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of vicriviroc found that patients in the 10 mg and 15 mg vicriviroc treatment groups achieved a median decrease in viral load of 1.92 and 1.44 (log10 copies/mL) and a median increase in CD4 cell count of 130 and 96 (cell/uL) from baseline, respectively. More patients in the vicriviroc groups had undetectable virus at 48 weeks (HIV-1 RNA <400/<50 copies/ml) compared to those in the placebo group (57/37 percent and 43/27 percent vs. 14/11 percent, respectively). The results from a 48-week phase II trial (VICTOR-E1) examining administration of 20 or 30 mg dosages of vicriviroc in addition to > 3-drug optimized background therapy (OBT) regimen that included a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor were reported in February 2008. Investigators concluded that, “‘Vicriviroc 30 or 20 mg once daily plus ritonavir-containing OBT provided sustained viral suppression in treatment-experienced subjects and increased CD4 cell counts regardless of the number of active drugs in OBT.’"" As of May 2008, two phase III trials (VICTOR-E3 and VICTOR E4) in treatment-experienced patients were initiated. The late stage clinical trials by did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and Merck has decided as of January 2010 to not pursue regulatory approval for the drug. == Concerns surrounding CCR5 antagonists == Available clinical trial data suggest that a new method of combating HIV-1 may be found in CCR5 antagonists. Studies into vicriviroc are ongoing, and another CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, is currently on the market. However, concerns have arisen regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists as anti-HIV treatments because such drugs may facilitate the emergence of resistant strains of HIV-1. Two possibilities for such resistance have been hypothesized: HIV-1 may evolve to use only CXCR4 as the coreceptor; or HIV-1 may mutate in such a way that it is still able to interact with CCR5, despite the presence of a receptor antagonist. In fact, maraviroc-resistant variants of HIV-1 have already been generated in vitro by mutating residues in the V3 loop of gp120. == See also == Discovery and development of CCR5 receptor antagonists Cenicriviroc Maraviroc == References ==",Vicriviroc,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5759617686271667), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.892617915989831e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004087071865797043)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicriviroc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16304152/,https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aac.49.12.4911-4919.2005,https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4690-2-S1-S12,https://www.poz.com/article/hiv-vicriviroc-merck-18742-4657 ', [])"

The drug was originally discovered and developed by Grünenthal, a German pharmaceutical company and formerly developed by Park Therapeutics and Depomed, pharmaceutical companies in the United States, for the treatment of a variety of different acute and chronic pain states. As of November 2014, it is in phase III clinical trials. Cebranopadol is unique in its mechanism of action as an opioid, binding to and activating all four of the opioid receptors; it acts as a full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (Ki = 0.7 nM; EC50 = 1.2 nM; IA = 104%), and δ-opioid receptor (Ki = 18 nM; EC50 = 110 nM; IA = 105%), and as a partial agonist of the nociceptin receptor (Ki = 0.9 nM; EC50 = 13.0 nM; IATooltip intrinsic activity = 89%) and κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2.6 nM; EC50 = 17 nM; IA = 67%). The EC50 values of 0.5–5.6 μg/kg when introduced intravenously and 25.1 μg/kg after oral administration. Cebranopadol shows highly potent and effective antinociceptive and antihypertensive effects in a variety of different animal models of pain. Notably, it has also been found to be more potent in models of chronic neuropathic pain than acute nociceptive pain compared to selective μ-opioid receptor agonists.

In addition, unlike morphine, cebranopadol has not been found to affect motor coordination or reduce respiration in animals at doses in or over the dosage range for analgesia. As such, it may have improved and prolonged efficacy and greater tolerability in comparison to currently available opioid analgesics. As an agonist of the κ-opioid receptor, cebranopadol may have the capacity to produce psychotomimetic effects, dysphoria, and other adverse reactions at sufficiently high doses, a property which could potentially limit its practical clinical dosage range, but would likely reduce the occurrence of patients taking more than their prescribed dose. == See also == List of investigational analgesics Mitragynine == References == == External links == Cebranopadol - AdisInsight Cebranopadol Search Results - ClinicalTrials.gov",Cebranopadol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013517419574782252), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019350391812622547)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/tris-pharma-announces-positive-results-alleviate-2-phase-3-pivotal-trial-cebranopadol-21938.html?utm_source=openai), [pharmatimes.com](https://pharmatimes.com/news/tris-pharma-announces-positive-results-from-alleviate-1-trial-of-cebranopadol/?utm_source=openai), [biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/tris-pharma-announces-positive-results-from-alleviate-2-phase-3-pivotal-trial-for-cebranopadol-an-investigational-first-in-class-oral-dual-nmr-agonist-for-the-treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-acute-pain?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=599, start_index=9, title='Tris Pharma Announces Positive Results from ALLEVIATE-2 Phase 3 Pivotal Trial for Cebranopadol, an Investigational First-in-Class Oral Dual-NMR Agonist, for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Acute Pain - Drugs.com MedNews', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/tris-pharma-announces-positive-results-alleviate-2-phase-3-pivotal-trial-cebranopadol-21938.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=599, start_index=9, title='Tris Pharma announces positive results from ALLEVIATE-1 trial of cebranopadol - PharmaTimes', type='url_citation', url='https://pharmatimes.com/news/tris-pharma-announces-positive-results-from-alleviate-1-trial-of-cebranopadol/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=599, start_index=9, title='Tris Pharma Announces Positive Results from ALLEVIATE-2 Phase 3 Pivotal Trial for Cebranopadol, an Investigational First-in-Class Oral Dual-NMR Agonist, for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Acute Pain - BioSpace', type='url_citation', url='https://www.biospace.com/press-releases/tris-pharma-announces-positive-results-from-alleviate-2-phase-3-pivotal-trial-for-cebranopadol-an-investigational-first-in-class-oral-dual-nmr-agonist-for-the-treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-acute-pain?utm_source=openai')])"
185,"('Cloxiquine', 'Cloxyquin', 'Dermofongin', 'Chlorisept', 'Dermofungin')",Medical," Melanoma is one of the most aggressive skin cancers and 5-year survival rate is only 4.6% for metastatic melanoma patients. Current therapies, especially those involving clinical chemotherapy drugs, have achieved remarkable advances. However, their side effects, such as bone marrow suppression, limit the effectiveness of available pharmacological therapies. Therefore, exploring new antimelanoma drugs with less toxicity is critical for the treatment of melanoma. In the present study, we aimed to identify the antimelanoma drugs with ability to repress the proliferation of melanoma cells by using a high-content screening of FDA-approved drug libraries. We found that cloxiquine (CLQ), a traditional antituberculosic drug, exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the growth and metastasis of melanoma cells both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, CLQ at the tested doses did not show any apparent toxicity in normal melanocytes and in the liver. At the metabolic level, treatment with CLQ decreased glycolysis, thus potentially inhibiting the ""Warburg effect"" in B16F10 cells. More importantly, combination of CLQ and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a well-known glycolysis inhibitor, did not show a synergistic effect on the tumor growth and metastasis, indicating that inhibition of glycolysis is potentially involved in mediating CLQ's antimelanoma function. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) served as a potential CLQ target. Mechanistically, CLQ stimulated the transcription and nuclear contents of PPARγ. Furthermore, the specific PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 or PPARγ shRNA partially abolished the effects of CLQ. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CLQ has a great potential in the treatment of melanoma through activation of PPARγ. The combined treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists has displayed significant anticancer efficacy. Based on these results, a series of cloxiquine derivatives were prepared as potent HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of melanoma.

E7820 targets RBM39, affecting RNA splicing and angiogenesis by suppressing integrin α2. Phase I studies have demonstrated some stability in advanced solid malignancies; however, further efficacy studies are required. Indisulam causes G1 cell cycle arrest and delays the G1/S transition by modulating splicing through RBM39 degradation via DCAF15. Despite its limited initial efficacy, it shows promise in combination therapies, particularly for hematopoietic malignancies and gliomas. Tasisulam inhibits VEGF signaling, suppresses angiogenesis, and induces apoptosis. Although early trials indicated broad activity, safety concerns have halted its development. Chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide, initially investigated for cell cycle arrest and topoisomerase II inhibition, was discontinued owing to its limited efficacy and toxicity, despite promising initial results. Recent studies revealed the structural interaction of E7820 with DCAF15 and RBM39, although phase II trials on myeloid malignancies have shown limited efficacy. Indisulam is effective against glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, with potential synergy in combination therapies and metabolic disruption. Recent research on tasisulam reveals its potential in cancer therapy by targeting RBM39 degradation through DCAF15-mediated pathways. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to new treatments that affect alternative splicing and improve cancer therapies Overall, although these drugs exhibit promising mechanisms of action, further research is required to optimize their clinical efficacy and safety. Chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide (CQS) has been developed to the clinical trial stage based on its activity in the Human Tumor Colony Forming Assay (HTCFA). In the HTCFA, CQS demonstrated inhibition of colony formation against breast, lung, melanoma and ovarian carcinomas. The mechanism of action of CQS is unknown. It does not appear to inhibit folate metabolism as does the structurally similar sulfaquinoxaline. Preclinical toxicology studies in dogs and rats have shown that CQS is toxic to lymphoid organs, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, CNS, adrenal glands and testes. Toxicity was generally reversible with the exception of testicular atrophy in dogs and rats which occurred late and was not reversible within the study time frame. The pharmacokinetic data indicate that CQS binds to serum proteins in a dose and species specific manner. Terminal half-lives appear to vary between species from 60 hours in mice, 15 hours in rats, and 45-132 hours in dogs. Preliminary data indicate a longer terminal half-life in humans. Two phase I trials are ongoing using a 60 min infusion schedule once every 28 days. The starting dose for each trial was 18 mg/m2. Chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide (CQS), a sulfanilamide derivative with antitumor activity, was found to be toxic to lymphoid tissue during preclinical studies. The mechanism of this toxicity appears to involve profound inhibition of lymphocyte activation. Incubation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) with CQS decreased cellular incorporation of thymidine and deoxyuridine in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry indicated that CQS blocked movement out of the G0/G1 phase. Drug-treated cells were smaller and expressed fewer receptors for interleukin-2 (IL-2) and transferrin than untreated mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. These observations support the notion that CQS has cell cycle specificity in regulating lymphocyte proliferation. As little as 10 microM CQS markedly inhibited both human lymphocyte and murine CTLL cell replication in response to IL-2 containing growth factors. However, CQS did not block secretion of IL-2 into culture supernatant fractions by human PBMNCs. Finally, CQS inhibited in vitro production of immunoglobulins G and M by mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, primarily by causing cytotoxicity. In all of these drug effects, CQS was approximately one to two logs more potent than the parent compound, sulfaquinoxaline (SQ). These studies indicate that CQS inhibits essential basic processes in human lymphocytes.

192,"('Selumetinib', 'Selumetinib (azd6244)', 'Koselugo', 'Selumetinib [usan:inn]', 'Selumetinibum')",Medical,"Selumetinib (INN), sold under the brand name Koselugo, is a medication for the treatment of children, two years of age and older, with neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1), a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing tumors to grow on nerves. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, abdominal pain and other problems of the gastrointestinal tract, fatigue, muscle pain, as well as dry skin and other skin problems. Selumetinib was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020, and in the European Union in June 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Selumetinib is used for the treatment of neurofibromas in those with neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1). This is a rare, progressive condition caused by a mutation or flaw in the gene coding for the protein neurofibromin 1. NF-1 is usually diagnosed in early childhood and appears in an estimated one out of every 3,000 infants. It is characterized by changes in skin coloring (pigmentation), neurologic and skeletal impairments and risk for development of benign and malignant tumors throughout life. It is approved specifically for children who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN), which are tumors involving the nerve sheaths (coating around nerve fibers) and can grow anywhere in the body, including the face, extremities, areas around the spine and deep in the body where they may affect organs. Between 30% and 50% of children born with NF-1 develop one or more PNs. === Pregnancy === Based on findings from animal studies, selumetinib may cause harm to a newborn baby when administered to a pregnant woman. The FDA advises health care professionals to tell women of reproductive age, and men with female partners of reproductive potential, to use effective contraception during treatment with selumetinib, and for one week after the last dose. == Adverse effects == Common side effects are headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain (pain in the body affecting bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons and nerves), fever, dry skin, acneiform rash (acne) and other rashes, stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), paronychia (infection in the skin that surrounds a toenail or fingernail) and pruritus (itching). Selumetinib can also cause serious side effects including heart failure (manifested as ejection fraction decrease, or when the muscle of the left ventricle of the heart is not pumping as well as normal) and eye toxicity (acute and chronic damage to the eye) including retinal vein occlusion, retinal pigment epithelial detachment and impaired vision. Selumetinib can also cause increased creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). CPK is an enzyme found in the heart, brain and skeletal muscles. When muscle tissue is damaged, CPK leaks into a person's blood, which can be a sign of rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle due to direct or indirect muscle injury). Further, selumetinib capsules contain vitamin E, and users are at an increased risk of bleeding if their daily intake of vitamin E exceeds the recommended or safe limits. == Interactions == As selumetinib is thought to be metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, use of moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as grapefruit juice) and of the CYP2C19 inhibitor fluconazole is discouraged for people taking selumetinib. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Selumetinib is a kinase inhibitor, more specifically a selective inhibitor of the enzyme mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK kinase or MEK) subtypes 1 and 2. These enzymes are part of the MAPK/ERK pathway, which regulates cell proliferation (i.e., growth and division) and is overly active in many types of cancer. == History == Selumetinib was discovered by Array BioPharma and was licensed to AstraZeneca. It has been investigated for the treatment of various types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for selumetinib priority review, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designations. It was granted a rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of pediatric NF-1 along with a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. In April 2020, selumetinib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of children with NF-1. It is the first drug approved in the US to treat this rare disease. The approval was based on a clinical trial of children who had NF-1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (defined as a PN that could not be completely removed without risk for substantial morbidity to the child), conducted by the National Cancer Institute. The efficacy results were from 50 of the children who received the recommended dose and had routine evaluations of changes in tumor size and tumor-related morbidities during the trial. The children received selumetinib 25 mg/m2 orally twice a day until disease progression or until they experienced unacceptable adverse reactions. The clinical trial measured the overall response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of subjects with a complete response and those who experienced more than a 20% reduction in PN volume on MRI that was confirmed on a subsequent MRI within 3 to 6 months. The ORR was 66% and all subjects had a partial response, meaning that no subjects had complete disappearance of the tumor. Of these subjects, 82% had a response lasting 12 months or longer. The trial was conducted at four sites in the United States. Other clinical outcomes for subjects during selumetinib treatment included changes in PN-related disfigurement, symptoms and functional impairments. Although the sample sizes of subjects assessed for each PN-related morbidity (such as disfigurement, pain, strength and mobility problems, airway compression, visual impairment and bladder or bowel dysfunction) were small, there appeared to be a trend of improvement in PN-related symptoms or functional deficits during treatment. == Research == Selumetinib has also been shown to inhibit growth of GNAQ mutated uveal melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, preliminary results suggest that selumetinib treatment of uveal melanoma patients can result in tumor shrinkage as the consequence of sustained inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. A Phase II clinical trial about selumetinib in NSCLC was completed in September 2011; one about cancers with BRAF mutations is ongoing as of June 2012. In July 2015, selumetinib failed a Phase III trial testing whether the drug significantly prolonged the survival of patients in a study on melanoma originating in the eye. In the 152-patient trial, a combination of selumetinib and dacarbazine failed to improve progression-free survival compared with just the old drug alone. As of March 2016, there were other phase III trials registered for thyroid cancer, and KRAS positive NSCLC. The combination of selumetinib to chemotherapy improved median progression-free survival in a trial of 510 patients with advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC just for one month, which was statistically not significant. In November 2018, investigators working with nasal polyp tissue in vitro demonstrated a synergistic effect of down regulating expression of p-MEK1 and p-ERK1 when it was administered with erythromycin. == References == == Further reading == Ho AL, Grewal RK, Leboeuf R, Sherman EJ, Pfister DG, Deandreis D, et al.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is often characterized by nitric oxide deficiency. To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of praliciguat, an oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, in patients with HFpEF. CAPACITY HFpEF was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. Fifty-nine sites enrolled 196 patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of at least 40%, impaired peak rate of oxygen consumption (peak V̇o2), and at least 2 conditions associated with nitric oxide deficiency (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or advanced age). The trial randomized patients to 1 of 3 praliciguat dose groups or a placebo group, but was refocused early to a comparison of the 40-mg praliciguat dose vs placebo. Participants were enrolled from November 15, 2017, to April 30, 2019, with final follow-up on August 19, 2019. Patients were randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with 40 mg of praliciguat daily (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90). The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline in peak V̇o2 in patients who completed at least 8 weeks of assigned dosing. Secondary end points included the change from baseline in 6-minute walk test distance and in ventilatory efficiency (ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope). The primary adverse event end point was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Among 181 patients (mean [SD] age, 70 [9] years; 75 [41%] women), 155 (86%) completed the trial. In the placebo (n = 78) and praliciguat (n = 65) groups, changes in peak V̇o2 were 0.04 mL/kg/min (95% CI, -0.49 to 0.56) and -0.26 mL/kg/min (95% CI, -0.83 to 0.31), respectively; the placebo-adjusted least-squares between-group difference in mean change from baseline was -0.30 mL/kg/min ([95% CI, -0.95 to 0.35]; P = .37). None of the 3 prespecified secondary end points were statistically significant. In the placebo and praliciguat groups, changes in 6-minute walk test distance were 58.1 m (95% CI, 26.1-90.1) and 41.4 m (95% CI, 8.2-74.5), respectively; the placebo-adjusted least-squares between-group difference in mean change from baseline was -16.7 m (95% CI, -47.4 to 13.9). In the placebo and praliciguat groups, the placebo-adjusted least-squares between-group difference in mean change in ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope was -0.3 (95% CI, -1.6 to 1.0). There were more dizziness (9.9% vs 1.1%), hypotension (8.8% vs 0%), and headache (11% vs 6.7%) TEAEs with praliciguat compared with placebo. The frequency of serious TEAEs was similar between the groups (10% in the praliciguat group and 11% in the placebo group). Among patients with HFpEF, the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator praliciguat, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve peak V̇o2 from baseline to week 12. These findings do not support the use of praliciguat in patients with HFpEF.

194,"('Raltegravir', 'Isentress', 'Raltegravir (mk-0518)', 'Mk 0518', 'N-(2-(4-((4-fluorobenzyl)carbamoyl)-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-5-methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-carboxamide')",Medical,"Raltegravir, sold under the brand name Isentress, is an antiretroviral medication used, together with other medication, to treat HIV/AIDS. It may also be used, as part of post exposure prophylaxis, to prevent HIV infection following potential exposure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, nausea, high blood sugar, and headaches. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, muscle breakdown, and liver problems. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Raltegravir is an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor which blocks the functioning of HIV integrase which is needed for viral replication. Raltegravir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Lamivudine/raltegravir, a combination with lamivudine, is also available. == Medical uses == Raltegravir was initially approved only for use in individuals whose infection has proven resistant to other HAART drugs. However, in July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted expanded approval for raltegravir for use in all patients. As with any HAART medication, raltegravir is unlikely to show durability if used as monotherapy, due to the highly mutagenic nature of HIV. In December 2011, it approval for use in children over the age of two, taken in pill form orally twice a day by prescription with two other antiretroviral medications to form the cocktail (most anti-HIV drugs regimens for adults and children use these cocktails). Raltegravir is available in chewable form, but because the two tablet formulations are not interchangeable, the chewable pills are only approved for use in children two to 11. Older adolescents will use the adult formulation. === Efficacy === In a study of the drug as part of combination therapy, raltegravir exhibited potent and durable antiretroviral activity similar to that of efavirenz at 24 and 48 weeks but achieved HIV-1 RNA levels below detection at a more rapid rate. After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, raltegravir did not result in increased serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides. == Side effects == Raltegravir was generally well tolerated when used in combination with optimized background therapy regimens in treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection in trials of up to 48 weeks' duration. == Mechanism of action == As an integrase inhibitor, raltegravir targets integrase, an enzyme common to retroviruses that integrates the viral genetic material into human chromosomes, a critical step in the HIV infection model. The drug is metabolized away via glucuronidation. == Chemistry == Raltegravir has been synthesized in several ways, which have been reviewed. In one method used for its manufacture, 2-amino-2-methylpropanenitrile is reacted with the acid chloride of 5-methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-carboxylic acid using N-methylmorpholine as base. The product is treated with aqueous hydroxylamine to form an amidoxime. The central pyrimidone ring of the drug is then created when the amidoxime reacts with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. The synthesis is completed by conversion of the remaining methyl ester of the intermediate to an amide with 4-fluorobenzylamine, followed by methylation using trimethylsulfoxonium iodide. Use of that reagent ensures the required chemoselectivity so that methylation occurs on the nitrogen atom of the pyrimidone. == History == Raltegravir was the first integrase inhibitor to receive approval in the United States in October 2007. It was developed by Merck and reported by Summa et al. in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. In July 2024, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency authorised the first generic raltegravir medicines for adult and paediatric patients with HIV who weigh at least 40kg. Authorisation was granted to Lupin Healthcare (UK) Limited and Zentiva Pharma UK Limited. == Research == Raltegravir significantly alters HIV viral dynamics and decay and further research in this area is ongoing. In clinical trials patients taking raltegravir achieved viral loads less than 50 copies per millitre sooner than those taking similarly potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. This statistically significant difference in viral load reduction has caused some HIV researchers to begin questioning long held paradigms about HIV viral dynamics and decay. Research into raltegravir's ability to affect latent viral reservoirs and possibly aid in the eradication of HIV is currently ongoing. Research results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 24, 2008. The authors concluded that ""raltegravir plus optimized background therapy provided better viral suppression than optimized background therapy alone for at least 48 weeks."" Research on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) terminase proteins demonstrated that raltegravir may block viral replication of the herpesviruses. In January 2013, a Phase II trial was initiated to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of raltegravir in treating multiple sclerosis (MS). The drug is active against Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) and possibly Epstein–Barr virus, which have been suggested in the pathogenesis of relapsing-remitting MS. == References == == External links == World patent covering the potassium salt Archived 2007-10-14 at the Wayback Machine",Isentress,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.158996332786046e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000346362212439999)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/isentress.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=78, start_index=9, title='Isentress: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/isentress.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is formulated and used both alone and in combination with an estrogen. CPA is taken by mouth one to three times per day. Common side effects of high-dose CPA in men include gynecomastia (breast development) and feminization. In both men and women, possible side effects of CPA include low sex hormone levels, reversible infertility, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, weight gain, and elevated liver enzymes. With prolonged use, brain tumors prompting surgery are common, from 5% at high doses to 2% at low doses. At very high doses in older individuals, significant cardiovascular complications can occur. Rare but serious adverse reactions of CPA include blood clots, and liver damage. CPA can also cause adrenal insufficiency as a withdrawal effect if it is discontinued abruptly from a high dosage. CPA blocks the effects of androgens such as testosterone in the body, which it does by preventing them from interacting with their biological target, the androgen receptor (AR), and by reducing their production by the gonads, hence their concentrations in the body. In addition, it has progesterone-like effects by activating the progesterone receptor (PR). It can also produce weak cortisol-like effects at very high doses. CPA was discovered in 1961. It was originally developed as a progestin. In 1965, the antiandrogenic effects of CPA were discovered. CPA was first marketed, as an antiandrogen, in 1973, and was the first antiandrogen to be introduced for medical use. A few years later, in 1978, CPA was introduced as a progestin in a birth control pill. It has been described as a ""first-generation"" progestin and as the prototypical antiandrogen. CPA is available widely throughout the world. An exception is the United States, where it is not approved for use. == Medical uses == CPA is used as a progestin and antiandrogen in hormonal birth control and in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions. Specifically, CPA is used in combined birth control pills, in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, excessive hair growth, and scalp hair loss, high androgen levels, in transgender hormone therapy, to treat prostate cancer, to reduce sex drive in sex offenders or men with paraphilias or hypersexuality, to treat early puberty, and for other uses. Treatment dosages range from 2mg or less, to 100mg or more daily. In the United States, where CPA is not available, other medications with antiandrogenic effects are used to treat androgen-dependent conditions instead. Examples of such medications include gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators) like leuprorelin and degarelix, nonsteroidal antiandrogens like flutamide and bicalutamide, the diuretic and steroidal antiandrogen spironolactone, the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate, and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride. The steroidal antiandrogen and progestin chlormadinone acetate is used as an alternative to CPA in Japan, South Korea, and a few other countries. In 2020, the European Medicine Agency issued a warning that high doses of cyproterone acetate may contribute to risk of meningioma, and recommended physicians use alternative treatment for most indications (or the minimum effective dose where no alternatives were available) with the exception of prostate carcinoma. === Birth control === CPA is used with ethinylestradiol as a combined birth control pill to prevent pregnancy. This birth control combination has been available since 1978. The formulation is taken once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day free interval. CPA has also been available in combination with estradiol valerate (brand name Femilar) as a combined birth control pill in Finland since 1993. High-dose CPA tablets have a contraceptive effect and can be used as a form of birth control, although they are not specifically licensed as such. === Skin and hair conditions === ==== Females ==== CPA is used as an antiandrogen to treat androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), scalp hair loss, and hidradenitis suppurativa in women. These conditions are worsened by the presence of androgens, and by suppressing androgen levels and blocking their actions, CPA improves the symptoms of these conditions. CPA is used to treat such conditions both at low doses as a birth control pill and on its own at higher doses. A birth control pill containing low-dose CPA in combination with ethinylestradiol to treat acne has been found to result in overall improvement in 75 to 90% of women, with responses approaching 100% improvement. High-dose CPA alone likewise has been found to improve symptoms of acne by 75 to 90% in women. Discontinuation of CPA has been found to result in marked recurrence of symptoms in up to 70% of women. CPA is one of the most commonly used medications in the treatment of hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary syndrome in women throughout the world. Higher dosages of CPA are used in combination with an estrogen specifically at doses of 25 to 100 mg/day cyclically in the treatment of hirsutism in women. The efficacy of such dosages of CPA in the treatment of hirsutism in women appear to be similar to that of spironolactone, flutamide, and finasteride. Randomized controlled trials have found that higher dosages of CPA (e.g., 20 mg/day or 100 mg/day) added cyclically to a birth control pill containing ethinylestradiol and 2 mg/day CPA were no more effective or only marginally more effective in the treatment of severe hirsutism in women than the birth control pill alone. Maintenance therapy with lower doses of CPA, such as 25 mg/day, has been found to be effective in preventing relapse of symptoms of hirsutism. CPA has typically been combined with ethinylestradiol, but it can alternatively be used in combination with hormone replacement therapy dosages of estradiol instead. CPA at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with 100 μg/day transdermal estradiol patches has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism similarly to the combination of CPA with ethinylestradiol. The efficacy of the combination of an estrogen and CPA in the treatment of hirsutism in women appears to be due to marked suppression of total and free androgen levels as well as additional blockade of the androgen receptor. ==== Males ==== CPA has been found to be effective in the treatment of acne in males, with marked improvement in symptoms observed at dosages of 25, 50, and 100 mg/day in different studies. It can also halt further progression of scalp hair loss in men. Increased head hair and decreased body hair has been observed with CPA in men with scalp hair loss. However, its side effects in men, such as demasculinization, gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, bone density loss, and reversible infertility, make the use of CPA in males impractical in most cases. In addition, lower dosages of CPA, such as 25 mg/day, have been found to be better-tolerated in men. But such doses also show lower effectiveness in the treatment of acne in men. === High androgen levels === CPA is used as an antiandrogen to treat high androgen levels and associated symptoms such as masculinization due to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in women. It is almost always combined with an estrogen, such as ethinylestradiol, when it is used in the treatment of PCOS in women. === Menopausal hormone therapy === CPA is used at low doses in menopausal hormone therapy in combination with an estrogen to provide endometrial protection and treat menopausal symptoms. It is used in menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name Climen, which is a sequential preparation that contains 2 mg estradiol valerate and 1 mg CPA. Climen was the first product for use in menopausal hormone therapy containing CPA to be marketed. It is available in more than 40 countries. === Transgender hormone therapy === CPA is widely used as an antiandrogen and progestogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender individuals. It has been historically used orally at a dosage of 10 to 100 mg/day and by intramuscular injection at a dosage of 300 mg once every 4 weeks. Many transgender individuals seeking feminizing hormone therapy have breast growth as one of the goals for undergoing feminizing hormone therapy, making this particular side effect of CPA generally viewed as a beneficial outcome rather than an issue. Studies have found that 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/day CPA in combination with estrogen all result in equivalent and full testosterone suppression in transgender women. In light of risks of CPA such as fatigue, blood clots, benign brain tumors, and liver damage, the use of lower dosages of CPA may help to minimize such risks. As a result, a CPA dosage of 10 mg/day and no greater is now recommended by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 (SOC8). CPA has an advantage over spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender people, as the combination of estrogen and CPA consistently suppresses testosterone levels into the normal female range whereas estrogen with spironolactone does not. Spironolactone is the most widely used antiandrogen in transgender women in the United States, whereas CPA is widely used in Europe and throughout the rest of the world. Aside from adult transgender people, CPA has also been used as a puberty blocker and hence as an antiandrogen and antiestrogen to suppress puberty in transgender adolescents, although GnRH modulators are primarily used and more effective for this purpose. === Prostate cancer === CPA is used as an antiandrogen monotherapy and means of androgen deprivation therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. It is used at very high doses by mouth or by intramuscular injection to treat this disease. Antiandrogens do not cure prostate cancer, but can significantly extend life in men with the disease. CPA has similar effectiveness to GnRH modulators and surgical castration, high-dose estrogen therapy (e.g., with diethylstilbestrol), and high-dose nonsteroidal antiandrogen monotherapy (e.g., with bicalutamide), but has significantly inferior effectiveness to combined androgen blockade with a GnRH modulator and a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (e.g., with bicalutamide or enzalutamide). In addition, the combination of CPA with a GnRH modulator or surgical castration has not been found to improve outcomes relative to a GnRH modulator or surgical castration alone, in contrast to nonsteroidal antiandrogens. Due to its inferior effectiveness, tolerability, and safety, CPA is rarely used in the treatment of prostate cancer today, having largely been superseded by GnRH modulators and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. CPA is the only steroidal antiandrogen that continues to be used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Dose-ranging studies of CPA for prostate cancer were not performed, and the optimal dosage of CPA for the treatment of the condition has not been established. A dosage range of oral CPA of 100 to 300 mg/day is used in the treatment of prostate cancer, but generally 150 to 200 mg/day oral CPA is used. Schröder (1993, 2002) reviewed the issue of CPA dosage and recommended a dosage of 200 to 300 mg/day for CPA as a monotherapy and a dosage of 100 to 200 mg/day for CPA in combined androgen blockade (that is, CPA in combination with surgical or medical castration). However, the combination of CPA with castration for prostate cancer has been found to significantly decrease overall survival compared to castration alone. Hence, the use of CPA as the antiandrogen component in combined androgen blockade would appear not to be advisable. When used by intramuscular injection to treat prostate cancer, CPA is used at a dosage of 300 mg once a week. The combination of CPA with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol sulfonate or low-dose diethylstilbestrol has been used as a form of combined androgen blockade and as an alternative to the combination of CPA with surgical or medical castration. === Sexual deviance === CPA is used as an antiandrogen and form of chemical castration in the treatment of paraphilias and hypersexuality in men. It is used to treat sex offenders. The medication is approved in more than 20 countries for this indication and is predominantly employed in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. CPA works by decreasing sex drive and sexual arousal and producing sexual dysfunction. CPA can also be used to reduce sex drive in individuals with inappropriate sexual behaviors, such as people with intellectual disability and dementia. The medication is also used to reduce sexual behavior diagnosed as self-harmful, such as masochism. CPA has comparable effectiveness to medroxyprogesterone acetate in suppressing sexual urges and function but appears to be less effective than GnRH modulators like leuprorelin and has more side effects. High-dose CPA significantly decreases sexual fantasies and sexual activity in 80 to 90% of men with paraphilias. In addition, it has been found to decrease the rate of reoffending in sex offenders from 85% to 6%, with most of the reoffenses being committed by individuals who did not follow their CPA treatment prescription. It has been reported that in 80% of cases, 100 mg/day CPA is adequate to achieve the desired reduction of sexuality, whereas in the remaining 20% of cases, 200 mg/day is sufficient. When only a partial reduction in sexuality is desired, 50 mg/day CPA can be useful. Reduced sexual desire and erectile function occurs with CPA by the end of the first week of treatment, and becomes maximal within three to four weeks. The dosage range is 50 to 300 mg/day. === Early puberty === CPA is used as an antiandrogen and antiestrogen to treat precocious puberty in boys and girls. However, it is not fully satisfactory for this indication because it is not able to completely suppress puberty. It does not suppress skeletal maturation enough to avoid a reduction in height at adulthood. For this reason, CPA has mostly been superseded by GnRH agonists in the treatment of precocious puberty. CPA is not satisfactory for gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty. CPA has been used at dosages of 50 to 300 mg/m2 to treat precocious puberty. === Other uses === CPA is useful in the treatment of hot flashes, for instance due to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. CPA is useful for suppressing the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy. It has been used successfully both alone and in combination with estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol for this purpose. === Available forms === CPA is available in the form of oral tablets alone (higher-dose; 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg) or in combination with ethinylestradiol or estradiol valerate (low-dose; 1 or 2 mg CPA) and in the form of ampoules for intramuscular injection (higher-dose; 100 mg/mL, 300 mg/3 mL; brand name Androcur Depot). The higher-dose formulations are used to treat prostate cancer and certain other androgen-related indications while the low-dose formulations which also have an estrogen are used as combined birth control pills and are used in menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. == Contraindications == Contraindications of CPA include: Hypersensitivity to CPA or any of the other components of the medication Pregnancy, lactation, and breastfeeding Puberty (except if being used to treat precocious puberty or delay puberty) Liver diseases and liver dysfunction Chronic kidney disease Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome History of jaundice or persistent pruritus during pregnancy History of herpes during pregnancy Previous or existing liver tumors (only if not due to metastases from prostate cancer) Previous or existing meningioma, hyperprolactinemia, or prolactinoma Wasting syndromes (except in inoperable prostate cancer) Severe depression Previous or existing thromboembolic processes, as well as stroke and myocardial infarction Severe diabetes with vascular changes Sickle-cell anemia When CPA is used in combination with an estrogen, contraindications for birth control pills should also be considered. == Side effects == CPA is generally well-tolerated and has a mild side-effect profile regardless of dosage when it is used in combination with an estrogen in women. Side effects of CPA in general include hypogonadism (low sex-hormone levels) and associated symptoms such as demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and osteoporosis (fragile bones); breast changes such as breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and gynecomastia (breasts in men); emotional changes such as fatigue and depression; and other side effects such as vitamin B12 deficiency, weak glucocorticoid effects, and elevated liver enzymes. Weight gain can occur with CPA when it is used at high doses. Some of the side effects of CPA can be improved or fully prevented if it is combined with an estrogen to prevent estrogen deficiency. Few quantitative data are available on many of the potential side effects of CPA. Pooled tolerability data for CPA is not available in the literature. Cyproterone is also known to suppress adrenocortical function. At very high doses in aged men with prostate cancer, CPA can cause cardiovascular side effects. Rarely, CPA can produce blood clots, liver toxicity (including hepatitis, liver failure, and liver cancer), excessively high prolactin levels, and certain benign brain tumors including meningiomas (tumors of the meninges) and prolactinomas (prolactin-secreting tumors of the pituitary gland). Upon discontinuation from high doses, CPA can produce adrenal insufficiency as a withdrawal effect. == Overdose == CPA is relatively safe in acute overdose. It is used at very high doses of up to 300 mg/day by mouth and 700 mg per week by intramuscular injection. For comparison, the dose of CPA used in birth control pills is 2 mg/day. There have been no deaths associated with CPA overdose. There are no specific antidotes for CPA overdose, and treatment should be symptom-based. Gastric lavage can be used in the event of oral overdose within the last 2 to 3 hours. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 may interact with CPA. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, and ritonavir, while examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers include rifampicin, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort. Certain anticonvulsant medications can substantially reduce levels of CPA, by as much as 8-fold. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === CPA has antiandrogenic activity, progestogenic activity, weak partial glucocorticoid activity, weak steroidogenesis inhibitor activity, and agonist activity at the pregnane X receptor. It has no estrogenic or antimineralocorticoid activity. In terms of potency, CPA is described as a highly potent progestogen, a moderately potent antiandrogen, and a weak glucocorticoid. Due to its progestogenic activity, CPA has antigonadotropic effects, and is able to suppress fertility and sex-hormone levels in both males and females. === Pharmacokinetics === CPA can be taken by mouth or by injection into muscle. It has near-complete oral bioavailability, is highly and exclusively bound to albumin in terms of plasma protein binding, is metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation and conjugation, has 15β-hydroxycyproterone acetate (15β-OH-CPA) as a single major active metabolite, has a long elimination half-life of about 2 to 4 days regardless of route of administration, and is excreted in feces primarily and to a lesser extent in urine. == Chemistry == CPA, also known as 1α,2α-methylene-6-chloro-17α-acetoxy-δ6-progesterone or as 1α,2α-methylene-6-chloro-17α-hydroxypregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione acetate, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and an acetylated derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is structurally related to other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of CPA have been published. The following is one such synthesis: The dehydrogenation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate [302-23-8] (1) with chloranil (tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone) gives a compound that has been called melengestrol acetate [425-51-4] (2). Dehydrogenation with selenium dioxide gives 17-acetoxy-1,4,6-pregnatriene-3,20-dione [2668-75-9] (3). Reacting this with diazomethane results in a 1,3-dipolar addition reaction at C1–C2 of the double bond of the steroid system, which forms a derivative of dihydropyrazole, CID:134990386 (4). This compound cleaves when reacted with perchloric acid, releasing nitrogen molecules and forming a cyclopropane derivative, 6-deschloro cyproterone acetate [2701-50-0] (5). Selective oxidation of the C6=C7 olefin with benzoyl peroxide gives the epoxide, i.e. 6-deschloro-6,7-epoxy cyproterone [15423-97-9] (6). The penultimate step involves a reaction with hydrochloric acid in acetic acid, resulting in the formation of chlorine and its subsequent dehydration, and a simultaneous opening of the cyclopropane ring giving 1α-(chloromethyl) chlormadinone acetate [17183-98-1] (7). The heating of this in collidine reforms the cyclopropane ring, completing the synthesis of CPA (8). == History == CPA was first synthesized in 1961 by Rudolf Wiechert, a Schering employee, and together with Friedmund Neumann in Berlin, they filed for a patent for CPA as ""progestational agent"" in 1962. The antiandrogenic activity of CPA was discovered serendipitously by Hamada, Neumann, and Karl Junkmann in 1963. Along with the steroidal antiandrogens benorterone (17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone; SKF-7690), cyproterone, BOMT (Ro 7–2340), and trimethyltrienolone (R-2956) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and DIMP (Ro 7–8117), CPA was one of the first antiandrogens to be discovered and researched. CPA was initially developed as a progestogen for the prevention of threatened abortion. As part of its development, it was assessed for androgenic activity to ensure that it would not produce teratogenic effects in female fetuses. The drug was administered to pregnant rats and its effects on the rat fetuses were studied. To the surprise of the researchers, all of the rat pups born appeared to be female. After 20 female rat pups in a row had been counted, it was clear that this could not be a chance occurrence. The rat pups were further evaluated and it was found that, in terms of karyotype, about 50% were actually males. The male rat pups had been feminized, and this resultant finding constituted the discovery of the powerful antiandrogenic activity of CPA. A year after patent approval in 1965, Neumann published additional evidence of CPA's antiandrogenic effect in rats; he reported an ""organizational effect of CPA on the brain"". CPA started being used in animal experiments around the world to investigate how antiandrogens affected fetal sexual differentiation. The first clinical use of CPA in the treatment of sexual deviance and prostate cancer occurred in 1966. It was first studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair symptoms, specifically acne, hirsutism, seborrhea, and scalp hair loss, in 1969. CPA was first approved for medical use in 1973 in Europe under the brand name Androcur. In 1977, a formulation of CPA was introduced for use by intramuscular injection. CPA was first marketed as a birth control pill in 1978 in combination with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Diane. Following phase III clinical trials, CPA was approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in Germany in 1980. CPA became available in Canada as Androcur in 1987, as Androcur Depot in 1990, and as Diane-35 in 1998. Conversely, CPA was never introduced in any form in the United States. This was reportedly due to concerns about breast tumors observed with high-dose pregnane progestogens in beagle dogs as well as concerns about potential teratogenicity in pregnant women. Use of CPA in transgender women, an off-label indication, was reported as early as 1977. The use of CPA in transgender women was well-established by the early 1990s. The history of CPA, including its discovery, development, and marketing, has been reviewed. == Society and culture == === Generic names === The English and generic name of CPA is cyproterone acetate and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. The English and generic name of unacetylated cyproterone is cyproterone and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while cyprotérone is the DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and French name and ciproterone is the DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana and Italian name. The name of unesterified cyproterone in Latin is cyproteronum, in German is cyproteron, and in Spanish is ciproterona. These names of cyproterone correspond for CPA to acétate de cyprotérone in French, acetato de ciproterona in Spanish, ciproterone acetato in Italian, cyproteronacetat in German, siproteron asetat in Turkish, and cyproteronacetaat in Dutch. CPA is also known by the developmental code names SH-80714 and SH-714, while unacetylated cyproterone is known by the developmental code names SH-80881 and SH-881. === Brand names === CPA is marketed under brand names including Androcur, Androcur Depot, Androcur-100, Androstat, Asoteron, Cyprone, Cyproplex, Cyprostat, Cysaxal, Imvel, and Siterone. When CPA is formulated in combination with ethinylestradiol, it is also known as co-cyprindiol, and brand names for this formulation include Andro-Diane, Bella HEXAL 35, Chloe, Cypretil, Cypretyl, Cyproderm, Diane, Diane Mite, Diane-35, Dianette, Dixi 35, Drina, Elleacnelle, Estelle, Estelle-35, Ginette, Linface, Minerva, Vreya, and Zyrona. CPA is also marketed in combination with estradiol valerate as Climen, Climene, Elamax, and Femilar. === Availability === CPA is widely available throughout the world, and is marketed in almost every developed country, with the notable major exceptions of the United States and Japan. In almost all countries in which CPA is marketed, it is available both alone and in combination with an estrogen in birth control pills. CPA is marketed widely in combination with both ethinylestradiol and estradiol valerate. CPA-containing birth control pills are available in South Korea, but CPA as a standalone medication is not marketed in this country. In Japan and South Korea, the closely related antiandrogen and progestin chlormadinone acetate, as well as other medications, are used instead of CPA. Specific places in which CPA is marketed include the United Kingdom, elsewhere throughout Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, and Asia. CPA is not marketed in most of Africa and the Middle East. It has been said that the lack of availability of CPA in the United States explains why there are relatively few studies of it in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as hyperandrogenism and hirsutism in women. === Generation === Progestins in birth control pills are sometimes grouped by generation. While the 19-nortestosterone progestins are consistently grouped into generations, the pregnane progestins that are or have been used in birth control pills are typically omitted from such classifications or are grouped simply as ""miscellaneous"" or ""pregnanes"". In any case, CPA has been described as a ""first-generation"" progestin similarly to closely related progestins like chlormadinone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. == Research == CPA has been studied and used in combination with low-dose diethylstilbestrol in the treatment of prostate cancer. The combination results in suppression of testosterone levels into the castrate range, which normally cannot be achieved with CPA alone. CPA has been studied as a form of androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate). The medication has been studied in the treatment of breast cancer as well. CPA has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive both alone and in combination with testosterone in men. CPA was under development by Barr Pharmaceuticals in the 2000s for the treatment of hot flashes in prostate cancer patients in the United States. It reached phase III clinical trials for this indication and had the tentative brand name CyPat but development was ultimately discontinued in 2008. CPA is not satisfactorily effective as topical antiandrogen, for instance in the treatment of acne. CPA has been used to treat estrogen hypersensitivity vulvovaginitis in women. CPA has been investigated for use in reducing aggression and self-injurious behavior via its antiandrogenic effects in conditions like autism spectrum disorders, dementias like Alzheimer's disease, and psychosis. CPA may be effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). CPA has been studied in the treatment of cluster headaches in men. == See also == Estradiol valerate/cyproterone acetate Ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate == References == == Further reading == == External links == Die Geschichte des Wirkstoffs Cyproteronazetat: Von der ""Pille für den Mann"" zum ""Hautpflegemittel mit Empfängnisschutz"" [The History of Cyproterone Acetate: From the ""Pill for Men"" to the ""Skin Care Product and Contraceptive""] - Arznei-Telegramm (in German) [Google Translate]",Cyproterone acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5298504119273275e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002481597475707531)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyproterone_acetate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Cyproterone acetate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyproterone_acetate?utm_source=openai')])"

197,"('Lubiprostone', 'Ru 0211', 'Prostan-1-oic acid, 16,16-difluoro-11-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-, (11a)-', 'Prostan-1-oic acid, 16,16-difluoro-11-hydroxy-9,15-dioxo-, (11alpha)-', 'S1675')",Medical,"Lubiprostone, sold under the brand name Amitiza among others, is a medication used in the management of chronic idiopathic constipation, predominantly irritable bowel syndrome-associated constipation in women and opioid-induced constipation. The drug is owned by Mallinckrodt and is marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. The drug was developed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006. It was recommended for use in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in July 2014. Health Canada approved the drug in 2015. Lubiprostone received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), and in 2013, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic noncancer pain. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Lubiprostone is a laxative used for the treatment of constipation, specifically: Chronic idiopathic constipation (difficult or infrequent passage of stools that lasts for 3 months or longer and is not caused by diet, disease, or drugs). Constipation caused by certain opioid (narcotic) pain medications in people with chronic (ongoing), noncancer pain, or in patients with long-lasting pain caused by a previous cancer or its treatment who do not need weekly increases in opioid dosage. The effectiveness of lubiprostone has not been established in patients who are taking a diphenylheptane opioid (e.g., methadone). Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C; a condition that causes stomach pain or cramps, bloating, and infrequent or difficult passage of stools) in women who are at least 18 years of age. Lubiprostone has not been studied in children. There is current research under way to determine the safety and efficacy in postoperative bowel dysfunction. It comes in a liquid filled capsule and is available only with a doctor's prescription. If one misses a dose it should be taken as soon as possible unless it is almost time for the next dose, in which case it should be skipped and the user should return to their regular dosing schedule. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials, the most common adverse event was nausea (31%). Other adverse events (≥5% of patients) included diarrhea (13%), headache (13%), abdominal distension (5%), abdominal pain (5%), flatulence (6%), sinusitis (5%), vomiting (5%), and fecal incontinence (1%). The FDA lists the following: For subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation taking Amitiza: Nausea ~ 29% (4% were severe, and 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to nausea. The rate of nausea was lower among male (8%) and elderly (19%) patients. No patients in the clinical studies were hospitalized due to nausea.) Diarrhea: ~12% (2% were severe, and 2% of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea) Several less common adverse reactions (<1%). For opioid-induced constipation: Nausea: ~ 11%; 1% severe nausea and 2% discontinued treatment due to nausea. Diarrhea: ~ 8%; 2% severe diarrhea and 1% of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea. Less common adverse reactions (<1%): fecal incontinence, blood potassium decreased. For subjects with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation: Nausea: ~ 8%; 1% severe nausea and 1% discontinued treatment due to nausea. Diarrhea: ~ 7%; <1% of patients had severe diarrhea and <1% of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea. Less common adverse reactions: <1% A 2018 pooled analysis from three phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on usage for Opioid-Induced Constipation, found that the numbers of patients reporting adverse effects were similar in both the lubiprostone and placebo treatment groups for all opioid classes (P ≥ 0.125); however, gastrointestinal adverse effects were reported more frequently by those receiving lubiprostone than 2 of the 3 opioid groups. The most commonly reported TEAEs in the lubiprostone treatment groups were nausea (13.4%–18.1%), diarrhea (1.2%–13.9%), and abdominal pain (4.7%–5.6%). In the population overall, the greatest likelihood of experiencing the first episode of any of these three TEAEs was greatest in the first week of treatment and decreased thereafter. According to Medscape, the most common (>10%) were: Nausea, Diarrhea (7-12%), Headache (2-11%). Less common side effects (1-10%) included: Abdominal pain (4-8%), Abdominal distension (3-6%), Flatulence (4-6%), Vomiting (3%), Loose stools (3%), Edema (1-3%), Abdominal discomfort (1-3%), Dizziness (3%), Chest discomfort/pain (2%), Dyspnea (2%), Dyspepsia (2%), Fatigue (2%), Dry mouth (1%). === Contraindications === Known or suspected mechanical GI obstruction. Known hypersensitivity to lubiprostone or any ingredient in the formulation. The effects on pregnancy have not been studied in humans, but testing in guinea pigs resulted in fetal loss. Lubiprostone is contraindicated in people exhibiting chronic diarrhea, bowel obstruction, or diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. == Mechanism of action == Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid derived from prostaglandin E1 that acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements. == Pharmacokinetics == Unlike many laxative products, lubiprostone does not show signs of drug tolerance, chemical dependency, or altered serum electrolyte concentration. Minimal distribution of the drug occurs beyond the immediate gastrointestinal tissues. Lubiprostone is rapidly metabolized by reduction/oxidation, mediated by carbonyl reductase. There is no metabolic involvement of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. The measurable metabolite, M3, exists in very low levels in plasma and makes up less than 10% of the total administered dose. Data indicate that metabolism occurs locally in the stomach and jejunum. == Society and culture == === Economics === The cost to the NHS was £29.68 per 24 mcg 28-cap pack as of April 2017. === Brand names === Lubiprostone is available in the United States, Japan, Switzerland, India, Bangladesh, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In Bangladesh and India, lubiprostone is sold under the brand name Lubigut by Ziska Pharmaceuticals, Lubilax by Beacon Pharmaceuticals, and under the brand name Lubowel by Sun Pharmaceutical. == References ==",Lubiprostone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.318072337307967e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.798523387871683e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubiprostone,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a607034.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/lubiprostone.html ', [])"

Kainate induced > 90% cell death (EC50 65 microM) and (S)-AMPA only about 50% cell death (EC50 3.1 microM), both in a monophasic dose-dependent manner. (S)-5-Fluorowillardiine also killed > 90% of neurones, however, in a biphasic dose-dependent manner (EC50 0.70 and 170 microM). Additionally, the neurotoxic effects of (S)-AMPA and (S)-5-fluorowillardiine (high-affinity component) were attenuated by the AMPA receptor antagonists LY293558 ((3,S,4aR, 6R,8aR)-6[2h91 H-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinol ine- 3-carboxylic acid). A component of kainate and (S)-5-fluorowillardiine (low-affinity component) neurotoxicity was blocked by the low-affinity kainate receptor antagonist NS-102 (5-nitro-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrobenzo[g]indole-2,3-dione-3-oxime). We have shown that both kainate and (S)-AMPA can effect substantial cell death in cortical neurones and that the novel agonist (S)-5-fluorowillardiine exerts its excitotoxicity through both AMPA- and kainate-preferring receptors. AMPA receptors can be labeled using the agonist radioligands [3H](R,S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid ([3H](R,S)-AMPA), [3H](S)-AMPA or [3H](S)-5-fluorowillardiine. In the presence of KSCN, [3H](R,S)-AMPA and [3H](S)-AMPA bind to a single population of sites in rat brain membranes, whereas [3H](S)-5-fluorowillardiine binds with two affinity components. KSCN increased the affinity of the low affinity [3H](S)-5-fluorowillardiine component > 4-fold and increased the density of both components 1.5-1.7-fold, arguing against KSCN-induced interconversion of low to high affinity states. KSCN, which promotes receptor desensitization, increased the potency of AMPA isomers, (S)-5-fluorowillardiine, quisqualate and cyclothiazide for inhibition of [3H](S)-5-fluorowillardiine binding suggesting that these ligands discriminate desensitized and nondesensitized receptors. In contrast, KSCN did not greatly affect the potency of glutamate, kainate, or competitive antagonists suggesting that these ligands do not discriminate desensitized and nondesensitized receptors. In the presence of KSCN, the rank order potency for agonists and antagonists was similar or identical in all assays indicating that the three radioligands bind identical glutamate recognition sites, a conclusion supported by their identical total receptor density. However, AMPA isomers displayed 6-10-fold higher potency for displacement of [3H](S)- or (R,S)-AMPA relative to [3H](S)-5-fluorowillardiine binding. This finding, coupled with the marked two component binding by [3H](S)-5-fluorowillardiine but not [3H](S)- or (R,S)-AMPA, suggests qualitative differences between the interaction of these ligands with the agonist recognition site.",(s)-5-fluorowillardiine,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0004585518909152597)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3914600610733032), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002041757572442293)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.320199877838604e-07)])","('INFO; ', [])"
199,"('Diclofenac', 'Diclofenac acid', 'Dichlofenac', 'Diclofenacum', 'Diclophenac')",Medical,"Diclofenac, sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout. It can be taken orally (swallowed by mouth), inserted rectally as a suppository, injected intramuscularly, injected intravenously, applied to the skin topically, or through eye drops. Improvements in pain last up to eight hours. It is also available as the fixed-dose combination diclofenac/misoprostol (Arthrotec) to help protect the stomach; however, proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole are typically first-line since they are at least as effective as misoprostol, but with better tolerability. Common side effects include abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling. Serious side effects may include heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach ulceration. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. Diclofenac is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandins, like other drugs in this class. In 2022, it was the 51st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions. It is available as its acid or in two salts, as either diclofenac sodium or potassium. == Medical uses == Diclofenac is used to treat pain related to arthritis, dysmenorrhea, rheumatic diseases and other inflammatory disorders, kidney stones and gallstones. An additional indication is the treatment of acute migraines. Diclofenac is used to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present. Diclofenac ophthalmic is indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in people who have undergone cataract extraction and for the temporary relief of pain and photophobia in people undergoing corneal refractive surgery. Diclofenac is also available in topical forms and is useful for osteoarthritis but not other types of long-term musculoskeletal pain. Diclofenac may also help with actinic keratosis and with acute pain caused by minor strains, sprains and contusions. In many countries, eye drops are sold to treat acute and chronic nonbacterial inflammation of the anterior part of the eyes (such as postoperative states). The eye drops have also been used to manage pain for traumatic corneal abrasion. Diclofenac is often used to treat chronic pain associated with cancer, especially if inflammation is present. == Contraindications == Diclofenac is contraindicated for pregnant women; for people with active stomach and/or duodenal ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding; and for people undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. == Adverse effects == Diclofenac consumption has been associated with significantly increased vascular and coronary risk in a study including coxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen. Upper gastrointestinal complications were also reported. Major adverse cardiovascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death is increased significantly by diclofenac. In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescription label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in fetuses that result in low amniotic fluid. === Heart === In 2013, a study found major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 people allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased by diclofenac (1·65). Following the identification of increased risks of heart attacks with the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib in 2004, attention has focused on all the other members of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug group, including diclofenac. Research results are mixed, with a meta-analysis of papers and reports up to April 2006 suggesting a relative increased rate of heart disease of 1.63 compared to nonusers. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation said, ""However, the increased risk is small, and many patients with chronic debilitating pain may well feel that this small risk is worth taking to relieve their symptoms"". Only aspirin was found not to increase the risk of heart disease; however, this is known to have a higher rate of gastric ulceration than diclofenac. As of January 2015, the MHRA announced that diclofenac would be reclassified as a prescription-only medicine (POM) due to the risk of cardiovascular adverse events. A subsequent large study of 74,838 Danish users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or coxibs found no additional cardiovascular risk from diclofenac use. A very large study of 1,028,437 Danish users of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or coxibs found the ""Use of the nonselective NSAID diclofenac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.42; and odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.59, respectively), with a dose-dependent increase in risk."" Diclofenac is similar in COX-2 selectivity to celecoxib. === Gastrointestinal === Gastrointestinal complaints are most often noted. Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment (misoprostol, ranitidine, or omeprazole). === Liver === Liver damage occurs infrequently, and is usually reversible. Hepatitis may occur rarely without any warning symptoms and may be fatal. Patients with osteoarthritis more often develop symptomatic liver disease than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. If used for the short-term treatment of pain or fever, diclofenac has not been found more hepatotoxic than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As of December 2009, Endo, Novartis, and the US FDA notified healthcare professionals to add new warnings and precautions about the potential for elevation in liver function tests during treatment with all products containing diclofenac sodium. Cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. === Kidney === Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ""are associated with adverse renal [kidney] effects caused by the reduction in synthesis of renal prostaglandins"" in sensitive persons or animal species, and potentially during long-term use in nonsensitive persons if resistance to side effects decreases with age. However, this side effect cannot be avoided merely by using a COX-2 selective inhibitor because, ""Both isoforms of COX, COX-1, and COX-2, are expressed in the kidney... === Mental health === Mental health side effects have been reported. These symptoms are rare but exist in significant enough numbers to include as potential side effects. These include depression, anxiety, irritability, nightmares, and psychotic reactions. == Pharmacology == As with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the primary mechanism responsible for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic action is thought to be inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis through COX-inhibition. The main target in the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis appears to be the transiently expressed prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGES-2), also known as cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2). That is, diclofenac is partially selective for COX-2. The reported selectivity for COX-2 varies from 1.5 to 30 depending on the source. The drug may be bacteriostatic via inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis. Diclofenac has a relatively high lipid solubility, making it one of the few nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are able to enter the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier. As in the rest of the body, it is thought to exert its effect in the brain through inhibition of COX-2. In addition, it may have effects inside the spinal cord. Diclofenac may be a unique member of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in other aspects. Some evidence indicates it inhibits the lipoxygenase pathways, thus reducing the formation of leukotrienes (also pro-inflammatory autacoids). It also may inhibit phospholipase A2, which may be relevant to its mechanism of action. These additional actions may explain its high potency – it is the most potent NSAID on a broad basis. Marked differences exist among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in their selective inhibition of the two subtypes of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, and COX-2. Drug developers have focused on selective COX-2 inhibition, particularly as a way to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In practice, the use of some COX-2 inhibitors with their adverse effects has led to massive numbers of lawsuits alleging wrongful death by heart attack, yet other significantly COX-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as diclofenac, have been well tolerated by most of the population. Besides the COX-inhibition, several other molecular targets of diclofenac possibly contributing to its pain-relieving actions have recently been identified. These include: Blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels (after activation of the channel, diclofenac inhibits its reactivation, also known as phase inhibition) Blockage of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) Positive allosteric modulation of KCNQ- and BK-potassium channels (diclofenac opens these channels, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane) The duration of action (i.e., duration of pain relief) of a single dose is longer (6 to 8 h) than the drug's 1.2–2 h half-life. This could be partly because it persists for over 11 hours in synovial fluids. == History == Diclofenac was first synthesized by Alfred Sallmann and Rudolf Pfister in 1973. The name ""diclofenac"" derives from its chemical name: 2-(2,6-dichloranilino) phenylacetic acid. It was patented in Germany in 1978 by Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis). It came into medical use in the United States in 1988. GlaxoSmithKline purchased the rights in 2015. It is available as a generic medication. == Society and culture == === Formulations and brand names === Diclofenac formulations are available worldwide under many different brand names. Voltaren and Voltarol contain the sodium salt of diclofenac. In the United Kingdom, Voltarol can be supplied with either the sodium salt or the potassium salt, while Cataflam, sold in some other countries, is the potassium salt only. However, Voltarol Emulgel contains diclofenac diethylammonium 1.16%, being equivalent to 1% sodium salt. In 2016, Voltarol was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £39.3 million. In the United States, 1% diclofenac gel was approved by the FDA in 2007 as a prescription drug for the temporary relief of the pain of osteoarthritis of joints in the hands, knees, and feet. In 2020, the FDA approved the gel formulation for nonprescription use. In January 2015, diclofenac oral preparations were reclassified as prescription-only medicines in the UK. The topical preparations are available without a prescription. === Ecological effects === Use of diclofenac for animals is controversial due to toxicity when eaten by scavenging birds that eat dead animals; the medication has been banned for veterinary use in several countries. Use of diclofenac in animals has been reported to have led to a sharp decline in the vulture population in the Indian subcontinent – a 95% decline by 2003 and a 99.9% decline by 2008. The mechanism is presumed to be kidney failure; however, toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures. Vultures eat the carcasses of livestock that have been administered veterinary diclofenac, and are poisoned by the accumulated chemical, as vultures do not have a particular enzyme to break down diclofenac. At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March 2005, the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of diclofenac. Meloxicam is a safer alternative to replace use of diclofenac. It is more expensive than diclofenac, but the cost is dropping as more pharmaceutical companies are beginning to manufacture it. Steppe eagles have the same vulnerability to diclofenac as Old World vultures and are therefore at a similar risk from its effects. Diclofenac has been shown also to harm freshwater fish species such as rainbow trout. In contrast, New World vultures, such as the turkey vulture, can tolerate at least 100 times the level of diclofenac that is lethal to Gyps species. ""The loss of tens of millions of vultures over the last decade has had major ecological consequences across the Indian subcontinent that pose a potential threat to human health. In many places, populations of feral dogs have increased sharply from the disappearance of Gyps vultures as the main scavenger of wild and domestic ungulate carcasses. Associated with the rise in dog numbers is an increased risk of rabies"" and casualties of almost 50,000 people. The Government of India cites this as one of the major consequences of a vulture species extinction. A major shift in the transfer of corpse pathogens from vultures to feral dogs and rats could lead to a disease pandemic, causing millions of deaths in a crowded country like India, whereas vultures' digestive systems safely destroy many species of such pathogens. Vultures are long-lived and slow to breed. They start breeding only at the age of six and only 50% of their young survive. Even if the government ban is fully implemented, it will take many years to revive the vulture population. The loss of vultures has had a social impact on the Indian Zoroastrian Parsi community, who traditionally use vultures to dispose of human corpses in Towers of Silence, but are now compelled to seek alternative methods of disposal. Despite the vulture crisis, diclofenac remains available in other countries including many in Europe. It was controversially approved for veterinary use in Spain in 2013 and continues to be available, despite Spain being home to around 90% of the European vulture population and an independent simulation showing that the drug could reduce the population of vultures by 1–8% annually. Spain's medicine agency presented simulations suggesting that the number of deaths would be quite small. A paper published in 2021 identified the first authenticated death of a vulture from diclofenac in Spain, a cinereous vulture. Diclofenac is on the European Union's watch list because it pollutes the Baltic Sea. When the substance enters freshwater, it has an environmental impact and is considered more difficult to remove in wastewater treatment plants than, for example, ibuprofen. Harmful residues have been found in blue mussels and fish, among others, where it has been found to cause damage to internal organs such as the gills, kidneys and liver. == Veterinary use == Diclofenac is used for livestock; such use was responsible for the Indian vulture crisis, during which in a few years 95% of the country's vulture population was killed, and in many countries, agricultural use is now forbidden. Diclofenac is approved as a veterinary medication in some countries for the treatment of pets as well as in livestock. In some species of birds, diclofenac causes accumulation of uric acid crystals in internal organs—especially the liver and kidneys—resulting in visceral gout, as well as cellular damage and necrosis. In South Asia in the 2000s, vulture populations were decimated after feeding on carcasses of livestock that had been treated with diclofenac. == References == == External links ==",Diclofenacum,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.960446742392378e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000916537712328136)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([zellbio.eu](https://zellbio.eu/product/diclofenac/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=9, title='Diclofenac - ZellBio GmbH', type='url_citation', url='https://zellbio.eu/product/diclofenac/?utm_source=openai')])"
