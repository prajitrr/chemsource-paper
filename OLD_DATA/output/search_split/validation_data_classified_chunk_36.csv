3567,"('Glyphosate', 'N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine', 'N-phosphonomethyl-glycine', 'Roundup', 'Glyphosphate')",Medical,"Glyphosate (IUPAC name: N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide and crop desiccant. It is an organophosphorus compound, specifically a phosphonate, which acts by inhibiting the plant enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP). Glyphosate-based herbicides are used to kill weeds, especially annual broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with crops. Monsanto brought it to market for agricultural use in 1974 under the trade name Roundup. Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent expired in 2000. Farmers quickly adopted glyphosate for agricultural weed control, especially after Monsanto introduced glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready crops, enabling farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States' agricultural sector and the second-most used (after 2,4-D) in home and garden, government and industry, and commercial applications. From the late 1970s to 2016, there was a 100-fold increase in the frequency and volume of application of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) worldwide, with further increases expected in the future. Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage, and minimally through roots, and from there translocated to growing points. It inhibits EPSP synthase, a plant enzyme involved in the synthesis of three aromatic amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. It is therefore effective only on actively growing plants and is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide. Crops have been genetically engineered to be tolerant of glyphosate (e.g. Roundup Ready soybean, the first Roundup Ready crop, also created by Monsanto), which allows farmers to use glyphosate as a post-emergence herbicide against weeds. While glyphosate and formulations such as Roundup have been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment have persisted. A number of regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 stating the use of glyphosate formulations does not necessarily constitute a health risk, and giving an acceptable daily intake limit of 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day for chronic toxicity. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. In March 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In contrast, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in November 2015 that ""the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans"", later clarifying that while carcinogenic glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies that ""look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect"". In 2017, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) classified glyphosate as causing serious eye damage and as toxic to aquatic life but did not find evidence implicating it as a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs. == Discovery == Glyphosate was first synthesized in 1950 by Swiss chemist Henry Martin, who worked for the Swiss company Cilag. The work was never published.: 1 Early studies found it to be a weak chemical chelating agent. Glyphosate was independently discovered in the United States at Monsanto in 1970. About 100 derivatives of aminomethylphosphonic acid had been prepaared as potential water-softening agents. Two were found to have weak herbicidal activity, and John E. Franz, a chemist at Monsanto, was asked to try to make analogs with stronger herbicidal activity. Glyphosate was the third analog he made.: 1–2 Franz received the National Medal of Technology of the United States in 1987 and the Perkin Medal for Applied Chemistry in 1990 for his discoveries. Monsanto developed and patented the use of glyphosate to kill weeds in the early 1970s and first brought it to market in 1974 under the Roundup brandname. While its initial patent expired in 1991, Monsanto retained exclusive rights in the United States until its patent on the isopropylamine salt expired in September 2000. In 2008, scientists at the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS) described glyphosate as a ""virtually ideal"" herbicide. In 2010 Powles stated: ""glyphosate is a one in a 100-year discovery that is as important for reliable global food production as penicillin is for battling disease."" As of April 2017, the Canadian government stated that glyphosate was ""the most widely used herbicide in Canada"", at which date the product labels were revised to ensure a limit of 20% POEA by weight. Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency found no risk to humans or the environment at that 20% limit, and that all products registered in Canada at that time were at or below that limit. == Chemistry == Glyphosate is a derivative of aminophosphonic acid and the amino acid glycine. Both the phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties can ionised (deprotonated) and the amine group can be protonated. Consequently the substance exists as a series of rapidly interchanging zwitterions. It was originally synthesized by the reaction of chloromethylphosphonate with glycine. Its name is a contraction of its constituents: glycine and a phosphonate. (HO)2P(O)CH2Cl + H2NCH2COOH → (HO)2P(O)CH2NHCH2COOH + HCl The main degradation path for glyphosate is hydrolysis to aminomethylphosphonic acid. === Synthesis === Two main approaches are used to synthesize glyphosate industrially, both of which proceed via the Kabachnik–Fields reaction. The first is to react iminodiacetic acid and formaldehyde with phosphorous acid (sometimes formed in situ from phosphorus trichloride using the water generated by the Mannich reaction of the first two reagents). Decarboxylation of the hydrophosphonylation product gives the desired glyphosate product. Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site by various methods depending on reagent availability. The second uses glycine in place of iminodiacetic acid. This avoids the need for decarboxylation but requires more careful control of stoichiometry, as the primary amine can react with any excess formaldehyde to form bishydroxymethylglycine, which must be hydrolysed during the work-up to give the desired product. This synthetic approach is responsible for a substantial portion of the production of glyphosate in China, with considerable work having gone into recycling the triethylamine and methanol solvents. Progress has also been made in attempting to eliminate the need for triethylamine altogether. === Impurities === Technical grade glyphosate is a white powder which, according to FAO specification, should contain not less than 95% glyphosate. Formaldehyde, classified as a known human carcinogen, and N-nitrosoglyphosate, have been identified as toxicologically relevant impurities. The FAO specification limits the formaldehyde concentration to a maximum of 1.3 g/kg glyphosate. N-Nitrosoglyphosate, ""belonging to a group of impurities of particular concern as they can be activated to genotoxic carcinogens"", should not exceed 1 ppm. == Formulations == Glyphosate is marketed in the United States and worldwide by many agrochemical companies in diverse strengths and with diverse adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames. As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market. In 2012, about half of the total global consumption of glyphosate by volume was for agricultural crops, with forestry comprising another important market. Asia and the Pacific was the largest and fastest growing regional market. As of 2014, Chinese manufacturers collectively are the world's largest producers of glyphosate and its precursors and account for about 30% of global exports. Key manufacturers include Anhui Huaxing Chemical Industry Company, BASF, Bayer CropScience (which also acquired the maker of glyphosate, Monsanto), Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Jiangsu Good Harvest-Weien Agrochemical Company, Nantong Jiangshan Agrochemical & Chemicals Co., Nufarm, SinoHarvest, Syngenta, and Zhejiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Company. Glyphosate is an acid molecule, so it is formulated as a salt for packaging and handling. Various salt formulations include isopropylamine, diammonium, monoammonium, or potassium as the counterion. The active ingredient of the Monsanto herbicides is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Another important ingredient in some formulations is the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA). Some brands include more than one salt. Some companies report their product as acid equivalent (ae) of glyphosate acid, or some report it as active ingredient (ai) of glyphosate plus the salt, and others report both. Given that each salt has its own molecular weight, the acid equivalent is a more accurate method of expressing and comparing concentrations. Adjuvant loading refers to the amount of adjuvant already added to the glyphosate product. Fully loaded products contain all the necessary adjuvants, including surfactant; some contain no adjuvant system, while other products contain only a limited amount of adjuvant (minimal or partial loading) and additional surfactants must be added to the spray tank before application. Products are supplied most commonly in formulations of 120, 240, 360, 480, and 680 g/L of active ingredient. The most common formulation in agriculture is 360 g/L, either alone or with added cationic surfactants. For 360 grams per litre (0.013 lb/cu in) formulations, European regulations allow applications of up to 12 litres per hectare (1.1 imp gal/acre) for control of perennial weeds such as couch grass. More commonly, rates of 3 litres per hectare (0.27 imp gal/acre) are practiced for control of annual weeds between crops. == Mode of action == Glyphosate interferes with the shikimate pathway, which produces the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan in plants and microorganisms – but does not exist in the genome of animals, including humans. It blocks this pathway by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which catalyzes the reaction of shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP). Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage and minimally through roots, meaning that it is only effective on actively growing plants and cannot prevent seeds from germinating. After application, glyphosate is readily transported around the plant to growing roots and leaves and this systemic activity is important for its effectiveness. Inhibiting the enzyme causes shikimate to accumulate in plant tissues and diverts energy and resources away from other processes, eventually killing the plant. While growth stops within hours of application, it takes several days for the leaves to begin turning yellow. Glyphosate may chelate Co2+ which contributes to its mode of action. Under normal circumstances, EPSP is dephosphorylated to chorismate, an essential precursor for the amino acids mentioned above. These amino acids are used in protein synthesis and to produce secondary metabolites such as folates, ubiquinones, and naphthoquinone. X-ray crystallographic studies of glyphosate and EPSPS show that glyphosate functions by occupying the binding site of the phosphoenolpyruvate, mimicking an intermediate state of the ternary enzyme–substrate complex. Glyphosate inhibits the EPSPS enzymes of diverse species of plants and microbes, although rates vary. == Uses == Glyphosate is effective in killing a wide variety of plants, including grasses and broadleaf and woody plants. By volume, it is one of the most widely used herbicides. In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States agricultural sector, with 180 to 185 million pounds (82,000 to 84,000 tonnes) applied, the second-most used in home and garden with 5 to 8 million pounds (2,300 to 3,600 tonnes) and 13 to 15 million pounds (5,900 to 6,800 tonnes) in non-agricultural settings. It is commonly used for agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, and silviculture purposes, as well as garden maintenance (including home use). It has a relatively small effect on some clover species and morning glory. Glyphosate and related herbicides are often used in invasive species eradication and habitat restoration, especially to enhance native plant establishment in prairie ecosystems. The controlled application is usually combined with a selective herbicide and traditional methods of weed eradication such as mulching to achieve an optimal effect. In many cities, glyphosate is sprayed along the sidewalks and streets, as well as crevices in between pavement where weeds often grow. However, up to 24% of glyphosate applied to hard surfaces can be run off by water. Glyphosate contamination of surface water is attributed to urban and agricultural use. Glyphosate is used to clear railroad tracks and get rid of unwanted aquatic vegetation. Since 1994, glyphosate has been used in aerial spraying in Colombia in coca eradication programs; Colombia announced in May 2015 that by October, it would cease using glyphosate in these programs due to concerns about human toxicity of the chemical. Glyphosate is also used for crop desiccation to increase harvest yield and uniformity. Glyphosate itself is not a chemical desiccant; rather crop desiccants are so named because application just before harvest kills the crop plants so that the food crop dries from normal environmental conditions (""dry-down"") more quickly and evenly. Because glyphosate is systemic, excess residue levels can persist in plants due to incorrect application and this may render the crop unfit for sale. When applied appropriately, it can promote useful effects. In sugarcane, for example, glyphosate application increases sucrose concentration before harvest. In grain crops (wheat, barley, oats), uniformly dried crops do not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest, but can easily be straight-cut and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money, which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short, and it enhances grain storage when the grain has a lower and more uniform moisture content. === Genetically modified crops === Some micro-organisms have a version of 5-enolpyruvoyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthetase (EPSPS) resistant to glyphosate inhibition. A version of the enzyme that was both resistant to glyphosate and that was still efficient enough to drive adequate plant growth was identified by Monsanto scientists after much trial and error in an Agrobacterium strain called CP4, which was found surviving in a waste-fed column at a glyphosate production facility.: 56 This CP4 EPSPS gene was cloned and transfected into soybeans. In 1996, genetically modified soybeans were made commercially available. Current glyphosate-resistant crops include soy, maize (corn), canola, alfalfa, sugar beets, and cotton, with wheat still under development. In 2023, 91% of corn, 95% of soybeans, and 94% of cotton produced in the United States were from strains that were genetically modified to be tolerant to multiple herbicides, including dicamba, glufosinate, and glyphosate. == Environmental fate == Glyphosate has four ionizable sites, with pKa values of 2.0, 2.6, 5.6 and 10.6. Therefore, it is a zwitterion in aqueous solutions and is expected to exist almost entirely in zwitterionic forms in the environment. Zwitterions generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Glyphosate strongly sorbs onto soil minerals, and, with the exception of colloid-facilitated transport, its soluble residues are expected to be poorly mobile in the free porewater of soils. The spatial extent of ground and surface water pollution is therefore considered to be relatively limited. Glyphosate is readily degraded by soil microbes to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA, which like glyphosate strongly adsorbs to soil solids and is thus unlikely to leach to groundwater). Though both glyphosate and AMPA are commonly detected in water bodies, a portion of the AMPA detected may actually be the result of degradation of detergents and other aminophosphonates rather than degradation of glyphosate. The proportion of AMPA from non-glyphosate sources is claimed to be higher in Europe compared to USA. Glyphosate does have the potential to contaminate surface waters due to its aquatic use patterns and through erosion, as it adsorbs to colloidal soil particles suspended in runoff. Detection in surface waters (particularly downstream from agricultural uses) has been reported as both broad and frequent by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) researchers, although other similar research found equal frequencies of detection in urban-dominated small streams. Rain events can trigger dissolved glyphosate loss in transport-prone soils. The mechanism of glyphosate sorption to soil is similar to that of phosphate fertilizers, the presence of which can reduce glyphosate sorption. Phosphate fertilizers are subject to release from sediments into water bodies under anaerobic conditions, and similar release can also occur with glyphosate, though significant impact of glyphosate release from sediments has not been established. Limited leaching can occur after high rainfall after application. If glyphosate reaches surface water, it is not broken down readily by water or sunlight. The half-life of glyphosate in soil ranges between 2 and 197 days; a typical field half-life of 47 days has been suggested. Soil and climate conditions affect glyphosate's persistence in soil. The median half-life of glyphosate in water varies from a few to 91 days. At a site in Texas, half-life was as little as three days. A site in Iowa had a half-life of 141.9 days. The glyphosate metabolite AMPA has been found in Swedish forest soils up to two years after a glyphosate application. In this case, the persistence of AMPA was attributed to the soil being frozen for most of the year. Glyphosate adsorption to soil, and later release from soil, varies depending on the kind of soil. Glyphosate is generally less persistent in water than in soil, with 12- to 60-day persistence observed in Canadian ponds, although persistence of over a year has been recorded in the sediments of American ponds. The half-life of glyphosate in water is between 12 days and 10 weeks. === Residues in food products === According to the National Pesticide Information Center fact sheet, glyphosate is not included in compounds tested for by the Food and Drug Administration's Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, nor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. The U.S. has determined the acceptable daily intake of glyphosate at 1.75 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/bw/day) while the European Union has set it at 0.5. Pesticide residue controls carried out by EU Member States in 2016 analysed 6,761 samples of food products for glyphosate residues. 3.6% of the samples contained quantifiable glyphosate residue levels with 19 samples (0.28%) exceeding the European maximum residue levels (MRLs), which included six samples of honey and other apicultural products (MRL = 0.05 mg/kg) and eleven samples of buckwheat and other pseudo‐cereals (MRL = 0.1 mg/kg). Glyphosate residues below the European MRLs were most frequently found in dry lentils, linseeds, soya beans, dry peas, tea, buckwheat, barley, wheat and rye. In Canada, a survey of 7,955 samples of food found that 42.3% contained detectable quantities of glyphosate and only 0.6% contained a level higher than the Canadian MRL of 0.1 mg/kg for most foods and 4 mg/kg for beans and chickpeas. Of the products that exceeded MRLs, one third were organic products. Health Canada concluded based on the analysis ""that there was no long-term health risk to Canadian consumers from exposure to the levels of glyphosate"". == Toxicity == Glyphosate is the active ingredient in herbicide formulations containing it. However, in addition to glyphosate salts, commercial formulations of glyphosate contain additives (known as adjuvants) such as surfactants, which vary in nature and concentration. Surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) are added to glyphosate to enable it to wet the leaves and penetrate the cuticle of the plants. === Glyphosate alone === ==== Humans ==== The acute oral toxicity for mammals is low, but death has been reported after deliberate overdose of concentrated formulations. The surfactants in glyphosate formulations can increase the relative acute toxicity of the formulation. Glyphosate is less toxic than 94% of herbicides, and is also less toxic than household chemicals such as table salt or vinegar. In a 2017 risk assessment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) wrote: ""There is very limited information on skin irritation in humans. Where skin irritation has been reported, it is unclear whether it is related to glyphosate or co-formulants in glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations."" The ECHA concluded that available human data was insufficient to support classification for skin corrosion or irritation. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate. ==== Cancer ==== The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. The Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the European Commission, the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified glyphosate as ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans."" One international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, classified glyphosate in Group 2A, ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" in 2015. As of 2020, the evidence for long-term exposure to glyphosate increasing the risk of human cancer remains inconclusive. There is weak evidence human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, such as in agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. Although some small studies have suggested an association between glyphosate and non-hodgkin lymphoma, subsequent work confirmed the likelihood this work suffered from bias, and the association could not be demonstrated in more robust studies. ==== Other mammals ==== Amongst mammals, glyphosate is considered to have ""low to very low toxicity"". The LD50 of glyphosate is 5,000 mg/kg for rats, 10,000 mg/kg in mice and 3,530 mg/kg in goats. The acute dermal LD50 in rabbits is greater than 2,000 mg/kg. Indications of glyphosate toxicity in animals typically appear within 30 to 120 minutes following ingestion of a large enough dose, and include initial excitability and tachycardia, ataxia, depression, and bradycardia, although severe toxicity can develop into collapse and convulsions. A review of unpublished short-term rabbit-feeding studies reported severe toxicity effects at 150 mg/kg/day and ""no observed adverse effect level"" doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg/kg/day. Glyphosate can have carcinogenic effects in nonhuman mammals. These include the induction of positive trends in the incidence of renal tubule carcinoma and haemangiosarcoma in male mice, and increased pancreatic islet-cell adenoma in male rats. In reproductive toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits, no adverse maternal or offspring effects were seen at doses below 175–293 mg/kg/day. Large quantities of glyphosate-based herbicides may cause life-threatening arrhythmias in mammals. Evidence also shows that such herbicides cause direct electrophysiological changes in the cardiovascular systems of rats and rabbits. ==== Aquatic fauna ==== In many freshwater invertebrates, glyphosate has a 48-hour LC50 ranging from 55 to 780 ppm. The 96-hour LC50 is 281 ppm for grass shrimp (Palaemonetas vulgaris) and 934 ppm for fiddler crabs (Uca pagilator). These values make glyphosate ""slightly toxic to practically non-toxic"". ==== Antimicrobial activity ==== The antimicrobial activity of glyphosate has been described in the microbiology literature since its discovery in 1970 and the description of glyphosate's mechanism of action in 1972. Efficacy was described for numerous bacteria and fungi. Glyphosate can control the growth of apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), and Cryptosporidium parvum, and has been considered an antimicrobial agent in mammals. Inhibition can occur with some Rhizobium species important for soybean nitrogen fixation, especially under moisture stress. ==== Soil biota ==== When glyphosate comes into contact with the soil, it can be bound to soil particles, thereby slowing its degradation. Glyphosate and its degradation product, aminomethylphosphonic acid are considered to be much more benign toxicologically and environmentally than most of the herbicides replaced by glyphosate. A 2016 meta-analysis concluded that at typical application rates glyphosate had no effect on soil microbial biomass or respiration. Some species of earthworms are affected, some are not. Some avoid treated soil. ==== Endocrine disruption ==== In 2007, the EPA selected glyphosate for further screening through its Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Selection for this program is based on a compound's prevalence of use and does not imply particular suspicion of endocrine activity. On June 29, 2015, the EPA released the Weight of Evidence Conclusions of the EDSP Tier 1 screening for glyphosate, recommending that glyphosate not be considered for Tier 2 testing. The Weight of Evidence conclusion stated ""...there was no convincing evidence of potential interaction with the estrogen, androgen or thyroid pathways."" A review of the evidence by the European Food Safety Authority published in September 2017 showed conclusions similar to those of the EPA report. ==== Effect on plant health ==== Some studies have found causal relationships between glyphosate and increased or decreased disease resistance. Exposure to glyphosate has been shown to change the species composition of endophytic bacteria in plant hosts, which is highly variable. === Glyphosate-based formulations === Glyphosate-based formulations may contain a number of adjuvants, the identities of which may be proprietary. Surfactants are used in herbicide formulations as wetting agents, to maximize coverage and aid penetration of the herbicide(s) through plant leaves. As agricultural spray adjuvants, surfactants may be pre-mixed into commercial formulations or they may be purchased separately and mixed on-site. Polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) is a surfactant used in the original Roundup formulation and was commonly used in 2015. The percentage of POEA varies. A 1997 US government report said that Roundup is 15% POEA while Roundup Pro is 14.5%. Since POEA is more toxic to fish and amphibians than glyphosate alone, POEA is not allowed in aquatic formulations. As of 2000, at least 58 studies existed on the effects of Roundup on a range of organisms. This review concluded that ""...for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed non-target organisms"". ==== Human ==== Overall, there is no conclusive evidence on glyphosate's effect on human health. Acute toxicity and chronic toxicity are dose-related. Skin exposure to ready-to-use concentrated glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. These effects are probably due to the preservative benzisothiazolin-3-one. Severe skin burns are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate. Death has been reported after deliberate overdose. Ingestion of Roundup ranging from 85 to 200 ml (of 41% solution) has resulted in death within hours of ingestion, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. Adult consumption of more than 85 ml of concentrated product can lead to corrosive esophageal burns and kidney or liver damage. More severe cases cause ""respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia"" and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias. While the surfactants in formulations generally do not increase the toxicity of glyphosate itself, it is likely that they contribute to its acute toxicity. ==== Aquatic fauna ==== Glyphosate products for aquatic use generally do not use surfactants, and aquatic formulations do not use POEA due to aquatic organism toxicity. Due to the presence of POEA, such glyphosate formulations only allowed for terrestrial use are more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate alone. The half-life of POEA (21–42 days) is longer than that for glyphosate (7–14 days) in aquatic environments. Aquatic organism exposure risk to terrestrial formulations with POEA is limited to drift or temporary water pockets where concentrations would be much lower than label rates. Some researchers have suggested the toxicity effects of pesticides on amphibians may differ from those of other aquatic fauna because of their lifestyle; amphibians may be more susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides because they often prefer to breed in shallow, lentic, or ephemeral pools. These habitats do not necessarily constitute formal water-bodies and can contain higher concentrations of pesticide compared to larger water-bodies. Studies in a variety of amphibians have shown the toxicity of GBFs containing POEA to amphibian larvae. These effects include interference with gill morphology and mortality from either the loss of osmotic stability or asphyxiation. At sub-lethal concentrations, exposure to POEA or glyphosate/POEA formulations have been associated with delayed development, accelerated development, reduced size at metamorphosis, developmental malformations of the tail, mouth, eye and head, histological indications of intersex and symptoms of oxidative stress. Glyphosate-based formulations can cause oxidative stress in bullfrog tadpoles. A 2003 study of various formulations of glyphosate found, ""[the] risk assessments based on estimated and measured concentrations of glyphosate that would result from its use for the control of undesirable plants in wetlands and over-water situations showed that the risk to aquatic organisms is negligible or small at application rates less than 4 kg/ha and only slightly greater at application rates of 8 kg/ha."" A 2013 meta-analysis reviewed the available data related to potential impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians. According to the authors, the use of glyphosate-based pesticides cannot be considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to the widespread use of glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure. The authors recommended further study of per-species and per-development-stage chronic toxicity, of environmental glyphosate levels, and ongoing analysis of data relevant to determining what if any role glyphosate might be playing in worldwide amphibian decline, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries. ==== Genetic damage ==== Several studies have not found mutagenic effects, so glyphosate has not been listed in the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the International Agency for Research on Cancer databases. Various other studies suggest glyphosate may be mutagenic. The IARC monograph noted that glyphosate-based formulations can cause DNA strand breaks in various taxa of animals in vitro. === Government and organization positions === ==== European Food Safety Authority ==== A 2013 systematic review by the German Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) examined more than 1000 epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. It found that ""no classification and labelling for carcinogenicity is warranted"" and did not recommend a carcinogen classification of either 1A or 1B.: 34–37, 139 It provided the review to EFSA in January 2014 which published it in December 2014. In November 2015, EFSA published its conclusion in the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR), stating it was ""unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans"". The EU was largely informed by this report when it made its decision on the use of glyphosate in November 2017. EFSA's decision and the BfR report were criticized in an open letter published by 96 scientists in November 2015 saying that the BfR report failed to adhere to accepted scientific principles of open and transparent procedures. The BfR report included unpublished data, lacked authorship, omitted references, and did not disclose conflict-of-interest information. In July 2023, EFSA re-evaluated after three years of assessment the putative impact of glyphosate on the health of humans, animals and the environment. As a result, no critical areas of concern were identified that would otherwise prevent glyphosate's registration renewal in the EU. ==== International Agency for Research on Cancer ==== In March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an intergovernmental agency forming part of the World Health Organization of the United Nations, published a summary of their forthcoming monograph on glyphosate, and classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic in humans"" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. It noted that there was ""limited evidence"" of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The IARC classifies substances for their carcinogenic potential, and ""a few positive findings can be enough to declare a hazard, even if there are negative studies, as well."" Unlike the BfR, it does not conduct a risk assessment, weighing benefits against risk. The BfR responded that IARC reviewed only a selection of what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called Agricultural Health Study, do not support the classification. The IARC report did not include unpublished studies, including one completed by the IARC panel leader. The agency's international protocol dictates that only published studies be used in classifications of carcinogenicity, since national regulatory agencies including the EPA have allowed agrochemical corporations to conduct their own unpublished research, which may be biased in support of their profit motives. ===== Reviews of the EFSA and IARC reports ===== A 2017 review done by personnel from EFSA and BfR argued that the differences between the IARC's and EFSA's conclusions regarding glyphosate and cancer were due to differences in their evaluation of the available evidence. The review concluded that ""Two complementary exposure assessments ... suggests that actual exposure levels are below"" the reference values identified by the EFSA ""and do not represent a public concern."" In contrast, a 2016 analysis by Christopher Portier, a scientist advising the IARC in the assessment of glyphosate and advocate for its classification as possibly carcinogenic, concluded that in the EFSA's Renewal Assessment Report, ""almost no weight is given to studies from the published literature and there is an over-reliance on non-publicly available industry-provided studies using a limited set of assays that define the minimum data necessary for the marketing of a pesticide"", arguing that the IARC's evaluation of probably carcinogenic to humans ""accurately reflects the results of published scientific literature on glyphosate"". In October 2017, an article in The Times revealed that Portier had received consulting contracts with two law firm associations representing alleged glyphosate cancer victims that included a payment of US$160,000 to Portier. The IARC final report was also found to have changed compared to an interim report, through the removal of text saying certain studies had found glyphosate was not carcinogenic in that study's context, and through strengthening a conclusion of ""limited evidence of animal carcinogenicity,"" to ""sufficient evidence of animal carcinogenicity"". ==== US Environmental Protection Agency ==== In a 1993 review, the EPA, considered glyphosate to be noncarcinogenic and relatively low in dermal and oral acute toxicity. The EPA considered a ""worst case"" dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate-sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions. In 2015, the EPA initiated a review of glyphosate's toxicity and in 2016 reported that glyphosate is likely not carcinogenic. In August 2019, the EPA announced that it no longer allowed labels claiming glyphosate is a carcinogen, as those claims would ""not meet the labeling requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act"" and misinform the public. In 2017, evidence collected in a lawsuit brought against Monsanto by cancer patients revealed company emails which appeared to show a friendly relationship with a senior EPA official. ===== Monsanto response and campaign ===== Monsanto called the IARC report biased and said it wanted the report to be retracted. In 2017, internal documents from Monsanto were made public by lawyers pursuing litigation against the company, who used the term ""Monsanto papers"" to describe the documents. This term was later used also by Leemon McHenry and others. The documents indicated Monsanto had planned a public relations effort to discredit the IARC report, and had engaged Henry Miller to write a 2015 opinion piece in Forbes Magazine challenging the report. Miller did not reveal the connection to Forbes, and according to the New York Times, when Monsanto asked him if he was interested in writing such an article, he replied ""I would be if I could start from a high-quality draft"" provided by the company. Once this became public, Forbes removed his blog from their site. Two journalists from Le Monde won the 2018 European Press Prize for a series of articles on the documents, also titled Monsanto Papers. Their reporting described, among other things, Monsanto's lawyers' letters demanding that IARC scientists turn over documents relating to Monograph 112, which contained the IARC finding that glyphosate was a ""probable carcinogen""; several of the scientists condemned these letters as intimidating. ==== California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ==== In March 2015, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) announced plans to have glyphosate listed as a known carcinogen based on the IARC assessment. In 2016, Monsanto started a case against OEHHA and its acting director, Lauren Zeise, but lost the suit in March 2017. Glyphosate was listed as ""known to the State of California to cause cancer"" in 2017, requiring warning labels under Proposition 65. In February 2018, as part of an ongoing case, an injunction was issued prohibiting California from enforcing carcinogenicity labeling requirements for glyphosate until the case was resolved. The injunction stated that arguments by a US District Court Judge for the Eastern District of California ""[do] not change the fact that the overwhelming majority of agencies that that have examined glyphosate have determined it is not a cancer risk."" In August 2019, the EPA also said it no longer allowed labels claiming glyphosate is a carcinogen, as those claims would ""not meet the labeling requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act"" and misinform the public. ==== European Chemicals Agency ==== On March 15, 2017 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) announced recommendations proceeding from a risk assessment of glyphosate performed by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC). Their recommendations maintained the current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life. However, the RAC did not find evidence implicating glyphosate to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs. In 2022, the agency reiterated these findings in a later review and stated on cancer risk that, ""Based on a wide-ranging review of scientific evidence, the committee again concludes that classifying glyphosate as a carcinogen is not justified."" == Effects of use == === Emergence of resistant weeds === In the 1990s, no glyphosate-resistant weeds were known to exist. In 2005 a slow upward trend began, resistant weeds appearing rarely around the world. Another inflection point occurred in 2011 and resistance accelerated globally. By 2014, glyphosate-resistant weeds dominated herbicide-resistance research. At that time, 23 glyphosate-resistant species were found in 18 countries. ""Resistance evolves after a weed population has been subjected to intense selection pressure in the form of repeated use of a single herbicide."" According to Ian Heap, a weed specialist, who completed his PhD on resistance to multiple herbicides in annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) in 1988 – the first case of an herbicide-resistant weed in Australia – by 2014 Lolium rigidum was the ""world’s worst herbicide-resistant weed"" with instances in ""12 countries, 11 sites of action, 9 cropping regimens"" and affecting ""over 2 million hectares."" Annual ryegrass has been known to be resistant to herbicides since 1982. The first documented case of glyphosate-resistant L. rigidum was reported in Australia in 1996 near Orange, New South Wales. In 2006, farmers associations were reporting 107 biotypes of weeds within 63 weed species with herbicide resistance. In 2009, Canada identified its first resistant weed, giant ragweed, and at that time 15 weed species had been confirmed as resistant to glyphosate. As of 2010, in the United States 7 to 10 million acres (2.8 to 4.0 million hectares) of soil were afflicted by herbicide-resistant weeds, or about 5% of the 170 million acres planted with corn, soybeans, and cotton, the crops most affected, in 22 states. In 2012, Charles Benbrook reported that the Weed Science Society of America listed 22 herbicide-resistant species in the U.S., with over 5.7×10^6 ha (14×10^6 acres) infested by GR weeds and that Dow AgroSciences had carried out a survey and reported a figure of around 40×10^6 ha (100×10^6 acres). The International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds database lists species that are resistant to glyphosate. In response to resistant weeds, farmers are hand-weeding, using tractors to turn over soil between crops, and using other herbicides in addition to glyphosate. Monsanto scientists have found that some resistant weeds have as many as 160 extra copies of a gene called EPSPS, the enzyme glyphosate disrupts. ==== Palmer amaranth ==== In 2004, a glyphosate-resistant variation of Palmer amaranth was found in the U.S. state of Georgia. In 2005, resistance was also found in North Carolina. The species can quickly become resistant to multiple herbicides and has developed multiple mechanisms for glyphosate resistance due to selection pressure. ==== Conyza species ==== Conyza bonariensis (also known as hairy fleabane and buva) and C. canadensis (known as horseweed or marestail) are other weed species that have lately developed glyphosate resistance. A 2008 study on the current situation of glyphosate resistance in South America concluded ""resistance evolution followed intense glyphosate use"" and the use of glyphosate-resistant soybean crops is a factor encouraging increases in glyphosate use. In the 2015 growing season, glyphosate-resistant marestail proved to be especially problematic to control in Nebraska production fields. ==== Ryegrass ==== Glyphosate-resistant ryegrass (Lolium) has occurred in most of the Australian agricultural areas and other areas of the world. All cases of evolution of resistance to glyphosate in Australia were characterized by intensive use of the herbicide while no other effective weed control practices were used. Studies indicate resistant ryegrass does not compete well against nonresistant plants and their numbers decrease when not grown under conditions of glyphosate application. ==== Johnson grass ==== Glyphosate-resistant Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) has been found in Argentina as well as Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. === Monarch butterfly populations === Use of glyphosate and other herbicides like 2,4-D to clear milkweed along roads and fields may have contributed to a decline in monarch butterfly populations in the Midwestern United States. Along with deforestation and adverse weather conditions, the decrease in milkweed contributed to an 81% decline in monarchs. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a suit against the EPA in 2015, in which it argued that the agency ignored warnings about the potentially dangerous impacts of glyphosate usage on monarchs. == Legal status == Glyphosate was first approved for use in the 1970s, and as of 2010 was labelled for use in 130 countries.: 2 In 2017 Vandenberg et al. cited a 100-fold increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicides from 1974 to 2014, the possibility that herbicide mixtures likely have effects that are not predicted by studying glyphosate alone, and reliance of current safety assessments on studies done over 30 years ago. They recommended that current safety standards be updated, writing that the current standards ""may fail to protect public health or the environment."" === Europe === ==== European Union ==== A vote on the relicensing of glyphosate in the EU stalled in March 2016. Member states France, Sweden, and the Netherlands objected to the renewal. A vote to reauthorize on a temporary basis failed in June 2016 but at the last minute the license was extended for 18 months until the end of 2017. On 27 November 2017, in the EU Council a majority of eighteen member states voted in favor of permitting the use of glyphosate for five more years. A qualified majority of sixteen states representing 65% of EU citizens was required to pass the law. The German Minister of Agriculture, Christian Schmidt, unexpectedly voted in favor while the German coalition government was internally divided on the issue which usually results in Germany abstaining. In December 2018, attempts were made to reopen the decision to license the weed-killer. These were condemned by Conservative MEPs, who said the proposal was politically motivated and flew in the face of scientific evidence. In March 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to release all carcinogenicity and toxicity pesticide industry studies on glyphosate to the general public. The assessment process for an approval of glyphosate in the European Union was scheduled to begin in December 2019. France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Sweden were to jointly assess the application dossiers of the producers. The draft report of the assessment group was then to be peer-reviewed by the EFSA before the then-current approval expired in December 2022. The date was subsequently pushed back, partially due to very high interest and input in the participation process, with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) even calling it an “unprecedented number”. Because the EFSA had to review all these 2400 comments and almost 400 responses, the process was expected to take longer. The created document was under extra review by the specially formed Glyphosate Renewal Group (GRG) and the Assessment Group on Glyphosate (AGG), the panel consisting of the four mentioned member states. With their responses then being scheduled for September 2022, the consultations with member states were supposed to be held by the very end of 2022. This would allow to finish the final assessment by mid-2023 and pass it on to further legislature to decide. In November 2023, glyphosate received a 10 year renewed authorization for use in the EU from the European Commission. ==== National level regulation ==== In April 2014, the legislature of the Netherlands passed legislation prohibiting sale of glyphosate to individuals for use at home; commercial sales were not affected. In June 2015, the French Ecology Minister asked nurseries and garden centers to halt over-the-counter sales of glyphosate in the form of Monsanto's Roundup. This was a nonbinding request and all sales of glyphosate remain legal in France until 2022, when it was planned to ban the substance for home gardening. However, subsequently the French parliament decided to not to impose a definitive date for such a ban. In January 2019, ""the sale, distribution, and use of Roundup 360 [wa]s banned"" in France. Exemptions for many farmers were later implemented, and a curb of its use by 80% for 2021 is projected. In March 2019, the Austrian state of Carinthia outlawed the private use of glyphosate in residential areas while the commercial application of the herbicide is still permitted for farmers. The use of glyphosate by public authorities and road maintenance crews was already halted a number of years prior to the current ban by local authorities. In June 2019, Deutsche Bahn and Swiss Federal Railways announced that glyphosate and other commonly used herbicides for weed eradication along railway tracks will be phased out by 2025, while more environmentally sound methods for vegetation control are implemented. In July 2019, the Austrian parliament voted to ban glyphosate in Austria. However, the ban was never brought into effect due to a legal defect rendering it unable to be promulgated. In September 2019, the German Environment Ministry announced that the use of glyphosate would be banned from the end of 2023. The use of glyphosate-based herbicides would be reduced starting from 2020. As of April 2024, a partial ban was reported to be in effect. A full ban on the use of glyphosate in Luxembourg entered into force on 1 January 2022,. The ban was annulled by the Administrative Court of Luxembourg in April 2023. === Other countries === In September 2013, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador approved legislation to ban 53 agrochemicals, including glyphosate; the ban on glyphosate was set to begin in 2015, but was later rescinded. In the United States, the state of Minnesota preempts local laws that attempt to ban glyphosate. In 2015 there was an attempt to pass legislation at the state level that would repeal that preemption. As of January 2018, glyphosate is not banned at either the federal or state level in the US. However, numerous local governments in various states have enacted restrictions or bans on the use of glyphosate in their respective jurisdictions. In addition, the state of California attempted to enforce a requirement for a Prop 65 carcinogen warning label on glyphosate containers, but was permanently enjoined from doing so by a federal court. In May 2015, the President of Sri Lanka banned the use and import of glyphosate, effective immediately. However, in May 2018 the Sri Lankan government decided to re-authorize its use in the plantation sector. The ban was fully revoked in August 2022. In May 2015, Bermuda blocked importation on all new orders of glyphosate-based herbicides for a temporary suspension awaiting outcomes of research. In 2016, the Bermudian government banned all glyphosate concentrates with a strength of over 2 per cent. In May 2015, Colombia announced that it would stop using glyphosate by October 2015 in the destruction of illegal plantations of coca, the raw ingredient for cocaine. Farmers have complained that the aerial fumigation has destroyed entire fields of coffee and other legal produce. The glyphosate ban in Colombia was subsequently lifted. In April 2019, Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development banned the use of glyphosate throughout the country. In August 2020, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced that glyphosate would be gradually phased out of use in Mexico by late 2024. However in March 2024, the Mexican government postponed the ban, and did not set a new date for its implementation. Thailand's National Hazardous Substances Committee decided to ban the use of glyphosate in October 2019 but reversed the decision in November 2019. After a court ruling in 2018, glyphosate was temporarily banned in Brazil. This decision was later overturned, causing major criticism by the federal agency of health (Anvisa). This comes, as the latest evaluations declared glyphosate as noncarcinogenic. Since all carcinogenic agrichemicals are automatically banned in the country, this allowed the continuous use. In New Zealand, glyphosate is an approved herbicide for killing weeds, with the most popular brand being Roundup. Genetically modified crops designed to resist glyphosate are absent in New Zealand. Crops applied with glyphosate must be regulated under the HSNO Act 1996 and ACVM Act 1997. Legal status for glyphosate use in New Zealand is approved for commercial and personal use. In 2021, exports of New Zealand honey were found to contain traces of glyphosate, causing some concern to Japanese importers. == Legal cases == === Lawsuits claiming liability for cancer === Since 2018, in a number of court cases in the United States, plaintiffs have argued that their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate in glyphosate-based herbicides produced by Monsanto/Bayer. Defendant Bayer has paid out over $9.6 billion in judgements and settlements in these cases. Bayer has also won at least 10 cases, successfully arguing that their glyphosate-based herbicides were not responsible for the plaintiff's cancer. === Advertising controversies === In 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Quaker Oats in the Federal district courts of both New York and California after trace amounts of glyphosate were found in oatmeal. The lawsuit alleged that the claim of ""100% natural"" was false advertising. That same year General Mills dropped the label ""Made with 100% Natural Whole Grain Oats"" from their Nature Valley granola bars after a lawsuit was filed that claimed the oats contained trace amounts of glyphosate. === Trade dumping allegations === United States companies have cited trade issues with glyphosate being dumped into western world market areas by Chinese companies, and a formal dispute was filed in 2010. == Misinformation campaigns == Glyphosate has become a locus of campaigning and misinformation by anti-GMO activists because of its association with genetically-modified glyphosate-resistant crops. The US politician Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has incorporated glyphosate into his anti-vaccination rhetoric, falsely claiming that both glyphosate and vaccines may be contributing to the American obesity epidemic. Stephanie Seneff has also falsely claimed that it may have a role in autism and in worsening concussion. == See also == == References == == External links == Glyphosate in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) Glyphosate trimesium in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) Glyphosate, isopropylamine salt in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) Glyphosate, potassium salt in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Glyphosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -6.988221684878226e-06), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.0005830018781125546), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011057882569730282)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/technology/glyphosate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=12, title='Glyphosate | Description, Discovery, Uses, Mechanism, Resistance, Environmental Risks, & Health Concerns | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/technology/glyphosate?utm_source=openai')])"
3568,"('Cc 401',)",Medical," Pharmacologic expansion of endogenous β cells is a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetes. To elucidate the molecular pathways that control β-cell growth we screened ∼2400 bioactive compounds for rat β-cell replication-modulating activity. Numerous hit compounds impaired or promoted rat β-cell replication, including CC-401, an advanced clinical candidate previously characterized as a c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor. Surprisingly, CC-401 induced rodent (in vitro and in vivo) and human (in vitro) β-cell replication via dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) 1A and 1B inhibition. In contrast to rat β cells, which were broadly growth responsive to compound treatment, human β-cell replication was only consistently induced by DYRK1A/B inhibitors. This effect was enhanced by simultaneous glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) or activin A receptor type II-like kinase/transforming growth factor-β (ALK5/TGF-β) inhibition. Prior work emphasized DYRK1A/B inhibition-dependent activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) as the primary mechanism of human β-cell-replication induction. However, inhibition of NFAT activity had limited effect on CC-401-induced β-cell replication. Consequently, we investigated additional effects of CC-401-dependent DYRK1A/B inhibition. Indeed, CC-401 inhibited DYRK1A-dependent phosphorylation/stabilization of the β-cell-replication inhibitor p27Kip1. Additionally, CC-401 increased expression of numerous replication-promoting genes normally suppressed by the dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multivulval class B (DREAM) complex, which depends upon DYRK1A/B activity for integrity, including MYBL2 and FOXM1. In summary, we present a compendium of compounds as a valuable resource for manipulating the signaling pathways that control β-cell replication and leverage a DYRK1A/B inhibitor (CC-401) to expand our understanding of the molecular pathways that control β-cell growth.",Cc 401,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002614550176076591), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.018587922677397728), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10023138672113419)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Better treatment options are needed to improve disease regression and patient survival. The purpose of this study was to examine a new treatment strategy by combining PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition and radiotherapy. First, we assessed the efficacy of two PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitors, PF-04691502 and PKI-402, to inhibit pAkt and increase apoptosis in NET cell lines (BON and QGP-1) and patient-derived tumor spheroids as single agents or combined with radiotherapy (XRT). Treatment with PF-04691502 decreased pAkt (Ser473) expression for up to 72 h compared with the control; in contrast, decreased pAkt expression was noted for less than 24 h with PKI-402. Simultaneous treatment with PF-04691502 and XRT did not induce apoptosis in NET cells; however, the addition of PF-04691502 48 h after XRT significantly increased apoptosis compared to PF-04691502 or XRT treatment alone. Our results demonstrate that schedule-dependent administration of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, combined with XRT, can enhance cytotoxicity by promoting the radiosensitivity of NET cells. Moreover, our findings suggest that radiotherapy, in combination with timed PI3K/mTOR inhibition, may be a promising therapeutic regimen for patients with GEP-NET. Targeting the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signalling pathway is a promising strategy for the treatment of various cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). PF-04691502 is a relatively novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that exerts inhibitory effects against various cancer cells. However, the effects of PF-04691502 in BC cells have not been clarified thus far. This study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of PF-04691502 and the mechanisms underlying these antitumour effects in BC cells. The effects of PF-04691502 on the viabilities of BC cells were examined using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell migration and invasion were measured using the wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. Cellular apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The change in the cellular protein levels was measured using western blotting. siRNA was used to study the role of PTEN in the antitumour effects of PF-04691502. PF-04691502 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells. Additionally, PF-04691502 induced apoptosis of BC cells via the intrinsic pathway. PF-04691502 inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in BC cells. In addition, PF-04691502 increased the apoptosis induced by various chemotherapeutic agents in BC cells. Taken together, PF-04691502 could be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of BC. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in a variety of human tumors including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Targeting this pathway has been validated in solid and hematological tumors. In the present study, we demonstrated that PF-04691502, a novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor has potent activity in a panel of aggressive B-NHL cell lines including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). MTS analysis showed that PF-04691502 effectively inhibited cell proliferation with IC50 values ranging from 0.12 to 0.55 µM. Cells treated with PF-04691502 exhibited decreased phosphorylation of Akt and S6 ribosomal protein confirming the mechanism of action of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Also, treatment of B-NHL cell lines with PF-04691502 induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, PF-04691502 significantly induced G1 cell cycle arrest associated with a decrease in cyclin D1 which contributed to suppression of cell proliferation. Finally, rituximab enhanced apoptosis induced by PF-04691502. Taken together, our findings provide for the first time that PF-04691502 inhibits the constitutively activated PI3K/mTOR pathway in aggressive B-cell NHL cell lines associated with inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis. These findings suggest that PF-04691502 is a novel therapeutic strategy in aggressive B-cell NHL and warrants early phase clinical trial evaluation with and without rituximab.",Pf 04691502,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013007997767999768), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008633431047201157)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -9.088346359931165e-07)])","('INFO; https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/58006/,https://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijo/48/1/253/abstract,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/10/5/1261 ', [])"

The earliest known record dates back to 3000 BC when ancient Egyptians applied the oil and sap of local Apiaceae species exposing their skin to sunlight to cure vitiligo. In meantime, tribes in India used Psoralea corylifolia which contained psoralen, the isomer of angelicin. Humans also attempted to harvest the plants as an alternative food source. However, most of them turned out to be unpalatable and toxic such as Angelica archangelica due to the ability to irritate skin and damage internal organs. The name ""angelicin"" stems from the aforementioned plant, Angelica. This Latin name originated in medieval Europe where this plant was also used as a universal treatment to many types of disease not mentioning the bubonic plague. At this time, people believed that the plant could prevent the soul from being taken over by sorcery, curse and evil spirit (add reference). Angelica would have appeared in a dream with an angel explaining its applications, hence the name. Ironically, it was later discovered that the plant's oil is toxic when utilized in large quantities particularly when the plant was fresh. The species of plants where angelicin is found was introduced in Britain in the 19th century. Currently, it can be found in Canada and some parts of the United States and Europe. Because of the toxicity of certain plant parts and the ability of plant to proliferate, it is included in the list of invasive species. The leaves of Angelica archangelica, which are rich in angelicin, are used to extract the compound. There were multiple studies on the toxicity of angelicin one of which showed that the compound elicits chromosomal damage in hamster cells exposed to 320-380 nm UV light. The chromosomal aberrations were shown to be also induced in humans. Nowadays, it is debated whether Angelica should be considered toxic. However, it is certain that the toxicity is dependent on the dose of angelicin administered and is solely the matter of experts when it comes to its application. == Biological synthesis == The biosynthesis of angelicin can be described as a variation in the biological synthesis of furanocoumarins. It begins from the capture of organic carbon by photosynthesis and the formation of carbohydrates. Subsequently, the carbohydrates become the substrates of the shikimic acid pathway where they are converted to phenylalanine and tyrosine. Enzymes such as ammonialyases, methylases and hydroxylases then transform these amino acids to cinnamic acid derivatives which undergo o-hydroxylation yielding coumarins. The coumarins can undergo further reactions such as prenylation and oxidation to give multiple furanocoumarins one of which is angelicin. Here, the biosynthesis of angelicin is described in more detail starting at L-phenylalanine as a precursor. The phenylalanine undergoes a non-oxidative deamination by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) to trans-cinnamic acid. Afterwards, the trans-cinnamic acid is hydroxylated at the para position by trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (C4H) which utilizes NADPH, H+ and O2. The product, p-coumaric acid, is then converted to umbelliferone, the important intermediate of biosynthesis pathway. 4-Coumaric acid 2-hydroxylase (C2’H) hydroxylates the p-coumaric acid at the ortho position. Notably, this reaction uses alpha-ketoglutarate which is reduced to succinate both of which are involved in the Krebs cycle. The newly formed trans-dihydrocinnamic acid undergoes a photochemical isomerization to a cis isomer which spontaneously lactonizes to yield umbeliferone. Subsequently, umbelliferone 6-prenyltransferase (PT) couples umbelliferone with prenyl diphosphate to give osthenol and pyrophosphate. Osthenol is oxidized to (+)-columbianetin by (+)-columbianetin synthase (CS), a putative plant cytochrome P450, although the details of this reaction are not clear. The biosynthesis is terminated with the oxidation of (+)-columbianetin yielding angelicin by angelicin synthase (AS) which is also considered as the enzyme of cytochrome P450 family. It is noteworthy that the biosynthesis of angelicin diverges at the umbelliferone as it is also converted to psoralen, the isomer of angelicin. In fact, psoralen, from which the family of linear furanocoumarins descends, is by far much more abundant in plants than angelicin. As a result, most herbivorous insects are resistant to psoralen. Now, it is increasingly recognized that plants devised the pathway leading to angelicin as an alternative defense mechanism. For example, angelicin enhances the toxicity of psoralen by acting as an inhibitor of the detoxifying cytochrome P450 in insects. Moreover, the comparison of the protein sequences of psoralen synthase and angelicin synthase shows a 70% identity overall and 40% identity in the substrate recognition sites. This implies that the biosynthesis of angelicin is a relatively recently evolved trait. == Chemical synthesis == Iodination of commercially available umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) yields 7-hydroxy-8-iodocoumarin. Acetoxy group can be introduced into hydroxyl of 7-hydroxy-8-iodocoumarin, which is used to create vaginol or vaginidiol with an isopropyl Grignard reagent and commercially available epoxy aldehydes. Subsequent acid-catalysed fragmentation of vaginol with dichloromethane in trifluoroacetic acid yields angelicin. The compound can be isolated from natural sources, albeit this affords a low yield due to the prevalence of other furanocoumarins. The popular technique is air drying the aerial parts and ground roots of plant followed by n-hexane extraction and column chromatography over silica gel. == Medical use == Angelicin derivatives are used to treat psoriasis and cancer. One way of treating these diseases is by photochemotherapy (PUVA) which combines UV irradiation with photosensitizing chemical. In most cases the 4,5’-dimethylangelicin is applied owing to its firm binding and specificity to DNA. Also, it was shown that it is actively inhibits the synthesis of nucleic acids in tumor cells thereby decreasing their growth. In PUVA, angelicin is less popular than psoralen, although both furanocoumarins are photosensitizing and used in couple with long-wave UV irradiation. Angelicin and psoralen are used in other skin disorders such as vitiligo and mycosis. DNA photobinding is the most studied aspect of the photobiology and photochemistry of angelicin. According to the mechanism, long-range UV light triggers angelicin to bind to the pyrimidine bases of DNA in the same manner as psoralen. In this way, the inhibition of DNA replication via the formation of photoadducts can occur. This might be the basis for the desired therapeutic effect as in the case of psoralen derivatives. However, extreme care should be taken while using PUVA due to the side effects it may bring. Therefore, this type of treatment is sometimes used as a last resort and often corticosteroids are used instead. One of the main adverse effects of PUVA is phototoxicity which can be tackled by heteroanalogues of angelicin. For example, recently researchers have shown that if furan ring is replaced by 1-substituted pyrazole or thiophene ring, the new angelicin heteroanalogues show virtually no phototoxicity. == Interaction with biomolecules == It was shown that angelicin exhibits a multifaceted effect on various biomolecules which stem from the compound's structure and photoreactivity. For example, the planar structure allows angelicin to intercalate between the DNA bases. When exposed to ultraviolet light, it undergoes a C4-photocycloaddition reaction with thymine and cytosine forming a monoadduct. The double bonds of angelicin involved in this reaction are the 3,4 and 4’,5’. However, the rest of the angelicin's aromatic system cannot react with the pyrimidine of complementary strand owing to the unfavorable alignment of reactive double bonds. Lipids are also susceptible to the photoinduced reactions with angelicin which can be either aerobic or anaerobic. The aerobic reactions cause lipid peroxidation whereas the anaerobic pathway leads to the conjugation of angelicin with unsaturated fatty acid chains such as linolenic acid in a manner similar to the formation of pyrimidine adducts. Proteins were demonstrated to interact with angelicin in a non-covalent fashion. For instance, there is a measurable affinity of angelicin towards human serum albumin (19.10 × 104 mol−1L−1) which has one non-covalent binding site per angelicin molecule. The ultraviolet light (365 nm) facilitates its covalent binding to proteins which is enhanced in the presence of oxygen. At this wavelength, angelicin can also modify certain amino acids. == Toxicity == According to the MSDS of Sigma-Aldrich, the LD50 of angelicin is 322 mg/kg which shows acute toxicity if orally administered to rats. The possible consequences are alteration in circadian rhythm and righting reflex, ataxia and analgesia. Angelicin demonstrates phototoxic and photomutagenic effects when in contact with skin. It enhances the sensitivity of skin to UV light leading to severe skin damage such as erythema and blisters. Upon irradiation with UV light of longer wavelength, angelicin forms DNA monoadducts which can cause skin cancer. In contrast, the isomer of angelicin, psoralen, was reported to be five to ten times more active than angelicin and cross-link DNA . This impedes DNA replication more prominently due to the inability for the two strands of DNA helix to separate. Both psoralen and angelicin can be used in cancer therapeutics to suppress DNA replication in tumor cells and induce apoptosis – as mentioned in medical use – but they should be handled with care as they can cause photodermatitis in healthy cells as a side effect. In mammalian cell cultures, angelicin showed mutagenic and cytotoxic effects while playing a role of strong inhibitor of drug metabolism. The inhibition is due to the fact that angelicin decreases the activity and expression of CYP1A1 which is regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhR). There are three hypotheses proposed to explain the phenomenon: Angelicin attenuates the catalytic activity performed by CYP1A1 regardless the presence of UV light. Angelicin triggers the gene expression of CYP1A1 by activation of AhR when no UV light is available. Angelicin leads to CYP1A1 gene expression without the involvement of AhR. The phototoxic properties of angelicin were deployed by its use as a natural pesticide and disinfectant. Note that it is difficult to readily determine whether only angelicin poses the highest risk of phototoxicity and photomutagenicity as in plants angelicin always occurs in a mixture with angelicin derivatives, psoralen and other furanocoumarins. Moreover, the furanocoumarin composition of most plant species is not definitely known as well as the toxic properties of some furanocoumarins. == References ==",Angelicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01868630386888981), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.01815696805715561), (' FOOD', -0.03351544588804245), (',', -0.12707646191120148), (' INDUSTR', -0.029913058504462242), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.6169221997261047), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00020287363440729678), ('ĠMED', -0.07945331186056137), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47500741481781006)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.00861456897109747), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelicin ', [])"
3572,"('Pentamidine (isethionate)', 'Pentamidine', 'Pentacarinat', 'Pentamide', 'Nebupent')",Medical,"Pentamidine is an antimicrobial medication used to treat African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Balamuthia infections, babesiosis, and to prevent and treat pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in people with poor immune function. In African trypanosomiasis it is used for early disease before central nervous system involvement, as a second line option to suramin. It is an option for both visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Pentamidine can be given by injection into a vein or muscle or by inhalation. Common side effects of the injectable form include low blood sugar, pain at the site of injection, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, and kidney problems. Common side effects of the inhaled form include wheezing, cough, and nausea. It is unclear if doses should be changed in those with kidney or liver problems. Pentamidine is not recommended in early pregnancy but may be used in later pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is unclear. Pentamidine is in the aromatic diamidine family of medications. While the way the medication works is not entirely clear, it is believed to involve decreasing the production of DNA, RNA, and protein. Pentamidine came into medical use in 1937. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In regions of the world where trypanosomiasis is common pentamidine is provided for free by the World Health Organization (WHO). == Medical uses == Treatment of PCP caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii Prevention of PCP in adults with HIV who have one or both of the following: History of PCP CD4+ count ≤ 200mm³ Treatment of leishmaniasis Treatment of African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense Balamuthia infections Pentamidine is classified as an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration === Other uses === Use as an antitumor drug has also been proposed. Pentamidine is also identified as a potential small molecule antagonist that disrupts this interaction between S100P and RAGE receptor. === Special populations === ==== Pregnancy ==== It has not been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies when given intravenously. There are no controlled studies to show if pentamidine can harm the fetus in pregnant women. It is only recommended if the drug of choice trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated. ==== Breastfeeding ==== There is no information regarding the excretion of pentamidine in breast milk, but since the adverse effects on breastfed infants are unknown currently, it is recommended by the manufacturer for the infant to not be breastfed or for the mother to stop the drug. Risks versus benefits for the mother should be considered when making this decision. ==== Children ==== Pentamidine can be used in the prevention of PCP in children with HIV who cannot tolerate Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and can use a nebulizer. Intranvenous solutions of pentamidine should only be used in children with HIV older than 2 years old when other treatments are unavailable ==== Elderly ==== There is no data for the use of pentamidine in this specific population. == Contraindications == Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity to pentamidine isethionate == Side effects == === Common === Burning pain, dryness, or sensation of lump in throat Chest pain Coughing difficulty in breathing difficulty in swallowing skin rash wheezing === Rare === Nausea and vomiting Pain in upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back Severe pain in side of chest Shortness of breath === Others === Blood: Pentamidine frequently causes leukopenia and less often thrombopenia, which may cause symptomatic bleeding. Some cases of anemia, possibly related to folic acid deficiency, have been described. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, which may be severe. Severe or fatal arrhythmias and heart failure are quite frequent. Kidney: 25 percent develop signs of nephrotoxicity ranging from mild, asymptomatic azotemia (increased serum creatinine and urea) to irreversible renal failure. Ample fluids or intravenous hydration may prevent some nephrotoxicity. Liver: Elevated liver enzymes are associated with intravenous use of pentamidine. Hepatomegaly and hepatitis have been encountered with long term prophylactic use of pentamidine inhalation. Neurological: Dizziness, drowsiness, neuralgia, confusion, hallucinations, seizures and other central side effects are reported. Pancreas: Hypoglycemia that requires symptomatic treatment is frequently seen. On the other hand, pentamidine may cause or worsen diabetes mellitus. Respiratory: Cough and bronchospasm, most frequently seen with inhalation. Skin: Severe local reactions after extravasculation of intravenous solutions or following intramuscular injection treatment have been seen. Pentamidine itself may cause rash, or rarely Stevens–Johnson syndrome or Lyell syndrome. Eye discomfort, conjunctivitis, throat irritation, splenomegaly, Herxheimer reaction, electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypocalcemia). == Drug interactions == The additional or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs like aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, capreomycin, colistin, polymyxin B, vancomycin, foscarnet, or cisplatin should be closely monitored, or whenever possible completely avoided. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism seems to vary with different organisms and is not well understood. However, pentamidine is suspected to work through various methods of interference of critical functions in DNA, RNA, phospholipid and protein synthesis. Pentamidine binds to adenine-thymine-rich regions of the Trypanosoma parasite DNA, forming a cross-link between two adenines four to five base pairs apart. The drug also inhibits topoisomerase enzymes in the mitochondria of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Similarly, pentamidine inhibits type II topoisomerase in the mitochondria of the Trypanosoma parasite, resulting in a broken and unreadable mitochondrial genome. === Resistance === Strains of the Trypanosoma brucei parasite that are resistant to pentamidine have been discovered. Pentamidine is brought into the mitochondria through carrier proteins, and the absence of these carriers prevents the drug from reaching its site of action. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Pentamidine is completely absorbed when given intravenously or intramuscularly. When inhaled through a nebulizer, pentamidine accumulates in the bronchoalveolar fluid of the lungs at a higher concentration compared to injections. The inhaled form is minimally absorbed in the blood, but the effects of chronic inhaled administration on these levels are not known. Absorption is unreliable when given orally. === Distribution === When injected, pentamidine binds to tissues and proteins in the plasma. It accumulates in the kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands. Additionally, pentamidine does not reach curative levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. It has a volume of distribution of 286–1356 liters when given intravenously and 1658–3790 liters when given intramuscularly. Inhaled pentamidine is mainly recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the lungs. === Metabolism === Pentamidine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Up to 12% of pentamidine is eliminated in the urine unchanged. === Elimination === Pentamidine has an average half-life of five to eight hours when given intravenously and seven to eleven hours when given intramuscularly. However, these may increase with severe kidney problems. Pentamidine can remain in the system for as long as eight months after the first injection. == Chemistry == Pentamidine isethionate for injection is commercially available as a lyophilized, white crystalline powder for reconstitution with sterile water or 5% dextrose. After reconstitution, the mixture should be free from discoloration and precipitation. Reconstitution with sodium chloride should be avoided due to formation of precipitates. Intravenous solutions of pentamidine can be mixed with intravenous HIV medications like zidovidine and intravenous heart medications like diltiazem. However, intravenous solutions of antiviral foscarnet and antifungal fluconazole are incompatible with pentamidine. To avoid side-effects associated with intravenous administration, the solution should be slowly infused to minimize the release of histamine. == History == Pentamidine was first used to treat African trypanosomiasis in 1937 and leishmaniasis in 1940 before it was registered as pentamidine mesylate in 1950. The sudden increase in requests for use of pentamidine isethionate in then unlicensed form from the CDC in the early 1980s for treating Pneumocystis jirovecii in young male patients was key in identifying the emergence of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at that time. Its efficacy against Pneumocystis jirovecii was demonstrated in 1987, following its re-emergence on the drug market in 1984 in the current isethionate form. == Trade names and dose form == For oral inhalation and for nebulizer use: NebuPent Nebulizer (APP Pharmaceuticals LLC - US) For intravenous and intramuscular use: US and Canada: Pentacarinat 300 injection powder 300 mg vial (Avantis Pharma Inc - Canada) Pentam 300 (APP Pharmaceuticals LLC - US) Pentamidine isethionate 300 mg for injection (David Bull Laboratories LTD - Canada, Hospira Healthcare Corporation - Canada) International Brands: Pentamidine isethionate (Abbott) Pentacarinat (Sanofi-Aventis) Pentacrinat (Abbott) Pentam (Abbott) Pneumopent == See also == Netropsin Lexitropsin == References == == External links == ""Pentamidine"".

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive proliferation of keratinocytes and infiltration of immune cells. Although psoriasis has entered the era of biological treatment, there is still a need to explore more effective therapeutic targets and drugs due to the presence of resistance and adverse reactions to biologics. Remetinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, can maintain its potency within the skin with minimal systemic effects, making it a promising topical medication for treating psoriasis. But its effectiveness in treating psoriasis has not been evaluated. In this study, the topical application of remetinostat significantly improved psoriasiform inflammation in an imiquimod-induced mice model by inhibiting CD86 expression of CD11C The mainstay of treatment for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is surgical excision, which can result in significant associated morbidity, particularly for patients with recurrent tumors. We previously conducted a drug repositioning screen using molecular data from human BCCs and identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a potential treatment for BCC. Here we conduct the first proof-of-principle study of a topical pan-HDAC inhibitor, remetinostat, in human BCC. We conducted a phase II, open-label, single-arm, single-institution trial of a topical HDAC inhibitor. Participants with at least one BCC were recruited. All participants applied 1% remetinostat gel three times daily for 6 weeks, with measurements of tumor diameter conducted at baseline and week 8. Surgical excision of the remaining tumor was conducted at the end of the study and microscopic evaluation was performed. Thirty-three per-protocol tumors from 25 participants were included in the analysis. The overall response rate, defined as the proportion of tumors achieving more than 30% decrease in the longest diameter from baseline to week 8, was 69.7% [90% confidence interval (CI), 54%-82.5%]. On pathologic examination, 54.8% of tumors demonstrated complete resolution. Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated similar levels of acetylated histone H3 in skin tissue before and after treatment, however, phosphorylation was increased. No systemic adverse events were reported. The HDAC inhibitor remetinostat is a well-tolerated and effective topical treatment for reducing BCC disease burden in a clinically significant manner.

3577,"('Cefodizime', 'Cefodizima', 'Cefodizimum', 'Hr 221', 'Hr 221 [as sodium]')",Medical,"Cefodizime is a 3rd generation cephalosporin antibiotic with broad spectrum activity against aerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Clinically, it has been shown to be effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea. Cefodizime is a bactericidal antibiotic that targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1A/B, 2, and 3 resulting in the eventual death of the bacterial cell. In vivo experimental models of infection showed that bacterial clearance by this drug is at least as effective compared with other 3rd generation cephalosporins. It has similar adverse effect profile to other 3rd generation cephalosporins as well, mainly being limited to gastrointestinal or dermatological side effects. It is not currently approved by the FDA for use in the United States. == Efficacy and susceptibility == Cefodizime demonstrated superior clinical efficacy that what could be predicted from its in vitro experimental results. Certain immunomodulatory properties of the drug might account for its increased in vivo activity against specific bacterial species. These immunomodulatory properties stimulate some phagocyte and lymphocyte cellular functions when they have been impaired. It was shown in a 2004 study that cefodizime increased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in neutrophils stimulated by Klebsiella pneumoniae infection which then affected the production of cytokines in the stimulated cells. A 1992 study conducted in vitro susceptibility studies for cefodizime and found that gram negative bacteria with consistent susceptibility include: Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. In vitro susceptible gram positive bacteria include: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Cefodizime was shown to be ineffective in vitro against Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Gram positive bacteria it was inactive against include Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus. In this trial, bacteria were considered susceptible if 90% or more of the strains were inhibited by cefodizime concentrations of at least 8 mg/L in vitro. == Pharmacokinetics == Intramuscular cefodizime bioavailability ranges from 90% to 100%. It distributes into many tissues and is approximately 81% bound to plasma proteins, chiefly albumin. The drug reaches minimum inhibitory concentrations approximately 2–3 hours after administration, maintaining it for several hours afterwards. Clearance of cefodizime from the body is predominantly renal, with the majority of the drug excreted unchanged within the first 12 hours. More specifically, cefodizime is mainly cleared via glomerular filtration in the kidney, in addition to some tubular secretion. In patients with normal renal function, the terminal phase elimination half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. == Adverse effects == Cefodizime has been shown to be generally well tolerated in drug trials and its adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal or dermatological. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in 2.4% of patients during clinical trials and included: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and elevated transaminases. Allergic symptoms were observed in 1.1% of patients and include: exanthema, urticaria, and pruritus. Other adverse effects observed include local site reactions, pain at site of injection, and phlebitis. == Administration == Cefodizime is available as an intramuscular injection or as an intravenous bolus or infusion and is usually given 1 or 2 times a day. In clinical trials, the most frequently used adult dosages ranged from 2 grams to 4 grams IM or IV per day given as a single dose or in 2 divided doses. == References ==",Cefodizime,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008048642775975168), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002687808300834149), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011861439561471343)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefodizime?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Cefodizime', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefodizime?utm_source=openai')])"
3578,"('Kavain', 'Kawain', 'Gonosan', 'Kavain, dl-', 'Kawaih')","Food, Medical","Kavain is the main kavalactone found mostly in the roots of the kava plant. == Pharmacology == Kavain has anticonvulsive properties, attenuating vascular smooth muscle contraction through interactions with voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels. How this effect is mediated, and to what extent this mechanism is involved in the anxiolytic and analgesic effects of kavalactones on the central nervous system, is unknown. The recent finding that kavain can reversibly inhibit both monoamine oxidase A and monoamine oxidase B suggests that kavain may exert some of its effects by modulating serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine signaling. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the psychotropic, sedative, and anxiolytic actions of kavain and related kavalactones are still debated. Direct binding to the benzodiazepine/flumazenil binding site of the GABA-A receptor does not occur with kavain enantiomers. Many studies involved kava extracts from different plant parts and are, therefore, not applicable to kavain itself. In 2016, kavain was shown to bind at the extrasynaptic α4β2δ GABAA receptor and potentiate GABA efficacy, similarly to barbiturates. A comparative review of in-vivo studies with kavain (and related kavapyrones) to commonly used antiepileptic drugs and mood stabilizers affecting ion fluxes indicates that the kavapyrones are weakly Na+ antagonistic and therefore antiepileptic. They also have pronounced L- type Ca2+ channel antagonistic properties and act as a positive modulator of the early K+ outward current, which contribute to mood stabilizing properties similar to lamotrigine. Kavain and analogs remain interesting for drug discovery against a variety of cellular targets, including P-glycoprotein (Pgp), cytochrome P450, and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes among others. == See also == 5,6-dehydrokavain == References ==",Kavain,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.6384437680244446), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0009120595059357584), (' FOOD', -6.2729995988775045e-06)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.6059854030609131), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.001207814086228609), ('ĠMED', -0.23320023715496063), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03805793821811676)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.029750484973192215), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3579,"('Triclosan', 'Cloxifenolum', 'Irgasan', 'Triclosanum', 'Irgasan dp300')","Medical, Personal Care","Triclosan (sometimes abbreviated as TCS) is an antibacterial and antifungal agent present in some consumer products, including toothpaste, soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. It is similar in its uses and mechanism of action to triclocarban. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent, the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and its possible role in disrupted hormonal development remains controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health. Triclosan was developed in 1966. A 2006 study recommended showering with 2% triclosan as a regimen in surgical units to rid patients' skin of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). == Uses == Triclosan was used as a hospital scrub in the 1970s. Prior to its change in regulatory status in the EU and US, it had expanded commercially and was a common ingredient in soaps (0.10–1.00%), shampoos, deodorants, toothpastes, mouthwashes, cleaning supplies, and pesticides. It also was part of consumer products, including kitchen utensils, toys, bedding, socks, and trash bags. Triclosan was registered as a pesticide in 1969. U.S. EPA registration numbers are required for all EPA-registered pesticides. As of 2017, there were five registrations for triclosan with the EPA. Currently, there are 20 antimicrobial registrations with the EPA under the regulations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The antimicrobial active ingredient is added to a variety of products where it acts to slow or stop the growth of bacteria, fungi, and mildew. In commercial, institutional, and industrial equipment uses, triclosan is incorporated in conveyor belts, fire hoses, dye bath vats, or ice-making equipment as an antimicrobial. Triclosan may be directly applied to commercial HVAC coils, where it prevents microbial growth that contributes to product degradation. In the United States, by 2000, triclosan and triclocarban (TCC) could be found in 75% of liquid soaps and 29% of bar soaps, and as of 2014 triclosan was used in more than 2,000 consumer products. In healthcare, triclosan is used in surgical scrubs and hand washes. Use in surgical units is effective with a minimum contact time of approximately two minutes. More recently, showering with 2% triclosan has become a recommended regimen in surgical units for the decolonization of patients whose skin carries methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Two small uncontrolled case studies reported the use of triclosan correlated with reduction in MRSA infections. Triclosan is also used in the coatings for some surgical sutures. There is good evidence these triclosan-coated sutures reduce the risk of surgical site infection. The World Health Organization, the American College of Surgeons and the Surgical Infection Society point out the benefit of triclosan-coated sutures in reducing the risk for surgical site infection. Triclosan has been employed as a selective agent in molecular cloning. A bacterial host transformed by a plasmid harboring a triclosan-resistant mutant FabI gene (mFabI) as a selectable marker can grow in presence of high dose of triclosan in growth media. === Effectiveness === In surgery, triclosan coated sutures reduce the risk of surgical site infection. Some studies suggest that antimicrobial hand soaps containing triclosan provide a slightly greater bacterial reduction on the hands compared to plain soap. As of 2013, the US FDA had found clear benefit to health for some consumer products containing triclosan, but not in others; for example the FDA had no evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water. A Cochrane review of 30 studies concluded that triclosan/copolymer-containing toothpastes produced a 22% reduction in both dental plaque and gingival inflammation when compared with fluoride toothpastes without triclosan/copolymer. There was weak evidence of a reduction in tooth cavities, and no evidence of reduction in periodontitis. A study of triclosan toothpastes did not find any evidence that it causes an increase in serious adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks. A study by Colgate-Palmolive found a significant reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, and plaque with the use of triclosan-containing toothpaste. An independent review by the Cochrane group suggests that the reduction in gingivitis, bleeding, and plaque is statistically significant (unlikely to occur by chance) but not clinically significant (unlikely to provide noticeable effects). Triclosan is used in food storage containers: 417–423 although this use is banned in the European Union since 2010. Veterinary use as a biocidal product in the EU is governed by the Biocidal Products Directive. == Chemical structure and properties == This organic compound is a white powdered solid with a slight aromatic, phenolic odor. Categorized as a polychloro phenoxy phenol, triclosan is a chlorinated aromatic compound that has functional groups representative of both ethers and phenols. Phenols often demonstrate antibacterial properties. Triclosan is soluble in ethanol, methanol, diethyl ether, and strongly basic solutions such as a 1M sodium hydroxide solution, but only slightly soluble in water. Triclosan can be synthesized from 2,4-dichlorophenol. === Synthesis === Under a reflux process, 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-methoxydiphenyl ether is treated with aluminium chloride. The United States Pharmacopeia formulary has published a monograph for triclosan that sets purity standards. == Mechanism of action == At high concentrations, triclosan acts as a biocide with multiple cytoplasmic and membrane targets. However, at the lower concentrations seen in commercial products, triclosan appears bacteriostatic, and it targets bacteria primarily by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. Triclosan binds to bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme, which is encoded by the gene fabI. This binding increases the enzyme's affinity for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This results in the formation of a stable, ternary complex of ENR-NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acids are necessary for building and reproducing cell membranes. Vertebrates do not have an ENR enzyme and thus are not affected by this mode of action. === Endocrine disruptor === Triclosan has been found to be a weak endocrine disruptor, though the relevance of this to humans is uncertain. The compound has been found to bind with low affinity to both the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor, where both agonistic and antagonistic responses have been observed. === Efflux pump inducer === Triclosan may upregulate or induce efflux pumps in bacteria causing them to become resistant against variety of other antibiotics. == Exposure == Humans are exposed to triclosan through skin absorption when washing hands or in the shower, brushing teeth, using mouthwash or doing dishes, and through ingestion when swallowed. When triclosan is released into the environment, additional exposure to the chemical is possible through ingesting plants grown in soil treated with sewage sludge, or eating fish exposed to it. An article from the American Society of Agronomy refers to a study done by Monica Mendez et al., in which the researchers irrigated plants with water containing triclosan and months later found it in all edible parts of tomato and onion plants. Triclosan is found to kill a wide spectrum of bacteria, and the researchers are also concerned about the effect it has on the beneficial bacteria in soil. == Distribution, metabolism, and elimination == Once absorbed, triclosan is metabolized by humans primarily through conjugation reactions into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates that are excreted in feces and urine. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that triclosan sulfate and glucuronide may be formed in the liver at approximately equal rates at the environmentally relevant concentration of 1 to 5 microMolar. When concentrations of triclosan are below 1 microMolar, sulfonation is expected to be the major metabolic pathway for elimination. == Health concerns == Because of potential health concerns, due to the possibility of antimicrobial resistance, endocrine disruption and other issues as listed below, triclosan has been designated as a ""contaminant of emerging concern (CEC)"" by the United States Geological Survey, meaning it is under investigation for public health risk. ""Emerging contaminants"" can be broadly defined as any synthetic or naturally occurring chemical or any microorganism that is not commonly monitored in the environment but has the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological or human health effects. Triclosan is thought to accumulate in wastewater and return to drinking water, thus propagating a buildup that could cause increasing effects with ongoing use. In the United States, after a decades-long review of the potential health issues from this contaminant of emerging concern, the FDA ruled on September 6, 2016, that 19 active ingredients including triclosan are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE). (See policy section below). === Allergic === Triclosan has been associated with a higher risk of food allergy. This may be because exposure to bacteria reduces allergies, as predicted by the hygiene hypothesis, and not caused by toxicology of triclosan itself. This effect may also occur with chlorhexidine gluconate and PCMX, among other antibacterial agents. Other studies have linked triclosan to allergic contact dermatitis in some individuals. Additionally, triclosan concentrations have been associated with allergic sensitization, especially inhalant and seasonal allergens, rather than food allergens. === By-product exposure === Triclosan can react with the free chlorine in chlorinated tap water to produce lesser amounts of other compounds, such as 2,4-dichlorophenol. Some of these intermediates convert into dioxins upon exposure to UV radiation (from the sun or other sources). The dioxins that can form from triclosan are not thought to be congeners of toxicologic concern for mammals, birds and fish. === Hormonal === Concerns on the health effects of triclosan have been raised after it was detected in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. Studies on rats have shown that triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses. There have been many studies performed over the years both in vivo and in vitro, in male and female fish and rats and they support the conclusion that triclosan possesses (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic properties depending on species, tissues, and cell types. Human studies on triclosan and hormone effects are fewer in number than those on animals, but are being conducted. In a 2017 study on 537 pregnant women in China, prenatal triclosan exposure was associated with increased cord testosterone levels in the infants. == History == Triclosan (TCS) was patented in 1964 by Swiss company Ciba-Geigy. The earliest known safety testing began in 1968. It was introduced the next year, mainly for use in hospitals, and was in worldwide production and use by the early 1970s. In 1997 Ciba-Geigy merged with another Swiss company, Sandoz, to form Novartis. During the merger, Ciba-Geigy's chemical business was spun off to become Ciba Specialty Chemicals, which was acquired in 2008 by chemical giant BASF. BASF currently manufactures TCS under the brand name Irgasan DP300. == Environmental concerns == === Treatment and disposal === Exposure to triclosan in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, triclosan is sent to municipal sewage treatment plants, where, in the United States, about 97–98% of triclosan is removed. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclosan (170,000–970,000 kg/yr) can escape from wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. In a study on effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, approximately 75% of triclocarban was present in sewage sludge. This poses a potential environmental and ecological hazard, particularly for aquatic systems. The volume of triclosan, in the United States, re-entering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is 44,000 ± 60,000 kg/yr. Triclosan can attach to other substances suspended in aquatic environments, which potentially endangers marine organisms and may lead to further bioaccumulation. Ozone is considered to be an effective tool for removing triclosan during sewage treatment. As little triclosan is released through plastic and textile household consumer products, these are not considered to be major sources of triclosan contamination. During wastewater treatment, a portion of triclosan is degraded, while the remainder adsorbs to sewage sludge or exits the plant as effluent. A mass balance in Athens (Greece) Sewage Treatment Plant (2013) showed that 43% of triclosan is accumulated to the primary and secondary sludge, 45% is lost due to degradation while the rest 12% is discharged to the environment via the secondary treated wastewater. In the environment, triclosan may be degraded by microorganisms or react with sunlight, forming other compounds, which include chlorophenols and dioxins. During 1999 to 2000, US Geological Survey detected TCS in 57.6% of streams and rivers sampled. === Bioaccumulation === While studies using semi-permeable membrane devices have found that triclosan does not strongly bioaccumulate, methyl-triclosan is comparatively more stable and lipophilic and thus poses a higher risk of bioaccumulation. The ability of triclosan to bioaccumulate is affected by its ionization state in different environmental conditions. Global warming may increase uptake and effects of triclosan in aquatic organisms. === Ecotoxicity === Triclosan is toxic to aquatic bacteria at levels found in the environment. It is highly toxic to various types of algae and has the potential to affect the structure of algal communities, particularly immediately downstream of effluents from wastewater treatment facilities that treat household wastewaters. Triclosan has been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins. It has also been found in land animals including earthworms and species higher up the food chain. In toxicity experiments with Vibrio fischeri marine bacterium, an EC50 value of TCS equal to 0.22 mg/L has been determined. Few data are available for the long-term toxicity of TCS to algae, daphnids and fish, while enough data are available for its acute toxicity on these groups of organisms. A 2017 study that used risk quotient (RQ) methodology and evaluated the ecological threat due to the discharge of wastewater containing TCS in European rivers, reported that the probability that RQ values exceeds 1 ranged from 0.2% (for rivers with dilution factor of 1000) to 45% (for rivers with dilution factor 2). Triclosan favors anaerobic conditions which is typical in soil and sediment. The antimicrobial properties of Triclosan are resistant to anaerobic degradation which is the main contributor to its persistence in the environment. == Resistance concerns == Concern pertains to the potential for cross-resistance (or co-resistance) to other antimicrobials. Numerous studies have been performed and there have been results indicating that the use of biocidal agents, such as triclosan, can cause cross-resistance. A study done in a wide range of bacteria and different classes of antibiotics showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, already resistant to triclosan, had increased resistance against antibiotics tetracycline and norfloxacin when exposed to triclosan. Results from a study published in The American Journal of Infection Control showed that exposure to triclosan was associated with a high risk of developing resistance and cross-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This was not observed with exposure to chlorhexidine or a hydrogen peroxide-based agent (during the conditions in said study). == Alternatives == A comprehensive meta-analysis published in 2007 indicated that, in community settings, plain soap was no less effective than soaps containing triclosan for ""preventing infectious illness symptoms and reducing bacterial levels on the hands."". Nonorganic antibiotics and organic biocides are effective alternatives to triclosan, such as silver and copper ions and nanoparticles. == Policy == In the US, triclosan is regulated as a pesticide by the EPA and as a drug by the FDA. The EPA generally regulates uses on solid surfaces, and FDA regulations cover uses in personal care products. In 1974, the US FDA began the drug review monograph process for ""over-the-counter (OTC) topical antimicrobial products"", including triclosan and triclocarban. The advisory panel first met on June 29, 1972, and the agency published its proposed rule on Sept 13, 1974. The initial rule applied to, ""OTC products containing antimicrobial ingredients for topical human use, which includes soaps, surgical scrubs, skin washes, skin cleansers, first aid preparations and additional products defined by the panel."" The proposed rule lists dozens of products that were already on the market at the time and the firms that produced them. In 1978 the FDA published a tentative final monograph (TFM) for topical antimicrobial products. The record was re-opened in March 1979 to take into account six comments the agency received during the period for submitting objections to the TFM, including new data submitted by Procter & Gamble on the safety and effectiveness of triclocarban and by Ciba-Geigy on the proliferation of use of triclosan. The document states that, ""significant amounts of new and previously unconsidered data were submitted with each of the above petitions."" It was re-opened again in October of that year to permit interested persons to submit further data establishing conditions for the safety, effectiveness and labeling of over-the-counter topical antimicrobial products for human use. The next document issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, the ""FDA is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. The FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative record for this rulemaking. The FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips."" In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products. In 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council forced the FDA to review triclosan after suing the agency for its inaction. Because the FDA prohibited hexachlorophene, a compound similar to triclosan, Halden and others argued that the FDA should also ban triclosan. On December 17, 2013, the FDA issued a draft rule revoking the generally recognized as safe status of triclosan as an ingredient in hand wash products, citing the need for additional studies of its potential endrocrine and developmental effects; impact on bacterial resistance; and carcinogenic potential. On September 6, 2016, 44 years after its initial proposed rule, the FDA issued a final rule establishing that 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic products intended for use with water (aka consumer antiseptic washes) are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE) and are misbranded, and are new drugs for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act are required for marketing. Companies have one year to reformulate products without these ingredients, take them off the market or submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for the products. The 19 ingredients are: Cloflucarban Fluorosalan Hexachlorophene Hexylresorcinol Iodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate) Iodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol) Methylbenzethonium chloride Nonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine Phenol (greater than 1.5 percent) Phenol (less than 1.5 percent) Poloxamer-iodine complex Povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent Secondary amyltricresols Sodium oxychlorosene Tribromsalan Triclocarban Triclosan Triple dye (an antiseptic applied to the umbilical region of newborn infants) Undecoylium chloride iodine complex In 2015 and 2016 FDA also issued proposed rules to amend the 1994 TFM regarding the safety and effectiveness of OTC health care antiseptics and OTC consumer antiseptic rubs. The state of Minnesota took action against triclosan in advance of a federal rule. In May 2014, the governor signed a bill banning triclosan-containing products in the state. A CNN article quotes the new law, ""In order to prevent the spread of infectious disease and avoidable infections and to promote best practices in sanitation, no person shall offer for retail sale in Minnesota any cleaning product that contains triclosan and is used by consumers for sanitizing or hand and body cleansing."" The law goes into effect on January 1, 2017. The exceptions to this rule are individual products that have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for consumer use. In light of mounting evidence on the human health and ecotoxic effects of triclosan, some companies reformulated to remove it in advance of regulation: Colgate-Palmolive removed it from Palmolive Dish Soap and Softsoap in 2011 (but it remained in Colgate Total toothpaste until late 2018 or early 2019); Johnson & Johnson removed it from baby products in 2012 and all products in 2015; Procter & Gamble from all products in 2014; in 2014 it was removed from Clearasil and Avon began phasing it out; and Unilever removed it from skin care and cleansing products in 2015, and says oral care by 2017. In Canada, triclosan is allowed in cosmetics, though FDA's recent announcement has prompted Health Canada spokeswoman Maryse Durette to state in an e-mail to Toronto newspaper The Globe and Mail that, ""the government will publish a final assessment of the safety of triclosan 'in the near future' and take further action 'if warranted.'"" Health Canada maintains a Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, including hundreds of chemicals that are not allowed or whose use is restricted in cosmetics. The list states that triclosan is currently allowed in cosmetics up to 0.3%, and 0.03% in mouthwashes and other oral products with required warnings to avoid swallowing and not for use in children under the age of 12. Triclosan was not approved by the European Commission as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 1 in January 2016. In the United States, manufacturers of products containing triclosan must indicate its presence on the label. In Europe, triclosan is regulated as a cosmetic preservative and must be listed on the label. Usage of triclosan in cosmetic products was restricted by the EU commission in 2014. == See also == == References ==",Triclosan,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, FOOD', [('IND', -0.9009078741073608), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.16308584809303284), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.00408516637980938), (' MED', -0.08895047754049301), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5765491724014282), (' FOOD', -6.110668618930504e-05)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.35374101996421814), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -2.884823152271565e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -0.030640101060271263), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.00408434122800827), ('ĠINDU', -0.002016060519963503), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10036110877990723)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.014168208464980125), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -7.493430894101039e-05), (' INDUSTR', -7.584239938296378e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan?utm_source=openai), [epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/triclosan?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=27, title='5 Things to Know About Triclosan | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=27, title='Triclosan | US EPA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/triclosan?utm_source=openai')])"
3580,"('Prostaglandin e2', 'Dinoprostone', 'Prostin e2', 'Prepidil', 'Minprostin e2')","Endogenous, Medical","Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), also known as dinoprostone, is a naturally occurring prostaglandin with oxytocic properties that is used as a medication. Dinoprostone is used in labor induction, bleeding after delivery, termination of pregnancy, and in newborn babies to keep the ductus arteriosus open. In babies it is used in those with congenital heart defects until surgery can be carried out. It is also used to manage gestational trophoblastic disease. It may be used within the vagina or by injection into a vein. PGE2 synthesis within the body begins with the activation of arachidonic acid (AA) by the enzyme phospholipase A2. Once activated, AA is oxygenated by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes to form prostaglandin endoperoxides. Specifically, prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) is modified by the peroxidase moiety of the COX enzyme to produce prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) which is then converted to PGE2. Common side effects of PGE2 include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and excessive uterine contraction. In babies there may be decreased breathing and low blood pressure. Caution should be taken in people with asthma or glaucoma and it is not recommended in those who have had a prior C-section. It works by binding and activating the prostaglandin E2 receptor which results in the opening and softening of the cervix and dilation of blood vessels. Prostaglandin E2 was first synthesized in 1970 and approved for medical use by the FDA in the United States in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Prostaglandin E2 works as well as prostaglandin E1 in babies. == Physiological effects == Dinoprostone has important effects in labor by inducing softening of the cervix and causing uterine contraction, and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Natural prostaglandins, including PGE1 and PGE2, are important in the structure and function of the ductus arteriosus in fetuses and newborns. They allow the ductus arteriosus to remain open, providing the necessary connection between the pulmonary artery and descending aorta that allows the blood to bypass the fetus's underdeveloped lungs and be transported to the placenta for oxygenation. The ductus arteriosus normally begins to close upon birth due to an increase of PGE2 metabolism, but in newborns with congenital heart disease, prostaglandins can be used to keep the ductus arteriosus open longer than normal to sustain healthy oxygen saturation levels in the blood. Although PGE1 is more commonly used in this setting, there has been a report of oral PGE2 being used to treat ductus-dependent congenital heart diseases in newborns to delay surgical treatment until the pulmonary arteries grew. In addition, PGE2 was used in another report to dilate the ductus arteriosus in newborns with various cardiovascular defects to allow for better perfusion of the lungs and kidneys. On the other hand, the post-partal synthesis of PGE2 in newborns is considered one cause of patent ductus arteriosus. When administered in aerosol form, PGE2 serves as a bronchodilator, but its use in this setting is limited by the fact that it also causes coughing. PGE2, similarly to PGE1, acts as a direct vasodilator by acting on smooth muscle to cause dilation of blood vessels. In addition, PGE2 inhibits platelet aggregation. PGE2 also suppresses T cell receptor signaling and proliferation, and may play a role in resolution of inflammation. In addition, PGE2 limits the immune response by preventing B-lymphocyte differentiation and their ability to present antigens. === Central and peripheral nervous systems effects === Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has a variety of functions within the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. When PGE2 interacts with EP3 receptors, it increases body temperature, resulting in fever. PGE2 is also a predominant prostanoid that contributes to inflammation via enhancing edema and leukocyte infiltration from increased vascular permeability (allowing more blood flow into an inflamed area of the body) when acting on EP2 receptors. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) blocks the activity of COX-2, resulting in a decrease of PGE2 production. NSAIDs blocking COX-2 and decreasing the production of PGE2 remediates fever and inflammation. Additionally, PGE2 acting on EP1 and EP4 receptors are a component in feeling pain via inflammatory nociception. When PGE2 binds to EP1 and EP4 receptors, an increase in excitability via cation channels as well as inhibition of hyperpolarizing potassium (K+) channels, increase membrane excitability. As a result, this causes peripheral nerve endings to report painful stimuli. === Immunity === As mentioned previously, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) contributes to the inflammation when bound to EP2 receptors. In terms of immunity, prostaglandins have the ability to regulate lymphocyte function. PGE2 affects T-lymphocyte formation by regulating apoptosis of immature thymocytes. In addition, it can suppress an immune response by inhibiting B lymphocytes from forming into antibody-secreting plasma cells. When this process is suppressed, it causes a decrease in a humoral antibody response because of the decrease in production of antibodies. PGE2 also has roles in inhibition of cytotoxic T-cell function, cell division of T-lymphocytes, and the development of TH1 lymphocytes. === Neurological effects === In response to physiologic and psychologic stress, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is involved in several inflammation and immunity pathways. As one of the most abundant prostaglandins in the body, PGE2 is involved almost all typical inflammation markers such as redness, swelling, and pain. It regulates these responses through binding to G coupled protein prostaglandin E2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4). The activation of these different EP receptors is dependent on the type of triggering stress stimuli and results in the corresponding stress response. Activation of EP1 via PGE2 results in the suppression of impulse behaviors in response to psychological stress. PGE2 is involved in regulating illness-induced memory impairment via activation of EP2. PGE2 activation of EP3 results in regulation of illness induced fever. EP4 is functionally similar to EP2 and has also been shown in studies to have a role in hypothermia and anorexia. In addition to inflammatory effects, PGE2 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects as well, due to its different actions on varying receptors. === Smooth muscle effects === Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) serves a significant role in vascular smooth muscle tone regulation. It is a vasodilator produced by endothelial cells. It promotes vasodilation of smooth muscles by increasing the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to decrease intracellular calcium levels via the IP and EP4 receptors. Conversely, PGE2 can also induce vasoconstriction via activation of EP1 and EP3 receptors, which activates the Ca2+ pathway and decreased cAMP activity. Within the gastrointestinal tract, PGE2 activates smooth muscles to cause contractions on longitudinal muscle when acting on EP3 receptors. In contrast, PGE2 effects on respiratory smooth muscle result in relaxation. === Kidney effects === Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), along with other prostaglandins, are synthesized within the cortex and medulla of the kidney. The role of renal COX-2-derived PGE2 within the kidney is to maintain renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through localized vasodilation. COX-2-derived prostanoids work to increase medullary blood flow as well as inhibit sodium reabsorption within kidney tubules. PGE2 also assists the kidneys with systemic blood pressure control by modifying water and sodium excretion. In addition, it is also thought to activate EP4 or EP2 to increase renin release, resulting in an elevation of GFR and sodium retention to raise systemic blood pressure levels within the body. == Medical uses == === Cervical ripening === In the setting of labor and delivery, cervical ripening (also known as cervical effacement) is a natural process that occurs before labor, in which the cervix becomes softer, thinner, and dilated, enabling the fetus to pass through the cervix. A ripe cervix is favorable prior to induction of labor, which is a common obstetric practice, and increases the chances for a successful induction. Pharmacological methods are sometimes required to induce cervical ripening that does not occur naturally. The natural ripening of the cervix is mediated by prostaglandins, thus a common pharmacological method is to use external prostaglandins such as PGE2, or dinoprostone. Results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature found that outpatient cervical ripening with dinoprostone or single-balloon catheters did not increase the risk of cesarean deliveries. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) achieves cervical ripening and softening by stimulating uterine contractions as well as directly acting on the collagenase present in the cervix to soften it. There are currently two formulations of PGE2 analog available for use in cervical ripening: Prepidil, a vaginal gel, and Cervidil, a vaginal insert. PGE2 is similar to oxytocin in terms of successful labor induction and the time from induction to delivery. === Termination of intrauterine pregnancy === PGE2 is a common pharmacological method of termination of pregnancy, particularly in the second trimester or for missed abortion, which is a miscarriage in which the fetus did not evacuate the uterus. However, PGE2 is not feticidal, and only induces abortion by stimulating uterine contractions. It is recommended that 20 mg of dinoprostone vaginal suppository be administered every three to five hours to evacuate the uterus. The abortion should occur within 24 hours after the beginning of administration of dinoprostone; if it does not, dinoprostone should no longer be given and other interventions would be required, such as dilation and curettage. == Side effects == A common side effect of prostaglandin E2 is its effect on gastrointestinal smooth muscle resulting in nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Other side effects include headache, shivering, and chills. The suppository form of prostaglandin E2 is associated with increased severity of these symptoms. Fever is also a common side effect with use of prostaglandin E2. Administration of prostaglandin E2 should be stopped if a person experiences side effects such as fever. The insert and gel forms have been shown to have minimal gastrointestinal effects, but are more associated with increase stimulation of the uterus as well as fetal distress. Uterine hyperstimulation is effectively treated by stopping use of prostaglandin E2. Other monitoring parameters include sustained uterine contractions and fetal distress. In babies there may be decreased breathing and low blood pressure. Care should be taken in people with asthma or glaucoma and it is not recommended in those who have had a prior C-section. == Mechanism of action == Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) binds to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 to cause various downstream effects to cause direct contractions in the myometrium. In addition, PGE2 inhibits Na+ absorption within the Thick Ascending Limb (TAL) of the Loop of Henle and ADH-mediated water transport in collecting tubules. As a result, blockage of PGE2 synthesis with NSAIDs can limit the efficacy of loop diuretics. == Administration == Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) should only be administered by, or under the direct supervision of, a physician and careful monitoring should be performed. PGE2 comes in many dosage forms with varying pharmacokinetic properties. For example PGE2 can come in a gel formulation that requires six hour dosing or it can come as a slow release dinoprostone pessary that does not need to be re-administered and can be taken out if necessary. In a quality improvement project done in UK, the switch from prostaglandin gel to the slow release dinoprostone pessary was able to lower cesarian section rates in women undergoing induction of labor in maternity care. For the vaginal insert (brand name Cervidil), the manufacturer recommends keeping the medication frozen until use since it does not need to be warmed to room temperature. Once the package is open, a water miscible lubricant may be used to insert the medication, using your finger place the device into the vagina and position the device transversely in the posterior vaginal fornix. The person receiving the drug should remain laying down for two hours after administration of the insert is complete. The manufacturer also recommends waiting 30 minutes after removal of insert before starting oxytocin. The vaginal gel (brand name Prostin E2, Canada) is administered through a prefilled syringe and the medication is placed in the posterior fornix of the vagina. After administration people should stay laying down for at least 30 minutes after they have received the drug. == Contraindications == Contraindications to a medication are any reasons to not use the drug. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is used to induce labor and should not be used in people that are contraindicated to give birth vaginally or spontaneous labor. PGE2 should not be used in people with allergies to prostaglandins or any components in the drugs formulations. PGE2 should be stopped before other oxytocic agents like oxytocin are given. Dinoprostone as a vaginal suppository is contraindicated for women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease or active disease of the cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, or renal systems. Caution is required for people with a history of cervical malignancy, hypo- or hypertension, anemia, epilepsy, jaundice, asthma, or pulmonary diseases. The suppository formulation is also not indicated for viable fetus evacuation. Endocervical gel is contraindicated in those with who have a history of C-sections or major uterine surgery, if the fetus is in distress and delivery is not imminent, vaginal bleeding throughout the pregnancy that is unexplained, history of difficult labors and deliveries, have cephalopelvic disproportion, less than six previous term babies with nonvertex presentation, hyper or hypotonic uterine patterns. == Toxicity == When prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is given in excess, hyper-stimulation of the uterus occurs and immediate discontinuation of the drug usually results in resolution of toxic effects. If symptoms continue a beta adrenergic drug (e.g. terbutaline) can be used. There are many different dosage forms of PGE2. The pharmacokinetic properties vary between dosage forms and should not be interchanged. A medication error was cited in the Institute for Safe Medication Practices where Prostin E2 was used in place of Cervidil. The hospital had run out of Cervidil which is a 10 mg endocervical insert and the provider decided to use half of a 20 mg Prostin E2 vaginal suppository. Cervidil delivers the drug at a constant rate and can be removed as necessary while Prostin E2 dissolves immediately and can not be removed. This error resulted in an emergency C-section since the fetus's heart rate dropped suddenly. == Pharmacokinetics == The synthetic PGE2 dinoprostone has a plasma half-life of approximately 2.5–5 minutes, after vaginal administration, with most metabolites being excreted in the urine. == History == Swedish physiologist Ulf von Euler and British physiologist M.W. Goldblatt, first discovered prostaglandins independently in 1935 as factors contained in human seminal fluid. Prostaglandins were noted for having blood pressure reducing effects and smooth muscle regulation effects. Prostaglandin E2 itself was identified in 1962 by Swedish biochemist Sune Bergström in the seminal fluid of sheep. The structure of prostaglandins is conserved in mammals, but it is also produced by marine organisms which allowed for more research into their biological roles. Prostaglandins were discovered to be products of arachidonic acid and with the ability to radio label arachidonic acid in the early 1960s, American chemist E.J. Corey was able to synthesize prostaglandin E2 in the lab in the 1970. This advancement paved the way for later studies that helped define the actions and response of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977 and it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Prostaglandin E2 was approved by the FDA in 1977. == References == == External links == ""Dinoprostone"". Drug Information Portal.

Bikinin was previously identified in a chemical genetics screen as an inhibitor targeting these kinases. To dissect the structural elements crucial for inhibition of GSK-3/Shaggy-like kinases by bikinin and to isolate more potent compounds we synthesised a number of related substances and tested their inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo using Arabidopsis thaliana. A pyridine ring with an amido succinic acid residue in position 2 and a halogen in position 5 were crucial for inhibitory activity. The compound with an iodine substituent in position 5, denoted iodobikinin, was most active in inhibiting BIN2 activity in vitro and efficiently induced brassinosteroid-like responses in vivo. Its methyl ester, methyliodobikinin, showed improved cell permeability, making it highly potent in vivo although it had lower activity in vitro. HPLC analysis revealed that the methyl residue was rapidly cleaved off in planta liberating active iodobikinin. In addition, we provide evidence that iodobikinin and bikinin are inactivated in planta by conjugation with glutamic acid or malic acid and that the latter process is catalysed by the malate transferase SNG1. Brassinosteroids participate in regulation of many aspects of plant development and in responses to environmental cues. Thus compounds modulating their action are valuable tools to study such processes and may be an interesting opportunity to modify plant growth and performance in horticulture and agronomy. Here we report the development of bikinin derivatives with increased potency that can activate BR signalling and mimic BR action. Methyliodobikinin was 3.4 times more active in vivo than bikinin. The main reason for the superior activity of methyliodobikinin, the most potent compound, is its enhanced plant tissue permeability. Inactivation of bikinin and its derivatives in planta involves SNG1, which constitutes a novel pathway for modification of xenobiotic compounds. Crops grown under stress conditions show restricted growth and, eventually, reduced yield. Among others, brassinosteroids (BRs) mitigate the effects of stress and improve plant growth. We used two barley cultivars with differing sensitivities to BRs, as determined by the lamina joint inclination test. Barley plants with the 2nd unfolded leaf were sprayed with a diluted series of bikinin, an inhibitor of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) family, which controls the BR signaling pathway. Barley was grown under salt stress conditions up to the start of the 5th leaf growth stage. The phenotypical, molecular, and physiological changes were determined. Our results indicate that the salt tolerance of barley depends on its sensitivity to BRs.

The present study aimed to characterize the metabolic profile of patients with gout using metabolomics, and to uncover the underlying pathological mechanisms leading to gout development. Serum samples were collected from 49 healthy participants and 47 patients with gout. Using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap Exploris mass spectrometer non-target metabolomics technology, with a variable importance in the projection >1 and a false discovery rate adjusted P<0.05 was used, while a biomarker panel was screened using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The potential differentially expressed markers related to gout were identified by ROC analysis, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, uric acid, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly different in the group of patients with gout compared with those in healthy individuals. A total of 186 differentially expressed metabolites were identified, with 156 differential metabolites upregulated and 30 downregulated in the patients with gout compared with healthy individuals. Pathway analysis demonstrated that D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism may serve key roles in gout. Compared with healthy people, the indolelactic acid (ILA) level of patients with gout was significantly higher. ILA may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of gout and could be used to detect or predict gout progression in the future.

However, the potential use of CX-5461 for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) treatment remains unknown. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of CX-5461 in lupus.

Previously we found that CX-5461 had anti-inflammatory activities. In this study we characterized potential immunosuppressive effects of CX-5461 and explored the underlying mechanisms. Allogeneic skin transplantation model (BALB/c to C57BL/6 mice) and heterotopic heart transplantation model (F344 to Lewis rats) were used. We showed that CX-5461 was a potent inhibitor of alloimmunity which prevented acute allograft rejections. CX-5461 treatment was invariably associated with expansion of the regulatory T cell population. In vitro, CX-5461 inhibited agonists-induced T cell activation. CX-5461 consistently inhibited the expression of interferon-γ and interleukin - 2, key mediators of T cell-mediated alloimmunity. Mechanistically, CX-5461-induced immunosuppression was, at least partly, dependent on the p53-DUSP5 (dual-specificity phosphatase 5) axis and subsequent antagonism of the Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

This study investigates the toxicodynamic earthworm at the enantiomeric level of hexythiazox. Earthworms exhibited notable enantioselectivity during the accumulation stage. Furthermore, the presence of earthworms can impact the rate of degradation and enantioselectivity of hexythiazox in soil. The accumulation of the two hexythiazox enantiomers in the earthworm adhered to the one-compartment model, whereas the elimination phase was governed by the first-order kinetics equation. Furthermore, it was discovered that there was no notable enantioselectivity observed during the elimination phase. The objective of this study was to collect baseline information for implementing an acaricide resistance management program of Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes) to hexythiazox in Brazilian citrus groves. The egg susceptibility of B. phoenicis to hexythiazox was measured by a direct contact bioassay. The estimated LC50 for the S strain was 0.89 mg hexythiazox L(-1) of water (95% FL 0.75-1.03). After hexythiazox selection of a field-collected population associated with intense hexythiazox use, a resistance ratio greater than 10,000-fold was detected. Results from a survey revealed a great variability in the frequency of resistance in populations of B. phoenicis collected from citrus groves located in the State of São Paulo. No relationship was observed between the intensity of hexythiazox use and the frequency of resistance. Studies on dynamics of resistance showed that the resistance of B. phoenicis to hexythiazox is stable under laboratory conditions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement resistance management of B. phoenicis to hexythiazox in order to prolong its effective use in Brazilian citrus groves. In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Gowan Crop Protection Limited submitted a request to the competent national authority in Finland to set an import tolerance for the active substance hexythiazox in blackberries and raspberries. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive maximum residue level (MRL) proposals of 3 mg/kg for raspberries and blackberries. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of hexythiazox in the plant matrices under consideration at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg.

It activates the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) and is potent, selective, and centrally active. It was the first selective KOR agonist approved for clinical use. It has also been dubiously referred to as the ""first non-narcotic opioid drug"" in history. == History == Nalfurafine was derived from structural modification of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. It was first synthesized and characterized in 1998, and was approved for clinical use in Japan as an intravenous drug under the brand name Remitch in 2009. The developer of nalfurafine also sought approval in Europe under the brand name Winfuran, but the Marketing Authorization Application was declined by the European Medicines Agency. The drug was originally developed as an analgesic in surgery, but while effective in animal models of nociception, it was repurposed as an antipruritic at lower treatment doses due to an apparently unacceptable incidence of sedative effects in humans. As of 2015, nalfurafine is also in clinical trials for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in Japan for patients with chronic liver disease, and for the treatment of uremic pruritus in the United States. == Effects == Unlike other KOR agonists, nalfurafine does not produce hallucinogenic effects in humans. Single intramuscular injections of up to 30 μg are well tolerated by humans, whereas a dose of 40 μg produced ""moderate behavioral/psychological side effects"" (possibly referring to sedation), though apparently did not produce any psychotomimetic or dysphoric effects. In rodents, a low dose of nalfurafine (10–40 μg/kg) was found not to produce conditioned place preference or aversion, though a high dose (80 μg/kg) did induce significant place aversion. The most common side effect of low-dose nalfurafine seen in clinical trials was insomnia (observed in 10–15% of patients), with few other adverse effects observed. In addition, tolerance to the antipruritic effects of nalfurafine was not found after treatment of patients with the drug for one year, and nalfurafine has shown no evidence of either physical nor psychological dependence in humans. The drug also shows lower evidence of tolerance for effects such as analgesia and sedation in animals relative to other KOR agonists. In animals, nalfurafine produces anti-scratch, antinociceptive, sedative, and diuretic effects. == Mechanism of action == Nalfurafine is an orally active, centrally acting, highly potent, selective full agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 75 pM; EC50 = 25 pM). As touched on above, nalfurafine shows atypical properties as a KOR agonist relative to other drugs. Notably, it does not completely substitute for the prototypical KOR agonist U-50488 in rodents, indicating qualitative differences in the discriminative effects of the two compounds. Moreover, unlike U-50488, it produces neither conditioned place aversion or preference in rodents. The drug is a 4,5-epoxymorphinan derivative, and is structurally unique relative to other KOR agonists. Nalfurafine may be a biased agonist of the KOR or a KOR subtype-selective agonist. Indeed, it has been found to act as a biased agonist of the KOR, preferring activation of β-arrestin signaling in vitro, but paradoxically, β-arrestin appears to be responsible for KOR agonist-induced aversion, and nalfurafine furthermore shows paradoxical effects in vivo that are not consistent with its in vitro profile. As such, more research is needed to clarify the distinct mechanisms and effects of this drug. Nalfurafine has been found in vitro to bind to the μ-opioid receptor and to possess weak partial agonist activity at this site, albeit with much lower affinity relative to the KOR. However, in vivo, nalfurafine has shown no indications of MOR agonism or antagonism in animals or humans, including no evidence of rewarding or reinforcing effects or physical dependence. == Research == Nalfurafine has been found to be effective in a variety of animal models relevant to drug abuse, addiction, and dependence, and may represent a novel potential treatment for these maladies. In rodents, the drug attenuates the discriminative and rewarding effects of cocaine and the rewarding and locomotor effects of morphine, and diminishes the mecamylamine-precipitated aversive effect of nicotine withdrawal. == See also == Asimadoline Butorphanol Difelikefalin Nalbuphine Nalmefene Naltriben Noribogaine RB-64 Salvinorin A == References ==",Nalfurafine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7179348762729205e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015151937259361148)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalfurafine,https://www.drugs.com/international/nalfurafine.html,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/nalfurafine ', [])"

The Wnt-signaling antagonist Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) has emerged as a crucial factor in the development and progression of osteolytic bone metastases. Although several signaling pathways have been implicated in promoting DKK-1 production in breast cancer cells, pharmacological interventions that interfere with tumor DKK-1 synthesis still remain scarce. In the current study, using an unbiased approach, we identified the small molecule Dorsomorphin as a potent suppressor of DKK-1 in several breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-Bone, MDA-MET and MCF7, respectively). Here, Dorsomorphin suppressed DKK-1 mRNA and protein production by 70 and 90%, respectively (p <0.001). Whereas bone morphogenic protein (BMP)- and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK)-signaling are two well-established targets of Dorsomorphin, we show that neither pathway is essentially involved in facilitating its inhibitory effects on DKK-1. In summary, we identified Dorsomorphin as a potent pharmacological inhibitor of DKK-1 production in breast cancer cells. Whether Dorsomorphin reflects a valuable therapeutic agent in breast cancer warrants further investigations. Colorectal cancer is a common malignant tumor with high mortality, for which chemotherapy resistance is one of the main reasons. The high expression of ABCG2 in the cancer cells and expulsion of anticancer drugs directly cause multidrug resistance (MDR). Therefore, the development of new ABCG2 inhibitors that block the active causes of MDR may provide a strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer. In this study, we find that dorsomorphin (also known as compound C or BML-275) potently inhibits the transporter activity of ABCG2, thereby preserving the chemotherapeutic agents mitoxantrone and doxorubicin to antagonize MDR in ABCG2-overexpressing colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, dorsomorphin does not alter ABCG2 protein expression. The results of molecular docking studies show that dorsomorphin is bound stably to the ABCG2-binding pocket, suggesting that dorsomorphin is a potent ABCG2 inhibitor that attenuates ABCG2-mediated MDR in colorectal cancer. Inflammatory pain is the most important clinical symptom of inflammatory diseases. Despite intensive research into inflammatory pain mechanisms, the majority of analgesics available are based on mechanistic classes of compounds that have been known for many years, as a result, inflammatory pain control remains a challenge for drug design in the context of clinically unmet needs in terms of safety and efficacy. A growing literature supports that pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling plays a crucial role in the development of inflammatory pain. Modulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine may hold the key to improved pain management. Previous studies have reported that dorsomorphin played key roles in inflammation. But the role of dorsomorphin in the formalin-induced inflammatory nociception in mice has never been reported. Here, we report a new function of dorsomorphin which can inhibit formalin-induced inflammatory nociception in mice.

In one study, fisetin content was highest in strawberries, with content also observed in apples, grapes, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Fisetin can be extracted from fruit juices, wines, and teas. It is also present in Pinophyta species such as the yellow cypress (Callitropsis nootkatensis). The average intake of fisetin from foods in Japan is about 0.4 mg per day. == Biosynthesis == Fisetin is a flavonoid, which is a polyphenol subgroup. Flavonoid synthesis begins with the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which phenylalanine, an amino acid, is transformed into 4-coumaroyl-CoA. This is the compound that enters the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Chalcone synthase, the first enzyme of this pathway, produces chalcone from 4-coumaroyl-CoA. All flavonoids are derived from this chalcone backbone (this family being the so-called chalconoids). The activity of different enzymes, including isomerases and hydroxylases, alter the backbone depending on the subclass of the flavonoid being produced. == Research == Although fisetin has been under laboratory research over several decades for its potential role in senescence or anticancer properties, among other possible effects, there is no clinical evidence that it provides any benefit to human health, as of 2018. == References ==",Fisetholz,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -1.0802738870552275e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INFO', [('FO', -0.0067795258946716785), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.5760368704795837), ('ĠINFO', -0.14328554272651672), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004698126285802573)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([spektrum.de](https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/arzneipflanzen-drogen/cotinus-coggygria/3435?utm_source=openai), [chembk.com](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/fisetholz?utm_source=openai), [supernahrung.com](https://supernahrung.com/fisetin/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=264, start_index=6, title='Cotinus coggygria - Lexikon der Arzneipflanzen und Drogen', type='url_citation', url='https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/arzneipflanzen-drogen/cotinus-coggygria/3435?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=264, start_index=6, title='fisetholz', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/fisetholz?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=264, start_index=6, title='Wirkstoff Fisetin (Fisetholz) » Anwendung, Wirkung & Empfehlung', type='url_citation', url='https://supernahrung.com/fisetin/?utm_source=openai')])"
3594,"('Nolatrexed dihydrochloride', 'Ag 337', 'Thymitaq')",Medical," To evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of nolatrexed in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Forty-eight patients were entered onto this study. Nolatrexed was administered every 3 weeks as a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of 725 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days. Doses were adjusted to maintain a dose level that produced > or = grade 2 toxicity. Response was assessed after every two cycles. Plasma pharmacokinetic samples were assayed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet method. Thirty-nine (81%) patients were evaluable for response. The mean number of cycles received was 2.8 (range 1-12). The mean dose intensity was 700 mg/m(2)/day (SD of 71). One patient had a partial response (2.6%) for 7 months. Eighteen (46%) patients had SD, 20 (51%) patients had progressive disease. The median duration of SD was 93 days. The median overall survival was 32 weeks [95% CI (22-37)]. The most frequent Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were stomatitis (25%), dehydration (23%) and asthenia (21%). There was no evidence of cumulative toxicity. The overall median plasma concentration (C (max)) was 14.20 microg/mL (range 1.41 to 119 microg /mL) with no accumulation observed between cycles 1-6. This phase II study of nolatrexed in advanced HCC patients, demonstrated minimal activity and significant stomatitis. Hence, it does not warrant further study as a single agent for this disease. A clinical study of nolatrexed dihydrochloride (AG337, Thymitaq) in combination with paclitaxel was performed. The aims were to optimize the schedule of administration and determine any pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between the two drugs. In vitro combination studies were performed to assist with schedule optimization. Three patients were entered on each of three different schedules of administration of the two drugs: (1) paclitaxel 0-3 h, nolatrexed 24-144 h; (2) nolatrexed 0-120 h, paclitaxel 48-51 h; (3) nolatrexed 0-120 h, paclitaxel 126-129 h. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 80 mg m(-2) over 3 h and nolatrexed at a dose of 500 mg m(-2) day(-1) as a 120-h continuous intravenous infusion. Plasma concentrations of both drugs were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro growth inhibition studies using corresponding schedules were performed using two head and neck cancer cell lines. In both HNX14C and HNX22B cell lines, synergistic growth inhibition was observed on schedule 2, whereas schedules 1 and 3 demonstrated antagonistic effects. In the clinical study, there was no effect of schedule on the pharmacokinetics of nolatrexed. However, patients on schedules 1 and 3 had a higher clearance of paclitaxel (322-520 ml min(-1) m(-2)) than those on schedule 2 (165-238 ml min(-1) m(-2)). Peak plasma concentrations (1.66-1.93 vs. 0.86-1.32 microM) and areas under the curve (392-565 vs. 180-291 microM min(-1)) of paclitaxel were correspondingly higher on schedule 2. The pharmacokinetic interaction was confirmed by studies with human liver microsomes, nolatrexed being an inhibitor of the major routes of metabolism of paclitaxel. Toxicity was not schedule-dependent. Nolatrexed and paclitaxel may be safely given together when administered sequentially at the doses used in this study. Studies in vitro suggest some synergy, however, due to a pharmacokinetic interaction, paclitaxel doses should be reduced when administered during nolatrexed infusion. A phase I study of nolatrexed, administered as a continuous 5 day intravenous infusion every 28 days, has been undertaken for children with advanced malignancy. 16 patients were treated at 3 dose levels; 420, 640 and 768 mg/m(2)24 h(-1). 8 patients were evaluable for toxicity. In the 6 patients treated at 768 mg/m(2)24 h(-1), dose-limiting oral mucositis and myelosuppression were observed. Plasma nolatrexed concentrations and systemic exposure, measured in 14 patients, were dose related, with mean AUC values of 36 mg(-1)ml(-1)min(-1), 50 mg ml(-1)min(-1)and 80 mg ml(-1)min(-1)at the 3 dose levels studied. Whereas no toxicity was encountered if the nolatrexed AUC was <45 mg ml(-1)min(-1), Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed with AUC values of >60 mg ml(-1)min(-1). Elevated plasma deoxyuridine levels, measured as a surrogate marker of thymidylate synthase inhibition, were seen at all of the dose levels studied. One patient with a spinal primitive neuroectodermal tumour had stable disease for 11 cycles of therapy, and in two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia a short-lived 50% reduction in peripheral lymphoblast counts was observed. Nolatrexed can be safely administered to children with cancer, and there is evidence of therapeutic activity as well as antiproliferative toxicity. Phase II studies of nolatrexed in children at the maximum tolerated dose of 640 mg/m(2)24 h(-1)are warranted.",Nolatrexed dihydrochloride,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017832119192462415), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00408825883641839)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16957834/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9508200/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9918208/,https://www.nature.com/articles/6690146,https://www.nature.com/articles/6691569,https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/5/1/111/287439/Phase-I-Studies-with-the-Nonclassical-Antifolate ', [])"

The precise mechanism of this coagulopathy remains unclear; one hypothesis is that loss of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity during viral endocytosis leads to pro-inflammatory angiotensin-II accumulation, loss of angiotensin-1-7 and subsequent vascular endothelial activation. We undertook a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled experimental medicine study to assess the effect of TRV027, a synthetic angiotensin-1-7 analogue on D-dimer in 30 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The study showed a similar rate of adverse events in TRV027 and control groups. There was a numerical decrease in D-dimer in the TRV027 group and increase in D-dimer in the placebo group; however, this did not reach statistical significance (P = .15). A Bayesian analysis demonstrated that there was a 92% probability that this change represented a true drug effect. TRV027 is a biased agonist for the Angiotensin (Ang)-II type 1 receptor (AT TRV027 is a novel β-arrestin biased peptide ligand of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The compound antagonizes G protein coupling while simultaneously stimulating β-arrestin-mediated signaling. In preclinical studies, TRV027 reversibly reduced blood pressure while preserving renal function in a dog tachypaced heart failure model and stimulating cardiomyocyte contractility in vitro. This profile suggests that TRV027 may have unique benefits in acute heart failure, a condition associated with renin-angiotensin system activation. A first-time-in-human study was conducted with ascending doses of TRV027 to explore its tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy volunteers. Subjects' salt intake was restricted to stimulate RAS activation. In this study TRV027 was safe and well tolerated with a short-half-life (ranging between 2.4 and 13.2 minutes) and dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure. Consistent with the pre-clinical findings, TRV027 reduced blood pressure to a greater degree in subjects with RAS activation, measured as elevated plasma renin activity, than in those with normal PRA levels. This study in sodium-restricted healthy subjects suggests that TRV027 will successfully target a core mechanism of acute heart failure pathophysiology.

3596,"('Selpercatinib', 'Retevmo', 'Serpercatinib', 'Retevmo (tn)', 'Selpercatinib [inn]')",Medical,"Selpercatinib, sold under the brand name Retevmo among others, is a targeted medication for the treatment of cancers in people whose tumors have an alteration (mutation or fusion) in a specific gene (RET which is short for ""rearranged during transfection""). Before beginning treatment, the identification of a RET gene alteration must be determined using laboratory testing. Selpercatinib is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include changes in laboratory tests (including increased liver enzymes, increased blood sugar, decreased white cell and platelet counts, decreased protein level, decreased calcium, increased total cholesterol, increased creatinine, and decreased sodium) dry mouth, diarrhea, high blood pressure, fatigue, edema, rash, and constipation. Selpercatinib is a RET kinase inhibitor, meaning it inhibits the protein RET receptor kinase, which is mutated in the cancer cells and provides them with growth signals. Blocking the RET kinase blocks the main growth signal for cancer cells and thereby prevents them from dividing. Selpercatinib is the first therapy approved specifically for people with cancer harboring RET gene alterations. Selpercatinib received accelerated approval for this indication for patients aged twelve years of age and older in 2020. In June 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration granted traditional approval to selpercatinib for people aged two years of age and older. == Medical uses == In the United States, selpercatinib is indicated for the treatment of: adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a rearranged during transfection (RET) gene fusion, as detected by an FDA-approved test. people aged twelve years of age and older with advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with a RET mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, who require systemic therapy. people aged twelve years of age and older with advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer with a RET gene fusion, as detected by an FDA-approved test, who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate). adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a rearranged during transfection (RET) gene fusion that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. In the European Union, selpercatinib, as monotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of adults with: advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib and for the treatment of people aged twelve years of age and older with advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. In September 2024, the FDA granted traditional approval to selpercatinib for people aged two years of age and older with advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer with a RET mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, who require systemic therapy. Selpercatinib received accelerated approval for this indication for people 12 years of age and older in 2020. In May 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval for this indication to people aged two years of age and older. == Adverse effects == Selpercatinib can cause serious side effects including liver toxicity, high blood pressure, heart rhythm changes due to prolongation of heart electrical activity (QT prolongation), bleeding, allergic reactions and impaired wound healing. Selpercatinib may also cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. The most common adverse reactions (≥25%) were edema, diarrhea, fatigue, dry mouth, hypertension, abdominal pain, constipation, rash, nausea, and headache. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥5%) were decreased lymphocytes, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decreased sodium, and decreased calcium. == History == Selpercatinib received accelerated approval for this indication for patients aged twelve years of age and older in 2020. Selpercatinib was approved based on the results of the LIBRETTO-001 clinical trial (NCT03157128) involving 702 participants aged 15–92 years with each of the three types of tumors. During the clinical trial, participants received 160 mg selpercatinib orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR), which reflects the percentage of participants that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage, and duration of response (DOR). The trial was conducted at 84 sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Israel. The conversion to regular approval for non-small cell lung cancer was based on data from an additional 172 participants and 18 months of additional follow-up to assess durability of response. Efficacy for non-small cell lung cancer was evaluated in 105 adult participants with rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer who were previously treated with platinum chemotherapy. Sixty-four percent of the 105 participants with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer, experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 81% of them. Out of 39 participants who had never undergone treatment, 84% experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 58% of them. Efficacy for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was evaluated in participants aged twelve years of age and older with RET-mutant MTC . The study enrolled 143 participants with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who had been previously treated with cabozantinib, vandetanib or both (types of chemotherapy), and participants with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant MTC who had not received prior treatment with cabozantinib or vandetanib. Sixty-nine percent of the 55 previously treated participants for MTC experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than 6 months for 76% of them. Out of 88 participants who had never undergone treatment with an approved drug, 73% experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 61% of them. Efficacy for rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive thyroid cancer was evaluated in participants aged twelve years of age and older. The study enrolled 19 participants with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who were radioactive iodine-refractory (RAI, if an appropriate treatment option) and had received another prior systemic treatment, and eight participants with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who were RAI-refractory and had not received any additional therapy. Seventy-nine percent of the 19 previously treated participants with thyroid cancer experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 87% of them. All eight participants who had not received therapy other than radioactive iodine therapy experienced complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors which lasted more than six months for 75% of them. Efficacy for locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a rearranged during transfection (RET) gene fusion that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options was demonstrated in LIBRETTO-001 (NCT03157128), a multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort trial that evaluated 41 participants with RET fusion-positive tumors (other than non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer) with disease progression on or following prior systemic treatment or who had no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The efficacy evaluation was supported by data in 343 participants with RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer enrolled in the same trial already described in product labeling. Participants received selpercatinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for selpercatinib priority review, orphan drug, and breakthrough therapy designations; and granted approval of Retevmo to Loxo Oncology, Inc., a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company.

3597,"('Oxybutynin', 'Ditropan', 'Oxytrol', 'Oxibutyninum', 'Oxybutyninum')",Medical,"Oxybutynin, sold under the brand name Ditropan among others, is an anticholinergic medication primarily used to treat overactive bladder. It is widely considered a first-line therapy for overactive bladder due to its well-studied side effect profile, broad applicability, and continued efficacy over long periods of time. It works similar to tolterodine, darifenacin, and solifenacin, although it is usually preferred over these medications. It is sometimes used off-label for treatment of hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating. It has also been used off-label to treat bedwetting in children, but this use has declined, as it is most likely ineffective in this role. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, trouble sleeping, and urinary tract infections. Serious side effects may include urinary retention and an increased risk of heat stroke. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied while use in breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is an antimuscarinic and works by blocking the effects of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. Oxybutynin was approved for medical use in the US in 1975. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 110th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Oxybutynin is used in the form of instant-release capsules, extended-release capsules, or transdermal (topical) products. All of these are considered safe and effective options for treatment of detrusor muscle-mediated overactive bladder. Extended-release formulations decrease the number of weekly incontinence episodes by an average of 90% compared to an untreated state. Some studies have identified advantages of transdermal oxybutynin over capsules, finding decreased frequency of incontinence episodes and increased average voided volume of urine. Oxybutynin has been established through head-to-head trials as a more effective for overactive bladder than tolterodine, another anticholinergic medication. Specifically, the extended-release form of oxybutynin was found to have greater effect in both the short- and long-term. However, oxybutynin is not selective for the bladder like tolterodine, and thus has a wider range of side effects. Tolterodine and other anticholinergics are primarily used when clinicians and patients want to reduce the side effect profile. Because both drugs have been studied extensively and shown relatively high efficacy, both oxybutynin and tolterodine are considered first-line treatments for overactive bladder. They are thus the typical choices for initial treatment of the condition. The choice of initial therapy often comes down to whether a patient prefers somewhat higher efficacy (oxybutynin) or somewhat reduced side effects (tolterodine). === Hyperhidrosis === Since the 2010s, oxybutynin has increasingly been used to treat hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). Numerous studies have identified concrete benefits of the drug in treating this condition, but have not identified appropriate dosing or the full spectrum of possible side effects, although dry mouth is seemingly infrequent in patients with hyperhidrosis. Until further clinical trials can be conducted, oxybutynin is only used as an off-label medication for hyperhidrosis (as of 2024). == Adverse effects == Common adverse effects that are associated with oxybutynin and other anticholinergics include: dry mouth, difficulty in urination, constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, and dizziness. Anticholinergics have also been known to induce delirium. Oxybutynin's tendency to reduce sweating can be dangerous. Reduced sweating increases the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke in apparently safe situations where normal sweating keeps others safe and comfortable. Adverse effects of elevated body temperature are more likely for the elderly and for those with health issues, especially multiple sclerosis. N-Desethyloxybutynin is an active metabolite of oxybutynin that is thought responsible for much of the adverse effects associated with the use of oxybutynin. N-Desethyloxybutynin plasma levels may reach as much as six times that of the parent drug after administration of the immediate-release oral formulation. Alternative dosage forms have been developed in an effort to reduce blood levels of N-desethyloxybutynin and achieve a steadier concentration of oxybutynin than is possible with the instant-release form. The long-acting formulations also allow once-daily administration instead of the twice-daily dosage required with the immediate-release form. The transdermal patch, in addition to the benefits of the extended-release oral formulations, bypasses the first-pass hepatic effect that the oral formulations are subject to. == Contraindications == Oxybutynin chloride is contraindicated in patients with untreated narrow angle glaucoma, and in patients with untreated narrow anterior chamber angles—since anticholinergic drugs may aggravate these conditions. It is also contraindicated in partial or complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of the elderly or debilitated patient, megacolon, toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis, severe colitis, and myasthenia gravis. It is contraindicated in patients with obstructive uropathy and in patients with unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage. Oxybutynin chloride is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the product. == Pharmacology == Sources say the drug is absorbed within one hour and has an elimination half-life of 2 to 5 hours. There is a wide variation among individuals in the drug's concentration in blood. This, and its low concentration in urine, suggest that it is eliminated through the liver. === Chemistry === Oxybutynin contains one stereocenter. Commercial formulations are sold as the racemate. The (R)-enantiomer is a more potent anticholinergic than either the racemate or the (S)-enantiomer, which is essentially without anticholinergic activity at doses used in clinical practice. However, (R)-oxybutynin administered alone offers little or no clinical benefit above and beyond the racemic mixture. The other actions (calcium antagonism, local anesthesia) of oxybutynin are not stereospecific. (S)-Oxybutynin has not been clinically tested for its spasmolytic effects, but may be clinically useful for the same indications as the racemate, without the unpleasant anticholinergic side effects. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Oxybutynin is available by mouth in generic formulation and under the brand names Ditropan, Lyrinel XL, Ditrospam, Kentera, and Aquiette, as a transdermal patch under the brand name Oxytrol, and as a topical gel under the brand name Gelnique. == Research == A large study linked the development of dementia in those over 65 to the use of oxybutynin, due to its anticholinergic properties. == References ==",Oxytrol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0018239067867398262), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005308697931468487)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([merck.com](https://www.merck.com/news/fda-approves-oxytrol-for-women-the-first-over-the-counter-treatment-for-overactive-bladder-in-women/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=169, start_index=9, title='FDA Approves OXYTROL® FOR WOMEN, the First Over-the-Counter Treatment for Overactive Bladder in Women - Merck.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.merck.com/news/fda-approves-oxytrol-for-women-the-first-over-the-counter-treatment-for-overactive-bladder-in-women/?utm_source=openai')])"

3600,"('Santonin', 'Alpha-santonin', 'Semenen', 'Santoninic anhydride', 'Santoninum')",Medical,"Santonin is a drug which was widely used in the past as an anthelminthic. It is a terpenoid and an organic compound consisting of colorless flat prisms, turning slightly yellow from the action of light and soluble in alcohol, chloroform and boiling water. According to the US Pharmacopoeia, santonin occurs ""in colorless, shining, flattened, prismatic crystals, odorless and nearly tasteless when first put in the mouth, but afterward developing a bitter taste; not altered by exposure to air, but turning yellow on exposure to light. Nearly insoluble in cold water; soluble in 40 parts of alcohol at 15 °C. (59 °F.), in 250 parts of boiling water, and in 8 parts of boiling alcohol; also soluble in 140 parts of ether, in 4 parts of chloroform, and in solutions of caustic alkalies. When heated to 170 °C. (338 °F.), santonin melts, and forms, if rapidly cooled, an amorphous mass, which instantly crystallizes oil coming in contact with a minute quantity of one of its solvents. At a higher temperature, it sublimes partly unchanged, and, when ignited, it is consumed, leaving no residue. Santonin is neutral to litmus paper moistened with alcohol. Santonin yields, with an alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide, a bright pinkish-red liquid, which gradually becomes colorless. From its solution in caustic alkalies, santonin is completely precipitated by supersaturation with an acid"". == Isolation == It is derived from santonica (the unexpanded flower-heads of Artemisia maritima var. stechmanniana). Others refer to A. cina or A. chamaemelifolia as being the derivative species. The determination of the structure of santonin was the subject of intense early work. The initial photoproduct obtained from santonin is lumisantonin. In this rearrangement, the C-3 carbonyl group moves to C-2, the C-4 methyl moves to C-1, and the C-10 carbon inverts. == Anthelminthic use == Santonin paralyzes parasitic worms (helminths), allowing them to be passed out of the body. Santonin has the effect of paralyzing the anterior (front) end of the worm, while having a stimulant effect on the posterior end, depending on the concentration. Because of this, the worm cannot coordinate itself, and loses its ability to maintain its position in the host. By using a purgative, the worm can easily be passed out. Experiments in the 1880s showed that even after 40 hours, santonin had no lethal effect on roundworms using a saturated solution in dilute alkali. Santonin was formerly listed in U.S. and British pharmacopoeia, but it has fallen out of use with the development of safer ascaricides and is no longer registered as a drug in most countries. == Reactions and properties == Santonin can be converted to santonic acid (C15H20O4) via based-catalyzed hydrolysis followed by a multistep rearrangement process. Santonin dissolves in alkalies with formation of salts of this carboxylic acid. Santonin, in acetic acid solution, when exposed to sunlight for about a month, is converted into (colorless) photosantonic acid (C15H22O5) which is generally regarded as less toxic. The ethyl ester of the latter is obtained when an alcoholic solution of santonin is exposed to sunlight (Sestini). A yellow coloration is developed upon exposure of santonin to light. Santonin is optically levorotatory. == Proposed biosynthesis == The full biosynthesis of α-santonin has not been elucidated but α-santonin bears much similarity to parthenolide. The proposed biosynthesis begins with the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (+)-germacrene A by a sesquiterpene synthase. (+)-germacrene A hydroxylase then hydroxylates the isopropenyl side chain. The oxidation of germacratrien-12-ol to germacratrien-12-oic acid via the intermediate germacratrien-12-al is done by NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase(s). Germacratrien-12-oic acid is then hydroxylated at C6 subsequently followed by lactonization forming (+)-costunolide. It was proposed that the methylene of (+)-costunolide is reduced before the second ring closure. The bicyclic decalin ring system is formed via the eudesmyl cation followed by hydroxylation at C1. Further oxidation at C3 forms the β-ketohydroxyl which upon elimination of H2O completes the proposed biosynthetic pathway of α-santonin. === Photochemistry === The chemistry of α-santonin upon exposure to sunlight has the distinction of being the first reported organic photochemical reaction. Trommsdorff reported in 1834 that crystals of α-santonin first turned yellow upon exposure to sunlight before ""exploding"". The product of this solid-phase reaction was identified by Matsuura in 1968 as the product of photorearrangement, followed by a lattice-controlled Diels–Alder reaction and [2+2]-photocycloaddition. On the other hand, exposure to light in the solution phase results in the formation of monomeric skeletal rearrangement products. The mechanism of the photodimerization has been investigated in detail. == Historical pharmacological use == Santonin was developed in the 1830s by German chemists by extracting the chemical from Artemisia cina, a plant from Turkmenistan. At the time Artemisia was often used as an antihelminthic remedy, and as a perennial it was widely accessible. A common remedy at the time used an infusion of 5–10 g herb in 500 ml water. Castor oil could be used to help the expulsion process. It was reported that by 1843 candy lozenges were available in Germany which contained santonin. Santonin was used from the mid-19th century to the 1950s as an anthelminthic, typically administered with a purgative. Santonin was used in treatment of infestation by the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and in ascarid parasitoses in general (including threadworm parasitosis). It is ineffective in treatment of tapeworm infestation. Santonin was often found as a major ingredient of patent remedies for intestinal worms. It was sold in numerous formulations with varying degrees of effectiveness, such as worm lozenges, powders, syrups, and tonics. It was reported by an official of the Eastern & Russian Trading Company that during 1926, Japanese manufacturers were mixing santonin into nearly all pastry, confections, and tonics as part of a government-sponsored effort to eradicate intestinal parasites; Japan at the time imported five tons of santonin from Russia annually. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) notes that the typical dose was 2 to 5 grams. (This was a total dose; many regimens called for three doses daily over three days, and the ""three teaspoons three times a day for three days"" regimen was typical around the 1950s when use of santonin was starting to wane; actual doses per dose were closer to 20–30 milligrams per adult dose in a typical ""'50s regimen"", but ""one-shot"" doses of santonin (especially via suppository) were common in the late 19th century–early 20th century.) The only formerly registered British preparation (as of 1911) was the ""trochiscus santonini"" (santonin lozenge), but the preparation ""sodii santoninas"" (soda of santonin) was also formerly listed as an official preparation in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia. Commercial preparations containing santonin (usually containing a purgative laxative as well) also appeared in US drug formularies as late as the 1950s; the Modern Drug Encyclopedia and Therapeutic Index of 1955 listed Lumbricide (produced by Massengill) and a generic santonin preparation made by Winthrop-Stearns (now Winthrop-Sanofi). Santonin also was used in a lesser extent in treatment of atony of the bladder. This usage largely dropped off after the early 20th century. Dosage forms varied for santonin; in the 19th–20th centuries, santonin lozenges or suppositories designed for single-dosage treatment of ascarid infestation were the typical form of treatment, whilst in the 1950s the two remaining santonin preparations on the market in the United States were liquid medications. == Hazards and difficulty of use of santonin == Santonin was an agent that (compared to more modern anthelminthic drugs) was very complicated to use and entailed rather serious risk to the patient. Nearly every formulary and herbal which lists santonin or santonin-containing plants lists the real risk of yellow vision and of fatal reactions; even small doses of santonin cause disturbances of vision, usually yellow vision or perhaps green (xanthopsia or chromatopsia). Even the Encyclopædia Britannica noted: ...These effects usually pass off in a few days. Large doses, however, produce toxic effects, aphasia, muscular tremors and epileptiform convulsions, and the disturbances of vision may go on to total blindness. More typical is the warning given regarding side effects of santonin in King's American Dispensatory: Santonin is an active agent, and, in improper doses, is capable of producing serious symptoms, and even death. As small a dose as 2 grains is said to have killed a weakly child of 5 years, and 5 grains produced death in about 1/2 hour in a child of the same age. Among the toxic effects may be mentioned gastric pain, pallor and coldness of the surface, followed by heat and injection of the head, tremors, dizziness, pupillary dilatation, twitching of the eyes, stertor, copious sweating, hematuria, convulsive movements, tetanic cramps stupor, and insensibility. Occasionally symptoms resembling cholera morbus have been produced, and in all cases the urine presents a characteristic yellowish or greenish-yellow hue. We have observed convulsions caused by the administration of ""worm lozenges."" Death from santonin is due to respiratory paralysis, and post-mortem examination revealed in one instance a contracted and empty right ventricle, and about an ounce of liquid, black blood in the left heart, an inflamed duodenum, and inflamed patches in the stomach (Kilner). . . . Santonin often produces a singular effect upon the vision, causing surrounding objects to appear discolored, as if they were yellow or green, and occasionally blue or red; it also imparts a yellow or green color to the urine, and a reddish-purple color if that fluid be alkaline. Prof. Giovanni was led to believe that the apparent yellow color of objects observed by the eye, when under the influence of santonin, did not depend upon an elective action on the optic nerves, but rather to the yellow color which the drug itself takes when exposed to the air. Santonin colored by the air does not produce this effect, which only follows the white article. The air gives the yellow color to santonin, to passed urine containing it, and to the serum of the blood when drawn from a vein, and, according to Giovanni, it is owing to its direct action upon the aqueous humor, where it is carried by absorption, that objects present this color. The view now held, however, is that of Rose, that the alkaline serum dissolves the santonin, which then acts upon the perspective centers of the brain, producing the chromatopsia or xanthopsia. At least one modern herbal has also noted these same severe side effects of santonin. Even were it not for the fact that santonin is among the most toxic of herbal anthelminthic drugs, deworming using santonin is complicated in comparison to more modern anthelminthics. Typically, santonin must be taken whilst fasting completely (both before and after taking the drug) for ""single dose"" regimens or on a full stomach with all fats and oils in the diet being avoided for 2–3 days before treatment as well as during treatment and 2–3 days afterwards (due to santonin being fat soluble and having an increased risk of side effects); after a course of santonin, a purgative must be given to cleanse the body of the dead worms. (The two remaining registered santonin preparations in the United States as of 1955 were in fact santonin/purgative combinations; Lumbricide contained santonin and senna (among other ingredients) and the Winthrop-Stearns generic preparation was a santonin/cascara sagrada combination drug.) Due to the severe side effects (even when used as directed), the need for a purgative, and the development of many safer deworming drugs, santonin has largely fallen out of use. Typically mebendazole and pyrantel pamoate are used in modern pharmacopoeia practice where santonin was formerly used; even guides on holistic medicine strongly recommend avoiding the use of santonin due to its severe and occasionally fatal side effects and the availability of far safer anthelminthics. The Council Directive 65/65 European Economic Community (EEC) (in regards to pharmaceuticals and naturopathic preparations) has officially ruled santonin preparations to have an ""unacceptable"" risk-benefit ratio and preparations containing santonin are no longer eligible for registration in EU countries. == Santonin and absinthe == While absinthe is certainly more infamous for its content of thujone, the liquor does also contain small amounts of santonin . It has been speculated by some parties that Impressionist art—in particular, Van Gogh's artwork—may have been inspired not by thujone and its presumed psychotropic effects, but on the ""yellow vision"" or xanthopsia which is a known side effect of santonin. This has been disputed, however, most notably by Arnold and Loftus (1991) who have noted the santonin content would have been insufficient to cause xanthopsia. == See also == Artemisin, a hydroxylated derivative of santonin == References == This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

3602,"('Disodium nadp', 'Triphosphopyridine nucleotide', 'Coenzyme ii', 'Codehydrogenase ii', 'Cozymase ii')","Endogenous, Medical","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent ('hydrogen source'). NADPH is the reduced form, whereas NADP+ is the oxidized form. NADP+ is used by all forms of cellular life. NADP+ is essential for life because it is needed for cellular respiration. NADP+ differs from NAD+ by the presence of an additional phosphate group on the 2' position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. This extra phosphate is added by NAD+ kinase and removed by NADP+ phosphatase. == Biosynthesis == === NADP+ === In general, NADP+ is synthesized before NADPH is. Such a reaction usually starts with NAD+ from either the de-novo or the salvage pathway, with NAD+ kinase adding the extra phosphate group. ADP-ribosyl cyclase allows for synthesis from nicotinamide in the salvage pathway, and NADP+ phosphatase can convert NADPH back to NADH to maintain a balance. Some forms of the NAD+ kinase, notably the one in mitochondria, can also accept NADH to turn it directly into NADPH. The prokaryotic pathway is less well understood, but with all the similar proteins the process should work in a similar way. === NADPH === NADPH is produced from NADP+. The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway, by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the first step. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces pentose, another important part of NAD(P)H, from glucose. Some bacteria also use G6PDH for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, but NADPH production remains the same. Ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, present in all domains of life, is a major source of NADPH in photosynthetic organisms including plants and cyanobacteria. It appears in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and help turn the carbon dioxide into glucose. It has functions in accepting electrons in other non-photosynthetic pathways as well: it is needed in the reduction of nitrate into ammonia for plant assimilation in nitrogen cycle and in the production of oils. There are several other lesser-known mechanisms of generating NADPH, all of which depend on the presence of mitochondria in eukaryotes. The key enzymes in these carbon-metabolism-related processes are NADP-linked isoforms of malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase. In these reactions, NADP+ acts like NAD+ in other enzymes as an oxidizing agent. The isocitrate dehydrogenase mechanism appears to be the major source of NADPH in fat and possibly also liver cells. These processes are also found in bacteria. Bacteria can also use a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the same purpose. Like the pentose phosphate pathway, these pathways are related to parts of glycolysis. Another carbon metabolism-related pathway involved in the generation of NADPH is the mitochondrial folate cycle, which uses principally serine as a source of one-carbon units to sustain nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondrial folate cycle has been recently suggested as the principal contributor to NADPH generation in mitochondria of cancer cells. NADPH can also be generated through pathways unrelated to carbon metabolism. The ferredoxin reductase is such an example. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase transfers the hydrogen between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, and is found in eukaryotic mitochondria and many bacteria. There are versions that depend on a proton gradient to work and ones that do not. Some anaerobic organisms use NADP+-linked hydrogenase, ripping a hydride from hydrogen gas to produce a proton and NADPH. Like NADH, NADPH is fluorescent. NADPH in aqueous solution excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near UV) has a fluorescence emission which peaks at 445-460 nm (violet to blue). NADP+ has no appreciable fluorescence. == Function == NADPH provides the reducing agents, usually hydrogen atoms, for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), allowing the regeneration of glutathione (GSH). NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as cholesterol synthesis, steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid synthesis, xylitol synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis and microsomal fatty acid chain elongation. The NADPH system is also responsible for generating free radicals in immune cells by NADPH oxidase. These radicals are used to destroy pathogens in a process termed the respiratory burst. It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs. == Stability == NADH and NADPH are very stable in basic solutions, but NAD+ and NADP+ are degraded in basic solutions into a fluorescent product that can be used conveniently for quantitation. Conversely, NADPH and NADH are degraded by acidic solutions while NAD+/NADP+ are fairly stable to acid. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a coenzyme == Many enzymes that bind NADP share a common super-secondary structure named named the ""Rossmann fold"". The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann folds. This segment is in contact with the ADP portion of NADP. Therefore, it is also called an ""ADP-binding βαβ fold"". Adrenodoxin reductase: This enzyme is present ubiquitously in most organisms. It transfers two electrons from NADPH to FAD. In vertebrates, it serves as the first enzyme in the chain of mitochondrial P450 systems that synthesize steroid hormones. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a substrate == In 2018 and 2019, the first two reports of enzymes that catalyze the removal of the 2' phosphate of NADP(H) in eukaryotes emerged. First the cytoplasmic protein MESH1 (Q8N4P3), then the mitochondrial protein nocturnin were reported. Of note, the structures and NADPH binding of MESH1 (5VXA) and nocturnin (6NF0) are not related. == References ==",Triphosphopyridine nucleotide,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -4.334533878136426e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.02166101336479187), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.680836794548668e-05), ('OUS', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12700186669826508)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -2.7729658540920354e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/triphosphopyridine-nucleotide-introduction-and-uses.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=144, start_index=12, title='Triphosphopyridine nucleotide: Introduction and Uses_Chemicalbook', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/triphosphopyridine-nucleotide-introduction-and-uses.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

N-Acetylhistamine was more potent to elevate histamine than was histidine, a precursor amino acid of histamine. From the present results and the distribution of N-acetylhistamine deacetylase in tissues, it could be concluded that the elevation of histamine was due to the deacetylation of N-acetylhistamine. In addition, a slight but significant amount of N-acetylhistamine was found in tissues of normal rats. The physiological role of the deacetylation of N-acetylhistamine is discussed on the basis of these results. Properties of N-acetylhistamine deacetylase in rat brain were studied, utilizing a sensitive coupled radioenzymatic assay. The Km for N-acetylhistamine for this deacetylase was 660 microM and its Vmax was 330 pmol/h/mg protein. N-Acetylhistamine deacetylase activity increased 80% in the presence of 1 mM Mn2+. The Km of Mn2+ was 40 microM. The enzyme is primarily a soluble enzyme with a relatively uniform regional distribution, unlike the distribution for histamine and histidine decarboxylase. Neonatal activity of this enzyme in rat brain is higher than in adult brain. alpha-Fluoromethylhistidine does not affect the activity of N-acetylhistamine, indicating that deacetylation probably does not play a regulatory role in the synthesis of brain histamine. Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase like 7 (AANATL7) catalyzes the formation of N-acetylarylalkylamides and N-acetylhistamine from acetyl-CoA and the corresponding amine substrate. AANATL7 is a member of the GNAT superfamily of >10000 GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases, many members being linked to important roles in both human metabolism and disease. Drosophila melanogaster utilizes the N-acetylation of biogenic amines for the inactivation of neurotransmitters, the biosynthesis of melatonin, and the sclerotization of the cuticle. We have expressed and purified D. melanogaster AANATL7 in Escherichia coli and used the purified enzyme to define the substrate specificity for acyl-CoA and amine substrates. Information about the substrate specificity provides insight into the potential contribution made by AANATL7 to fatty acid amide biosynthesis because D. melanogaster has emerged as an important model system contributing to our understanding of fatty acid amide metabolism. Characterization of the kinetic mechanism of AANATL7 identified an ordered sequential mechanism, with acetyl-CoA binding first followed by histamine to generate an AANATL7·acetyl-CoA·histamine ternary complex prior to catalysis. Successive pH-activity profiling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified two ionizable groups: one with a pKa of 7.1 that is assigned to Glu-26 as a general base and a second pKa of 9.5 that is assigned to the protonation of the thiolate of the coenzyme A product.

Classical MAOIs, including isocarboxazid, are used only rarely due to prominent food and drug interactions and have been largely superseded by newer antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The cause of the interactions is because MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of dietary amines (e.g., tyramine) and the monoamine neurotransmitters. In combination with other drugs that increase the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters such as the SSRIs, or with certain foods high in dietary amines such as aged cheeses, MAOIs can produce dangerous elevations of monoamine neurotransmitters resulting in potentially life-threatening syndromes such as hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. == Contraindications == Isocarboxazid is contraindicated in certain patient populations, in combination with certain other drugs, and in combination with certain foods due to the risk of serious adverse reactions. Some notable contraindications include: Cerebrovascular disorders including Hypertension. Pheochromocytoma Liver disease Renal impairment Headache disorders Foods containing significant levels of Tyramine Serotonergic drugs (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs, SMSs Dextromethorphan) Antihypertensive Agents CNS Depressants Certain Anesthetics agents == See also == Hydrazine (antidepressant) == References ==",Enerzer,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.8889261304575484e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.19981250166893005), (',', -0.37453922629356384), ('ĠMED', -0.4718111753463745), ('ICAL', -6.6756979322235566e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006915681064128876)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Aurora kinases are serine/threonine kinases that function as key regulators of mitosis and are frequently overexpressed in human cancers. The use of several small molecule aurora kinase inhibitors as potential anticancer therapeutic is being investigated. Danusertib (formerly PHA-739358) is a small ATP competitive molecule that inhibits aurora A, B and C kinases. Interestingly, danusertib also inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases such as Abl, Ret, FGFR-1 and TrkA. These tyrosine kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of malignancies and the observed multi-target inhibition may increase the antitumor activity resulting in extending the indication. Danusertib was one of the first aurora kinase inhibitors to enter the clinic and has been studied in Phase I and II trials. This review provides an updated summary of preclinical and clinical experience with danusertib up to July 2011. Future studies with danusertib should focus on the possibility of combining this agent with other targeted anticancer agents, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. As a single agent, danusertib may show more promise in the treatment of leukemias than in solid tumors. Previous evidence has shown that the increased expression of aurora kinase is closely related to melanoma progression and is an important therapeutic target in melanoma. Danusertib is an inhibitor of aurora kinase, and recent studies have shown that danusertib treatment induces autophagy in several types of cancer. Interestingly, autophagy plays a dual function in cancer as a pro-survival and anti-survival factor. In this study, we investigated the role of danusertib on the induction of autophagy in melanoma and determined the impact of autophagy induction on its anticancer activity against melanoma. Our results showed that danusertib can significantly inhibit melanoma growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated that danusertib treatment significantly inhibits the oncogenic Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and induces autophagy in melanoma cells. Furthermore, we identified that the inhibition of autophagy can enhance the inhibitory effects of danusertib on melanoma growth. Thus, the induction of autophagy by danusertib appears to be a survival mechanism in melanoma cells that may counteract its anticancer effects. These findings suggest a novel strategy to enhance the anticancer efficacy of danusertib in melanoma by blocking autophagy. Aurora kinase (AURK) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) are commonly overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlating with poor prognosis. This study aims to assess the therapeutic potential of combining the Danusertib (Danu, AURK inhibitor) and KRIBB11 (HSF1 inhibitor) for NSCLC treatment. The effects of this combination were investigated in A549 cells and a tumor xenograft mouse model. The findings demonstrate that concurrent administration of Danu and KRIBB11 effectively impedes cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and triggers G2/M cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the combination treatment upregulates pro-apoptotic proteins (Cleaved-caspase3, Cleaved-PARP, and Bax) while downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2), as well as G2/M-related proteins (CDC2 and cyclin B1). Additionally, the combination treatment elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreases mitochondrial membrane potential, and activates the DNA damage pathway. Interestingly, we discovered that the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in mediating the effects of both Danu and KRIBB11. Furthermore, the combination treatment inhibits tumor growth and AKT signaling in the xenograft mouse model, increases levels of the tumor tissue oxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), and induces DNA damage. To summarize, a potential therapeutic approach for NSCLC may involve dual inhibition of AURK and HSF1, resulting in the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and the activation of ROS-mediated mitochondrial and DNA damage pathways.",Danusertib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000321336614433676), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002482073148712516)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3516633/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4661876/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4338784/ ', [])"

Typically it is used together with other medications when those are insufficient. Therapeutic benefits appear smaller in females than males. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include constipation, headache, nausea, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include QT prolongation. Ranolazine is contraindicated (not recommended) in those with liver cirrhosis. How it works is not clear but may involve adenosine triphosphate. Ranolazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2006. In 2022, it was the 232nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ranolazine is used to treat chronic angina. It may be used concomitantly with β blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. It is also effective at preventing atrial fibrillation, and has been studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other medications used to treat irregular heartbeat. Its use is not recommended in Scotland as of 2019. == Contraindications == Some contraindications for ranolazine are related to its metabolism and are described under Drug Interactions. Additionally, in clinical trials ranolazine slightly increased QT interval in some patients and the FDA label contains a warning for doctors to beware of this effect in their patients. The drug's effect on the QT interval is increased in the setting of liver dysfunction; thus it is contraindicated in persons with mild to severe liver disease. == Side effects == The most common side effects are dizziness (11.5%) and constipation (10.9%). Other side effects include headache and nausea. == Drug interactions == Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by the CYP3A enzyme. It also inhibits another metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome CYP2D6. For this reason, the doses of ranolazine and drugs that interact with those enzymes need to be adjusted when they are used by the same patient. Ranolazine should not be used with drugs such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir that strongly inhibit CYP3A, nor with drugs that activate CYP3A, such as rifampin and phenobarbital. For drugs that are moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as diltiazem, verapamil, and erythromycin, the dose of ranolazine should be reduced. Drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, such as tricyclic antidepressants, may need to be given at reduced doses when administered with ranolazine. == Mechanism of action == Ranolazine inhibits persistent or late inward sodium current (INa) in heart muscle in a variety of voltage-gated sodium channels. Inhibiting that current leads to reductions in intracellular calcium levels. This in turn leads to reduced tension in the heart wall, leading to reduced oxygen requirements for the muscle. The QT prolongation effect of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of IKr, which prolongs the ventricular action potential. Ranolazine also exhibits its effects on the delayed rectifier current (hERG/IKr potassium channels), it readily stimulates myogenesis, it reduces a pro-oxidant inflammation/oxidative condition, and activates the calcium signaling pathway. Ranolazine prolongs the action potential duration, with corresponding QT interval prolongation on electrocardiography, blocks the INa current, and prevents calcium overload caused by the hyperactive INa current, thus it stabilizes the membrane and reducing excitability. == History == Syntex Inc. originally began developing ranolazine in 1985 and 61 studies were completed from then until 1994. Afterwards, Phase 2 studies were done; however, it was found that the formulation did not result in adequate plasma concentrations of drug. It is due to this that the sustained-release (SR) formulation of ranolazine was created. Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 In 1996, CV Therapeutics licensed the North American and European rights to ranolazine from Syntex, a subsidiary of Roche, which had discovered the drug and had developed it through Phase II trials in angina. In 2006, CV Therapeutics acquired the remaining worldwide rights to ranolazine from Roche. In 2008 CV Therapeutics exclusively licensed rights for ranolazine in Europe and some other countries to Menarini. In 2009, Gilead acquired CV Therapeutics. In 2013 Gilead expanded the partnership with Menarini to include additional countries, including those in Asia. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Ranolazine was approved by the FDA in January 2006, for the treatment of patients with chronic angina as a second-line treatment in addition to other drugs. In 2007 the label was updated to make ranolazine a first-line treatment, alone or with other drugs. In April 2008 ranolazine was approved by the European EMEA for use in angina. === Commercial aspects === Ranolazine is manufactured and sold as Ranexa by Gilead. According to a Gilead annual income statement, combined sales for Ranexa and another Gilead product, AmBisom, were $621 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Ranolazine might constitute a therapeutic option to improve the two main strategies currently used to treat metastatic melanoma.

Molsidomine is metabolized in the liver to the active metabolite linsidomine. Linsidomine is an unstable compound that releases nitric oxide (NO) upon decay as the actual vasodilating compound. == Medical uses == Molsidomine is used for the prevention and long-term treatment of stable and unstable angina pectoris, with or without left heart failure. It is also used to treat angina in the context of an acute myocardial infarction. == Contraindications == The drug must not be used in patients with acute cardiac arrest or severe hypotension (low blood pressure), during lactation, and in combination with PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. == Side effects == The most common adverse effects are headache, which occurs in 10–25% of patients, and low blood pressure. Side effects occurring in fewer than 1% of patients include dizziness, nausea, reflex tachycardia (fast heartbeat), hypersensitivity reactions, as well as thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) in rare cases. == Interactions == The blood pressure lowering effect of molsidomine can be amplified significantly by PDE5 inhibitors, potentially leading to fainting or myocardial infarction, and to a lesser extent by other antihypertensive drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or other nitrovasodilators. Ergolines can antagonise the effects of molsidomine. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Molsidomine belongs to the drug class of nitrovasodilators. It releases NO, which acts as a gaseous signaling molecule, relaxing the smooth muscles of blood vessels. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly and almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gut. Molsidomine is a prodrug that is hydrolysed to linsidomine (SIN-1) in the liver via first-pass effect, which subsequently releases NO. 44–59% of molsidomine reach the bloodstream in unchanged form, 3–11% of which are bound to plasma proteins. Both molsidomine and linsidomine reach their highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to two hours. Linsidomine has a biological half-life of one to two hours. More than 90% are excreted via the kidney. == Chemistry == Molsidomine and linsidomine are sydnone imines, a class of mesoionic heterocyclic aromatic chemical compounds. Molsidomine melts at 140–141 °C (284–286 °F), is freely soluble in chloroform, soluble in aqueous hydrochloric acid, ethanol, ethyl acetate and methanol, sparingly soluble in water and acetone, and very slightly soluble in diethyl ether and petroleum ether. It is stable in aqueous solutions at pH 5–7, but not in alkaline solutions. Its absorption maximum is in the near ultraviolet, at 326 nm, in chloroform. The substance is sensitive to ultraviolet light at wavelengths shorter than 320 nm. === Synthesis === Its synthesis starts by reacting 1-aminomorpholine with formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide to give 2. Nitrosation gives the N-nitroso analog (3) which cyclizes to the Linsidomine (4) on treatment with anhydrous acid. Formation of the ethyl urethane is then made possible by reacting linsidomine with ethyl chloroformate. Also see a related structure called Ciclosidomine. == History == The substance was first synthesised at Takeda in 1970.

3610,"('Limonene', '(s)-limonene', '(s)-1-methyl-4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-1-ene', '(4s)-limonene', 'S-limonene')","Food, Medical","Limonene () is a colorless liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon classified as a cyclic monoterpene, and is the major component in the essential oil of citrus fruit peels. The (+)-isomer, occurring more commonly in nature as the fragrance of oranges, is a flavoring agent in food manufacturing. It is also used in chemical synthesis as a precursor to carvone and as a renewables-based solvent in cleaning products. The less common (-)-isomer has a piny, turpentine-like odor, and is found in the edible parts of such plants as caraway, dill, and bergamot orange plants. Limonene takes its name from Italian limone (""lemon""). Limonene is a chiral molecule, and biological sources produce one enantiomer: the principal industrial source, citrus fruit, contains (+)-limonene (d-limonene), which is the (R)-enantiomer. (+)-Limonene is obtained commercially from citrus fruits through two primary methods: centrifugal separation or steam distillation. == In plants == (+)-Limonene is a major component of the aromatic scents and resins characteristic of numerous coniferous and broadleaved trees: red and silver maple (Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum), cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia), aspens (Populus grandidentata, Populus tremuloides) sumac (Rhus glabra), spruce (Picea spp.), various pines (e.g., Pinus echinata, Pinus ponderosa), Pinus leucodermis, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), larches (Larix spp.), true firs (Abies spp.), hemlocks (Tsuga spp.), cedars (Cedrus spp.), various Cupressaceae, and juniper bush (Juniperus spp.). It contributes to the characteristic odor of orange peel, orange juice and other citrus fruits. To optimize recovery of valued components from citrus peel waste, (+)-limonene is typically removed. == Chemical reactions == Limonene is a relatively stable monoterpene and can be distilled without decomposition, although at elevated temperatures it cracks to form isoprene. It oxidizes easily in moist air to produce carveol, carvone, and limonene oxide. With sulfur, it undergoes dehydrogenation to p-cymene. Limonene occurs commonly as the (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes at 300 °C. When warmed with mineral acid, limonene isomerizes to the conjugated diene α-terpinene (which can also easily be converted to p-cymene). Evidence for this isomerization includes the formation of Diels–Alder adducts between α-terpinene adducts and maleic anhydride. It is possible to effect reaction at one of the double bonds selectively. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride reacts preferentially at the disubstituted alkene, whereas epoxidation with mCPBA occurs at the trisubstituted alkene. In another synthetic method Markovnikov addition of trifluoroacetic acid followed by hydrolysis of the acetate gives terpineol. The most widely practiced conversion of limonene is to carvone. The three-step reaction begins with the regioselective addition of nitrosyl chloride across the trisubstituted double bond. This species is then converted to the oxime with a base, and the hydroxylamine is removed to give the ketone-containing carvone. === Biosynthesis === In nature, limonene is formed from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclization of a neryl carbocation or its equivalent as shown. The final step involves loss of a proton from the cation to form the alkene. == Uses == As the main fragrance of citrus peels, D-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, such as a flavoring agent to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, aftershave lotions, bath products, and other personal care products. (+)-Limonene is also used as a botanical insecticide. (+)-Limonene is used in the organic herbicides. It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers, to give a lemon or orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, (-)-limonene has a piny, turpentine-like odor. Limonene is used as a solvent for cleaning purposes, such as adhesive remover, or the removal of oil from machine parts, as it is produced from a renewable source (citrus essential oil, as a byproduct of orange juice manufacture). It is used as a paint stripper and is also useful as a fragrant alternative to turpentine. Limonene is also used as a solvent in some model airplane glues and as a constituent in some paints. Commercial air fresheners, with air propellants, containing limonene are used by stamp collectors to remove self-adhesive postage stamps from envelope paper. Limonene is also used as a solvent for fused filament fabrication based 3D printing. Printers can print the plastic of choice for the model, but erect supports and binders from high impact polystyrene (HIPS), a polystyrene plastic that is easily soluble in limonene. In preparing tissues for histology or histopathology, D-limonene is often used as a less toxic substitute for xylene when clearing dehydrated specimens. Clearing agents are liquids miscible with alcohols (such as ethanol or isopropanol) and with melted paraffin wax, in which specimens are embedded to facilitate cutting of thin sections for microscopy. Limonene, from orange peel oil, is also combustible and has been considered as a biofuel. == Safety and research == Applied to skin, limonene may cause irritation from contact dermatitis, but otherwise appears to be safe for human use. Limonene is flammable as a liquid or vapor and it is toxic to aquatic life. === Cancer === There is no evidence that the limonene in peel oils of citrus fruits affects the onset or progress of cancer, with one national agency stating, ""There is no consistent evidence that people with cancer who consume limonene—either in supplement form or by eating citrus fruits—get better or are more likely to be cured"". == See also == Essential oil Monoterpenes Resin == References == == External links == Mass spectrum of limonene Description of D-limonene on the International Chemical Safety Cards D-Limonene information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency",Limonene,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0007300666766241193), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.06213013455271721), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.0002627662615850568), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.005596919916570187), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0001113352773245424), ('ĠPERSON', -0.31442320346832275), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.004083035048097372), ('ĠINDU', -0.0019397982396185398), ('ST', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('RI', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('AL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07892169803380966)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.676292231422849e-05), (' PERSONAL', -0.07998336851596832), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0019286326132714748), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/d-limonene?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/limonene/?utm_source=openai), [acs.org](https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/l/limonene.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=304, start_index=33, title='Limonene: Uses, Benefits, Side Effects, and Dosage', type='url_citation', url='https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/d-limonene?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=304, start_index=33, title='Limonene - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/limonene/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=304, start_index=33, title='Limonene - American Chemical Society', type='url_citation', url='https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/l/limonene.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3611,"('Hydrocinnamic acid', 'Benzenepropanoic acid', 'Benzylacetic acid', 'Dihydrocinnamic acid', 'Benzenepropionic acid')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Phenylpropanoic acid or hydrocinnamic acid is a carboxylic acid with the formula C9H10O2 belonging to the class of phenylpropanoids. It is a white, crystalline solid with a sweet, floral scent at room temperature. Phenylpropanoic acid has a wide variety of uses including cosmetics, food additives, and pharmaceuticals. == Preparation and reactions == Phenylpropanoic acid can be prepared from cinnamic acid by hydrogenation. Originally it was prepared by reduction with sodium amalgam in water and by electrolysis. A characteristic reaction of phenylpropanoic acid is its cyclization to 1-indanone. When the side chain is homologated by the Arndt–Eistert reaction, subsequent cyclization affords 2-tetralone, derivatives. == Uses == Phenylpropanoic acid is widely used for flavoring, food additives, spices, fragrance, and medicines as it acts as a fixative agent, or a preservative. === Food industry === Phenylpropanoic acid is used in the food industry to preserve and maintain the original aroma quality of frozen foods. It can also be used to add or restore original color to food. Shelved foods are protected from microorganism by adding phenylpropanoic acid to prevent deterioration to the food by microorganisms as well as acting as an antioxidant to prolong shelf life foods. This compound is used as a sweetener as well to sweeten food and can be found in table top sweeteners. It can also act as an emulsifier, to keep oil and water mixtures from separating.

It is a very strong iron chelator and in the body it is likely that the iron chelate is the active species that quenches the active site tyrosyl radical required by ribonucleotide reductase for its enzymatic activity. The 3AP iron chelate is redox active and there have been several reports in the literature ascribing this property to some of the biological activities of 3AP. 3AP was chosen, based on the results of studying and the screening these products, as the candidate inhibitor most likely to express activity in the setting of human neoplastic disease.

3616,"('Tozadenant', 'Ro-4494351000', 'Ro-4494351-002', 'Tozadenant [usan:inn]', 'Tozadenant (usan)')",Medical," Adenosine A2A receptors are localized in the brain, mainly within the caudate and putamen nuclei of the basal ganglia. Their activation leads to stimulation of the 'indirect' pathway. Conversely, administration of A2A receptor antagonists leads to inhibition of this pathway, which was translated into reduced hypomotility in several animal models of parkinsonism. In this review, the effects of two A2A receptor antagonists, istradefylline and tozadenant, on parkinsonian symptoms in animal and humans will be discussed. Animal studies have shown potent antiparkinsonian effects for several A2A receptor antagonists, including istradefylline. In clinical trials, istradefylline reduced OFF time when administered with levodopa, but results are inconclusive. Results with tozadenant are scarce. Modification of thalamic blood flow compatible with reduced inhibition was noted in one small trial, followed by a significant reduction in OFF time in a larger one. Therefore, both drugs show promising efficacy for the reduction of OFF time in levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease patients, but further research is needed in order to obtain definitive conclusions. Motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) are caused by a loss of dopamine input from the substantia nigra to the striatum. Blockade of adenosine 2A (A(2A)) receptors facilitates dopamine D(2) receptor function. In phase 2 clinical trials, A(2A) antagonists (istradefylline, preladenant, and tozadenant) improved motor function in PD. We developed a new A(2A) PET radiotracer, (18)F-MNI-444, and used it to investigate the relationship between plasma levels and A(2A) occupancy by preladenant and tozadenant in nonhuman primates (NHP). A series of 20 PET experiments was conducted in 5 adult rhesus macaques. PET data were analyzed with both plasma-input (Logan graphical analysis) and reference-region-based (simplified reference tissue model and noninvasive Logan graphical analysis) methods. Whole-body PET images were acquired for radiation dosimetry estimates. Human pharmacokinetic parameters for tozadenant and preladenant were used to predict A(2A) occupancy in humans, based on median effective concentration (EC(50)) values estimated from the NHP PET measurements. (18)F-MNI-444 regional uptake was consistent with A(2A) receptor distribution in the brain. Selectivity was demonstrated by dose-dependent blocking by tozadenant and preladenant. The specific-to-nonspecific ratio was superior to that of other A(2A) PET radiotracers. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicted that tozadenant and preladenant may have different profiles of A(2A) receptor occupancy in humans. (18)F-MNI-444 appears to be a better PET radiotracer for A(2A) imaging than currently available radiotracers. Assuming that EC(50) in humans is similar to that in NHP, it appears that tozadenant will provide a more sustained A(2A) receptor occupancy than preladenant in humans at clinically tested doses. Many patients with Parkinson's disease have motor fluctuations despite treatment with available drugs. Tozadenant (SYN115) is an oral, selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist that improves motor function in animal models of Parkinson's disease. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of tozadenant as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease who have motor fluctuations on levodopa. We did an international, multicentre, phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding clinical trial of tozadenant in levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease who had motor fluctuations (at least 2·5 h off-time per day). Eligible patients were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomisation schedule to receive tozadenant 60, 120, 180, or 240 mg or matching placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. All study management, site personnel, and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 12 in hours per day spent in the off-state (assessed from Parkinson's disease diaries completed by patients). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01283594. Of 420 randomised patients (mean age 63·3 [SD 8·3] years; mean duration of Parkinson's disease 8·7 [4·7] years), 403 provided post-baseline diary data and 337 completed study treatment. Compared with placebo, mean daily off-time was significantly reduced in the combined tozadenant 120 mg twice-daily and 180 mg twice-daily group (-1·1 h, 95% CI -1·8 to -0·5; p=0·0006), the tozadenant 120 mg twice-daily group (-1·1 h, -1·8 to -0·4; p=0.0039), and the tozadenant 180 mg twice-daily group (-1·2 h, -1·9 to -0·4; p=0·0039). The most common adverse events in these groups were dyskinesia (seven [8%] of 84 patients in the placebo group, 13 [16%] of 82 in the 120 mg twice-daily group, and 17 [20%] of 85 in the 180 mg twice-daily group), nausea (three [4%], 9 [11%], and ten [12%]), and dizziness (one [1%], four [5%], and 11 [13%]). Tozadenant 60 mg twice daily was not associated with a significant reduction in off-time, and tozadenant 240 mg twice daily was associated with an increased rate of discontinuation because of adverse events (17 [20%] of 84 patients). Tozadenant at 120 or 180 mg twice daily was generally well tolerated and was effective at reducing off-time. Further investigation of tozadenant treatment in phase 3 trials is warranted.

3617,"('Avobenzone', 'Parsol 1789', 'Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane', 'Escalol 517', 'Eusolex 9020')","Medical, Personal Care","Avobenzone (trade names Parsol 1789, Milestab 1789, Eusolex 9020, Escalol 517, Neo Heliopan 357 and others, INCI Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane) is an organic molecule and an oil-soluble ingredient used in sunscreen products to absorb the full spectrum of UVA rays. == History == Avobenzone was patented in 1973 and was approved in the EU in 1978. It was approved by the FDA in 1988. As of 2021, the FDA announced that they do not support avobenzone as being generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) citing the need for additional safety data. Avobenzone was banned in 2020 by the Palau government citing reef-toxicity concerns. == Properties == Pure avobenzone is a whitish to yellowish crystalline powder with a weak odor, dissolving in isopropanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, decyl oleate, capric acid/caprylic, triglycerides and other oils. It is not soluble in water. Avobenzone is a dibenzoylmethane derivative. Avobenzone exists in the ground state as a mixture of the enol and keto forms, favoring the chelated enol. This enol form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding within the β-diketone. Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light over a wider range of wavelengths than many other sunscreen agents has led to its use in many commercial preparations marketed as ""broad spectrum"" sunscreens. Avobenzone has an absorption maximum of 357 nm. == Safety == Avobenzone, a petroleum-based sunscreen active ingredient, is not generally recognised as safe and effective (GRASE) by the FDA for lack of sufficient data to support this claim. However, it is still the only FDA approved UVA filter (up to 3% concentration). Avobenzone is also approved in all other jurisdictions, such as EU (up to 5%), Australia, and Japan. A 2017 study at Lomonosov Moscow State University found that chlorinated water and ultraviolet light can cause avobenzone to disintegrate into various other organic compounds, including; phenolic acids, aldehydes, phenols, and acetophenones which can cause adverse health effects. == Stability == Avobenzone is sensitive to the properties of the solvent, being relatively stable in polar protic solvents and unstable in nonpolar environments. Also, when it is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or it can transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects. Avobenzone has been shown to degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time. The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. Data presented to the Food and Drug Administration by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association indicates a −36% change in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. For this reason, in sunscreen products, avobenzone is always formulated together with a photostabilizer, such as octocrylene. Other photostabilizers include: 4-Methylbenzylidene camphor (USAN Enzacamene) Tinosorb S (USAN Bemotrizinol, INCI Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine) Tinosorb M (USAN Bisoctrizole, INCI Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol) Butyloctyl Salicylate (Tradename HallBrite BHB - [1]) Hexadecyl Benzoate Butyloctyl Benzoate HallBrite PSF (INCI Undecylcrylene DimethiconeE) Mexoryl SX (USAN Ecamsule, INCI Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid) Synoxyl HSS (INCI Trimethoxybenzylidene Pentanedione) Corapan TQ (INCI Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate) Parsol SLX (INCI Polysilicone-15) Oxynex ST (INCI Diethylhexyl Syringylidene Malonate Polycrylene (INCI Polyester-8) SolaStay S1 (INCI Ethylhexyl Methoxycrylene) Octyl Salicylate (INCI Ethylhexyl Salicylate) Complexing avobenzone with cyclodextrins may also increase its photostability. Formulations of avobenzone with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin have shown significant reduction in photo-induced degradation, as well as decreased transdermal penetration of the UV absorber when used in high concentrations. The photostability of avobenzone is further increased when sunscreens are formulated with antioxidant compounds. Mangiferin, glutathione, ubiquinone, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene and trans-resveratrol have all demonstrated some ability to protect avobenzone from photodegradation. The stability and efficacy of avobenzone seems to continue to increase as a greater amount of antioxidants are added to the sunscreen. According to some studies, ""the most effective sunscreens contain avobenzone and titanium dioxide."" Avobenzone can degrade faster in light in combination with mineral UV absorbers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, though with the right coating of the mineral particles this reaction can be reduced. A manganese doped titanium dioxide may be better than undoped titanium dioxide to improve avobenzone's stability. === Various === As an enolate, avobenzone forms with heavy metal ions (such as Fe3+) colored complexes, and chelating agents can be added to suppress them. Stearates, aluminum, magnesium and zinc salts can lead to poorly soluble precipitates. Manufacturers also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, heavy metals, formaldehyde donors and PABA and PABA esters. Avobenzone in sunscreen may stain clothes yellow-orange and make them sticky if washed in iron-rich water, as it reacts with iron to produce rust. The damage can be undone with a rust remover or stain remover. The staining properties of sunblock made with avobenzone are particularly noticeable on fiberglass boats with white gelcoat. Avobenzone also reacts with boron trifluoride to form a stable crystalline complex that is highly fluorescent under UV irradiation. The emission color of the crystals depends on the molecular packing of the boron avobenzone complex. The photoluminescence may also be altered by mechanical force in the solid state, resulting in a phenomenon called ""mechanochromic luminescence"". The altered emission color recovers itself slowly at room temperature or more swiftly at higher temperatures. === Absorbance spectrum === Avobenzone has a peak absorbance around 360 nm when dissolved. The peak may shift slightly depending on the solvent. == Preparation == The compound is prepared by reacting 4-tert-butylbenzoic methyl ester (from 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid by esterification with methanol) with 4-methoxyacetophenone in toluene in the presence of sodium amide via Claisen condensation. According to a recent patent application, yields of up to 95% are obtained with the same starting materials in toluene in the presence of potassium methoxide. It is subject to keto-enol tautomerism and exists predominantly enol when dissolved. Upon UV radiation, it may convert to keto form, while converting back to enol form after placing in dark.

Although phthalic acid is of modest commercial importance, the closely related derivative phthalic anhydride is a commodity chemical produced on a large scale. Phthalic acid is one of three isomers of benzenedicarboxylic acid, the others being isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. == Production == Phthalic acid is produced by the catalytic oxidation of naphthalene or ortho-xylene directly to phthalic anhydride and a subsequent hydrolysis of the anhydride. Phthalic acid was first obtained by French chemist Auguste Laurent in 1836 by oxidizing naphthalene tetrachloride. Believing the resulting substance to be a naphthalene derivative, he named it ""naphthalic acid"". After the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac determined its correct formula, Laurent gave it its present name. Manufacturing methods in the nineteenth century included oxidation of naphthalene tetrachloride with nitric acid, or, better, oxidation of the hydrocarbon with fuming sulfuric acid, using mercury or mercury(II) sulfate as a catalyst. == Synthesis == Naphthalene, on oxidation with potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate, gives Phthalic anhydride, which, through hydrolysis with hot water, gives Phthalic acid. A more standard procedure is to oxidize napthalene with air, but this reaction proceeds explosively unless conditions are set up very accurately. == Uses == Phthalic acid in the form of phthalic anhydride is an important industrial chemical, used for making phthalates (esters of phthalic acid) that are used as plasticizers. However, phthalic anhydride is usually not made by dehydration of phthalic acid but from p-xylene or naphthalene. == Reactions == It is a dibasic acid, with pKas of 2.89 and 5.51. The monopotassium salt, potassium hydrogen phthalate is a standard acid in analytical chemistry. Typically phthalate esters are prepared from the widely available phthalic anhydride. Reduction of phthalic acid with sodium amalgam in the presence of water gives the 1,3-cyclohexadiene derivative. == Safety == The toxicity of phthalic acid is moderate with LD50 (mouse) of 550 mg/kg. == Biodegradation == The bacteria Pseudomonas sp.

It was reclassified as a prescription drug after the FDA and DEA concluded that the impermeability of the blood–brain barrier to this compound made it non-habit-forming, and so without the potential for abuse. == Medical use == Naloxegol is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in people with chronic non-cancer pain. == Side effects == The most common side effects are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting, and headache. == Pharmacodynamic properties == Naloxegol inhibits opioid binding in μ-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, thus decreasing the constipating effects (slowing of gastrointestinal motility and transit, hypertonicity, increased fluid reabsorption) associated with opioids. If naloxegol is coadministered with other opioid antagonists, there is a potential for additive effect and increased risk of opioid withdrawal. == Mechanism of action == Chemically, naloxegol is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol-modified) derivative of α-naloxol. Specifically, the 6-α-hydroxyl group of α-naloxol is connected via an ether linkage to the free hydroxyl group of a monomethoxy-terminated n=7 oligomer of PEG, shown extending at the lower left of the molecule image at right. The ""n=7"" defines the number of two-carbon ethylenes, and so the chain length, of the attached PEG chain, and the ""monomethoxy"" indicates that the terminal hydroxyl group of the PEG is ""capped"" with a methyl group. The pegylation of the 6-α-hydroxyl side chain of naloxol prevents the drug from crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB). == References ==",Moventig,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.2782016205601394e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007200032705441117)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([dcatvci.org](https://www.dcatvci.org/top-industry-news/astrazeneca-receives-eu-approval-for-moventig/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=132, start_index=9, title='AstraZeneca Receives EU Approval for Moventig - DCAT Value Chain Insights', type='url_citation', url='https://www.dcatvci.org/top-industry-news/astrazeneca-receives-eu-approval-for-moventig/?utm_source=openai')])"
3620,"('Stavudine', 'D4t', 'Sanilvudine', 'Zerit', 'Stavudinum')",Medical,"Stavudine (d4T), sold under the brand name Zerit among others, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. However, it is not a first-line treatment. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and peripheral nerve problems. Severe side effects include high blood lactate, pancreatitis, and an enlarged liver. It is not generally recommended in pregnancy. Stavudine is in the nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of medication. Stavudine was first described in 1966 and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Stavudine is used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection, but is not a cure. It is not normally recommended as initial treatment. Stavudine can also reduce the risk of developing HIV-1 infection after coming into contact with the virus either at work (e.g., needlestick) or through exposure to infected blood or other bodily fluids. It is always used in combination with other HIV medications for the better control of the infection and a reduction in HIV complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends stavudine to be phased out to due to its high toxicity levels. If the drug must be used, it is recommended to use low dosages to reduce the occurrence of side effects; however, a 2015 Cochrane review found no clear advantage between high and low dosage regimens. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Stavudine has been demonstrated to affect the fetus in animal studies but no data are available from human studies. Pregnant women should therefore be given stavudine only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential harm to the fetus. Additionally, there have been case reports of fatal lactic acidosis in pregnant women receiving combination therapy of stavudine and didanosine with other antiviral agents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants, in order to avoid the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk. There is also evidence that stavudine gets into animal breast milk, although no data are available for human breast milk. === Children === Stavudine is safe for use in children infected with HIV from birth through adolescence. Adverse effects and safety profile are the same as adults. === Elderly === There is no data available for stavudine use in HIV-infected adults aged 65 years or older. However, among 12,000 people over the age of 65, 30% developed peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, since the elderly are more likely to have decreased renal function, they are more likely to develop toxic side effects. == Adverse events == Common side effects Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Headache Upset stomach Severe side effects Peripheral neuropathy Lactic acidosis Pancreatitis Hepatotoxicity Hepatomegaly with steatosis Lipoatrophy/lipodystrophy (fat redistribution/accumulation) Individuals are monitored for the development of these serious adverse effects. The development of peripheral neuropathy is shown to be dose related, and may be resolved if the drug is discontinued. Individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease, a history of peripheral neuropathy, or individuals on other drugs that have association with neuropathy develop this side effect more often. Stavudine has been shown in laboratory test to be genotoxic, but with clinical doses its carcinogenic effects are non-existent. Hyperlactatemia, bone mineral density (BMD) loss, reduction in limb fat and an increase in triglycerides were found when administered in high dosages. It is also one of the most likely antiviral drugs to cause lipodystrophy, and for this reason it is no longer considered an appropriate treatment for most patients in developed countries. HLA-B*4001 may be used as a genetic marker to predict which patients will develop stavudine-associated lipodystrophy, to avoid or shorten the duration of stavudine according to a study in Thailand. It is still used as first choice in first line therapy in resource poor settings such as in India. Only in case of development of peripheral neuropathy or pregnancy is it changed to the next choice, zidovudine. Safety and effectiveness of dosage titration was not reported in treatment naive patients. It was only reported in those patients with sustained virologic suppression. These findings are not generalized to stavudine used in ART naive patients who have high viral loads. In November 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that ""[The WHO] recommends that countries phase out the use of stavudine, or d4T, because of its long-term, irreversible side-effects. Stavudine is still widely used in first-line therapy in developing countries due to its low cost and widespread availability. Zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) are recommended as less toxic and equally effective alternatives."" == Mechanism of action == Stavudine is a nucleoside analog of thymidine. It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases into an active triphosphate. Stavudine triphosphate inhibits HIV's reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme the virus uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA in order to insert its genetic material into the host's DNA. Upon incorporation into the DNA strand, stavudine triphosphate causes termination of DNA replication. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption: Stavudine has rapid absorption and good oral bioavailability (F = 0.86). Distribution: Stavudine does not bind to proteins in the blood. Metabolism: The clearance of stavudine is affected minimally by hepatic metabolism. Oxidation and glucuronidation produce minor metabolites. Elimination: Stavudine is mostly eliminated in the urine and mostly in its unchanged form. == Drug interactions == Simultaneous use of zidovudine is not recommended, as it can inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of stavudine. Other anti-HIV drugs do not possess this property. Stavudine is not protein-bound nor does it inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms. Thus, significant drug interactions with drugs metabolized through these pathways or drugs that are protein-bound are unlikely. == History == Stavudine was first created by Jerome Horwitz in the 1960s and was originally named D4T. When the AIDS epidemic occurred in the 1980s, William Prusoff and others at Yale University discovered the anti-HIV properties of stavudine. In 1990, Yale patented the use of the drug stavudine (d4T) to treat HIV and granted an exclusive license to Bristol-Myers Squibb to manufacture the drug under the brand name Zerit. Since then, stavudine became a key drug for treating HIV. However, because of its high price (over $1600 per year), Zerit was inaccessible to infected people in developing countries. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) found an Indian manufacturer, who was willing to sell stavudine in South Africa for $40 per year per patient. However, this deal fell apart, because Yale patented stavudine in South Africa, and was unwilling to issue a license to the Indian generic manufacturer. Students sided with Médecins Sans Frontières and approached Yale with the idea to put pressure on Bristol-Myers Squibb to lower Stavudine's prices in South Africa and/or to issue patent licenses to generic manufacturers. After the issue was publicized, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced, that it would not enforce the stavudine patent in South Africa and that it would sell Zerit in sub-Saharan Africa for $55 per year. Stavudine was the first drug to be granted parallel track status in 1992, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allowed the agency to make Stavudine available to patients before being approved. Stavudine was submitted under the FDA's accelerated approval process. Through this process, Stavudine's effectiveness was measured by its effect on the surrogate marker, CD4, instead of clinical endpoints. The FDA concluded that an increase in CD4 cell counts was an indicator of how effective the drug would be against AIDS and HIV infection. Stavudine was the fourth drug to be approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection by the FDA on 27 June 1994. Even after approval, studies were continued to evaluate the clinical benefit of the drug. If there is no indication of clinical benefits, the accelerated approval may be withdrawn. In 2018, Mylan Pharmaceuticals discontinued manufacturing stavudine 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg capsules. == References ==",Zerit,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.0265373677830212e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002810560108628124)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/zerit.html ', [])"
3621,"('Oxytocin (acetate)', 'Œ±-hypophamine acetate', 'Oxytocic hormone acetate', 'Pitocin', 'Endopituitrina')","Endogenous, Medical","Synthetic oxytocin, sold under the brand name Pitocin among others, is a medication made from the peptide oxytocin. As a medication, it is used to cause contraction of the uterus to start labor, increase the speed of labor, and to stop bleeding following delivery. For this purpose, it is given by injection either into a muscle or into a vein. Oxytocin is also available in intranasal spray form for psychiatric, endocrine and weight management use as a supplement. Intranasal oxytocin works on a different pathway than injected oxytocin, primarily along the olfactory nerve crossing the blood–brain barrier to the olfactory lobe in the brain, where dense magnocellular oxytocin neurons receive the nerve impulse quickly. The natural occurrence of oxytocin was discovered in 1906. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == An intravenous infusion of oxytocin is used to induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the oxytocin challenge test fails. Whether a high dose is better than a standard dose for labor induction is unclear. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors. It is registered in many countries for use in suppressing premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (such as ritodrine, salbutamol and terbutaline). Oxytocin has not been found to be useful for improving breastfeeding success. == Contraindications == Oxytocin injection (synthetic) is contraindicated in any of these conditions: Substantial cephalopelvic disproportion Unfavorable fetal position or presentation (e.g., transverse lies) undeliverable without conversion before delivery Obstetric emergencies where maternal or fetal risk-to-benefit ratio favors surgery Fetal distress when delivery is not imminent Umbilical cord prolapse Uterine activity fails to progress adequately Hyperactive or hypertonic uterus Vaginal delivery is contraindicated (e.g., invasive cervical carcinoma, active genital herpes infection, total placenta previa, vasa previa, cord presentation or prolapse) Uterine or cervical scarring from previous cesarean section or major cervical or uterine (e.g., transfundal) surgery Unengaged fetal head History of hypersensitivity to oxytocin or any ingredient in the formulation == Side effects == Oxytocin is relatively safe when used at recommended doses, and side effects are uncommon. These maternal events have been reported: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Increased blood pressure Cardiac arrhythmia including increased or decreased heart rate, and premature ventricular contraction Impaired uterine blood flow Pelvic hematoma Afibrinogenemia Anaphylaxis Nausea and vomiting Increased fetal blood flow Excessive dosage or long-term administration (over a period of 24 hours or longer) has been known to result in tetanic uterine contractions, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, sometimes fatal. Water intoxication may be exhibited in administration through symptoms such as seizures, comas, neonatal jaundice, and potential fatality. Managed fluids intake and consistent monitoring of sodium levels has been researched as crucial in the safe administration of oxytocin. The use of oxytocin during childbirth has been linked to an increased need for other medical interventions, most primarily, through the administration of an epidural anaesthetic. This has been documented as creating a 'cascade effect', potentially causing detrimental impacts to the birthing process. Since a landmark investigation was published in JAMA Pediatrics by researchers in 2013, the potential link between oxytocin use during childbirth and increased risks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children's development has been a topic of debate. Oxytocin was added to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices's list of High Alert Medications in Acute Care Settings in 2012. The list includes medications that have a high risk for harm if administered incorrectly. During pregnancy, increased uterine motility has led to decreased heart rate, cardiac arrhythmia, seizures, brain damage, and death in the fetus or neonate. Use is linked to an increased risk of postpartum depression in the mother. Certain learning and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can impair memory retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks. However, oxytocin does seem to facilitate learning and memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered intranasal oxytocin show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces. == Pharmacodynamics == In addition to its oxytocin receptor agonism, oxytocin has been found to act as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the μ- and κ-opioid receptors and this may be involved in its analgesic effects. == Pharmacokinetics == === Routes of administration === One IU of oxytocin is the equivalent of about 1.68 μg or mcg of pure peptide. Injection: Clinical doses of oxytocin are given by injection either into a muscle or into a vein to cause contraction of the uterus. Very small amounts (< 1%) do appear to enter the central nervous system in humans when peripherally administered. The compound has a half-life of typically about 3 minutes in the blood when given intravenously. Intravenous administration requires 40 minutes to reach a steady-state concentration and achieve maximum uterine contraction response. Buccal: Oxytocin was delivered in buccal tablets, but this is not common practice any more. Under the tongue: Oxytocin is poorly absorbed sublingually. Nasal administration: Oxytocin is effectively distributed to the brain when administered intranasally via a nasal spray, after which it reliably crosses the blood–brain barrier and exhibits psychoactive effects in humans. No serious adverse effects with short-term application of oxytocin with 18~40 IU (36–80 mcg) have been recorded. Intranasal oxytocin has a central duration of at least 2.25 hours and as long as 4 hours. Oral: While it was originally assumed that Oxytocin administered orally would be destroyed in the gastrointestinal tract, studies have shown that Oxytocin is transported by the immunoglobulin RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) across the intestinal epithelium and into the blood. Orally-administered Oxytocin has been shown to increase putamen responses to facial emotions in humans. Oxytocin administered orally produces different effects on human behaviour and brain function than when given intranasally, possibly due to variations in the molecular transport and binding mechanisms. == Chemistry == Peptide analogues of oxytocin with similar actions, for example carbetocin (Duratocin) and demoxytocin (Sandopart), have been developed and marketed for medical use. In addition, small-molecule oxytocin receptor agonists, like TC OT 39, WAY-267464, and LIT-001 have been developed and studied. However, lack of selectivity over vasopressin receptors has so far limited the potential usefulness of small-molecule oxytocin receptor agonists. == History == Oxytocin's uterine-contracting properties were discovered by British pharmacologist Henry Hallett Dale in 1906. Oxytocin's milk ejection property was described by Ott and Scott in 1910 and by Schafer and Mackenzie in 1911. Oxytocin was the first polypeptide hormone to be sequenced or synthesized. Du Vigneaud was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1955 for his work. === Etymology === The word oxytocin was coined from the term oxytocic. Greek ὀξύς, oxys, and τόκος, tokos, meaning ""quick birth"". == Society and culture == === Counterfeits === In African and Asian countries, some oxytocin products were found to be counterfeit medications. == Other uses == The trust-inducing property of oxytocin might help those with social anxiety and depression, anxiety, fear, and social dysfunctions, such as generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder, as well as autism and schizophrenia, among others. However, a 2013 meta-analysis only autism spectrum disorder showed a significant combined effect size. A 2022 study found an indication of an effect among autistic children aged 3–5, but not among autistic children aged 5-12. People using oxytocin show improved recognition for positive social cues over threatening social cues and improved recognition of fear. Autism: Oxytocin may play a role in autism and may be an effective treatment for autism's repetitive and affiliative behaviors. Relationship counseling: The use of oxytocin in relationship counseling for well-being has been suggested. Post-traumatic stress disorder: It has been suggested that oxytocin may be a safer option than MDMA for the treatment of PTSD, although oxytocin has less evidence of efficacy. == See also == Attachment theory List of investigational anxiolytics List of investigational sexual dysfunction drugs == References ==",Pitocin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002614550176076591), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.659658250398934e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2014646977186203)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/pitocin,https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/pitocin-1/,https://www.verywellhealth.com/pitocin-5270507 ', [])"
3622,"('Protirelin (acetate)', 'Thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (acetate)', 'Protirelin', 'Thyroliberin', 'Lopremone')",Medical,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a hypophysiotropic hormone produced by neurons in the hypothalamus that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin from the anterior pituitary. TRH has been used clinically for the treatment of spinocerebellar degeneration and disturbance of consciousness in humans. Its pharmaceutical form is called protirelin (INN) (). == Synthesis and release == TRH is synthesized within parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is translated as a 242-amino acid precursor polypeptide that contains 6 copies of the sequence -Gln-His-Pro-Gly-, with both ends of the sequence flanked by Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg sequences. To produce the mature form, a series of enzymes are required. First, a protease cleaves to the C-terminal side of the flanking Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg. Second, a carboxypeptidase removes the Lys/Arg residues leaving Gly as the C-terminal residue. Then, this Gly is converted into an amide residue by a series of enzymes collectively known as peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase. Concurrently with these processing steps, the N-terminal Gln (glutamine) is converted into pyroglutamate (a cyclic residue). These multiple steps produce 6 copies of the mature TRH molecule per precursor molecule for human TRH (5 for mouse TRH). TRH synthesizing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus project to the medial portion of the external layer of the median eminence. Following secretion at the median eminence, TRH travels to the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system where it binds to the TRH receptor stimulating the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone from thyrotropes and prolactin from lactotropes. The half-life of TRH in the blood is approximately 6 minutes. == Structure == TRH is a tripeptide, with an amino acid sequence of pyroglutamyl-histidyl-proline amide. == History == The structure of TRH was first determined, and the hormone synthesized, by Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally in 1969. Both parties insisted their labs determined the sequence first: Schally first suggested the possibility in 1966, but abandoned it after Guillemin proposed TRH was not actually a peptide. Guillemin's chemist began concurring with these results in 1969, as NIH threatened to cut off funding for the project, leading both parties to return to work on synthesis. Schally and Guillemin shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine ""for their discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain."" News accounts of their work often focused on their ""fierce competition"" and use of a very large amount of sheep and pig brains to locate the hormone. == Clinical significance == TRH is used clinically by intravenous injection (brand name Relefact TRH) to test the response of the anterior pituitary gland; this procedure is known as a TRH test. This is done as diagnostic test of thyroid disorders such as secondary hypothyroidism and in acromegaly. TRH has anti-depressant and anti-suicidal properties, and in 2012 the U.S. Army awarded a research grant to develop a TRH nasal spray in order to prevent suicide amongst its ranks. The antidepressant properties of TRH are present when TRH is administered intrathecally, or administration into the spine, and the effects are short-lived. Some researchers are testing a prodrug approach to administer TRH orally and have TRH reach the brain without being degraded in the stomach or blood. TRH has been shown in mice to be an anti-aging agent with a broad spectrum of activities that, because of their actions, suggest that TRH has a fundamental role in the regulation of metabolic and hormonal functions. == Side effects == Side effects after intravenous TRH administration are minimal. Nausea, flushing, urinary urgency, and mild rise in blood pressure have been reported. After intrathecal administration, shaking, sweating, shivering, restlessness, and mild rise in blood pressure were observed. == See also == Thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor Thyroid-stimulating hormone Hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis Hypothalamic–pituitary–prolactin axis == References == == External links == Media related to Thyrotropin-releasing hormone at Wikimedia Commons",Protirelin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.10026177763938904), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' END', 0.0), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.2471589798224159e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.06812361627817154), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.001508051878772676), ('ĠEND', -0.00020621081057470292), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00027044929447583854)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.014163628220558167), (' END', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09421?utm_source=openai), [kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D00176?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=159, start_index=20, title='Protirelin: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09421?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=159, start_index=20, title='KEGG DRUG: Protirelin', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D00176?utm_source=openai')])"

3624,"('Taurine', 'Ethanesulfonic acid, 2-amino-', 'Tauphon', 'O-due', 'Taufon')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Taurine (), or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is a non-proteinogenic naturally occurring amino sulfonic acid that is widely distributed in animal tissues. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine, and accounts for up to 0.1% of total human body weight. Taurine is named after Latin taurus (cognate to Ancient Greek ταῦρος, taûros) meaning bull or ox, as it was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists Friedrich Tiedemann and Leopold Gmelin. It was discovered in human bile in 1846 by Edmund Ronalds. Although taurine is abundant in human organs with diverse putative roles, it is not an essential human dietary nutrient and is not included among nutrients with a recommended intake level. Taurine is synthesized naturally in the human liver from methionine and cysteine. Taurine is commonly sold as a dietary supplement, but there is no good clinical evidence that taurine supplements provide any benefit to human health. Taurine is used as a food additive for cats (who require it as an essential nutrient), dogs, and poultry. Taurine concentrations in land plants are low or undetectable, but up to 1000 nmol/g wet weight have been found in algae. == Chemical and biochemical features == Taurine exists as a zwitterion H3N+CH2CH2SO−3, as verified by X-ray crystallography. The sulfonic acid has a low pKa ensuring that it is fully ionized to the sulfonate at the pHs found in the intestinal tract. === Synthesis === Synthetic taurine is obtained by the ammonolysis of isethionic acid (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of ethylene oxide with aqueous sodium bisulfite. A direct approach involves the reaction of aziridine with sulfurous acid. In 1993, about 5000–6000 tonnes of taurine were produced for commercial purposes: 50% for pet food and 50% in pharmaceutical applications. As of 2010, China alone has more than 40 manufacturers of taurine. Most of these enterprises employ the ethanolamine method to produce a total annual production of about 3000 t. In the laboratory, taurine can be produced by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts. === Biosynthesis === Taurine is naturally derived from cysteine. Mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the liver via the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. In this pathway, cysteine is first oxidized to its sulfinic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine. Hypotaurine is enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine by hypotaurine dehydrogenase. Taurine is also produced by the transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine into cystathionine. The cystathionine is then converted to hypotaurine by the sequential action of three enzymes: cystathionine gamma-lyase, cysteine dioxygenase, and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Hypotaurine is then oxidized to taurine as described above. A pathway for taurine biosynthesis from serine and sulfate is reported in microalgae, developing chicken embryos, and chick liver. Serine dehydratase converts serine to 2-aminoacrylate, which is converted to cysteic acid by 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate:2-aminoacrylate C-sulfotransferase. Cysteic acid is converted to taurine by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. == In food == Taurine occurs naturally in fish and meat. The mean daily intake from omnivore diets was determined to be around 58 mg (range 9–372 mg), and to be low or negligible from a vegan diet. Typical taurine consumption in the American diet is about 123–178 mg per day. Taurine is partially destroyed by heat in processes such as baking and boiling. This is a concern for cat food, as cats have a dietary requirement for taurine and can easily become deficient. Either raw feeding or supplementing taurine can satisfy this requirement. Both lysine and taurine can mask the metallic flavor of potassium chloride, a salt substitute. === Breast milk === Prematurely born infants are believed to lack the enzymes needed to convert cystathionine to cysteine, and may, therefore, become deficient in taurine. Taurine is present in breast milk, and has been added to many infant formulas as a measure of prudence since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial. === Energy drinks and dietary supplements === Taurine is an ingredient in some energy drinks in amounts of 1–3 grams per serving. A 1999 assessment of European consumption of energy drinks found that taurine intake was 40–400 mg per day. == Research == Taurine is not regarded as an essential human dietary nutrient and has not been assigned recommended intake levels. High-quality clinical studies to determine possible effects of taurine in the body or following dietary supplementation are absent from the literature. Preliminary human studies on the possible effects of taurine supplementation have been inadequate due to low subject numbers, inconsistent designs, and variable doses. == Safety and toxicity == According to the European Food Safety Authority, taurine is ""considered to be a skin and eye irritant and skin sensitiser, and to be hazardous if inhaled;"" it may be safe to consume up to 6 grams of taurine per day. Other sources indicate that taurine is safe for supplemental intake in normal healthy adults at up to 3 grams per day. A 2008 review found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, concluding, ""The amounts of guarana, taurine, and ginseng found in popular energy drinks are far below the amounts expected to deliver either therapeutic benefits or adverse events"". == Animal dietary requirement == === Cats === Cats lack the enzyme sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to produce taurine and must therefore acquire it from their diet. A taurine deficiency in cats can lead to retinal degeneration and eventually blindness – a condition known as central retinal degeneration as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Other effects of a diet lacking in this essential amino acid are dilated cardiomyopathy, and reproductive failure in female cats. Decreased plasma taurine concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation. Taurine is now a requirement of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine in dry food and 0.2% in wet food. Studies suggest the amino acid should be supplied at 10 mg/kg of bodyweight per day for domestic cats. === Other mammals === A number of other mammals also have a requirement for taurine. While the majority of dogs can synthesize taurine, case reports have described a singular American cocker spaniel, 19 Newfoundland dogs, and a family of golden retrievers suffering from taurine deficiency treatable with supplementation. Foxes on fur farms also appear to require dietary taurine. The rhesus, cebus and cynomolgus monkeys each require taurine at least in infancy. The giant anteater also requires taurine. === Birds === Taurine appears to be essential for the development of passerine birds. Many passerines seek out taurine-rich spiders to feed their young, particularly just after hatching. Researchers compared the behaviours and development of birds fed a taurine-supplemented diet to a control diet and found the juveniles fed taurine-rich diets as neonates were much larger risk takers and more adept at spatial learning tasks. Under natural conditions, each blue tit nestling receive 1 mg of taurine per day from parents. Taurine can be synthesized by chickens. Supplementation has no effect on chickens raised under adequate lab conditions, but seems to help with growth under stresses such as heat and dense housing. === Fish === Species of fish, mostly carnivorous ones, show reduced growth and survival when the fish-based feed in their food is replaced with soy meal or feather meal. Taurine has been identified as the factor responsible for this phenomenon; supplementation of taurine to plant-based fish feed reverses these effects. Future aquaculture is expected to use more of these more environmentally-friendly protein sources, so supplementation would become more important. The need of taurine in fish is conditional, differing by species and growth stage. The olive flounder, for example, has lower capacity to synthesize taurine compared to the rainbow trout. Juvenile fish are less efficient at taurine biosyntheis due to reduced cysteine sulfinate decarboxylase levels. == Derivatives == Taurine is used in the preparation of the anthelmintic drug netobimin (Totabin). Taurolidine Taurocholic acid and tauroselcholic acid Tauromustine 5-Taurinomethyluridine and 5-taurinomethyl-2-thiouridine are modified uridines in (human) mitochondrial tRNA. Tauryl is the functional group attaching at the sulfur, 2-aminoethylsulfonyl. Taurino is the functional group attaching at the nitrogen, 2-sulfoethylamino.

3625,"('Prednisone', 'Dehydrocortisone', 'Decortin', 'Deltasone', 'Meticorten')",Medical,"Prednisone is a glucocorticoid medication mostly used to suppress the immune system and decrease inflammation in conditions such as asthma, COPD, and rheumatologic diseases. It is also used to treat high blood calcium due to cancer and adrenal insufficiency along with other steroids. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects may include cataracts, bone loss, easy bruising, muscle weakness, and thrush. Other side effects include weight gain, swelling, high blood sugar, increased risk of infection, and psychosis. It is generally considered safe in pregnancy and low doses appear to be safe while the user is breastfeeding. After prolonged use, prednisone must be stopped gradually. Prednisone is a prodrug and must be converted to prednisolone by the liver before it becomes active. Prednisolone then binds to glucocorticoid receptors, activating them and triggering changes in gene expression. Prednisone was patented in 1954 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 30th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Prednisone is used for many different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, including asthma, gout, COPD, CIDP, rheumatic disorders, allergic disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, adrenocortical insufficiency, hypercalcemia due to cancer, thyroiditis, laryngitis, severe tuberculosis, hives, eczema, lipid pneumonitis, pericarditis, multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, sarcoidosis, to relieve the effects of shingles, lupus, myasthenia gravis, poison oak exposure, Ménière's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, giant cell arteritis, the Herxheimer reaction that is common during the treatment of syphilis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, uveitis, and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection after organ transplant. Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headaches and for severe aphthous ulcer. Prednisone is used as an antitumor drug. Prednisone is often also prescribed as a form of treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). Prednisone can be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to increase renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large doses of loop diuretics. In terms of the mechanism of action for this purpose: prednisone, a glucocorticoid, can improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by increasing the density of natriuretic peptide receptor type A in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, thereby inducing a potent diuresis. At high doses, it may be used to prevent rejection following an organ transplant. == Side effects == Short-term side effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood glucose levels (especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as tacrolimus) and mineralocorticoid effects such as fluid retention. The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly. It can also cause depression or depressive symptoms and anxiety in some individuals. Long-term side effects include Cushing's syndrome, steroid dementia syndrome, truncal weight gain, glaucoma and cataracts, diabetes mellitus type 2, and depression upon dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids can also increase the risk of osteoporosis, but research has found that few of these people were taking medications to protect bones. Prednisone also results in leukocytosis. === Major === Source: === Minor === Source: === Dependency === Adrenal suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days. Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone is short but may take weeks or months if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an Addisonian crisis. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects. Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the hypothalamus, decreasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland, decreasing the amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again. Prednisone may start to result in the suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis if used at doses 7–10 mg or higher for several weeks. This is approximately equal to the amount of endogenous cortisol produced by the body every day. As such, the HPA axis starts to become suppressed and atrophy. If this occurs the patient should be tapered off prednisone slowly to give the adrenal gland enough time to regain its function and endogenous production of steroids. === Withdrawal === The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have: received more than 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than one week been given repeat doses in the evening received more than three weeks of treatment recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than three weeks) taken a short course within one year of stopping long-term therapy other possible causes of adrenal suppression Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse who have received treatment for three weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above. During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5 mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur. == Pharmacology == Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Prednisone is a prodrug; it is metabolised in the liver by 11-β-HSD to prednisolone, the active drug. Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to prednisolone. === Pharmacokinetics === Prednisone is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and has a half-life of 2–3 hours. it has a volume of distribution of 0.4–1 L/kg. The drug is cleared by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome P450 enzymes. Metabolites are excreted in the bile and urine. === Lodotra === ""Lodotra"" is the brand name of an oral formulation, which releases prednisone four hours after ingestion. It is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness. Taken at 10 p.m., it releases the drug at around 2 a.m. The plasmic peak level is reached at 4 a.m., which is considered to be the optimal time for relieving morning stiffness. The drug was approved in the European Union, in January 2009. == Industry == The pharmaceutical industry uses prednisone tablets for the calibration of dissolution testing equipment according to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). == Chemistry == Prednisone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisone and is also known as δ1-cortisone or 1,2-dehydrocortisone or as 17α,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione. == History == The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by Arthur Nobile. The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became Schering-Plough Corporation, by Arthur Nobile and coworkers. They discovered that cortisone could be microbiologically oxidized to prednisone by the bacterium Corynebacterium simplex. The same process was used to prepare prednisolone from hydrocortisone. The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice. Prednisone and prednisolone were introduced in 1955 by Schering and Upjohn, under the brand names Meticorten and Delta-Cortef, respectively. == References ==",Meticorten,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012232924345880747), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008697722107172012)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3626,"('Toyocamycin', 'Vengicide', 'Antibiotic 1037', 'Siromycin', 'Cyanotubericidin')",Medical," Toyocamycin is a member of the nucleoside antibiotic family and has been recognized as a promising fungicide for the control of plant diseases. However, low productivity of toyocamycin remains an important bottleneck in its industrial production. Therefore, dramatic improvements of strains for overproduction of toyocamycin are of great interest in applied microbiology research. In this study, we sequentially selected for mutations for multiple drug resistance to promote the overproduction of toyocamycin by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes 1628. The triple mutant strain, SD3145 (str str par), was obtained through sequential screenings. This strain showed an enhanced capacity to produce toyocamycin (1500 mg/L), 24-fold higher than the wild type in GYM liquid medium. This dramatic overproduction was attributed at least partially to the acquisition of an rsmG mutation and increased gene expression of toyA, which encodes a LuxR-family transcriptional regulator for toyocamycin biosynthesis. The expression of toyF and toyG, probably directly involved in toyocamycin biosynthesis, was also enhanced, contributing to toyocamycin overproduction. By addition of a small amount of scandium (ScCl3·6H2O), the mutant strain, SD3145, produced more toyocamycin (2664 mg/L) in TPM medium, which was the highest toyocamycin level produced in shake-flask fermentation by a streptomycete so far. We demonstrated that introduction of combined drug resistance mutations into S. diastatochromogenes 1628 resulted in an obvious increase in the toyocamycin production. The triple mutant strain, SD3145, generated in our study could be useful for improvement of industrial production of toyocamycin. Streptomyces albulus CK-15 produces various secondary metabolites, including the antibiotics wuyiencin and toyocamycin, which can reportedly control a broad range of plant fungal diseases. The production of these nucleoside antibiotics in CK-15 is regulated by two biosynthesis gene clusters. To investigate the potential effect of toyocamycin biosynthesis on wuyiencin production, we herein generated S. albulus strains in which a key gene in the toyocamycin biosynthesis gene cluster, namely toyF, was either deleted or overexpressed. The toyF deletion mutant ∆toyF did not produce toyocamycin, while the production of wuyiencin increased by 23.06% in comparison with that in the wild-type (WT) strain. In addition, ΔtoyF reached the highest production level of wuyiencin 4 h faster than the WT strain (60 h vs. and 64 h). Further, toyocamycin production by the toyF overexpression strain was two-fold higher than by the WT strain, while wuyiencin production was reduced by 29.10%. qRT-PCR showed that most genes in the toyocamycin biosynthesis gene cluster were expressed at lower levels in ∆toyF as compared with those in the WT strain, while the expression levels of genes in the wuyiencin biosynthesis gene cluster were upregulated. Finally, the growth rate of ∆toyF was much faster than that of the WT strain when cultured on solid or liquid medium. Based on our findings, we report that in industrial fermentation processes, ∆toyF has the potential to increase the production of wuyiencin and reduce the timeframe of fermentation. Aberrant transcription in cancer cells involves the silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and activation of oncogenes. Transcriptomic changes are associated with epigenomic alterations such as DNA-hypermethylation, histone deacetylation, and chromatin condensation in promoter regions of silenced TSGs. To discover novel drugs that trigger TSG reactivation in cancer cells, we used a GFP-reporter system whose expression is silenced by promoter DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation. After screening a natural product drug library, we identified that toyocamycin, an adenosine-analog, induces potent GFP reactivation and loss of clonogenicity in human colon cancer cells. Connectivity-mapping analysis revealed that toyocamycin produces a pharmacological signature mimicking cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. RNA-sequencing revealed that the toyocamycin transcriptomic signature resembles that of a specific CDK9 inhibitor (HH1). Specific inhibition of RNA Pol II phosphorylation level and kinase assays confirmed that toyocamycin specifically inhibits CDK9 (IC",Toyocamycin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.08404824882745743), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -7.493430894101039e-05), (' INDUSTR', -9.722539834911004e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.37185317277908325), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.023691195994615555), ('ĠMED', -0.011790941469371319), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018217505887150764)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00020401719666551799)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyocamycin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=6, title='Toyocamycin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyocamycin?utm_source=openai')])"

Its activity against bacteria with fluoroquinolone resistance is attributed to its evasion of bacterial efflux pumps. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Ozenoxacin is synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of a bromoquinolone and a pyridyl tributylstannane (Stille coupling). The pyridyl tributylstannane is synthesized from the corresponding dihalopyridine. This is achieved through a sequence of nucleophilic aromatic substitution with methylamine, which is protected as the acetamide using acetic anhydride and this is converted to the organostannane through a Pd-catalyzed stannylation with bis(tributyltin). The bromoquinolone is made from the N-cyclopropyl aniline and diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate, which react through a Michael addition, followed by elimination of the ethoxy group and then a Friedel-Crafts acylation at elevated temperature.

HEDTA (hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid) and its trisodium salt are substituted amines. These ingredients function as chelating agents in cosmetic formulations. The typical concentration of use of EDTA is less than 2%, with the other salts in current use at even lower concentrations. The lowest dose reported to cause a toxic effect in animals was 750 mg/kg/day. These chelating agents are cytotoxic and weakly genotoxic, but not carcinogenic. Oral exposures to EDTA produced adverse reproductive and developmental effects in animals. Clinical tests reported no absorption of an EDTA salt through the skin. These ingredients are likely, however, to affect the passage of other chemicals into the skin because they will chelate calcium. Exposure to EDTA in most cosmetic formulations, therefore, would produce systemic exposure levels well below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies. Exposure to EDTA in cosmetic formulations that may be inhaled, however, was a concern. An exposure assessment done using conservative assumptions predicted that the maximum EDTA dose via inhalation of an aerosolized cosmetic formulation is below that shown to produce reproductive or developmental toxicity. Because of the potential to increase the penetration of other chemicals, formulators should continue to be aware of this when combining these ingredients with ingredients that previously have been determined to be safe, primarily because they were not significantly absorbed. Based on the available data, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel found that these ingredients are safe as used in cosmetic formulations. The conventional x-ray angiography (XRA) provides a gold standard for diagnosis of vascular diseases (1). However, this technique requires administration of a large volume of iodinated contrast media through arterial puncture and exposes patients to a significant dose of ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive alternative to XRA that derives signals from tissue water protons without irradiation (1, 2). The difference between the signal intensity of vasculatures and that of surrounding tissues creates contrasts in MR images and results in a MR angiogram. The use of blood pool contrast agents (BPCAs) enhances the signal in vasculatures and improves the quality of MR angiograms (3). BPCAs are paramagnetic contrast agents designed to remain in the blood for a prolonged time compared to conventional contrast agents like gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) (3). BPCAs normally include macromolecules attached gadolinium chelates or iron oxide nanoparticles that are sufficiently large to prevent them from diffusing through the endothelium of normal tissue and entering the interstitial space easily. These agents can produce persistent signal-enhancing effects in a much longer acquisition time window to yield better signal-to-noise ratio and image spatial resolution. The difference between their molecular size and the pore size in the capillary endothelium of organs determines their biodistribution and elimination (3). Glomerular capillaries in the kidneys are fenestrated with pores 60–70 nm in diameter, allowing for rapid excretion of molecules <20 kDa regardless of their charges. Molecules between 20 and 70 kDa are partly or completely excreted through the kidney endothelial membrane depending on pH, lipid solubility, and polarity. Molecules >70 kDa do not pass through the glomerulus filter but are metabolized before excretion. For instance, albumin-(DTPA) The crystal structure of anhydrous tris-odium citrate, Na3(C6H5O7), has been solved and refined using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data, and optimized using density functional theory (DFT).

There is a need for novel drugs to fulfill this challenge. Pyroptosis-inducing drugs can inhibit tumor growth. However, their roles in ovarian cancer have not been demonstrated. We tested the effectiveness of a novel drug, BI 2536, which we found in colorectal cancer. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, and drug-induced apoptosis and pyroptosis were tested.  BI 2536 significantly inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phases. After BI 2536 treatment, DNA fragmentation and PS exposure on the outside of apoptotic cells were detected. Moreover, the pyroptotic phenotype of ovarian cancer cells along with the release of LDH and HMGB1 were observed, indicating the leakage of cells. Western blot analysis verified that BI 2536 induced GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Pyroptosis was abolished after additional treatment with Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor. Thus, BI 2536 induced pyroptosis in ovarian cancer through the caspase-3/GSDME pathway.  In this study, we identified BI 2536 as an effective anti-ovarian cancer drug that inhibits proliferation, arrests the cell cycle, induces apoptosis and pyroptosis, and leads to the accumulation of CD8 HIV-1 latent reservoirs harbouring silenced but replication-competent proviruses are a major obstacle against viral eradication in infected patients. The ""shock and kill"" strategy aims to reactivate latent provirus with latency reversing agents (LRAs) in the presence of antiretroviral drugs, necessitating the development of effective and efficient LRAs. We screened a chemical library for potential LRAs and identified two dual Polo-like kinase (PLK)/bromodomain inhibitors, BI-2536 and BI-6727 (volasertib), which are currently undergoing clinical trials against various cancers. BI-2536 and BI-6727 significantly reactivated silenced HIV-1 provirus at both the mRNA and protein level in two latently infected model cell lines (ACH2 and U1). BI-2536 dramatically reactivated transcription of latent HIV-1 provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from infected patients. Long terminal repeat activation by the inhibitors was associated with bromodomain rather than PLK inhibition. We also found that BI-2536 synergistically activates the latent provirus in combination with SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, or the non-tumour-promoting phorbol ester prostratin. Our findings strongly suggest that BI-2536 and BI-6727 are potent LRAs for the ""shock and kill"" HIV-1 eradication strategy. Human Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential regulator of mitotic progression. Targeted inhibition of this kinase was effective in killing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The Plk1 inhibitor BI_2536 was well tolerated and showed antitumor activity in the first clinical trials enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors and refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.",Bi 2536,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013061572099104524), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018165765330195427)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.15310683415737e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.abbexa.com/bi-2536,https://www.yeasen.com/products/detail/1080,https://axispharm.com/product/bi-2536/,https://interpriseusa.com/product/bi-2536-50-mg/,https://drugs.ncats.io/substance/4LJG22T9C6,https://www.invivochem.com/bi-2536.html,https://www.anbapharma.com/index.php/products/research-areas/cancer/bi-2536,https://www.selleckchem.com/datasheet/BI-2536-S110906-DataSheet.html,https://www.medchemexpress.cn/bi-2536.html ', [])"

3639,"('Zoledronic acid (monohydrate)', 'Zoledronic acid', 'Zoledronate', 'Zometa', 'Reclast')",Medical,"Zoledronic acid, also known as zoledronate and sold under the brand name Zometa among others, by Novartis among others, is a medication used to treat a number of bone diseases. These include osteoporosis, high blood calcium due to cancer, bone breakdown due to cancer, Paget's disease of bone and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include fever, joint pain, high blood pressure, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood calcium, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. It is in the bisphosphonate family of medications. It works by blocking the activity of osteoclast cells and thus decreases the breakdown of bone. Zoledronic acid was patented in 1986 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Zoledronic acid is indicated for the prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery to bone, or tumor-induced hypercalcemia) in people with advanced malignancies involving bone; the treatment of adults with tumor-induced hypercalcemia (TIH). Zoledronic acid is also indicated for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis; the treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis; the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis; the treatment of Paget’s disease of bone in men and women. === Bone complications of cancer === Zoledronic acid is used to prevent bone fractures in patients with cancers such as multiple myeloma and prostate cancer, as well as for treating osteoporosis. It can also be used to treat hypercalcaemia of malignancy and can be helpful for treating pain from bone metastases. It can be given at home rather than in hospital. Such use has shown safety and quality-of-life benefits in people with breast cancer and bone metastases. === Osteoporosis === Zoledronic acid is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in men and post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture. In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved zoledronic acid for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. === Other === Zoledronic acid may be used for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta. == Contraindications == Poor kidney function (e.g. estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min) Hypocalcaemia Pregnancy Paralysis == Side effects == Side effects can include fatigue, anemia, muscle aches, fever, and/or swelling in the feet or legs. Flu-like symptoms are common after the first infusion, although not subsequent infusions, and are thought to occur because of its potential to activate human gamma delta T cell (γδ T cells). === Kidneys === There is a risk of severe renal impairment. Appropriate hydration is important before administration, as is adequate calcium and vitamin D intake before Aclasta therapy in patients with hypocalcaemia, and for ten days following Aclasta in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. Monitoring for other mineral metabolism disorders and the avoidance of invasive dental procedures for those who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw is recommended. Zoledronate is rapidly processed via the kidneys; consequently its administration is not recommended for patients with reduced renal function or kidney disease. Some cases of acute kidney injury either requiring dialysis or having a fatal outcome following Reclast use have been reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This assessment was confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) specified new contraindications for the medication on 15 December 2011, which include hypocalcaemia and severe renal impairment with a creatinine clearance of less than 35 ml/min. === Bone === ==== Osteonecrosis of the jaw ==== A rare complication that has been recently observed in cancer patients being treated with bisphosphonates is osteonecrosis of the jaw. This has mainly been seen in patients with multiple myeloma treated with zoledronic acid who have had dental extractions. ==== Atypical fractures ==== After approving the drug in July 2009, the European Medicines Agency conducted a class review of all bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, after several cases of atypical fractures were reported. In 2008, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) noted that alendronic acid was associated with an increased risk of atypical fracture of the femur that developed with low or no trauma. In April 2010, the PhVWP noted that further data from both the published literature and post-marketing reports were now available which suggested that atypical stress fractures of the femur may be a class effect. The European Medicines Agency then reviewed all case reports of stress fractures in patients treated with bisphosphonates, relevant data from the published literature, and data provided by the companies which market bisphosphonates. The Agency recommended that doctors who prescribe bisphosphonate-containing medicines should be aware that atypical fractures may occur rarely in the femur, especially after long-term use, and that doctors who are prescribing these medicines for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should regularly review the need for continued treatment, especially after five or more years of use. == Pharmacology == As a nitrogenous bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, allowing the bone-forming cells time to rebuild normal bone and allowing bone remodeling. == Research == Zoledronic acid has been found to have a direct antitumor effect and to synergistically augment the effects of other antitumor agents in osteosarcoma cells. Zoledronic acid has shown significant benefits versus placebo over three years, with a reduced number of vertebral fractures and improved markers of bone density. An annual dose of zoledronic acid may also prevent recurring fractures in patients with a previous hip fracture. === With hormone therapy for breast cancer === An increase in disease-free survival (DFS) was found in the ABCSG-12 trial, in which 1,803 premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer received anastrozole with zoledronic acid. A retrospective analysis of the AZURE trial data revealed a DFS survival advantage, particularly where estrogen had been reduced. In a meta-analysis of trials where upfront zoledronic acid was given to prevent aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss, active cancer recurrence appeared to be reduced. As of 2010 ""The results of clinical studies of adjuvant treatment on early-stage hormone-receptor-positive breast-cancer patients under hormonal treatment – especially with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid – caused excitement because they demonstrated an additive effect on decreasing disease relapses at bone or other sites.

It is available as an inhaler, cream, pills, and nasal spray. The inhaled form is used in the long-term management of asthma. The cream may be used for dermatitis and psoriasis. The pills have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. The nasal spray is used to treat allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps. Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Beclomethasone dipropionate was first patented in 1962 and used medically in 1972. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 268th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Side effects == Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Occasionally, it may cause a cough upon inhalation. Deposition on the tongue and throat may promote oral candidiasis, which appears as a white coating, possibly with irritation. This may usually be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after using the inhaler. Other adverse drug reaction side effects may rarely include: a smell similar to burning plastic, unpleasant taste, hoarseness or nasal congestion, pain or headache, and visual changes. Allergic reactions may occur, but rarely. Nasal corticosteroids may be associated with central serous retinopathy. == Pharmacology == Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression). Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. == Names == Beclometasone dipropionate is the INN modified and beclomethasone dipropionate is the USAN and former BAN. It is a prodrug of the free form, beclometasone (INN). The prodrug beclometasone is marketed in Norway and Russia. Clenil, Qvar, Cortis are brandnames for the inhalers; Beconase, Alanase, Vancenase, Qnasl for the nasal spray or aerosol. == References ==",Andion,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.988221684878226e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00035041390219703317), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025158440694212914)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration. In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of peramivir based on safety data from phase I, phase II, and limited phase III trial data. The emergency use authorization for peramivir expired in June 2010. On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. == History == An intramuscular (IM) peramivir phase II study for seasonal influenza in 2008–2009 found no effect for the primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated influenza infection versus placebo. In October 2009, it was reported that the experimental antiviral drug peramivir had been ""life-saving"" effective in intravenous treating 8 serious cases of swine flu. On October 23, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization for peramivir, allowing the use of the drug in intravenous form for hospitalized patients only in cases where the other available methods of treatment are ineffective or unavailable; for instance, if oseltamivir resistance develops and a person is unable to take zanamivir via the inhaled route. The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program. Biocryst also donated 1200 courses of treatment to the US department of Health and Human Services. The Emergency Use Authorization expired on June 23, 2010. In 2011 a phase III trial found the median durations of influenza symptoms were the same with 1 intravenous injection of peramivir against 5 days of oral oseltamivir for people with seasonal influenza virus infection. In 2012 BioCryst reported that it should halt enrollment on its study for intravenous peramivir in potentially life-threatened people after an interim analysis led trial monitors to conclude that it would be futile to continue and the trial should be terminated. The difference between peramivir and control group (oral oseltamivir) for the primary endpoint, clinical or virologic, was small. In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir. According to a research report published in June 2011, a new variant of swine flu had emerged in Asia with a genetic adaptation (a S247N neuraminidase mutation) giving some resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but no significant reduction in sensitivity to peramivir. But a H274Y virus mutation showed resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, but not to zanamivir, and only in N1 neuraminidases. Ultimately 3.2% (19/599) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected between 2009 and 2012 had highly reduced peramivir inhibition due to the H275Y NA mutation. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intravenous peramivir in December 2013.

It acts as a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonist, sequestering lymphocytes to peripheral lymphoid organs and away from their sites of chronic inflammation. The most common adverse reactions are upper respiratory infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary tract infection, back pain, and hypertension. Ozanimod was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2020, in the European Union in May 2020, and in Australia in July 2020. == Medical uses == In the United States, ozanimod is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease; and with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In the European Union and in Australia, ozanimod is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. == Pharmacology == === Potency and selectivity === The principle of autoimmune therapy based on targeting S1P receptors was established through the clinical work performed during development of fingolimod (trade name Gilenya), a non‐selective S1P modulator. The prospects for ozanimod (Scripps-Receptos compound RPC1063) depended upon demonstration of comparable or better activity and selectivity relative to fingolimod and other comparators. During the discovery phase of its development, ozanimod was shown to be a selective agonist of the S1P1 and S1P5 receptors. Specifically, in a discovery research report, ozanimod's equal potency and improved selectivity for S1P1 and S1P5 receptor family members were determined though a combination of inhibition, binding, and signalling assays for the S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptor types alongside the same tests with fingolimod and other compounds. Potency for ozanimod as an agonist of the S1P1 receptor type was established through observed sub-nanomolar EC50 values in GTPγS binding and cAMP inhibition assays, and for the S1P5 type through an observed nanomolar EC50 value in the GTPγS binding assay. Measured alongside its binding to the S1P2, S1P3, and S1P4 receptor types, these concentration-response results supported a conclusion of an improved selectivity profile, with selectivity of S1P1 over S1P5 receptors at 27‐fold, and selectivity for S1P1 over S1P2, S1P3, and S1P4 receptors greater than 10,000‐fold. Also, these assays allowed comparison of ozanimod potency against and selectivity for S1P1 over other S1 receptors, relative to related S1 active agents siponimod and the phosphorylated (prodrug) forms of fingolimod and mocravimod, where ozanimod was similar to these comparators in S1P1 potency, but had the elevated selectivities stated above (versus fingolimod being potent in stimulating S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5, siponimod potent with a S1P5 form, and mocravimod active in some way against S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5), making its selectivity profile an improvement over all of these. Hence, the study concluded that it had ""established... RPC1063 [as] a potent agonist of the S1P1 receptor with additional agonist activity on the S1P5 receptor"" with S1P1 activity ""similar to other known, less selective S1P receptor agonists"". === Mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics === The agonism of S1P directly causes its internalization and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. The loss of S1P leads to a decrease in the total lymphocyte count in circulation, specifically CD4+ CCR7+ and CD8+ CCR7+ T cells. The most frequent adverse effects is an increase in liver enzymes (>10% ) and high blood pressure (4%) per product labeling.Kaposi sarcoma of the skin and colon was described in a single case s after treatment with ozanimod for 2 months. === Pharmacokinetics === Ozanimod has a high oral bioavailability, a circulating half-life of about 19 hours, and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after about 6 hours. Ozanimod is dehydrogenated by two CYP enzymes into two active metabolites, all with similar pharmacokinetics. The decrease in lymphocyte count lasts for approximately 14 days after treatment discontinuation. Unlike fingolimod, it does not require phosphorylation for activation, nor does it demonstrate cardiac abnormalities. == History == Ozanimod was invented by Hugh Rosen, Edward Roberts, and colleagues at The Scripps Research Institute, and was subsequently out-licensed in the creation of the startup, Receptos Inc. Celgene Corp acquired Receptos along with its intellectual property in 2015. Bristol Myers Squibb acquired Celgene in 2019 (and with it, ozanimod and the rest of its products and pipeline). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ozanimod based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT02294058 and Trial 2/ NCT02047734) of 1767 subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The trials were conducted at 173 centers in the United States, Belarus, Poland, Russia and Ukraine. Subjects received ozanimod or comparator (interferon β1a, a product approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis) for up to one year (in Trial 1) or up to two years (in Trial 2). Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until the trials were completed. The benefit of ozanimod was evaluated based on the percentage of subjects who experienced reduction in disease relapse in comparison to subjects treated with interferon β1a. In May 2021, the FDA approved ozanimod for an additional indication for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. == Clinical trials == === Touchstone === Touchstone is a double-blind, placebo controlled phase II clinical for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. 197 patients, ages 18–75, with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo Score 6–10) were recruited and assigned either placebo, 0.5 mg or 1 mg of oral ozanimod followed by 1 week of dose escalation. The 1 mg dose showed a slight increase in rate of clinical remission of ulcerative colitits and total lymphocyte decrease as compared to the placebo, with the most common adverse effects being headaches and anemia. The authors noted that limitations on this study included a brief duration and small sample size, meaning they could not assess safety nor efficacy. === Radiance === Radiance is a double-blind, placebo controlled phase combined II/III clinical trial for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. For the phase II trial, 258 patients, ages 18–55 with relapsing multiple sclerosis (mean Expanded Disability Status Scale of 2.9) were assigned either placebo, 0.5 mg or 1 mg of oral ozanimod followed by 1 week of dose escalation. Ozanimod significantly reduced MRI lesion activity in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis over a period of 24 weeks. Both doses of ozanimod reached anticipated range of 60-70% decreased lymphocyte count, and were well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with a previous phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The most common adverse effects as compared to the placebo were: nasopharyngitis, headache, and urinary-tract infections, with no serious infectious or cardiac adverse effects. With these results, both doses of ozanimod were taken forward into the 2-year long phase III trial and is completed but unpublished as of November 2016. === Sunbeam === Sunbeam is the second relapsing multiple sclerosis phase III clinical trial to establish the dose with optimum safety-benefit relationship, with an estimated size of 1200 patients. It began in November 2014, and has an estimated completion date of February 2017. == Society and culture == === Commercial === After going public in May 2013, Receptos, Inc. stock surged with the clinical data ozanimod displayed as a S1P immunomodulating drug. In August 2015, Receptos was acquired by Celgene for $7.2 billion through a combination of cash in hand and new debt, leading to a one-day 22% increase in Celgene stock value. Receptos-Celgene patented the synthesis of ozanimod in July 2016. With the expansion of Celgene's inflammation and immunology profile, the company had been expecting to generate $4 to $6 billion in annual sales from ozanimod; however, in a ""surprise development"", the FDA rejected Celgene's initial application for the drug's approval in February 2018. Celgene refiled in March 2019. The new owner of the product, Bristol Myers Squibb, received FDA approval for ozanimod (Zeposia) oral capsules on March 26, 2020, for the following adult indications: relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and clinically isolated syndrome. Ozanimod was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2020, and in Australia in July 2020. == Research == Ozanimod is in development for additional immune-inflammatory indications, including Crohn's disease. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02047734 for ""Efficacy and Safety Study of Ozanimod in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RADIANCE)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02435992 for ""Safety and Efficacy Trial of RPC1063 for Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Ozanimod,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.8132995794294402e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010847456724150106)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([news.bms.com](https://news.bms.com/news/corporate-financial/2020/US-Food-and-Drug-Administration-Approves-Bristol-Myers-Squibbs-ZEPOSIA-ozanimod-a-New-Oral-Treatment-for-Relapsing-Forms-of-Multiple-Sclerosis/default.aspx?utm_source=openai), [news.bms.com](https://news.bms.com/news/details/2021/U.S.-Food-and-Drug-Administration-Approves-Bristol-Myers-Squibbs-Zeposia-ozanimod-an-Oral-Treatment-for-Adults-with-Moderately-to-Severely-Active-Ulcerative-Colitis1/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=492, start_index=9, title='Bristol Myers Squibb - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Bristol Myers Squibb’s ZEPOSIA® (ozanimod), a New Oral Treatment for Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis', type='url_citation', url='https://news.bms.com/news/corporate-financial/2020/US-Food-and-Drug-Administration-Approves-Bristol-Myers-Squibbs-ZEPOSIA-ozanimod-a-New-Oral-Treatment-for-Relapsing-Forms-of-Multiple-Sclerosis/default.aspx?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=492, start_index=9, title='Bristol Myers Squibb - U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Bristol Myers Squibb’s Zeposia® (ozanimod), an Oral Treatment for Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis', type='url_citation', url='https://news.bms.com/news/details/2021/U.S.-Food-and-Drug-Administration-Approves-Bristol-Myers-Squibbs-Zeposia-ozanimod-an-Oral-Treatment-for-Adults-with-Moderately-to-Severely-Active-Ulcerative-Colitis1/?utm_source=openai')])"
3643,"('Buformin (hydrochloride)', 'Buformin', 'Buformine', 'Butylbiguanide', 'Butyldiguanide')",Medical,"Buformin (1-butylbiguanide) is an oral antidiabetic drug of the biguanide class, chemically related to metformin and phenformin. Buformin was marketed by German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal as Silubin. == Chemistry and animal toxicology == Buformin hydrochloride is a fine, white to slightly yellow, crystalline, odorless powder, with a weakly acidic bitter taste. Its melting point is 174 to 177 °C, it is a strong base, and is freely soluble in water, methanol and ethanol, but insoluble in chloroform and ether. Toxicity: guinea pig LD50 subcutaneous 18 mg/kg; mouse LD50 intraperitoneal 140 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg oral. The log octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) is -1.20E+00; its water solubility is 7.46E+05 mg/L at 25 °C. Vapor pressure is 1.64E-04 mm Hg at 25 °C (EST); Henry's law constant is 8.14E-16 atm-m3/mole at 25 °C (EST). Its Atmospheric -OH rate constant is 1.60E-10 cm3/molecule-sec at 25 °C. == Mechanism of action == Buformin delays absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into cells, and inhibits synthesis of glucose by the liver. Buformin and the other biguanides are not hypoglycemic, but rather antihyperglycemic agents. They do not produce hypoglycemia; instead, they reduce basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics. Biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. == Pharmacokinetics == After oral administration of 50 mg of buformin to volunteers, almost 90% of the applied quantity was recovered in the urine; the rate constant of elimination was found to be 0.38 per hr. Buformin is a strong base (pKa = 11.3) and not absorbed in the stomach. After intravenous injection of about 1 mg/kg buformin-14-C, the initial serum concentration is 0.2-0.4 μg/mL. Serum level and urinary elimination rate are linearly correlated. In man, after oral administration of 50 mg 14-C-buformin, the maximum serum concentration was 0.26-0.41 μg/mL. The buformin was eliminated with an average half-life of 2 h. About 84% of the dose administered was found excreted unchanged in the urine. Buformin is not metabolized in humans. The bioavailability of oral buformin and other biguanides is 40%-60%. Binding to plasma proteins is absent or very low. == Dosage == The daily dose of buformin is 150–300 mg by mouth. Buformin has also been available in a sustained release preparation, Silubin Retard, which is still sold in Romania. == Side effects and contraindications == The side effects encountered are anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, metallic taste, and weight loss. Its use is contraindicated in diabetic coma, ketoacidosis, severe infection, trauma, other conditions where buformin is unlikely to control the hyperglycemia, renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, recent myocardial infarct, dehydration, alcoholism, and conditions likely to predispose to lactic acidosis. == Toxicity == Buformin was withdrawn from the market in many countries due to an elevated risk of causing lactic acidosis (although not the US, where it was never sold). Buformin is still available and prescribed in Romania (timed release Silubin Retard is sold by Zentiva), Hungary, Taiwan and Japan (sold by Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd as ""DIBETOS"" tablets, each containing 50 mg buformin hydrochloride). The lactic acidosis occurred only in patients with a buformin plasma level of greater than 0.60 μg/mL and was rare in patients with normal renal function. In one report, the toxic oral dose was 329 ± 30 mg/day in 24 patients who developed lactic acidosis on buformin. Another group of 24 patients on 258 ± 25 mg/day did not develop lactic acidosis on buformin. == Anticancer properties == Buformin, along with phenformin and metformin, inhibits the growth and development of cancer. The anticancer property of these drugs is due to their ability to disrupt the Warburg effect and revert the cytosolic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells to normal oxidation of pyruvate by the mitochondria. Metformin reduces liver glucose production in diabetics and disrupts the Warburg effect in cancer by AMPK activation and inhibition of the mTor pathway. Buformin decreased cancer incidence, multiplicity, and burden in chemically induced rat mammary cancer, whereas metformin and phenformin had no statistically significant effect on the carcinogenic process relative to the control group. Buformin also exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in endometrial cancer cells, lung cancer cells and cervical cancer cells. == Antiviral properties == Biguanides were first noted to be active against influenza in the 1940s. Further studies confirmed their antiviral activity in vitro. Buformin, especially, was potently antiviral against vaccinia and influenza. Buformin is a metabolic antiviral that inhibits the mTOR pathway used by influenza and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. == History == Buformin was synthesized as an oral antidiabetic in 1957. == Synthesis == Buformin is obtained by reaction of butylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine. == References ==",Buformin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.629103492945433e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008715921081602573)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04830,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/buformin,https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/medicine-and-healthcare/pharmaceutical-medicine/buformin/ ', [])"

3646,"('Urea', 'Carbamide', 'Carbonyldiamide', 'Isourea', 'Ureophil')","Endogenous, Medical","Urea, also called carbamide (because it is a diamide of carbonic acid), is an organic compound with chemical formula CO(NH2)2. This amide has two amino groups (–NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (–C(=O)–). It is thus the simplest amide of carbamic acid. Urea serves an important role in the cellular metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the urine of mammals. Urea is Neo-Latin, from French urée, from Ancient Greek οὖρον (oûron) 'urine', itself from Proto-Indo-European *h₂worsom. It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic (LD50 is 15 g/kg for rats). Dissolved in water, it is neither acidic nor alkaline. The body uses it in many processes, most notably nitrogen excretion. The liver forms it by combining two ammonia molecules (NH3) with a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule in the urea cycle. Urea is widely used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen (N) and is an important raw material for the chemical industry. In 1828, Friedrich Wöhler discovered that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials, which was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry. This showed for the first time that a substance previously known only as a byproduct of life could be synthesized in the laboratory without biological starting materials, thereby contradicting the widely held doctrine of vitalism, which stated that only living organisms could produce the chemicals of life. == Properties == === Molecular and crystal structure === The structure of the molecule of urea is O=C(−NH2)2. The urea molecule is planar when in a solid crystal because of sp2 hybridization of the N orbitals. It is non-planar with C2 symmetry when in the gas phase or in aqueous solution, with C–N–H and H–N–H bond angles that are intermediate between the trigonal planar angle of 120° and the tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. In solid urea, the oxygen center is engaged in two N–H–O hydrogen bonds. The resulting hydrogen-bond network is probably established at the cost of efficient molecular packing: The structure is quite open, the ribbons forming tunnels with square cross-section. The carbon in urea is described as sp2 hybridized, the C-N bonds have significant double bond character, and the carbonyl oxygen is relatively basic. Urea's high aqueous solubility reflects its ability to engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with water. By virtue of its tendency to form porous frameworks, urea has the ability to trap many organic compounds. In these so-called clathrates, the organic ""guest"" molecules are held in channels formed by interpenetrating helices composed of hydrogen-bonded urea molecules. In this way, urea-clathrates have been well investigated for separations. === Reactions === Urea is a weak base, with a pKb of 13.9. When combined with strong acids, it undergoes protonation at oxygen to form uronium salts. It is also a Lewis base, forming metal complexes of the type [M(urea)6]n+. Urea reacts with malonic esters to make barbituric acids. ==== Thermolysis ==== Molten urea decomposes into ammonium cyanate at about 152 °C, and into ammonia and isocyanic acid above 160 °C: Heating above 160 °C yields biuret NH2CONHCONH2 and triuret NH2CONHCONHCONH2 via reaction with isocyanic acid: At higher temperatures it converts to a range of condensation products, including cyanuric acid (CNOH)3, guanidine HNC(NH2)2, and melamine. ==== Aqueous stability ==== In aqueous solution, urea slowly equilibrates with ammonium cyanate. This elimination reaction cogenerates isocyanic acid, which can carbamylate proteins, in particular the N-terminal amino group, the side chain amino of lysine, and to a lesser extent the side chains of arginine and cysteine. Each carbamylation event adds 43 daltons to the mass of the protein, which can be observed in protein mass spectrometry. For this reason, pure urea solutions should be freshly prepared and used, as aged solutions may develop a significant concentration of cyanate (20 mM in 8 M urea). Dissolving urea in ultrapure water followed by removing ions (i.e. cyanate) with a mixed-bed ion-exchange resin and storing that solution at 4 °C is a recommended preparation procedure. However, cyanate will build back up to significant levels within a few days. Alternatively, adding 25–50 mM ammonium chloride to a concentrated urea solution decreases formation of cyanate because of the common ion effect. === Analysis === Urea is readily quantified by a number of different methods, such as the diacetyl monoxime colorimetric method, and the Berthelot reaction (after initial conversion of urea to ammonia via urease). These methods are amenable to high throughput instrumentation, such as automated flow injection analyzers and 96-well micro-plate spectrophotometers. == Related compounds == Ureas describes a class of chemical compounds that share the same functional group, a carbonyl group attached to two organic amine residues: R1R2N−C(=O)−NR3R4, where R1, R2, R3 and R4 groups are hydrogen (–H), organyl or other groups. Examples include carbamide peroxide, allantoin, and hydantoin. Ureas are closely related to biurets and related in structure to amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and thiocarbamides. == Uses == === Agriculture === More than 90% of world industrial production of urea is destined for use as a nitrogen-release fertilizer. Urea has the highest nitrogen content of all solid nitrogenous fertilizers in common use. Therefore, it has a low transportation cost per unit of nitrogen nutrient. The most common impurity of synthetic urea is biuret, which impairs plant growth. Urea breaks down in the soil to give ammonium ions (NH+4). The ammonium is taken up by the plant through its roots. In some soils, the ammonium is oxidized by bacteria to give nitrate (NO−3), which is also a nitrogen-rich plant nutrient. The loss of nitrogenous compounds to the atmosphere and runoff is wasteful and environmentally damaging so urea is sometimes modified to enhance the efficiency of its agricultural use. Techniques to make controlled-release fertilizers that slow the release of nitrogen include the encapsulation of urea in an inert sealant, and conversion of urea into derivatives such as urea-formaldehyde compounds, which degrade into ammonia at a pace matching plants' nutritional requirements. === Resins === Urea is a raw material for the manufacture of formaldehyde based resins, such as UF, MUF, and MUPF, used mainly in wood-based panels, for instance, particleboard, fiberboard, OSB, and plywood. === Explosives === Urea can be used in a reaction with nitric acid to make urea nitrate, a high explosive that is used industrially and as part of some improvised explosive devices. === Automobile systems === Urea is used in Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) reactions to reduce the NOx pollutants in exhaust gases from combustion from diesel, dual fuel, and lean-burn natural gas engines. The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. Ammonia (NH3) produced by the hydrolysis of urea reacts with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and is converted into nitrogen gas (N2) and water within the catalytic converter. The conversion of noxious NOx to innocuous N2 is described by the following simplified global equation: When urea is used, a pre-reaction (hydrolysis) occurs to first convert it to ammonia: Being a solid highly soluble in water (545 g/L at 25 °C), urea is much easier and safer to handle and store than the more irritant, caustic and hazardous ammonia (NH3), so it is the reactant of choice. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of diesel exhaust fluid, also sold as AdBlue, a solution of urea in water. === Laboratory uses === Urea in concentrations up to 10 M is a powerful protein denaturant as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins. A mixture of urea and choline chloride is used as a deep eutectic solvent (DES), a substance similar to ionic liquid. When used in a deep eutectic solvent, urea gradually denatures the proteins that are solubilized. Urea in concentrations up to 8 M can be used to make fixed brain tissue transparent to visible light while still preserving fluorescent signals from labeled cells. This allows for much deeper imaging of neuronal processes than previously obtainable using conventional one photon or two photon confocal microscopes. === Medical use === Urea-containing creams are used as topical dermatological products to promote rehydration of the skin. Urea 40% is indicated for psoriasis, xerosis, onychomycosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns, and calluses. If covered by an occlusive dressing, 40% urea preparations may also be used for nonsurgical debridement of nails. Urea 40% ""dissolves the intercellular matrix"" of the nail plate. Only diseased or dystrophic nails are removed, as there is no effect on healthy portions of the nail. This drug (as carbamide peroxide) is also used as an earwax removal aid. Urea has also been studied as a diuretic. It was first used by Dr. W. Friedrich in 1892. In a 2010 study of ICU patients, urea was used to treat euvolemic hyponatremia and was found safe, inexpensive, and simple. Like saline, urea has been injected into the uterus to induce abortion, although this method is no longer in widespread use. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test is a measure of the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea. It is used as a marker of renal function, though it is inferior to other markers such as creatinine because blood urea levels are influenced by other factors such as diet, dehydration, and liver function. Urea has also been studied as an excipient in Drug-coated Balloon (DCB) coating formulation to enhance local drug delivery to stenotic blood vessels. Urea, when used as an excipient in small doses (~3 μg/mm2) to coat DCB surface was found to form crystals that increase drug transfer without adverse toxic effects on vascular endothelial cells. Urea labeled with carbon-14 or carbon-13 is used in the urea breath test, which is used to detect the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the stomach and duodenum of humans, associated with peptic ulcers. The test detects the characteristic enzyme urease, produced by H. pylori, by a reaction that produces ammonia from urea. This increases the pH (reduces the acidity) of the stomach environment around the bacteria. Similar bacteria species to H. pylori can be identified by the same test in animals such as apes, dogs, and cats (including big cats). === Miscellaneous uses === An ingredient in diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), which is 32.5% urea and 67.5% de-ionized water. DEF is sprayed into the exhaust stream of diesel vehicles to break down dangerous NOx emissions into harmless nitrogen and water. A component of animal feed, providing a relatively cheap source of nitrogen to promote growth A non-corroding alternative to rock salt for road de-icing. It is often the main ingredient of pet friendly salt substitutes although it is less effective than traditional rock salt or calcium chloride. A main ingredient in hair removers such as Nair and Veet A browning agent in factory-produced pretzels An ingredient in some skin cream, moisturizers, hair conditioners, and shampoos A cloud seeding agent, along with other salts A flame-proofing agent, commonly used in dry chemical fire extinguisher charges such as the urea-potassium bicarbonate mixture An ingredient in many tooth whitening products An ingredient in dish soap Along with diammonium phosphate, as a yeast nutrient, for fermentation of sugars into ethanol A nutrient used by plankton in ocean nourishment experiments for geoengineering purposes As an additive to extend the working temperature and open time of hide glue As a solubility-enhancing and moisture-retaining additive to dye baths for textile dyeing or printing As an optical parametric oscillator in nonlinear optics To help prepare a alpine skiing course by hardening the snow into a icier surface to maintain the integrity of the course. == Physiology == Amino acids from ingested food (or produced from catabolism of muscle protein) that are used for the synthesis of proteins and other biological substances can be oxidized by the body as an alternative source of energy, yielding urea and carbon dioxide. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The first step in the conversion of amino acids into metabolic waste in the liver is removal of the alpha-amino nitrogen, which produces ammonia. Because ammonia is toxic, it is excreted immediately by fish, converted into uric acid by birds, and converted into urea by mammals. Ammonia (NH3) is a common byproduct of the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds. Ammonia is smaller, more volatile, and more mobile than urea. If allowed to accumulate, ammonia would raise the pH in cells to toxic levels. Therefore, many organisms convert ammonia to urea, even though this synthesis has a net energy cost. Being practically neutral and highly soluble in water, urea is a safe vehicle for the body to transport and excrete excess nitrogen. Urea is synthesized in the body of many organisms as part of the urea cycle, either from the oxidation of amino acids or from ammonia. In this cycle, amino groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea, while L-ornithine, citrulline, L-argininosuccinate, and L-arginine act as intermediates. Urea production occurs in the liver and is regulated by N-acetylglutamate. Urea is then dissolved into the blood (in the reference range of 2.5 to 6.7 mmol/L) and further transported and excreted by the kidney as a component of urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with sodium chloride and water) in sweat. In water, the amine groups undergo slow displacement by water molecules, producing ammonia, ammonium ions, and bicarbonate ions. For this reason, old, stale urine has a stronger odor than fresh urine. === Humans === The cycling of and excretion of urea by the kidneys is a vital part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the countercurrent exchange system of the nephrons, that allows for reabsorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is reabsorbed in the inner medullary collecting ducts of the nephrons, thus raising the osmolarity in the medullary interstitium surrounding the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, which makes the water reabsorb. By action of the urea transporter 2, some of this reabsorbed urea eventually flows back into the thin descending limb of the tubule, through the collecting ducts, and into the excreted urine. The body uses this mechanism, which is controlled by the antidiuretic hormone, to create hyperosmotic urine — i.e., urine with a higher concentration of dissolved substances than the blood plasma. This mechanism is important to prevent the loss of water, maintain blood pressure, and maintain a suitable concentration of sodium ions in the blood plasma. The equivalent nitrogen content (in grams) of urea (in mmol) can be estimated by the conversion factor 0.028 g/mmol. Furthermore, 1 gram of nitrogen is roughly equivalent to 6.25 grams of protein, and 1 gram of protein is roughly equivalent to 5 grams of muscle tissue. In situations such as muscle wasting, 1 mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume in litres multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/L) roughly corresponds to a muscle loss of 0.67 gram. === Other species === In aquatic organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia, whereas land-dwelling organisms convert the toxic ammonia to either urea or uric acid. Urea is found in the urine of mammals and amphibians, as well as some fish. Birds and saurian reptiles have a different form of nitrogen metabolism that requires less water, and leads to nitrogen excretion in the form of uric acid. Tadpoles excrete ammonia, but shift to urea production during metamorphosis. Despite the generalization above, the urea pathway has been documented not only in mammals and amphibians, but in many other organisms as well, including birds, invertebrates, insects, plants, yeast, fungi, and even microorganisms. == Adverse effects == Urea can be irritating to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Repeated or prolonged contact with urea in fertilizer form on the skin may cause dermatitis. High concentrations in the blood can be damaging. Ingestion of low concentrations of urea, such as are found in typical human urine, are not dangerous with additional water ingestion within a reasonable time-frame. Many animals (e.g. camels, rodents or dogs) have a much more concentrated urine which may contain a higher urea amount than normal human urine. Urea can cause algal blooms to produce toxins, and its presence in the runoff from fertilized land may play a role in the increase of toxic blooms. The substance decomposes on heating above melting point, producing toxic gases, and reacts violently with strong oxidants, nitrites, inorganic chlorides, chlorites and perchlorates, causing fire and explosion. == History == Urea was first discovered in urine in 1727 by the Dutch scientist Herman Boerhaave, although this discovery is often attributed to the French chemist Hilaire Rouelle as well as William Cruickshank. Boerhaave used the following steps to isolate urea: Boiled off water, resulting in a substance similar to fresh cream Used filter paper to squeeze out remaining liquid Waited a year for solid to form under an oily liquid Removed the oily liquid Dissolved the solid in water Used recrystallization to tease out the urea In 1828, the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler obtained urea artificially by treating silver cyanate with ammonium chloride. This was the first time an organic compound was artificially synthesized from inorganic starting materials, without the involvement of living organisms. The results of this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism, the theory that the chemicals of living organisms are fundamentally different from those of inanimate matter. This insight was important for the development of organic chemistry. His discovery prompted Wöhler to write triumphantly to Jöns Jakob Berzelius: I must tell you that I can make urea without the use of kidneys, either man or dog. Ammonium cyanate is urea. In fact, his second sentence was incorrect. Ammonium cyanate [NH4]+[OCN]− and urea CO(NH2)2 are two different chemicals with the same empirical formula CON2H4, which are in chemical equilibrium heavily favoring urea under standard conditions. Regardless, with his discovery, Wöhler secured a place among the pioneers of organic chemistry. Uremic frost was first described in 1865 by Harald Hirschsprung, the first Danish pediatrician in 1870 who also described the disease that carries his name in 1886. Uremic frost has become rare since the advent of dialysis. It is the classical pre-dialysis era description of crystallized urea deposits over the skin of patients with prolonged kidney failure and severe uremia. === Historical preparation === Urea was first noticed by Herman Boerhaave in the early 18th century from evaporates of urine. In 1773, Hilaire Rouelle obtained crystals containing urea from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive filtrations. This method was aided by Carl Wilhelm Scheele's discovery that urine treated by concentrated nitric acid precipitated crystals. Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin discovered in 1799 that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented the term ""urea."" Berzelius made further improvements to its purification and finally William Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and determining the chemical composition of the pure substance. In the evolved procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved in warm water, and barium carbonate added. The water is then evaporated and anhydrous alcohol added to extract the urea. This solution is drained off and evaporated, leaving pure urea. == Laboratory preparation == Ureas in the more general sense can be accessed in the laboratory by reaction of phosgene with primary or secondary amines: These reactions proceed through an isocyanate intermediate. Non-symmetric ureas can be accessed by the reaction of primary or secondary amines with an isocyanate. Urea can also be produced by heating ammonium cyanate to 60 °C. == Industrial production == In 2020, worldwide production capacity was approximately 180 million tonnes. For use in industry, urea is produced from synthetic ammonia and carbon dioxide. As large quantities of carbon dioxide are produced during the ammonia manufacturing process as a byproduct of burning hydrocarbons to generate heat (predominantly natural gas, and less often petroleum derivatives or coal), urea production plants are almost always located adjacent to the site where the ammonia is manufactured. === Synthesis === The basic process, patented in 1922, is called the Bosch–Meiser urea process after its discoverers Carl Bosch and Wilhelm Meiser. The process consists of two main equilibrium reactions, with incomplete conversion of the reactants. The first is carbamate formation: the fast exothermic reaction of liquid ammonia with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) at high temperature and pressure to form ammonium carbamate ([NH4]+[NH2COO]−): The second is urea conversion: the slower endothermic decomposition of ammonium carbamate into urea and water: The overall conversion of NH3 and CO2 to urea is exothermic, with the reaction heat from the first reaction driving the second. The conditions that favor urea formation (high temperature) have an unfavorable effect on the carbamate formation equilibrium. The process conditions are a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190 °C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140–175 bar), which favors the first reaction. Although it is necessary to compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia production plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium, a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel. === Reactant recycling === Because the urea conversion is incomplete, the urea must be separated from the unconverted reactants, including the ammonium carbamate. Various commercial urea processes are characterized by the conditions under which urea forms and the way that unconverted reactants are further processed. ==== Conventional recycle processes ==== In early ""straight-through"" urea plants, reactant recovery (the first step in ""recycling"") was done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, because it was not economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products such as ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfate, and the carbon dioxide was usually wasted. Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by the ""total recycle process"", developed in the 1940s to 1960s and now called the ""conventional recycle process"". It proceeds by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first to 18–25 bar and then to 2–5 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated carbamate decomposer, then recombining the resulting carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film carbamate condenser and pumping the carbamate solution back into the urea reaction vessel. ==== Stripping recycle process ==== The ""conventional recycle process"" for recovering and reusing the reactants has largely been supplanted by a stripping process, developed in the early 1960s by Stamicarbon in The Netherlands, that operates at or near the full pressure of the reaction vessel. It reduces the complexity of the multi-stage recycle scheme, and it reduces the amount of water recycled in the carbamate solution, which has an adverse effect on the equilibrium in the urea conversion reaction and thus on overall plant efficiency. Effectively all new urea plants use the stripper, and many total recycle urea plants have converted to a stripping process. In the conventional recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide, allowing these gasses to be separated from the urea product solution. The stripping process achieves a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure, by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants in order to promote carbamate decomposition. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the urea synthesis reactor with the ammonia, as in the conventional process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through the stripper. The stripper is a carbamate decomposer that provides a large amount of gas-liquid contact. This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor is passed to the urea production reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the conventional recycle process. === Side reactions === The three main side reactions that produce impurities have in common that they decompose urea. Urea hydrolyzes back to ammonium carbamate in the hottest stages of the synthesis plant, especially in the stripper, so residence times in these stages are designed to be short. Biuret is formed when two molecules of urea combine with the loss of a molecule of ammonia. Normally this reaction is suppressed in the synthesis reactor by maintaining an excess of ammonia, but after the stripper, it occurs until the temperature is reduced. Biuret is undesirable in urea fertilizer because it is toxic to crop plants to varying degrees, but it is sometimes desirable as a nitrogen source when used in animal feed. Isocyanic acid HNCO and ammonia NH3 results from the thermal decomposition of ammonium cyanate [NH4]+[OCN]−, which is in chemical equilibrium with urea: This decomposition is at its worst when the urea solution is heated at low pressure, which happens when the solution is concentrated for prilling or granulation (see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours, and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the process condensate. === Corrosion === Ammonium carbamate solutions are highly corrosive to metallic construction materials – even to resistant forms of stainless steel – especially in the hottest parts of the synthesis plant such as the stripper. Historically corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuous injection of a small amount of oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Highly corrosion resistant materials have been introduced to reduce the need for passivation oxygen, such as specialized duplex stainless steels in the 1990s, and zirconium or zirconium-clad titanium tubing in the 2000s. === Finishing === Urea can be produced in solid forms (prills, granules, pellets or crystals) or as solutions. ==== Solid forms ==== For its main use as a fertilizer urea is mostly marketed in solid form, either as prills or granules. Prills are solidified droplets, whose production predates satisfactory urea granulation processes. Prills can be produced more cheaply than granules, but the limited size of prills (up to about 2.1 mm in diameter), their low crushing strength, and the caking or crushing of prills during bulk storage and handling make them inferior to granules. Granules are produced by acretion onto urea seed particles by spraying liquid urea in a succession of layers. Formaldehyde is added during the production of both prills and granules in order to increase crushing strength and suppress caking. Other shaping techniques such as pastillization (depositing uniform-sized liquid droplets onto a cooling conveyor belt) are also used. ==== Liquid forms ==== Solutions of urea and ammonium nitrate in water (UAN) are commonly used as a liquid fertilizer. In admixture, the combined solubility of ammonium nitrate and urea is so much higher than that of either component alone that it gives a stable solution with a total nitrogen content (32%) approaching that of solid ammonium nitrate (33.5%), though not, of course, that of urea itself (46%). UAN allows use of ammonium nitrate without the explosion hazard.

3647,"('Rivastigmine', 'S-rivastigmine', 'Exelon', 'Rivastigmine teva', '(s)-3-(1-(dimethylamino)ethyl)phenyl ethyl(methyl)carbamate')",Medical,"Exelon Corporation is an American public utility headquartered in Chicago, and incorporated in Pennsylvania. Exelon is the largest electric parent company in the United States by revenue and is the largest regulated electric utility in the United States with approximately 10 million customers. The company is ranked 99th on the Fortune 500. Exelon owns six regulated utilities: Atlantic City Electric (New Jersey), Commonwealth Edison (Illinois), PECO Energy Company (Pennsylvania), Baltimore Gas and Electric (Maryland), Delmarva Power and Light (Delaware and Maryland), and Pepco (Washington, DC and Maryland). == Operating subsidiaries == Atlantic City Electric is a regulated utility in New Jersey with 545,000 electric customers. Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) is a regulated utility in Maryland with 1.25 million+ electric customers and 650,000+ natural gas customers. Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) is a regulated utility in Illinois with 4 million electric customers. Delmarva Power is a regulated utility in Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland with 515,000 electric customers over 5,000 square miles of service territory. They provide natural gas to 130,000 customers in northern Delaware. PECO Energy Company (PECO) is regulated utility in eastern Pennsylvania with 1.6 million electric customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers. Pepco (Potomac Electric Power Company) is a regulated utility in Washington, D.C. that serves 842,000 electric customers in the district and parts of Maryland. == History == Exelon Corporation was created in October 2000 by the merger between PECO Energy Company, formed in 1902, and Unicom Corporation, the parent of Commonwealth Edison, formed in 1907. Unicom was based in Chicago and the city became the headquarters of the new entity. The merger was overseen by the CEO of Unicom, John Rowe, who joined the corporation in 1998 and led the newly formed Exelon until 2012, becoming the nation's longest-serving utility executive. On July 31, 2005, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the merger of Exelon and Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey utility; however, after 18 months, the two companies terminated the agreement due to pressure put on the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities by public interest groups, including New Jersey Citizen Action. On March 12, 2012, Exelon acquired Constellation Energy, with the combined company owning more than 34 gigawatts of power generation (55% nuclear, 24% natural gas, 8% renewable including hydro, 7% oil and 6% coal). Exelon announced the proposed purchase of Pepco Holdings on April 30, 2014, for $6.8 billion in an all-cash transaction. The merger faced stiff opposition from community groups and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. The merger was originally rejected by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators. The companies appealed the decision. On March 23, 2016, the merger was finally approved by the District of Columbia Public Service Commission after the company made concessions and the merger was completed, making Exelon the largest regulated utility in the United States by customer count and total revenue. On February 2, 2022, Exelon completed the corporate spin-off of Constellation Energy, its energy generation business. Constellation was the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the United States and the largest non-governmental operator of nuclear power plants in the world. It is also the largest competitive U.S. power generator with approximately 35,500 megawatts of owned capacity. It had full or majority ownership of 23 nuclear reactors in 14 nuclear power plants. == Controversies and legal issues == === PECO Energy: Nuclear power protests and solar energy expansion === In the 1970s, activists delayed the opening of nuclear power plants by PECO Energy. In 2015, Earth Quaker Action Team began a campaign to pressure PECO to expand the solar power it purchases, and to purchase it locally to create jobs. === Pollution, security incidents === In 2005, Exelon was required to pay a $602,000 fine for exceeding the permitted sulfur dioxide emission limit from April to October 2004 at its Cromby Generating Station in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Exelon and Illinois state officials waited for four years until 2006 before disclosing that Exelon's Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station, a nuclear plant 60 miles southwest of Chicago, had spilled millions of gallons of water containing tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, multiple times over a decade. Exelon officials eventually apologized and said the risks from the leak were ""minimal"", with tritium levels in surrounding wells all found to be below regulatory limits. In 2009, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced its plan for a $65,000 fine against Exelon for permitting its contracted security guards that were guarding its Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station, a two-reactor nuclear plant located in Delta, Pennsylvania, to sleep on the job. The incidents did not come to light until a videotape of the security guards was leaked to news media. As a result, Exelon terminated the security contract of the Wackenhut security firm that had been involved and now operates its own in-house nuclear security force. === Political activity === Exelon makes political contributions via its political action committee (PAC), EXELONPAC. In 2021 and 2022, it contributed $323,500 to federal candidates, including $202,500 to Democrats and $121,000 to Republicans. In 2022, it spent $2,878,000 on lobbying. == Finances == == References == == External links == Official website BGE website ComEd website PECO website Business data for Exelon Corporation:",Exelon,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20143048465251923), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007447806419804692)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/exelon.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=75, start_index=9, title='Exelon: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/exelon.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is named for British chemist Henry Edward Armstrong. == Production and use == It is prepared by disulfonation of naphthalene with oleum: C10H8 + 2 SO3 → C10H6(SO3H)2 Further sulfonation gives The 1,3,5-trisulfonic acid derivative. == Reactions and uses == Fusion of Armstrong's acid in NaOH gives the disodium salt of 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene, which can be acidified to give the diol. The intermediate in this hydrolysis, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-5-sulfonic acid, is also useful. Nitration gives nitrodisulfonic acids, which are precursors to amino derivatives. The disodium salt is sometimes used as a divalent counterion for forming salts of basic drug compounds, as an alternative to the related mesylate or tosylate salts. When used in this way such a salt is called a naphthalenedisulfonate salt, as seen with the most common salt form of the stimulant drug CFT.

3649,"('Famotidine', 'Famotidinum', 'Famotidina', 'Brolin', 'Gastro')",Medical,"Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and intestine. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Fever, lack of energy, and dehydration may also occur. This typically lasts less than two weeks. Although it is not related to influenza, in the U.S it is sometimes called the ""stomach flu"". Gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses; however, gut bacteria, parasites, and fungi can also cause gastroenteritis. In children, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common causes. Eating improperly prepared food, drinking contaminated water or close contact with a person who is infected can spread the disease. Treatment is generally the same with or without a definitive diagnosis, so testing to confirm is usually not needed. For young children in impoverished countries, prevention includes hand washing with soap, drinking clean water, breastfeeding babies instead of using formula, and proper disposal of human waste. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended as a prevention for children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts and sugar). In those who are breastfed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed. However, antibiotics are recommended for young children with a fever and bloody diarrhea. In 2015, there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis, resulting in 1.3 million deaths globally. Children and those in the developing world are affected the most. In 2011, there were about 1.7 billion cases, resulting in about 700,000 deaths of children under the age of five. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity. == Signs and symptoms == Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting. Sometimes, only one or the other is present. This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks. Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days. However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common. Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea. Severe dehydration in children may be recognized if the skin color and position returns slowly when pressed. This is called ""prolonged capillary refill"" and ""poor skin turgor"". Abnormal breathing is another sign of severe dehydration. Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition. Stunted growth and long-term cognitive delays can result. Reactive arthritis occurs in 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species. Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species. HUS causes low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low red blood cell count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures. == Cause == Viruses (particularly rotavirus (in children) and norovirus (in adults)) and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species are the primary causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome including parasites and fungi. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity. Children are also at higher risk because they are less likely to practice good hygiene habits. Children living in areas without easy access to water and soap are especially vulnerable. === Viral === Rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses are known to cause viral gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children, and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases. Generally speaking, viral gastroenteritis accounts for 21–40% of the cases of infectious diarrhea in developed countries. Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America accounting for about 90% of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time proximate to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children. === Bacterial === In some countries, Campylobacter jejuni is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food. Toxigenic Clostridioides difficile is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly. Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms. It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use. Staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics. Acute ""traveler's diarrhea"" is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis, while the persistent form is usually parasitic. Acid-suppressing medication appears to increase the risk of significant infection after exposure to several organisms, including Clostridioides difficile, Salmonella, and Campylobacter species. The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H2 antagonists. === Parasitic === A number of parasites can cause gastroenteritis. Giardia lamblia is most common, but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and other species have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this type of illness can occur nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who have sex with men, and following disasters. === Transmission === Transmission may occur from drinking contaminated water or when people share personal objects. Water quality typically worsens during the rainy season and outbreaks are more common at this time. In areas with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Worldwide, bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, (especially among children), in crowded households, and in those with poor nutritional status. Adults who have developed immunities might still carry certain organisms without exhibiting symptoms. Thus, adults can become natural reservoirs of certain diseases. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others (such as Giardia) may occur in a wide variety of animals. === Non-infectious === There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious cause of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food. In the United States, rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department, rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period. == Pathophysiology == Gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to inflammation of the small or large bowel, often due to infection. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae). == Diagnosis == Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms. Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition. However, stool cultures should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world. It may also be appropriate in children younger than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function. Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance. As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended. Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration. === Dehydration === A determination of whether or not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed. === Differential diagnosis === Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both). Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis. == Prevention == === Water, sanitation, hygiene === A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis. Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. === Vaccination === Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease. This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over two years. There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development. For example, vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which are two of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide. == Management == Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain. === Rehydration === The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under five years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient. === Dietary === It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion, and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT. Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary. Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided. The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding. A Cochrane Review from 2020 concludes that probiotics make little or no difference to people who have diarrhea lasting 2 days or longer and that there is no proof that they reduce its duration. They may be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world. === Antiemetics === Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit. === Antibiotics === Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis, although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever. === Antimotility agents === Antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, can be used in mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible. == Epidemiology == It is estimated that there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3 million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those younger than five, there were about 1.7 billion cases resulting in 0.7 million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under five years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity. In 1980, gastroenteritis from all causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, with the majority occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by 2000, largely due to the introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375 million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age. == Society and culture == Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names, including ""Montezuma's revenge"", ""Delhi belly"", ""la turista"", and ""back door sprint"", among others. It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term ""no guts no glory"". Gastroenteritis is the main reason for 3.7 million visits to physicians a year in the United States and 3 million visits in France. In the United States gastroenteritis as a whole is believed to result in costs of US$23 billion per year, with rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of US$1 billion a year. == Terminology == The first usage of ""gastroenteritis"" was in 1825. Before this time it was commonly known as typhoid fever or ""cholera morbus"", among others, or less specifically as ""griping of the guts"", ""surfeit"", ""flux"", ""colic"", ""bowel complaint"", or any one of several other archaic names for acute diarrhea. Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera. == Animals == Many of the same agents cause gastroenteritis in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms. Some agents are more specific to a certain species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. It is believed to be introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available. It is not transmissible to humans. == See also == Enterocolitis == References == === Notes === Dolin R, Mandell GL, Bennett JE, eds. (2010).

3650,"('Acarbose', 'Glucobay', 'Precose', 'Acarbosum', 'Prandase')",Medical,"Acarbose (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and, in some countries, prediabetes. It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG). Acarbose is a starch blocker. It works by inhibiting alpha glucosidase, an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates such as starch and sucrose. It is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus. It can be degraded by a number of gut bacteria. Acarbose is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains that use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a large study concluded in 2013 that ""acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes."" A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high-starch Eastern diet. == Medical uses == === Efficacy === In type II diabetic patients, acarbose averages an absolute decrease of 0.8 percentage points in HbA1c, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies. Individuals with higher baseline levels show higher reductions, about an 0.12% additional decrease for each point of baseline HbA1c. Its effect on postprandial glucose, but not on HbA1c, scales with dose. Among diabetic patients, acarbose may help reduce the damage done to blood vessels and kidneys by reducing glucose levels. A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with prediabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). It was found that acarbose reduced the incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose, when compared to diet and exercise, metformin, placebo, or no intervention, improved all-cause mortality, reduced or increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, serious or non-serious adverse events, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Several studies showed that glucosidase inhibitors and alpha-amylase inhibitors promote loss of visceral fat and waist by acting as calorie restriction mimetics (linked to its acarbose-like action). === Combination therapy === The combination of acarbose with metformin results in greater reductions of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and post-prandial glucose than either agent alone. == Adverse effects == Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest (ferment) the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing. Sucrose is more likely to trigger GI side effects compared to starch. Acarbose is associated with very rare elevated transaminases (19 out of 500,000). Even rarer cases of hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine as a precaution. A 2016 meta-analysis confirms that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, including acarbose, have a statistically significant link to elevated transaminase levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Acarbose inhibits enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) needed to digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. It locks up the enzymes by mimicking the transition state of the substrate with its amine linkage. However, bacterial alpha-amylases from gut microbiome are able to degrade acarbose. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. === Metabolism === Acarbose degradation is the unique feature of glycoside hydrolases in gut microbiota, acarbose degrading glucosidase, which hydrolyze acarbose into an acarviosine-glucose and glucose. Human enzymes do transform acarbose: the pancreatic alpha-amylase is able to perform a rearrangement reaction, moving the glucose unit in the ""tail"" maltose to the ""head"" of the molecule. Analog drugs with the ""tail"" glucose removed or flipped to an α(1-6) linkage resist this transformation. It has been reported that the maltogenic alpha-amylase from Thermus sp. IM6501 (ThMA) and a cyclodextrinase (CDase) from Streptococcus pyogenes could hydrolyse acarbose to glucose and acarviosine-glucose, ThMA can further hydrolyze acarviosine-glucose into acarviosin and glucose. A cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) from gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum degraded acarbose via two different modes of action to produce maltose and acarviosin, as well as glucose and acarviosine-glucose, suggest that acarbose resistance is caused by the human microbiome. The microbiome-derived acarbose kinases are also specific to phosphorylate and inactivate acarbose. The molecular modeling showed the interaction between gut bacterial acarbose degrading glucosidase and human α-amylase. == Natural distribution == In nature, acarbose is synthesized by soil bacteria Actinoplanes sp through its precursor valienamine. And acarbose is also degraded by gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum and soil bacteria Thermus sp by acarbose degrading glucosidases. == In molecular biology == Acarbose is described chemically as a pseudotetrasaccharide, specifically a maltotetraose mimic inhibitor. As an inhibitor that mimics some natural substrates, it is useful for elucidating the structure of sugar-digesting enzymes, by binding into the same pocket. == Research == Most studies investigating alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity use acarbose as reference. In human T2DM patients, acarbose reduces total triglyceride levels. Acarbose has a similar effect in non-T2DM patients with isolated familial hypertriglyceridemia. In smaller samples of healthy human volunteers, acarbose increases postprandial GLP-1 levels. In studies conducted by three independent laboratories by the US National Institute on Aging's intervention testing programme, acarbose was shown to extend the lifespan of female mice by 5% and of male mice by 22%. == References ==",Prandase,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.259582343976945e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005247035529464483)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.493430894101039e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3651,"('Thyroxine', 'Levothyroxine', 'Thyroxin', 'Tetraiodothyronine', 'Thyrax')","Endogenous, Medical","Levothyroxine, also known as L-thyroxine, is a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4). It is used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism), including a severe form known as myxedema coma. It may also be used to treat and prevent certain types of thyroid tumors. It is not indicated for weight loss. Levothyroxine is taken orally (by mouth) or given by intravenous injection. Levothyroxine has a half-life of 7.5 days when taken daily, so about six weeks is required for it to reach a steady level in the blood. Side effects from excessive doses include weight loss, trouble tolerating heat, sweating, anxiety, trouble sleeping, tremor, and fast heart rate. Use is not recommended in people who have had a recent heart attack. Use during pregnancy has been found to be safe. Dosing should be based on regular measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 levels in the blood. Much of the effect of levothyroxine is following its conversion to triiodothyronine (T3). Levothyroxine was first made in 1927. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Levothyroxine is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the fourth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 82 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Levothyroxine is typically used to treat hypothyroidism, and is the treatment of choice for people with hypothyroidism who often require lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. It may also be used to treat goiter via its ability to lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is considered goiter-inducing. Levothyroxine is also used as interventional therapy in people with nodular thyroid disease or thyroid cancer to suppress TSH secretion. A subset of people with hypothyroidism treated with an appropriate dose of levothyroxine will describe continuing symptoms despite TSH levels in the normal range. In these people, further laboratory and clinical evaluation is warranted, as they may have another cause for their symptoms. Furthermore, reviewing their medications and dietary supplements is important, as several medications can affect thyroid hormone levels. Levothyroxine is also used to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, which is defined by an elevated TSH level and a normal-range free T4 level without symptoms. Such people may be asymptomatic and whether they should be treated is controversial. One benefit of treating this population with levothyroxine therapy is preventing the development of hypothyroidism. As such, treatment should be taken into account for patients with initial TSH levels above 10 mIU/L, people with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, people with symptoms of hypothyroidism and TSH levels of 5–10 mIU/L, and women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant. Oral dosing for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism is 1 μg/kg/day. It is also used to treat myxedema coma, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism characterized by mental status changes and hypothermia. As it is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate, it should be treated in the intensive-care unit with thyroid hormone replacement and aggressive management of individual organ system complications. Dosages vary according to the age groups and the individual condition of the person, body weight, and compliance with the medication and diet. Other predictors of the required dosage are sex, body mass index, deiodinase activity (SPINA-GD), and etiology of hypothyroidism. Annual or semiannual clinical evaluations and TSH monitoring are appropriate after dosing has been established. Levothyroxine is taken on an empty stomach about half an hour to an hour before meals. As such, thyroid replacement therapy is usually taken 30 minutes prior to eating in the morning. For patients with trouble taking levothyroxine in the morning, bedtime dosing is effective, as well. A study in 2015 showed greater efficacy of levothyroxine when taken at bedtime. Doses of levothyroxine that normalize serum TSH may not normalize abnormal levels of LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. Poor compliance in taking the medicine is the most common cause of elevated TSH levels in people receiving appropriate doses of levothyroxine. === 50 and older === For older people (over 50 years old) and people with known or suspected ischemic heart disease, levothyroxine therapy should not be initiated at the full replacement dose. Since thyroid hormone increases the heart's oxygen demand by increasing heart rate and contractility, starting at higher doses may cause an acute coronary syndrome or an abnormal heart rhythm. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Hypothyroidism is common among pregnant women. A nationwide cohort study showed that 1.39% of all pregnant women in 2010 in Denmark received a prescription of levothyroxine during pregnancy. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy categories, levothyroxine has been assigned category A. Given that no increased risk of congenital abnormalities has been demonstrated in pregnant women taking levothyroxine, therapy should be continued during pregnancy. Furthermore, treatment should be immediately administered to women diagnosed with hypothyroidism during pregnancy, as hypothyroidism is associated with a higher rate of complications, such as spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, and premature birth. Thyroid hormone requirements increase during and last throughout pregnancy. As such, pregnant women are recommended to increase to nine doses of levothyroxine each week, rather than the usual seven, as soon as their pregnancy is confirmed. Repeat thyroid function tests should be done five weeks after the dosage is increased. While a minimal amount of thyroid hormones is found in breast milk, the amount does not influence infant plasma thyroid levels. Furthermore, levothyroxine was not found to cause any adverse events to the infant or mother during breastfeeding. Since adequate thyroid hormone concentrations are required to maintain normal lactation, appropriate levothyroxine doses should be administered during breastfeeding. === Children === Levothyroxine is safe and effective for children with hypothyroidism; the goal of treatment for children with hypothyroidism is to reach and preserve normal intellectual and physical development. == Contraindications == Levothyroxine is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to levothyroxine sodium or any component of the formulation, people with acute myocardial infarction, and people with thyrotoxicosis of any etiology. Levothyroxine is also contraindicated for people with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency, as thyroid hormones may cause an acute adrenal crisis by increasing the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. For oral tablets, the inability to swallow capsules is an additional contraindication. == Side effects == Adverse events are generally caused by incorrect dosing. Long-term suppression of TSH values below normal values frequently causes cardiac side effects and contributes to decreases in bone mineral density (low TSH levels are also well known to contribute to osteoporosis). Too high a dose of levothyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Overdose can result in heart palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, anxiousness, confusion, agitation, insomnia, weight loss, and increased appetite. Allergic reactions to the drug are characterized by symptoms such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face and tongue. Acute overdose may cause fever, hypoglycemia, heart failure, coma, and unrecognized adrenal insufficiency. Acute massive overdose may be life-threatening; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Massive overdose can be associated with increased sympathetic activity, thus may require treatment with beta-blockers. The effects of overdosing appear 6 hours to 11 days after ingestion. == Interactions == Many foods and other substances can interfere with the absorption of thyroxine. Substances that reduce absorption are aluminium- and magnesium-containing antacids, simethicone, sucralfate, cholestyramine, colestipol, and polystyrene sulfonate. Sevelamer with calcium carbonate may decrease the bioavailability of levothyroxine. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine, but based on a study of 10 healthy people aged 20–30 (eight men, two women), it may not have a significant effect on bioavailability in young adults. A study of eight women suggested that coffee may interfere with the intestinal absorption of levothyroxine, though at a level less than eating bran. Certain other substances can cause adverse effects that may be severe. Combination of levothyroxine with ketamine may cause hypertension and tachycardia; and tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants increase its toxicity. Soy, walnuts, fiber, calcium supplements, and iron supplements can also adversely affect absorption. A study found that cow's milk reduces levothyroxine absorption. To minimize interactions, a manufacturer of levothyroxine recommends after taking it, waiting 30 minutes to one hour before eating or drinking anything that is not water. They further recommend taking it in the morning on an empty stomach. == Chemistry == Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), which is secreted by the thyroid gland. Levothyroxine and thyroxine are chemically identical: natural thyroxine is also in the ""levo"" chiral form, the difference is only in terminological preference. T4 is biosynthesized from tyrosine. Approximately 5% of the US population suffers from over- or underproduction of T4 and T3. See Thyroid hormones § Thyroid metabolism for more information on its biosynthesis. Industrially, levothyroxine is made by chemical synthesis. Tyrosine is a common starting material. The produced hormone is incorporated into drugs as its sodium salt, levothyroxine sodium. Solid drugs such as tablets contain the pentahydrate form of the salt. Dextrothyroxine is the mirror form of levothyroxine with the opposite, non-natural chirality. == Mechanism of action == T4 is a prohormone; T4 is a precursor to the hormone T3. T4 is a tetraiodide, T3 is a triiodide, triiodothyronine. The selenoenzyme iodothyronine deiodinase mediates the T4 → T3 conversion. T3-thyroxine is a unique example of an iodine compound essential for human health. T3 binds to thyroid receptor proteins in the cell nucleus and causes metabolic effects through the control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption of orally administered levothyroxine from the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 40 to 80%, with the majority of the drug absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. Levothyroxine absorption is increased by fasting and decreased in certain malabsorption syndromes, by certain foods, and with age. Dietary fiber decreases the bioavailability of the drug. Greater than 99% of circulating thyroid hormones are bound to plasma proteins including thyroxine-binding globulin, transthyretin (previously called thyroxine-binding prealbumin), and albumin. Only free hormone is metabolically active. The primary pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. The liver is the main site of T4 deiodination, and along with the kidneys, are responsible for about 80% of circulating T3. In addition to deiodination, thyroid hormones are also excreted through the kidneys and metabolized through conjugation and glucuronidation and excreted directly into the bile and the gut, where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Half-life elimination is 6–7 days for people with normal lab results; 9–10 days for people with hypothyroidism; 3–4 days for people with hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys (about 80%), with urinary excretion decreasing with age. The remaining 20% of T4 is eliminated in the stool. == History == Thyroxine was first isolated in pure form in 1914 at the Mayo Clinic by Edward Calvin Kendall from extracts of hog thyroid glands. The hormone was synthesized in 1927 by British chemists Charles Robert Harington and George Barger. == Society and culture == === Economics === As of 2011, levothyroxine was the second-most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., with 23.8 million prescriptions filled each year. In 2022, it was the fourth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 82 million prescriptions. === Available forms === Levothyroxine for systemic administration is available as an oral tablet, an intramuscular injection, and as a solution for intravenous infusion. Furthermore, it is available as both brand-name and generic products. While the FDA approved the use of generic levothyroxine for brand-name levothyroxine in 2004, the decision was met with disagreement by several medical associations. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Endocrine Society, and the American Thyroid Association did not agree with the FDA that brand-name and generic formulations of levothyroxine were bioequivalent. As such, people were recommended to be started and kept on either brand-name or generic levothyroxine formulations and not changed back and forth from one to the other. For people who do switch products, their TSH and free T4 levels should be tested after six weeks to check that they are within the normal range. Brand names include Eltroxin, Euthyrox, Eutirox, Letrox, Levaxin, Lévothyrox, Levoxyl, L-thyroxine, Thyrax, and Thyrax Duotab in Europe; Thyrox and Thyronorm in South Asia; Euthyrox, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, and Unithroid in North and South America; and Thyrin and Thyrolar in Bangladesh. Numerous generic versions also are available. == Research == A meta-analysis published in 2021 found that once weekly thyroxine is associated with less efficient control of hypothyroidism at six weeks. == References == == External links == ""Real-world Evidence from a Narrow Therapeutic Index Product (Levothyroxine) Reflects the Therapeutic Equivalence of Generic Drug Products"".

3652,"('Cysteine', 'Cystein', '(s)-2-amino-3-mercaptopropanoic acid', '(2s)-2-amino-3-sulfanylpropanoic acid', 'Zystein')","Endogenous, Medical","Cysteine (; symbol Cys or C) is a semiessential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOOC−CH(−NH2)−CH2−SH. The thiol side chain in cysteine enables the formation of disulfide bonds, and often participates in enzymatic reactions as a nucleophile. Cysteine is chiral, but both D and L-cysteine are found in nature. L‑Cysteine is a protein monomer in all biota, and D-cysteine acts as a signaling molecule in mammalian nervous systems. Cysteine is named after its discovery in urine, which comes from the urinary bladder or cyst, from Greek κύστις kýstis, ""bladder"". The thiol is susceptible to oxidation to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. In this case, the symbol Cyx is sometimes used. The deprotonated form can generally be described by the symbol Cym as well. When used as a food additive, cysteine has the E number E920. Cysteine is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. == Structure == Like other amino acids (not as a residue of a protein), cysteine exists as a zwitterion. Cysteine has l chirality in the older d/l notation based on homology to d- and l-glyceraldehyde. In the newer R/S system of designating chirality, based on the atomic numbers of atoms near the asymmetric carbon, cysteine (and selenocysteine) have R chirality, because of the presence of sulfur (or selenium) as a second neighbor to the asymmetric carbon atom. The remaining chiral amino acids, having lighter atoms in that position, have S chirality. Replacing sulfur with selenium gives selenocysteine. == Dietary sources == Cysteinyl is a residue in high-protein foods. Some foods considered rich in cysteine include poultry, eggs, beef, and whole grains. In high-protein diets, cysteine may be partially responsible for reduced blood pressure and stroke risk. Although classified as a nonessential amino acid, in rare cases, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic diseases or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine can usually be synthesized by the human body under normal physiological conditions if a sufficient quantity of methionine is available. == Industrial sources == The majority of l-cysteine is obtained industrially by hydrolysis of animal materials, such as poultry feathers or hog hair. Despite widespread rumor, human hair is rarely a source material. Indeed, food additive or cosmetic product manufactures may not legally source from human hair in the European Union. Some animal-originating sources of l-cysteine as a food additive contravene kosher, halal, vegan, or vegetarian diets. To avoid this problem, synthetic l-cysteine, compliant with Jewish kosher and Muslim halal laws, is also available, albeit at a higher price. The typical synthetic route involves fermentation with an artificial E. coli strain. Alternatively, Evonik (formerly Degussa) introduced a route from substituted thiazolines. Pseudomonas thiazolinophilum hydrolyzes racemic 2‑amino-Δ2‑thiazoline-4‑carboxylic acid to l‑cysteine. == Biosynthesis == In animals, biosynthesis begins with the amino acid serine. The sulfur is derived from methionine, which is converted to homocysteine through the intermediate S-adenosylmethionine. Cystathionine beta-synthase then combines homocysteine and serine to form the asymmetrical thioether cystathionine. The enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase converts the cystathionine into cysteine and alpha-ketobutyrate. In plants and bacteria, cysteine biosynthesis also starts from serine, which is converted to O-acetylserine by the enzyme serine transacetylase. The enzyme cysteine synthase, using sulfide sources, converts this ester into cysteine, releasing acetate. == Biological functions == The cysteine sulfhydryl group is nucleophilic and easily oxidized. The reactivity is enhanced when the thiol is ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. Because of its high reactivity, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine has numerous biological functions. === Precursor to the antioxidant glutathione === Due to the ability of thiols to undergo redox reactions, cysteine and cysteinyl residues have antioxidant properties. Its antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans and other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; so it must be biosynthesized from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid. While glutamic acid is usually sufficient because amino acid nitrogen is recycled through glutamate as an intermediary, dietary cysteine and glycine supplementation can improve synthesis of glutathione. === Precursor to iron-sulfur clusters === Cysteine is an important source of sulfide in human metabolism. The sulfide in iron-sulfur clusters and in nitrogenase is extracted from cysteine, which is converted to alanine in the process. === Metal ion binding === Beyond the iron-sulfur proteins, many other metal cofactors in enzymes are bound to the thiolate substituent of cysteinyl residues. Examples include zinc in zinc fingers and alcohol dehydrogenase, copper in the blue copper proteins, iron in cytochrome P450, and nickel in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases. The sulfhydryl group also has a high affinity for heavy metals, so that proteins containing cysteine, such as metallothionein, will bind metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium tightly. === Roles in protein structure === In the translation of messenger RNA molecules to produce polypeptides, cysteine is coded for by the UGU and UGC codons. Cysteine has traditionally been considered to be a hydrophilic amino acid, based largely on the chemical parallel between its sulfhydryl group and the hydroxyl groups in the side chains of other polar amino acids. However, the cysteine side chain has been shown to stabilize hydrophobic interactions in micelles to a greater degree than the side chain in the nonpolar amino acid glycine and the polar amino acid serine. In a statistical analysis of the frequency with which amino acids appear in various proteins, cysteine residues were found to associate with hydrophobic regions of proteins. Their hydrophobic tendency was equivalent to that of known nonpolar amino acids such as methionine and tyrosine (tyrosine is polar aromatic but also hydrophobic), those of which were much greater than that of known polar amino acids such as serine and threonine. Hydrophobicity scales, which rank amino acids from most hydrophobic to most hydrophilic, consistently place cysteine towards the hydrophobic end of the spectrum, even when they are based on methods that are not influenced by the tendency of cysteines to form disulfide bonds in proteins. Therefore, cysteine is now often grouped among the hydrophobic amino acids, though it is sometimes also classified as slightly polar, or polar. Most cysteine residues are covalently bonded to other cysteine residues to form disulfide bonds, which play an important role in the folding and stability of some proteins, usually proteins secreted to the extracellular medium. Since most cellular compartments are reducing environments, disulfide bonds are generally unstable in the cytosol with some exceptions as noted below. Disulfide bonds in proteins are formed by oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, cannot form disulfide bonds. More aggressive oxidants convert cysteine to the corresponding sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid. Cysteine residues play a valuable role by crosslinking proteins, which increases the rigidity of proteins and also functions to confer proteolytic resistance (since protein export is a costly process, minimizing its necessity is advantageous). Inside the cell, disulfide bridges between cysteine residues within a polypeptide support the protein's tertiary structure. Insulin is an example of a protein with cystine crosslinking, wherein two separate peptide chains are connected by a pair of disulfide bonds. Protein disulfide isomerases catalyze the proper formation of disulfide bonds; the cell transfers dehydroascorbic acid to the endoplasmic reticulum, which oxidizes the environment. In this environment, cysteines are, in general, oxidized to cystine and are no longer functional as a nucleophiles. Aside from its oxidation to cystine, cysteine participates in numerous post-translational modifications. The nucleophilic sulfhydryl group allows cysteine to conjugate to other groups, e.g., in prenylation. Ubiquitin ligases transfer ubiquitin to its pendant, proteins, and caspases, which engage in proteolysis in the apoptotic cycle. Inteins often function with the help of a catalytic cysteine. These roles are typically limited to the intracellular milieu, where the environment is reducing, and cysteine is not oxidized to cystine. == Evolutionary role of cysteine == Cysteine is considered a ""newcomer"" amino acid, being the 17th amino acid incorporated into the genetic code. Similar to other later-added amino acids such as methionine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, cysteine exhibits strong nucleophilic and redox-active properties. These properties contribute to the depletion of cysteine from respiratory chain complexes, such as Complexes I and IV, since reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the respiratory chain can react with the cysteine residues in these complexes, leading to dysfunctional proteins and potentially contributing to aging. The primary response of a protein to ROS is the oxidation of cysteine and the loss of free thiol groups, resulting in increased thiyl radicals and associated protein cross-linking. In contrast, another sulfur-containing, redox-active amino acid, methionine, does not exhibit these biochemical properties and its content is relatively upregulated in mitochondrially encoded proteins. == Applications == Cysteine, mainly the l-enantiomer, is a precursor in the food, pharmaceutical, and personal-care industries. One of the largest applications is the production of flavors. For example, the reaction of cysteine with sugars in a Maillard reaction yields meat flavors. l-Cysteine is also used as a processing aid for baking. In the field of personal care, cysteine is used for permanent-wave applications, predominantly in Asia. Again, the cysteine is used for breaking up the disulfide bonds in the hair's keratin. Cysteine is a very popular target for site-directed labeling experiments to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics. Maleimides selectively attach to cysteine using a covalent Michael addition. Site-directed spin labeling for EPR or paramagnetic relaxation-enhanced NMR also uses cysteine extensively. === Reducing toxic effects of alcohol === Cysteine has been proposed as a preventive or antidote for some of the negative effects of alcohol, including liver damage and hangover. It counteracts the poisonous effects of acetaldehyde. It binds to acetaldehyde to form the low-toxicity heterocycle methylthioproline. In a rat study, test animals received an LD90 dose of acetaldehyde. Those that received cysteine had an 80% survival rate; when both cysteine and thiamine were administered, all animals survived. The control group had a 10% survival rate. In 2020 an article was published that suggests L-cysteine might also work in humans. === N-Acetylcysteine === N-Acetyl-l-cysteine is a derivative of cysteine wherein an acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. This compound is sold as a dietary supplement, and used as an antidote in cases of acetaminophen overdose. === Sheep === Cysteine is required by sheep to produce wool. It is an essential amino acid that is taken in from their feed. As a consequence, during drought conditions, sheep produce less wool; however, transgenic sheep that can make their own cysteine have been developed. == Chemical reactions == Being multifunctional, cysteine undergoes a variety of reactions. Much attention has focused on protecting the sulfhydryl group. Methylation of cysteine gives S-methylcysteine. Treatment with formaldehyde gives the thiazolidine thioproline. With phosgene and related carbonylating agents, cysteine gives procysteine. Cysteine forms a variety of coordination complexes upon treatment with metal ions. This coordination behavior is seen in many metal-cysteine metalloenzymes. == Safety == Relative to most other amino acids, cysteine is much more toxic. == History == In 1884 German chemist Eugen Baumann found that reduction of cystine with zinc gave monomer, which he named ""cysteïne"".

It is a highly selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, and thus works by inhibiting the enzyme PIK3CG, disrupting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway which plays important roles in the development of cancer. Eganelisib is being developed by Infinity Pharmaceuticals. Early clinical trial results were published in September 2016. On September 29, 2020, it was granted Fast Track designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for inoperable, locally advanced, or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, combined with a checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy. As of October 2020, five phase I/II clinical trials were ongoing in the United States, and one in Europe. Eganelisib has also been explored for its potential use in the treatment of COVID-19 and MRSA. Early, pre-clinical in vitro studies published in 2024 suggested eganelisib's ability to inhibit PI3Kγ, an enzyme involved in myeloid cell movement into infected tissues, could reduce excessive immune system activity that can damage tissues. By inhibiting PI3Kγ, eganelisib may prevent myeloid cells from entering and damaging tissue in patients with COVID-19 or MRSA, thereby reducing inflammation and the risk of cytokine storms. The study also indicated eganelisib may inhibit the main protease (Mpro) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a crucial enzyme required for viral replication, potentially offering another therapeutic avenue against COVID-19. == References == == Further reading == Drew SL, Thomas-Tran R, Beatty JW, Fournier J, Lawson KV, Miles DH, Mata G, Sharif EU, Yan X, Mailyan AK, Ginn E, Chen J, Wong K, Soni D, Dhanota P, Chen PY, Shaqfeh SG, Meleza C, Pham AT, Chen A, Zhao X, Banuelos J, Jin L, Schindler U, Walters MJ, Young SW, Walker NP, Leleti MR, Powers JP, Jeffrey JL (October 2020).

As the rate at which gene clusters are identified outpaces the discovery rate of new molecules, this unknown chemical space is rapidly growing, as too are the rewards for developing technologies to exploit it. One class of natural products that has been underrepresented is phosphonic acids, which have important medical and agricultural uses. Hundreds of phosphonic acid biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified encoding for unknown molecules. Although methods exist to elicit secondary metabolite gene clusters in native hosts, they require the strain to be amenable to genetic manipulation. One method to circumvent this is pathway refactoring, which we implemented in an effort to discover new phosphonic acids from a gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. strain NRRL F-525. By reengineering this cluster for expression in the production host Streptomyces lividans, utility of refactoring is demonstrated with the isolation of a novel phosphonic acid, O-phosphonoacetic acid serine, and the characterization of its biosynthesis. In addition, a new biosynthetic branch point is identified with a phosphonoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which was used to identify additional phosphonic acid gene clusters that share phosphonoacetic acid as an intermediate. Many microorganisms produce phosphonates, molecules characterized by stable carbon-phosphorus bonds that store phosphorus or act as antimicrobials. The role of phosphonates in the marine biosphere is well characterized but the role of these molecules in the intestine is poorly understood.  Phosphonoacetic acid (PAA)-resistant type 1 herpes simplex virus population was isolated by repeated passage of the virus in the presence of this inhibitor. Hairless mice infected percutaneously with the inhibitor-resistant or the parental inhibitor-susceptible virus were treated intraperitoneally with PAA and 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-adenine by using several different dosage schedules. Whereas 9-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-adenine was effective both in the PAA-susceptible and PAA-resistant herpes simplex virus-induced skin infection, PAA suppressed only the infection induced by the parental PAA-susceptible virus.",Phosphonoacetic acid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.5280261039733887), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011049000546336174), (' INDUSTR', -1.843177233240567e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3065741956233978), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011565894819796085)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -9.615255839889869e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/212978/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC429125/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1043027/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC352460/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC429519/,https://www.medchemexpress.com/phosphonoacetic-acid.html,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB02823 ', [])"

In experiment 1, 18 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated, 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. Treatments were (1) basal diet estimated to supply 45 g/d digestible Met (dMet) or 1.47% of metabolizable protein (MP; control), (2) basal diet top-dressed with 32 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.2% of MP, and (3) basal diet top-dressed with 56 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.6% of MP. The NALM treatments supplied estimated 17 and 29 g/d dMet from NALM, respectively, based on manufacturer's specifications. In experiment 2, 4 rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with four 12-d periods. A 12-d period for baseline data collection and 4 d for determination of RE of NALM preceded the Latin square experiment. For determination of RE, 30 g of NALM were dosed into the rumen simultaneously with Cr-EDTA (used as a rumen fluid kinetics marker) and samples of ruminal contents were collected at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Rumen escape of NALM was calculated using the estimated passage rate based on the measured Cr rate of disappearance. Bioavailability of abomasally dosed NALM was determined using the area under the curve of plasma Met concentration technique. Two doses of l-Met (providing 7.5 and 15 g of dMet) and 2 doses of NALM (11.2 and 14.4 g of dMet) were separately pulse-dosed into the abomasum of the cows and blood was collected from the jugular vein for Met concentration analysis at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Supplementation of NALM did not affect DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk protein and lactose concentrations and yields in experiment 1. Milk fat concentration and energy-corrected milk yield decreased linearly with NALM dose. Plasma Met concentration was not affected by NALM dose. The estimated relative BA of abomasally dosed NALM (experiment 2) was 50% when dosed at 14.4 g/cow (11.2 g/d dMet from NALM) and 24% when dosed at 28.8 g/cow (14.4 g/d dMet from NALM). The estimated RE of NALM was 19% based on the measured k Neutral amino acids can be delivered into cells through the l-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1), which is a sodium independent transporter. The LAT1 protein is expressed in different tissues, including kidney, blood brain barrier and intestinal wall hence LAT1 can be used as a target in diseases associated with its overexpression. In-silico interactions between different ligands, including methionine (Met), N-acetyl-l-methionine (AcMet), hyaluronic acid (HA), grafted hyaluronic-acid l-methionine (HA-ADH-Met) and a novel grafted hyaluronic acid-N-acetyl-l-methionine (HA-ADH-AcMet), which are at the active site of the LAT1 transporter, were studied and the binding energies calculated. The HA-ADH-AcMet complex demonstrated binding energy and solvation energy of -74.84 and 81.46 kcal/mol, respectively, thus validating its potential to be synthesized. The structural conformation of the HA-ADH-AcMet was confirmed using  Methionine plays a vital role in protein synthesis, and regulation of antioxidant response in ruminants. This study aimed to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM), which serves a source of rumen-protected methionine, on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and oxidative stability. Sixty Angus heifers (initial body weight = 408 ± 51.2 kg, 15-18 months) were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: a control group (0% NALM), and experimental groups receiving diets containing 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.50% NALM (dry matter (DM) basis), respectively. The experiment included a 2-week adaptation and a 22-week data and sample collection period. Results indicated that blood urea nitrogen in the plasma of the 0.25% NALM group was lower compared to the control and the 0.50% NALM groups (P = 0.02). The plasma methionine (P = 0.04), proline (P < 0.01), and tryptophan (P = 0.05) were higher in the 0.25% and 0.50% NALM groups, as well as the methionine and proline in the muscle of the 0.25% NALM group (P < 0.01). The muscle pH (P < 0.01) was increased by supplementing 0.25% and 0.50% NALM in diets but decreased the lactate (P < 0.01). The 0.25% NALM group also increased a* (P = 0.05), decreased L* (P = 0.05), drip loss (P = 0.01), and glycolytic potential in the muscle (P < 0.01). The total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione in muscle of 0.25% NALM group were higher than that of the control (P < 0.01), and the malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were lower (P < 0.01).

3657,"('Baricitinib', 'Olumiant', 'Baricitinib (ly3009104, incb028050)', 'Ly 3009104', 'Baricitinib [usan:inn]')",Medical,"Baricitinib, sold under the brand name Olumiant among others, is an immunomodulatory medication used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, alopecia areata, and COVID-19. It acts as an inhibitor of janus kinase (JAK), blocking the subtypes JAK1 and JAK2. Baricitinib is approved for medical use in the European Union and in the United States. == Medical uses == In February 2017, baricitinib was approved for use in the European Union as a second-line therapy for moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults, either alone or in combination with methotrexate. In May 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved baricitinib for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. In May 2022, the FDA approved baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Baricitinib is the first immunomodulatory treatment for COVID-19 to receive FDA approval. In the United States, baricitinib is authorized under an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized people aged 2 to less than 18 years of age who require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In June 2022, the FDA authorized baricitinib for the treatment of severe alopecia areata. == Contraindications == During pregnancy, the use of baricitinib is contraindicated. == Side effects == In studies, upper respiratory tract infections and high blood cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia) occurred in more than 10% of participants. Less common side effects included other infections such as herpes zoster, herpes simplex, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis. == Interactions == Being metabolized only to a small extent, the substance has a low potential for interactions. In studies, inhibitors of the liver enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9, as well as the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, had no relevant influence on baricitinib concentrations in the bloodstream. While baricitinib blocks a number of transporter proteins in vitro, clinically relevant interactions via this mechanism are considered very unlikely, except perhaps for the cation transporter SLC22A1 (OCT1). An additive effect with other immunosuppressants cannot be excluded. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that reversibly inhibits Janus kinase 1 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.9 nM and Janus kinase 2 with an IC50 of 5.7 nM. Tyrosine kinase 2, which belongs to the same enzyme family, is affected less (IC50 = 53 nM), and Janus kinase 3 far less (IC50 > 400 nM). Via a signal transduction pathway involving STAT proteins, this ultimately modulates gene expression in immunological cells. Other JAK inhibitors include tofacitinib, which is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis; fedratinib, and ruxolitinib. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly absorbed from the gut with an absolute bioavailability of 79%. It reaches highest blood plasma levels after about an hour; in different individuals the time to reach this level ranges from 0.5 to 3 hours. Food intake has no relevant influence on the drug's pharmacokinetics. 50% of the circulating baricitinib are bound to blood plasma proteins. Less than 10% of the substance is metabolized to four different oxidation products by CYP3A4; the rest is left unchanged. Elimination half-life is 12.5 hours on average. About 75% is eliminated via the urine, and 20% via the faeces. == History == Baricitinib was discovered by Incyte and licensed to Eli Lilly. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In January 2016, Eli Lilly submitted a new drug application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the approval of baricitinib to treat moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In December 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the approval of baricitinib as a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. European Union approval was granted in February 2017. Despite widespread expectations that the FDA would approve baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis, in April 2017, the FDA issued a rejection, citing concerns about dosing and safety. In May 2018, baricitinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In March 2020, the US FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to baricitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata and granted approval in June 2022. The efficacy and safety of baricitinib in alopecia areata was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Trial AA-1 and Trial AA-2) with participants who had at least 50% scalp hair loss as measured by the Severity of Alopecia Tool for more than six months. Participants in these trials received either a placebo, 2 milligrams of baricitinib, or 4 milligrams of baricitinib every day. The primary measurement of efficacy for both trials was the proportion of participants who achieved at least 80% scalp hair coverage at week 36. == Research == As of August 2016, 31 clinical trials had been registered for baricitinib of which 24 had completed, and 4 of 6 phase 3 trials had completed. As of March 2022, a phase III clinical trial showed hair regrowth for those with alopecia areata. === COVID-19 === In April 2020, Lilly announced they were investigating the use of baricitinib for treating people with COVID-19. The drug's anti-inflammatory activity was expected to act on the inflammatory cascade associated with COVID-19. In April and June 2020, the first two studies of baricitinib prescribed for hospitalized people with COVID-19 were published online. Then in November 2020, published research showed baricitinib was beneficial in treating people with COVID-19. According to the paper ""mechanistic actions of a Janus kinase-1/2 inhibitor targeting viral entry, replication and the cytokine storm, and is associated with beneficial outcomes including in severely ill elderly people"". In a clinical trial of hospitalized people with COVID-19, baricitinib, in combination with remdesivir, was shown to reduce time to recovery within 29 days after initiating treatment compared to participants who received a placebo with remdesivir. The data supporting the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) for baricitinib combined with remdesivir was based on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (ACTT-2), which was conducted by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This clinical trial evaluated whether baricitinib impacted how long it took for subjects who were also taking remdesivir to recover from COVID-19. The trial followed participants for 29 days and included 1,033 participants with moderate or severe COVID-19; 515 participants received baricitinib plus remdesivir, and 518 participants received placebo plus remdesivir. Recovery was defined as either being discharged from the hospital or being hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care. The median time to recovery from COVID-19 was seven days for baricitinib plus remdesivir and eight days for placebo plus remdesivir. The odds of a patient's condition progressing to death or being ventilated at day 29 was 31% lower in the baricitinib plus remdesivir group versus the placebo plus remdesivir group. The odds of clinical improvement at day 15 was 30% higher in the baricitinib plus remdesivir group versus the placebo plus remdesivir group. For all of these endpoints, the effects were statistically significant. The EUA was issued to Eli Lilly and Company. In November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its guideline on therapeutics for COVID-19 to include a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir, triggered by results from the WHO Solidarity trial. In November 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people aged two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Then in September 2021, the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial of hospitalized people with COVID-19 to date, COV-BARRIER, was published. This trial randomized 1525 participants to either baricitinib or placebo. Nearly 80% of participants were receiving systemic corticosteroids at enrollment. There was an absolute risk reduction of 2.7 percent in the primary endpoint of progression to high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death by day 28. The 38.2% statistically significant reduction in all-cause 28-day mortality for participants receiving baricitinib compared to placebo was the largest mortality reduction to date and maintained at 60 days. This translates into one additional death prevented for every 20 participants treated with baricitinib. The frequencies of serious adverse events were lower for participants receiving baricitinib compared to those receiving placebo. As of April 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is evaluating the use of baricitinib to include treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized people from ten years of age who require supplemental oxygen. In July 2021, the FDA revised the EUA for baricitinib authorizing it alone for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized people aged two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Under the revised EUA, baricitinib is not required to be administered with remdesivir. As of January 2022, the World Health Organization recommends baricitinib for people with severe or critical COVID-19. Thereafter in February 2022, an exploratory randomized, placebo-controlled trial of participants receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were randomly to baricitinib or placebo. There was a 46% statistically significant relative reduction in all-cause mortality for participants receiving baricitinib compared to those receiving placebo at 28 days which was sustained at 60 days. Then in May 2022, the FDA approved use of baricitinib for the treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with a recommended dose of 4 mg once daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever happens first. In March 2022, the RECOVERY trial reported that the use of baricitinib cut the risk of death by about a fifth in about 12,000 participants. == References == == Further reading ==",Olumiant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.847726889536716e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001685477327555418)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-lilly-and-incytes-olumiantr-baricitinib-first-and?utm_source=openai), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-lilly-and-incytes-olumiantr-baricitinib-treatment?utm_source=openai), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-olumiantr-baricitinib-2-mg-tablets-treatment-adults?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=509, start_index=9, title=""FDA Approves Lilly and Incyte's OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) As First and Only Systemic Medicine for Adults with Severe Alopecia Areata | Eli Lilly and Company"", type='url_citation', url='https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-lilly-and-incytes-olumiantr-baricitinib-first-and?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=509, start_index=9, title=""FDA Approves Lilly and Incyte's OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) for the Treatment of Certain Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 | Eli Lilly and Company"", type='url_citation', url='https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-lilly-and-incytes-olumiantr-baricitinib-treatment?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=509, start_index=9, title='FDA Approves OLUMIANT® (baricitinib) 2-mg Tablets for the Treatment of Adults with Moderately-to-Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis | Eli Lilly and Company', type='url_citation', url='https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-approves-olumiantr-baricitinib-2-mg-tablets-treatment-adults?utm_source=openai')])"
3658,"('Oxymatrine', 'Ammothamnine', 'Matrine n-oxide', 'Oxysophoridine', 'Matrine oxide')",Medical,"Oxymatrine (matrine oxide, matrine N-oxide, matrine 1-oxide) is one of many quinolizidine alkaloid compounds extracted from the root of Sophora flavescens, a Chinese herb. It is very similar in structure to matrine, which has one less oxygen atom. Oxymatrine has a variety of effects in vitro and in animal models, including protection against apoptosis, tumor and fibrotic tissue development, and inflammation. Furthermore, oxymatrine has been shown to decrease cardiac ischemia (decreased blood perfusion), myocardial injury, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and improve heart failure by increasing cardiac function. == Role in cardiac fibrosis == Recent research has shown that oxymatrine prevents cardiac fibrosis in rats. The development of fibrotic tissue in the heart occurs when fibroblasts produce excessive amounts of collagen (particularly types I and III), which accumulate and deposit in the heart. The excessive transformation to fibrotic tissue negatively affects the function and structure of the heart. Additionally, excessive amounts of collagen in the ventricles lead to alterations in gene expression, deposition of extracellular matrix, wall thickening, and ventricular remodeling in a manner that promotes dysfunction. The mechanism by which oxymatrine may inhibit fibrosis is still unidentified. One theory that has been proposed is that oxymatrine inhibits a key signaling pathway involved in collagen production. One of the main signaling receptors involved in this pathway is the TGF-β1 co-receptor (complex of type I and type II receptors), which acts as a trans-membrane protein serine/threonine kinase. A receptor assembly factor first activates TGF-β1 type I receptor and then type II. Receptor I is then able to bind proteins Smad2 and Smad3, which form a complex with Smad4. This complex accumulates in the nucleus, and binds to promoter elements of the collagen gene, stimulating the production of collagen. In rats, oxymatrine also inhibits the expression of the Smad3 ligand which binds to TGF-β1 type I and activates the signal transduction pathway. A dose–response relationship was observed with increasing intragastric concentrations of oxymatrine resulting in decreased expression of Smad3. By inhibiting this pathway, less collagen was produced and deposited in the heart, preventing the formation of cardiac fibrosis. Huang and Chen (2013) claim that oxymatrine may even be involved in inhibiting the expression of TGF-β1 receptors, which would further support that oxymatrine attenuates the signal transduction pathway involved in collagen production. They also reported that inhibition of the TGF-β1 receptor may also prevent ventricular remodeling. == Future studies == Effects of oxymatrine on heart disease in humans has not been studied and the long term side-effects of clinical oxymatrine use have not yet been identified. In a 2010 study, Oxymatrine was shown to inhibit the development of morphine-induced tolerance associated with decreased expression of P-glycoprotein in rats.[1] == References ==",Matrine oxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.134606271982193)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.6993176937103271), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.12698905169963837), ('ĠFOOD', -0.2640519142150879), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023359231650829315)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is used in the acute treatment of convulsive status epilepticus. Fosphenytoin was developed in 1996. == Medical uses == Fosphenytoin is approved in the United States for the short-term (five days or fewer) treatment of epilepsy when more widely used means of phenytoin administration are not possible or are ill-advised, such as endotracheal intubation, status epilepticus or some other type of repeated seizures; cluster seizure, vomiting, and/or the patient is unalert or not awake or both. === Other === In 2003, it was reported that even though anticonvulsants are often very effective in mania, and acute mania requires rapid treatment, fosphenytoin had no antimanic effect. == Metabolism == One millimole of phenytoin is produced for every millimole of fosphenytoin administered; the hydrolysis of fosphenytoin also yields phosphate and formaldehyde, the latter of which is subsequently metabolized to formate, which is in turn metabolized by a folate dependent mechanism. == Side effects == Side effects are similar to intravenous phenytoin and include hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, CNS adverse events (nystagmus, dizziness, sedation/somnolence, ataxia and stupor), and local dermatological reactions. Purple glove syndrome probably occurs with fosphenytoin but possibly at lower frequency than with intravenous phenytoin. Fosphenytoin can cause hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal failure patients. == History == Phenytoin, in both its acidic and sodium salt forms, is erratically bioavailable whether it is injected or taken orally due to its high melting point, weak acidity, and its being only sparingly soluble in water. Simply putting patients on other drugs is not always an option; this was especially true before 1993, when the number of anticonvulsants available was much more limited. One solution was to develop a prodrug that did not have these drawbacks.

This time can then be used to administer steroid injections to the mother which help fetal lung maturity and reduce complications of prematurity. It should not be used to prevent preterm labor or delay labor more than 48–72 hours. In February 2011, the Food and Drug Administration began requiring a black box warning on the drug's label. Pregnant women should not be given injections of the drug terbutaline for the prevention of preterm labor or for long-term (beyond 48–72 hours) management of preterm labor, and should not be given oral terbutaline for any type of prevention or treatment of preterm labor ""due to the potential for serious maternal heart problems and death."" It was patented in 1966 and came into medical use in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Terbutaline is used as a fast-acting bronchodilator (often used as a short-term asthma treatment) and as a tocolytic to delay premature labor. As an asthma treatment, the inhaled form of terbutaline, starts working within 15 minutes and can last up to 6 hours. It is also sold as an injectable solution, an oral tablet, and as a syrup (in combination with guaifenesin). Terbutaline is a pregnancy category C medication and is prescribed to stop contractions. After successful intravenous tocolysis, little evidence exists that oral terbutaline is effective. Terbutaline as a treatment for premature labor is an off-label use not approved by the US FDA, who have warned that oral terbutaline is not effective and can cause severe heart problems or death, and while injectable terbutaline can be used for premature labor in emergency situations in a hospital setting, it should only be used for short periods of time. == Side effects == Adult — tachycardia, anxiety, nervousness, tremors, headache, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hypotension and, rarely, pulmonary edema. Fetal — tachycardia and hypoglycemia. == Pharmacology == The tertiary butyl group in terbutaline makes it more selective for β2 receptors. Since there is no hydroxy group on position 4 of the benzene ring, the molecule is less susceptible to metabolism by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase. == Chemistry == Terbutaline is synthesized by brominating 3,5-dibenzyloxyacetophenone into 3,5-dibenzyloxybromoacetophenone, which is reacted with N-benzyl-N-tert-butylamine, giving a ketone intermediate.

A double-blind study of oral dehydroemetine in the treatment of amoebiasis performed at St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Medical College, Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1973-1974 showed dehydroemetine treatment was effective. A total of 60 patients were treated, 20 with dehydroemetine, 20 with Tiberal, and 20 with metronidazole. One-fourth of the patients treated with dehydroemetine reported adverse reactions, compared to 20% with other drugs, but no patient discontinued therapy due to the reaction. In all three cases, the drug therapy resulted in clearance of the infection, defined as negative results through an O&P exam, in all but 1-2 patients. A 1979 study of 27 patients treated with dehydroemetine and various other drugs suggested all drug combinations were successful at treating amoebic liver abscesses.

Nomifensine was considered an effective antidepressant that lacked sedative effects. It did not interact significantly with alcohol and lacked anticholinergic effects. No withdrawal symptoms were seen after 6 months treatment. The drug was, however, considered not suitable for agitated patients as it presumably made agitation worse. In January 1986 the drug was withdrawn by its manufacturers for safety reasons. Some case reports in the 1980s suggested that there was potential for psychological dependence on nomifensine, typically in patients with a history of stimulant addiction, or when the drug was used in very high doses (400–600 mg per day). In a 1989 study it was investigated for use in treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and was proven to be effective. In a 1977 study it was not proven of benefit in advanced parkinsonism, except for depression associated with the parkinsonism. == Medical uses == Nomifensine was investigated for use as an antidepressant in the 1970s, and was found to be a useful antidepressant at doses of 50–225 mg per day, both motivating and anxiolytic. == Adverse effects == During treatment with nomifensine there were relatively few adverse effects, mainly renal failure, paranoid symptoms, drowsiness or insomnia, headache, and dry mouth. Side effects affecting the cardiovascular system included tachycardia and palpitations, but nomifensine was significantly less cardiotoxic than the standard tricyclic antidepressants. === Withdrawal from market === Due to a risk of haemolytic anaemia, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval for nomifensine on March 20, 1992. Nomifensine was subsequently withdrawn from the Canadian and UK markets as well. Some deaths were linked to immunohaemolytic anemia caused by this compound, although the mechanism remained unclear. == Synthesis == Nomifensine was a progenitor to Gastrophenzine. See also: Isatin derivatives. The alkylation between N-methyl-2-nitrobenzylamine [56222-08-3] (1) and phenacyl bromide (2) gives CID:15326127 (3). Catalytic hydrogenation over Raney Nickel reduces the nitro group to give CID:15113381 (4). The reduction of the ketone group with sodium borohydride to alcohol gives [65514-97-8] (5). Acid catalysed ring closure completes the formation of nomifensine (6). == Research == === Motivational disorders === Nomifensine has been found to reverse tetrabenazine-induced motivational deficits in animals.

The molecule has no hydrogen donors, but three atoms that are hydrogen receptors. Three of the bonds are rotatable and there are no stereocenters. The molecule has two carbonyl carbons, which can act as electrophiles, as well as three α-hydrogens. Ethyl Pyruvate can also be synonymous with ethyl 2-oxopropanoate, Ethyl-2-oxopropanoat, Propanoic acid, 2-oxo-, ethyl ester, Pyruvic acid, and ethyl ester == Research and applications == Three independent studies of ethyl pyruvate were performed, with rats as their test subjects, and each produced an optimistic result. The first study showed that ethyl pyruvate has a protective role against phosgene-induced pulmonary edema. The second study showed the therapeutic effects of ethyl pyruvate against severe acute pancreatitis. This study concluded three things: First, ethyl pyruvate prevents the severe acute pancreatitis-induced hepatic expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Second, ethyl pyruvate protects the rats from severe acute pancreatitis-induced liver and pancreas damages. Third, ethyl pyruvate controls liver severe acute pancreatitis induced by NF-κB activation. The third study showed the effects of sodium pyruvate (SP) and ethyl pyruvate (EP) as treatments to brain injury. This experiment concluded that the pyruvate treatments proved beneficial neurologically post-cortical contusion injury (CCI). The effects of ethyl pyruvate as an antioxidant were compared to that of its sodium salt in a recent study. Ethyl pyruvate has a greater lipophilicity than sodium pyruvate, which allows it to be a more effective scavenger in the reaction. This study was done using a liver homogenate as the model for cell membrane transport deletion. Hypochlorous acid was used as the oxidant, and the focus of the study was on the capacity of the pyruvates to scavenge the reactive oxygen species. Ethyl pyruvate is a good antioxidant due to its α-ketocarboxylate structure, which allows it to reduce hydrogen peroxide to water and scavenge the hydroxyl radical through decarboxylation. Amino-2H-imidazoles are a new class of BACE-1 inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Amino-2H-imidazoles were introduced because current treatments of Alzheimer's disease only treat the symptoms, but do not correct the underlying neuropathology. Ethyl pyruvate is used as a reactant in the synthesis of many of these new BACE-1 inhibitors. Overall, ethyl pyruvate has been found to be beneficial in wound healing, liver disease, pancreatitis, and spinal cord repair. Relating to health, there are still many researchers using ethyl pyruvate in their projects pertaining to myocardial ischemia, reperfusion, and human gastric cancer. == Preparation and reactions == Ethyl pyruvate can be synthesized in a simple, one-step reaction from the oxidation of ethyl lactate. Since ethyl lactate is slightly cheaper to buy than ethyl pyruvate, this synthesis can be useful. There are many different reagents that can be used to push the reaction forward to yield in excess of 98%, such as using potassium permanganate and aluminum sulfate hydrate in dichloromethane solvent. Ethyl pyruvate can undergo reduction (chemistry) as well. For example, when reduced by sodium borohydride the ketone gets reduced to an alcohol, leaving the ester group untouched. But, when ethyl pyruvate is reduced by lithium aluminium hydride, both the ketone and ester get completely reduced to alcohols. Enantioselective reactions are extremely important in chemistry, as the formation of optically pure products is especially useful in the food, pharmaceutical, and agrochemical industries. An important enantioselective reaction in modern chemistry involves the hydrogenation of α-ketoesters, including ethyl pyruvate. These reactions produce α-hydroxiesters, which are chiral compounds that can be further modified to synthesize important biologically active compounds. In the hydrogenation of ethyl pyruvate, Pt/SiO2 catalysts were modified with a chiral agent, cinchonidine. Without the addition of tin, the enantioselectivity was largely dependent on the size of the particles - larger particles dictated higher enantioselective success. With the promotion of small amounts of tin, the hydrogenation rate and the enantioselective success both increased. However, a critical amount was reached, where additional tin decreased the hydrogenation rate along with the enantioselective success of the reaction. == References ==",Ethyl pyruvate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3155283033847809)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.49291670322418213), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), (',', -0.10032067447900772), ('ĠINDU', -0.03690752014517784), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062078312039375305)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01419064961373806)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.ingredientreviewer.com/ingredient/617-35-6/,https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB3198366.htm ', [])"

It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Ibrutinib is indicated for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). == Adverse effects == Very common (>10% frequency) adverse effects include pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, skin infection, low neutrophil count, low platelet counts, headache, bleeding, bruising, diarrhea, vomiting, inflammation of mouth and lips, nausea, constipation, rash, joint pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, fever, and edema. Common (1–10% frequency) adverse effects include sepsis, urinary tract infection, non-melanoma skin cancer (basal-cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma), low leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count, interstitial lung disease, tumor lysis syndrome, high uric acid levels, dizziness, blurred vision, atrial fibrillation, subdural hematoma, nosebleeds, small bruises from broken blood vessels, high blood pressure, hives, and skin redness or blushing. == Pharmacology == Ibrutinib oral bioavailability is 3.9% in a fasting state, 8.4% in a fed state, and 15.9% after consumption of grapefruit juice. === Mechanism === Ibrutinib is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The acrylamide group of ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with the cysteine residue C481 in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is an important signalling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) pathway, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of several B-cell malignancies including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Preclinical studies have shown that ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro. In early clinical studies, the activity of ibrutinib has been described to include a rapid reduction in lymphadenopathy accompanied by a transient lymphocytosis, suggesting that the drug might have direct effects on cell homing or migration to factors in tissue microenvironments. In preclinical studies on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, ibrutinib has been reported to promote apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and also prevent CLL cells from responding to survival stimuli provided by the microenvironment. This also leads to a reduction of MCL1 levels (anti-apoptotic protein) in malignant B cells. Treatment of activated CLL cells with ibrutinib resulted in inhibition of BTK tyrosine phosphorylation and also effectively abrogated downstream survival pathways activated by this kinase including ERK1/2, PI3K, and NF-κB. Additionally, ibrutinib inhibited proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, effectively blocking survival signals provided externally to CLL cells from the microenvironment including soluble factors (BAFF, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF-α), fibronectin engagement and stromal cell contact. Ibrutinib has also been reported to reduce chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell chemotaxis towards the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13, and inhibit cellular adhesion following stimulation at the B-cell receptor (BCR). Additionally, ibrutinib down-modulates the expression of CD20 (target of rituximab/ofatumumab) by targeting the CXCR4/SDF1 axis. Together, these data are consistent with a mechanistic model whereby ibrutinib blocks BCR signaling, which drives cells into apoptosis and/or disrupts cell migration and adherence to protective tumour microenvironments. == History == Ibrutinib was created by scientists at Celera Genomics as a tool compound for studying BTK function; it covalently binds its target which is ideal for a reagent but generally not considered ideal for drugs. In 2006, in the course of acquiring an HDAC-focused program from Celera after its own initial discovery program had failed, Pharmacyclics also picked up Celera's small molecule BTK inhibitor discovery program for $2M in cash and $1M in stock and named the tool compound PCI-32765. In 2011 after the drug had completed Phase II trials, Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics agreed to co-develop the drug, and J&J paid Pharmacyclics $150 million upfront and $825 million in milestones. Pharmacyclics was acquired by AbbVie in May 2015, and Abbvie projected global sales of US$1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2013, for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. In February 2014, the FDA expanded the approved use of ibrutinib to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It was approved for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia in 2015. In March 2015, Pharmacyclics and AbbVie agreed that Abbvie would acquire Pharmacyclics for $21 billion; the deal was completed that May. In March 2016, a new indication for ibrutinib was approved in the United States for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In May 2016, a new indication for ibrutinib was approved in the United States for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In January 2017, a new indication for ibrutinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. In August 2017, the FDA approved a new indication for ibrutinib to treat graft-versus-host disease. It was the first drug approved by the FDA for this condition. In February 2018, a tablet formulation of ibrutinib was approved for use in the United States. In August 2018, ibrutinib in combination with rituximab was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare and incurable type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In January 2019, ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab was approved for the treatment of adults with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). In April 2020, the FDA expanded the indication of ibrutinib to include its combination with rituximab for the initial treatment of adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Approval was based on the E1912 trial (NCT02048813), a 2:1 randomized, multicenter, open-label, actively controlled trial of ibrutinib with rituximab compared to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in 529 adult subjects 70 years or younger with previously untreated CLL or SLL requiring systemic therapy. == Society and culture == === Economics === Janssen Pharmaceutica and Pharmacyclics introduced a new single dose tablet formulation with a flat pricing structure in the first half of 2018 and discontinued the capsule formulation. This caused an outcry as it was perceived to triple the cost of the drug to the average patient. Janssen Pharmaceutica and Pharmacyclics have since reversed the decision to discontinue the capsule formulation with the drug currently available in both capsule and tablet forms. Ibrutinib was added to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 2018. Generic ibrutinib was added to the Indian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 2020. Imbruvica was named in 2023 as one of the first 10 drugs to be subjected to Medicare price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Ibrutinib, National Cancer Institute Drug Dictionary",Ibrutinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.115249561844394e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00035589560866355896)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrutinib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Ibrutinib', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrutinib?utm_source=openai')])"
