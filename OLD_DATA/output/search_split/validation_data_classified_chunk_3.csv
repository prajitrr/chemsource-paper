It is an inhibitor of the B-Raf enzyme and was developed by Plexxikon. == Mechanism of action == Vemurafenib causes programmed cell death in melanoma cell lines. Vemurafenib interrupts the B-Raf/MEK step on the B-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway − if the B-Raf has the common V600E mutation. Vemurafenib only works in melanoma patients whose cancer has a V600E BRAF mutation (that is, at amino acid position number 600 on the B-Raf protein, the normal valine is replaced by glutamic acid). About 60% of melanomas have this mutation. It also has efficacy against the rarer V600K BRAF (the normal valine is replaced by lysine) mutation. Melanoma cells without these mutations are not inhibited by vemurafenib; the drug paradoxically stimulates normal BRAF and may promote tumor growth in such cases. === Resistance === Three mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib (covering 40% of cases) have been discovered: Cancer cells begin to overexpress cell surface protein PDGFRB, creating an alternative survival pathway. A second oncogene called NRAS mutates, reactivating the normal BRAF survival pathway. Stromal cell secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). === Side effects === At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 960 mg twice a day 31% of patients get skin lesions that may need surgical removal. The BRIM-2 trial investigated 132 patients; the most common adverse events were arthralgia in 58% of patients, skin rash in 52%, and photosensitivity in 52%. In order to better manage side effects some form of dose modification was necessary in 45% of patients. The median daily dose was 1750 mg, 91% of the MTD. == History == In a phase I clinical study, vemurafenib (then known as PLX4032) was able to reduce numbers of cancer cells in over half of a group of 16 patients with advanced melanoma. The treated group had a median increased survival time of 6 months over the control group. A second phase I study, in patients with a V600E mutation in B-Raf, ~80% showed partial to complete regression. The regression lasted from 2 to 18 months. In early 2010 a Phase I trial for solid tumors (including colorectal cancer), and a phase II study (for metastatic melanoma) were ongoing. A phase III trial (vs dacarbazine) in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma showed an improved rates of overall and progression-free survival. In June 2011, positive results were reported from the phase III BRIM3 BRAF-mutation melanoma study. The BRIM3 trial reported good updated results in 2012. Further trials are planned including a trial of vemurafenib co-administered with GDC-0973 (cobimetinib), a MEK-inhibitor. After good results in 2014, the combination was submitted to the European Medical Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval. In January 2015, trial results compared vemurafenib with the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for metastatic melanoma. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Vemurafenib was approved in the United States for the treatment of late-stage melanoma in August 2011, making it the first drug designed using fragment-based lead discovery to gain regulatory approval. Vemurafenib was approved for use in Canada in February 2012. In February 2012, the European Commission approved vemurafenib as a monotherapy for the treatment of adults with BRAF V600E mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. In November 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vemurafenib for the treatment of people with Erdheim–Chester disease (ECD), a rare type of histiocytic neoplasm. == Research == A trial combining vemurafenib and ipilimumab was stopped in April 2013 because of signs of liver toxicity. == Treating Hairy Cell Leukemia == In 2012, a grant from the Hairy cell leukemia Foundation supported the discovery of the BRAF mutation in classic HCL. This discovery charted a new path forward for many patients. It improved diagnosis and opened the door for additional therapies to be used in managing HCL. In a phase II clinical trial, Memorial Sloan Kettering is testing Vemurafenib, plus Obinutuzumab, in patients with previously untreated classical hairy cell leukemia. A separate clinical study treatment with only Vemurafenib (or monotherarpy) demonstrated high response rates in relapsed/refractory (R/R) hairy cell leukemia (HCL), achieving an overall response rate of 86%, including 33% complete response (CR) and 53% partial response. However, after a median follow-up of 40 months, 21 of 31 responders (68%) experienced relapse with a median relapse-free survival (RFS) of 19 months (range, 12.5-53.9 months). == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017).

303,"('Lomustine', 'Belustine', 'Ceenu', 'Cecenu', 'Chloroethylcyclohexylnitrosourea')",Medical,"Lomustine (INN; abbreviated as CCNU; original brand name CeeNU, now marketed as Gleostine) is an alkylating nitrosourea compound used in chemotherapy. It is closely related to semustine and is in the same family as streptozotocin. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug, thus it crosses the blood–brain barrier. This property makes it ideal for treating brain tumors, which is its primary use, although it is also used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma as a second-line option. It has also been used in veterinary practice as a treatment for cancers in cats and dogs. Lomustine is a bifunctional alkylating agent, alkylates both DNA and RNA, has the ability to created interstrand cross-links (ICLs) in DNA. As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins. Lomustine is cell-cycle nonspecific. == Medical uses == === Chemotherapy in human medicine === Lomustine is an alkylating chemotherapy drug that is indicated by the FDA for the treatment of patients with brain tumors (primary and metastatic), following any necessary surgery and radiation, as well as for treatment of progressive Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Lomustine is approved for the treatment of brain tumors, breast cancer, lung cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and melanoma by Health Canada. Lomustine is also used as an anti-cancer drug in several European countries, including the United Kingdom. ==== Pregnant patients ==== While current data is only based on animal studies, there is reason to believe that lomustine use during pregnancy can cause harm to a fetus, potentially leading to miscarriages or birth defects. Patients are advised not to take lomustine while pregnant. Patients hoping to conceive should be aware that lumostine may have the capacity to reduce fertility. Patients are advised to use birth control with partners while taking lomustine due to the potential for fetal harm. ==== Breastfeeding patients ==== No research currently exists on the effects of lomustine and its metabolites on breastfed infants. However, patients on Lomustine are advised not to breastfeed during the course of treatment due to the potential for serious adverse reactions to the drug. ==== Pediatric patients ==== There is insufficient clinical data surrounding the use of lomustine in pediatric populations. Current protocols use the same dosing and treatment protocols for pediatric patents as adult patients. ==== Geriatric patients ==== While there are no clinical studies on lomustine use in the 65+ age group, clinicians are recommended to exercise caution in prescribing this drug to geriatric patients. Lomustine causes high levels of organ toxicity, which must be taken into account when determining dosing for elderly patients. === Chemotherapy in veterinary medicine === Lomustine is used as an ""off-label"" veterinary treatment for cancers in cats and dogs. Clinical trials have demonstrated the drug's success in treating progressive lymphomas, mast cell tumors, and brain cancers. The chemotherapy has also been used to treat sarcomas and spinal cord tumors in these animals. Lomustine may be administered orally or by injection in cats and dogs. This chemotherapy has been observed to have a variety of side effects in animals, paralleling those in humans, including but not limited to bone marrow immunosuppression, gastrointestinal issues, and hepatotoxicity. === Administration === Lomustine is available in 5 mg (yellow capsule), 10 mg (white capsule), 40 mg (white & green capsule), and 100 mg (green capsule) gel capsules, referred to as Gleostine. Lomustine dosing is calculated based on body surface area. One dose of the drug is administered orally every 6 weeks, generally at a dosage of 130 mg/m2 for all patients. The dose may be lowered based on the patients blood counts and immune strength, but is still administered every 6 weeks. Lomustine must be taken on an empty stomach of at least two hours. Lomustine is highly toxic; as such, only one dose is dispensed at a time in order to lower overdose risk. Due to the cytotoxic nature of lomustine, the drug must be dosed, administered, and disposed of with special precautions including wearing gloves to prevent dermal exposure. == Side Effects == Lumostine causes a variety of side effects including gastrointestinal, ocular, neurologic, and other disorders. Certain side effects from lumostine require immediate medical attention. These commonly include, but are not limited to, bleeding gums, chest pain, shortness of breath, sores or white spots in the mouth, fever, edema of the legs, abnormal bleeding or bruising, tar-like stools, blood in the urine or stool, and extreme fatigue. Other side effects that may occur as the body adjusts to this drug do not require medical attention. These include, but are not limited to, hair loss, inflammation of the mouth, trouble with speaking, blurred vision, and shakiness. == Safety == === Toxicities === Lomustine use is linked to a variety of organ toxicities hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity. Hepatotoxicity occurs due to increased levels of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin with lumostine use. Liver enzymes and function should be monitored during use and dose should be adjusted based on toxicity levels. Lomustine causes progressive kidney shrinkage and failure with long-term use. Renal enzymes and function should be monitored during use and dose should be adjusted based on toxicity levels. Lomustine can cause or worsen pulmonary infiltrates and fibrosis in patients. Pulmonary toxicity generally occurs after at least 6 months of treatment with lumostine. Lung function should be monitored via Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) or Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLCO) tests to determine patients risk of developing pulmonary toxicities. Patients who develop pulmonary fibrosis should discontinue treatment immediately. === Secondary malignancies === Long term use of lomustine is linked to secondary malignancies including acute leukemia and myelodysplasia, due to the drug's DNA alkylating properties. === Delayed myelosupression === Lomustine causes myelosupression in a delayed, dose-dependent, and cumulative fashion. This delayed decrease in bone marrow activity generally occurs in the 4-6 week window after the drug's administration. Patients are expected to show thrombocytopenia and leukopenia during this period. Patients' complete blood counts should be consistently monitored during treatment in order to mitigate the myelosupressive risks of the drug and prevent fatal complications such as infections and internal bleeding. === Overdose risk === Fatal toxicity may occur with overdosage of Lomustine. Overdoses may lead to heightened myelosupression, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, extreme fatigue, dizziness, liver failure, and shortness of breath. No antidotes for this drug currently exist. Non-fatal overdose management includes hospitalization and antibiotic treatment to address myelosuppressive effects of lomustine. Only one dose of the drug is dispensed at a time to lower overdose risk. === Drug interactions === There are 407 FDA-approved drugs which may interact with lomustine. Many of these interactions are due to severe side-effects of this chemotherapy, which are incompatible other drugs' known side effects. Lomustine is contraindicated in the administration of most live vaccines during treatment, due to infection risk. Receiving these vaccines during the course of lomustine is highly discouraged due to the immunosuppression caused by this chemotherapy. == Manufacturing == Lomustine is manufactured by using continuous flow manufacturing. It requires two flow reactors, with an intermediate purification to change reaction solvents. The first step in the synthesis of Lomustine is a fast reaction at room temperature. The reaction is the carbamylation of cyclohexylamine (1) by 1-chloro-2-isocyanatoethane (2) in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) to form the 1-(2- chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexylurea (3)intermediate (Diab et al.). This reaction involves the interaction between the lone pair on the nitrogen of cyclohexylamine (1) and the nitrosyl carbon center on 1-chloro-2-isocyanatoethane (2). This results in a tetrahedral intermediate, in which a proton from the nitrogen of cyclohexylamine (1) is transferred to the nitrogen of 1-chloro-2-isocyanatoethane (2). The second step in the synthesis is the nitrosation of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexylurea (3) by tert-butyl nitrite (TBN) (4) in aqueous solution. The reaction involves the radical homolytic bond breaking of tert-butyl nitrates into a tert-butoxide radical and a nitrosyl radical. The tert-butoxide radical then reacts with the nitrogen-hydrogen bond on the chlorine side of the carbonyl group of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexylurea (3) to form tert-butanol and a 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexylurea radical, which reacts with the nitrosyl in a termination step to form lomustine (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Cell-cycle specific chemotherapy drugs only affect cells when they are dividing, whereas cell-cycle non-specific drugs affect cells when they are at rest. Lomustine is a cell cycle non-specific, highly lipophilic alkylating agent which produces chloroethyl carbenium ions and carbamylating intermediates in vivo. These products are electrophilic, and they attack nucleophilic sites on DNA and RNA to form alkylated products. Unlike other anticancer agents like mitomycin C, streptonigrin, bleomycin, and the anthracyclines, lomustine does not require bioactivation to react with cellular targets. Lomustine is a chloroethlyating compound and it causes alkylation and cross-linking of RNA and DNA at the O6 position of guanine-containing bases. If the DNA and RNA is not repaired, this cross-linking causes breakage during replication and eventually causes cell death via apoptosis. Lomustine also has other biologic effects including inhibition of DNA synthesis and some cell phase specificity. In general, nitrosureas lack cross-resistance with other alkylating agents. Since lomustine is a nitrosurea, it inhibits several processes such as carbomylation and the modification of cellular proteins. Lomustin also affects a variety of cellular events including ribosomal and nucleoplastic messenger RNA processing, DNA base structure, and DNA polymerase activity. However, the clinical application of lomustine is restricted due to dose-related toxicities such as hematologic and pulmonary toxicity. Lomustine is also a lipid soluble, which allows it to permeate the blood brain barrier well. This quality made it a reasonable candidate for the chemotherapy of intrinsic brain tumors. Lomustine is administered orally in six-to-eight-week intervals and with nadirs at five weeks after administration due to its delayed myelosuppressive properties. == History == === FDA approval === Lomustine was approved by the FDA to treat high-grade gliomas in 1976. Lomustine, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, was the standard of care following surgery and/or radiation up until the early twenty-first century. In the United States, lomustine is currently approved for recurrent high-grade gliomas. It is also approved for treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with other chemotherapies, following disease progression with initial chemotherapy. It is the standard of care for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme in Europe, and it is frequently used as a control arm in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme trials. == Society and culture == === Pricing controversies === Lomustine was manufactured in limited supply by Bristol-Myers Squibb prior to 2013. This resulted in a short supply of a key chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of brain cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In 2013, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued production of lomustine. NextSource Biotechnology took over as the sole distributor of lomustine in the United States. NextSource recognized the medical importance of lomustine, so they acquired the manufacturing rights from Bristol-Myers-Squibb in partnership with Corden Pharma. They relaunched the product under the name of Gleostine the next year. NextSource Pharmaceuticals decided to withdraw lomustine from Medicare at the beginning of 2021. This was the first time in history that a company with a drug eligible for coverage under the Medicare Part D benefit made the decision to leave the program. In July 2021, the list price for the highest dose of lomustine was 1900% higher than it was in 2013, when it was being manufactured and sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Since there were no approved generic alternatives to lomustine, patients were forced to absorb the price increases. The average age of people diagnosed with glioblastoma is 65, which included many Medicare patients who have Part D coverage. Under Part D coverage, patients are responsible for up to 25% of the price of a brand-name drug. Because lomustine is used as a control arm for many clinical trials, the denied insurance coverage and skyrocketing cost caused some trials to face difficulty enrolling and maintaining patients. In December 2021, the Glioblastom Foundation announced a new partnership with Continuity Pharma to manufacture a generic form of lomustine. The agreement allowed the drug to be manufactured in the United States, which made it more accessible to patients and lowered the cost of brain cancer treatment by approximately 90%. The manufacturing agreement also resulted in lomustine once again being included in the Medicare federal drug discount program. Continuity Pharma was able to develop the generic form of lomustine due to the technology of continuous flow manufacturing. Continuity Pharma provides the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for lomustine to the Glioblastoma Foundation. Pending FDA approval, the foundation will oversee the manufacturing and distribution of the drug to patients across the United States. == Research == === Clinical trials === Lomustine has been part of eighty-eight clinical trials. Twenty five trials are currently active, thirty eight have been completed, eleven have been terminated, four have been withdrawn, and the status of ten trials is unknown. Of the currently active trials, nine of them are in stage three, twelve are in stage two, and four are in stage one. The conditions that the active trials are researching include Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Untreated Childhood Medulloblastoma, High Grade Glioma: Glioblastoma, Brain Neoplasm, Central Nervous System Neoplasm, High Grade Glioma: Gliosarcoma, Medulloblastomas, Oligodendroglioma, Acute T Cell Leukemia Lymphoma, Bone Cancer, Breast Neoplasms, Colorectal Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Malignancies Multiple, Metastatic Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Refractory Cancer, Renal Cancer, Resistant Cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas, Ependymoma, Recurrent Brain Tumors, and MGMT Methylated Glioblastoma. == References == == External links == Lomustine at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Diseases Database (DDB): 29525",Cecenu,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.142934868577868e-05), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014169560745358467)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

305,"('Levofloxacin', 'Ofloxacin', 'Levaquin', 'Quixin', 'Cravit')",Medical,"Levofloxacin, sold under the brand name Levaquin among others, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It is the left-handed isomer of the medication ofloxacin. It is used to treat a number of bacterial infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, H. pylori (in combination with other medications), urinary tract infections, Legionnaires' disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it may be used to treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. A warning concerning all fluoroquinolones was issued in 2016: ""An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system."" Other serious side effects may include tendon rupture, tendon inflammation, seizures, psychosis, and potentially permanent peripheral nerve damage. Tendon damage may appear months after treatment is completed. People may also sunburn more easily. In people with myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness and breathing problems may worsen. While use during pregnancy is not recommended, risk appears to be low. The use of other medications in this class appear to be safe while breastfeeding; however, the safety of levofloxacin is unclear. Levofloxacin was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 251st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Levofloxacin is used to treat infections including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form. As of 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that ""serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs generally outweigh the benefits for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who have other treatment options. For patients with these conditions, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who do not have alternative treatment options."" Levofloxacin is used for the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections. As of 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society recommended levofloxacin and other respiratory fluoroquinolines as first line treatment for community acquired pneumonia when co-morbidities such as heart, lung, or liver disease are present or when in-patient treatment is required. Levofloxacin also plays an important role in recommended treatment regimens for ventilator-associated and healthcare-associated pneumonia. As of 2010 it was recommended by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with rifampicin as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections. The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial prostatitis when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it was recommended to treat bacterial prostatitis by the NIH research network studying the condition. Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones have also been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections, indications for which major medical societies generally recommend the use of older, narrower spectrum drugs to avoid fluoroquinolone resistance development. Due to its widespread use, common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have developed resistance. In many countries as of 2013, resistance rates among healthcare-associated infections with these pathogens exceeded 20%. Levofloxacin is also used as antibiotic eye drops to prevent bacterial infection. Usage of levofloxacin eye drops, along with an antibiotic injection of cefuroxime or penicillin during cataract surgery, has been found to lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or injections alone. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === According to the FDA approved prescribing information, levofloxacin is pregnancy category C. This designation indicates that animal reproduction studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but the potential benefit to the mother may in some cases outweigh the risk to the fetus. Available data point to a low risk for the unborn child. Exposure to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. Levofloxacin does penetrate into breastmilk, though the concentration of levofloxacin in the breastfeeding infant is expected to be low. Due to potential risks to the baby, the manufacturer does not recommend that nursing mothers take levofloxacin. However, the risk appears to be very low, and levofloxacin can be used in breastfeeding mothers with proper monitoring of the infant, combined with delaying breastfeeding for 4–6 hours after taking levofloxacin. === Children === Levofloxacin is not approved in most countries for the treatment of children except in unique and life-threatening infections because it is associated with an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injury in this population, a property it shares with other fluoroquinolones. In the United States levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of anthrax and plague in children over six months of age. Levofloxacin is recommended by the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first-line treatment for pediatric pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and as a second-line agent for the treatment of penicillin-sensitive cases. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months post-treatment. At 12 months follow-up the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, approximately two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae. === Spectrum of activity === Levofloxacin and later generation fluoroquinolones are collectively referred to as ""respiratory quinolones"" to distinguish them from earlier fluoroquinolones which exhibited modest activity toward the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug exhibits enhanced activity against the important respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae relative to earlier fluoroquinolone derivatives like ciprofloxacin. For this reason, it is considered a ""respiratory fluoroquinolone"" along with more recently developed fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. It is less active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lacks the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. Levofloxacin has shown moderate activity against anaerobes, and is about twice as potent as ofloxacin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium avium complex. Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Gram positive (methicillin-sensitive but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes), and atypical bacterial pathogens (Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Compared to earlier antibiotics of the fluoroquinoline class such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin exhibits greater activity towards Gram-positive bacteria but lesser activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. === Resistance === Resistance to fluoroquinolones is common in staphylococcus and pseudomonas. Resistance occurs in multiple ways. One mechanism is by an alteration in topoisomerase IV enzyme. A double mutant form of S. pneumoniae Gyr A + Par C bearing Ser-81-->Phe and Ser-79-->Phe mutations were eight to sixteen times less responsive to ciprofloxacin. == Contraindications and interactions == Package inserts mention that levofloxacin is to be avoided in patients with a known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin or other quinolone drugs. Like all fluoroquinolines, levofloxacin is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders, and in patients who have a history of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Levofloxacin may prolong the QT interval in some people, especially the elderly, and levofloxacin should not be used for people with a family history of Long QT syndrome, or who have long QT, chronic low potassium, it should not be prescribed with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Unlike ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin does not appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with high dose fluoroquinolone therapy may lead to seizures. When levofloxacin is taken with anti-acids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts that are difficult to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is taken with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc. A 2011 review examining musculoskeletal complications of fluoroquinolones proposed guidelines with respect to administration to athletes, that called for avoiding all use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if possible, and if they are used: ensure there is informed consent about the musculoskeletal risks, and inform coaching staff; do not use any corticosteroids if fluoroquinolones are used; consider dietary supplements of magnesium and antioxidants during treatment; reduce training until the course of antibiotic is finished and then carefully increase back to normal; and monitor for six months after the course is finished, and stop all athletic activity if symptoms emerge. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are typically mild to moderate. However, severe, disabling, and potentially irreversible adverse effects sometimes occur, and for this reason it is recommended that use of fluoroquinolones be limited. Prominent among these are adverse effects that became the subject of a black box warning by the FDA in 2016. The FDA wrote: ""An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system."" Rarely, tendinitis or tendon rupture may occur due to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including levofloxacin. Such injuries, including tendon rupture, has been observed up to six months after cessation of treatment; higher doses of fluoroquinolones, being elderly, transplant patients, and those with a current or historical corticosteroid use are at elevated risk. The U.S. label for levofloxacin also contains a black box warning for the exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disease myasthenia gravis. Similarly, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommendations warn of rare but disabling and potentially irreversible adverse effects, and to recommend limiting use of these drugs. Increasing age and corticosteroid use appears to increase the risk of musculoskeletal complications. A wide variety of other uncommon but serious adverse events have been associated with fluoroquinolone use, with varying degrees of evidence supporting causation. These include anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, central nervous system effects including seizures and psychiatric effects, prolongation of the QT interval, blood glucose disturbances, and photosensitivity, among others. Levofloxacin may produce fewer of these rare serious adverse effects than other fluoroquinolones. There is some disagreement in the medical literature regarding whether and to what extent levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs. Concerning more usual adverse effects, in pooled results from 7537 patients exposed to levofloxacin in 29 clinical trials, 4.3% discontinued treatment due to adverse drug reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Overall, 7% of patients experienced nausea, 6% headache, 5% diarrhea, and 4% insomnia, along with other adverse reactions experienced at lower rates. Administration of levofloxacin or other broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridioides strain. More research is needed to determine the best dose and length of treatment. == Overdose == Overdosing experiments in animals showed loss of body control and drooping, difficulty breathing, tremors, and convulsions. Doses in excess of 1500 mg/kg orally and 250 mg/kg IV produced significant mortality in rodents. In the event of an acute overdosage, authorities recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases. Topoisomerase IV is necessary to separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, so that it will fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide. As of 2011, the mechanism of action for the drug's musculoskeletal complications were not clear. === Pharmacokinetics === Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with a plasma concentration profile over time that is essentially identical to that obtained from intravenous administration of the same amount over 60 minutes. As such, the intravenous and oral formulations of levofloxacin are considered interchangeable. Levofloxacin's ability to bind to proteins in the body ranges from 24 to 38%. The drug undergoes widespread distribution into body tissues. Peak levels in skin are achieved 3 hours after administration and exceed those in plasma by a factor of 2. Similarly, lung tissue concentrations range from two-fold to five-fold higher than plasma concentrations in the 24 hours after a single dose. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. Elimination occurs mainly via excretion of unmetabolized drug in the urine. Following oral administration, 87% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug within 2 days. Less than 5% was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, the only metabolites identified in humans. == Chemistry == Like all fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin is a fluorinated quinolone carboxylic acid. It is a chiral molecule and the pure (−)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug ofloxacin. This enantiomer binds more effectively to the DNA gyrase enzyme and to topoisomerase IV than its (+)-(R)-counterpart. Levofloxacin is referred to as a chiral switch: These are chiral drugs that have already been patent claimed, approved and marketed as racemates (or as mixtures of diastereomers but have since been redeveloped as pure enantiomers. Distinct functional groups on this molecules include a hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, and an aromatic ring. The substance is used as the hemihydrate, which has the empirical formula C18H20FN3O4 · 1⁄2 H2O and a molecular mass of 370.38 g/mol. Levofloxacin is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. A major issue in the synthesis of levofloxacin is identifying correct entries into the benzoxazine core in order to produce the correct chiral form. == History == Levofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone, being one of the isomers of ofloxacin, which was a broader-spectrum conformationally locked analog of norfloxacin; both ofloxacin and levofloxaxin were synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. The Daiichi scientists knew that ofloxacin was racemic, but tried unsuccessfully to separate the two isomers; in 1985 they succeeded in separately synthesizing the pure levo form and showed that it was less toxic and more potent than the other form. It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1993, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Cravit. Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson as it had with ofloxacin, obtained FDA approval in 1996 under the brand name Levaquin to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis. == Society and culture == === Economics === Levofloxacin had reached blockbuster status by this time; combined worldwide sales of levofloxacin and ofloxacin for J&J alone were US$1.6 billion in 2009. The term of the levofloxacin United States patent was extended by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 810 days under the provisions of the Hatch Waxman Amendment so that the patent would expire in 2010 instead of 2008. This extension was challenged by generic drug manufacturer Lupin Pharmaceuticals, which did not challenge the validity of the patent, but only the validity of the patent extension, arguing that the patent did not cover a ""product"" and so Hatch-Waxman was not available for extensions. The federal patent court ruled in favor of J&J and Daiichi, and generic versions of levofloxacin did not enter the U.S. market until 2009. === Availability === Levofloxacin is available in tablet form, injection,patches and oral solution. === Usage === The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that in 2011, over 23 million outpatient prescriptions for fluoroquinolones, of which levofloxacin made up 28%, were filled in the United States. === Litigation === As of 2012, Johnson and Johnson was facing around 3400 state and federal lawsuits filed by people who claimed tendon damage from levofloxacin; about 1900 pending in a class action at the United States District Court in Minnesota and about 1500 pending at a district court in New Jersey. In October 2012, J&J settled 845 cases in the Minnesota action, after Johnson and Johnson prevailed in three of the first four cases to go to trial. By May 2014, all but 363 cases had been settled or adjudicated. === Brand names === Levofloxacin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under a license agreement signed with Daiichi in 1993, under the brand name Tavanic. == References ==",Cravit,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03109816648066044), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018335960805416107)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cravit?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='CRAVIT - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cravit?utm_source=openai')])"
306,"('Ofloxacin', 'Hoe-280', 'Floxin', 'Tarivid', 'Ofloxacine')",Medical,"Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present. When taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA. Ofloxacin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ofloxacin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 206th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ofloxacin is used in the treatment of bacterial infections such as: Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Community-acquired pneumonia Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis Epididymitis Mixed Infections of the urethra and cervix Acute pelvic inflammatory disease Uncomplicated cystitis Complicated urinary tract infections Prostatitis Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea Ofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Fluoroquinolones, the class of drug ofloxacin belongs to, were the drug of choice for treating gonorrhea in the 1980s; However, due to the development of fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, fluoroquinolones were no longer used to treat gonorrhea by the late 1990s. As of 2004, the failure of single dose ofloxacin to treat gonorrhea has been reported in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. === Susceptible bacteria === According to the product package insert, ofloxacin is effective against these microorganisms: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter koseri (Citrobacter diversus) Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Other microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis == Adverse effects == In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. On occasion, serious adverse effects occur. Common side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia. The overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients. The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Tendon damage may manifest during and up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed. Fluoroquinolones prolong the QT interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice, this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval. Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk similar to or less than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain. The US prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. Other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis Other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation. Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. Susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use. Ofloxacin, like some other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes, and thereby increase blood levels of other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophylline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels may result in a greater risk of side effects. Careful monitoring of serum glucose is advised when ofloxacin or other fluorquinolones are used by people who are taking sulfonylurea antidiabetes drugs. The concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a quinolone, including ofloxacin, may increase the risk of central nervous system stimulation and convulsive seizures. The fluoroquinolones have been shown to increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol, anisindione, and dicumarol. Additionally, the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias is increased when co-administered with drugs such as dihydroquinidine barbiturate, quinidine, and quinidine barbiturate. Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones. == Contraindications == As noted above, under licensed use, ofloxacin is now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance. Caution should be used in people with liver disease. The excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites). Ofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. === Pregnancy === Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day (four times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (five times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. === Children === Oral and intravenous ofloxacin are not licensed for use in children, except as noted above, due to the risk of musculoskeletal injury. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months after treatment. At 12 months' follow-up, the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, about two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these adverse events were thought to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the levofloxacin. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period. == Overdose == Limited information is available on overdose with ofloxacin. Advice for the management of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as kidney failure and seizure. Both seizures and severe psychiatric reactions have, however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage. == Pharmacokinetics == The bioavailability of ofloxacin in the tablet form is roughly 98% following oral administration, reaching maximum serum concentrations within one to two hours. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Therefore, elimination is mainly by renal excretion. However, 4-8% of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This would indicate a small degree of biliary excretion, as well. Plasma elimination half-life is around 4 to 5 hours in patients and 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients. Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which consists of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin. ""After multiple-dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 and 3.6 μg/ml, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. In vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound. Floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. Ofloxacin has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. Pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces."" A number of the endogenous compounds have been reported to be affected by ofloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters, and depletors. See the latest package insert for ofloxacin for additional details. == Mode of action == Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting two bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division. == History == Ofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of norfloxacin, and was synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1985, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Tarvid. Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson, obtained FDA approval in December 1990, under the brand name Floxin, labelled for use in adults with lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases. By 1991, it was also marketed as Tarvid by Hoechst in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and Portugal; as Oflocet in France, Portugal, Tunisia, and several African countries by Roussel-Uclaf, as Oflocin by Glaxo in Italy, and as Flobacin by Sigma-Tau in Italy. The market for ofloxacin was seen as difficult from its launch; it was approved as a ""1C"" drug, a new molecular entity with little or no therapeutic gain over existing therapies, and ciprofloxacin, which had a broader spectrum, was already on the market. By 1992, an intravenous solution was approved for marketing, In 1997, an indication for pelvic inflammatory disease was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the oral formulation, and in the same year, a solution for ear infections was approved under the brand Daiichi and J&J also cannibalized its own market by introducing levofloxacin, the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin, in 1996; Johnson and Johnson's annual sales of Floxin in 2003 was about $30 million, whereas their combined sales of Levaquin/Floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. Johnson & Johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Ofloxacin for systemic use is available in multiple strengths as a tablet, an oral suspension, and an injectable solution. It is also used as eye drops and ear drops and is available in combination with ornidazole. === Antibiotic use and bacterial resistance === Resistance to ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes now exhibit resistance worldwide. Floxacin and other fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection. == References ==",Tarivid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017498392844572663), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005607224884442985)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
307,"('Maraviroc', 'Selzentry', 'Celsentri', 'Uk 427857', 'Celsentri(tm)')",Medical,"Maraviroc, sold under the brand names Selzentry (US) and Celsentri (EU), is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection. It is taken by mouth. It is in the CCR5 receptor antagonist class. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2007, and in the European Union in September 2007. == Medical uses == Maraviroc is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medications, for the treatment of only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. == Side effects == Maraviroc can cause serious, life-threatening side effects. These include liver problems, skin reactions, and allergic reactions. An allergic reaction may happen before liver problems occur. Official labeling of Selzentry has black box warning for hepatotoxicity. The MOTIVATE trials showed no clinically relevant differences in safety between the maraviroc and placebo groups. == Mechanism of action == Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor. Specifically, maraviroc is a negative allosteric modulator of the CCR5 receptor, which is found on the surface of certain human cells. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an essential co-receptor for most HIV strains and necessary for the entry process of the virus into the host cell. The drug binds to CCR5, thereby blocking the HIV protein gp120 from associating with the receptor. HIV is then unable to enter human macrophages and T cells. Because HIV can also use other coreceptors, such as CXCR4, an HIV tropism test such as a trofile assay must be performed to determine if the drug will be effective. == History == Maraviroc, originally designated UK-427857, was developed by the drug company Pfizer in its UK labs located in Sandwich. On 24 April 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel reviewing maraviroc's New Drug Application unanimously recommended approval for the new drug, and the drug received full FDA approval on 6 August 2007 for use in treatment experienced patients. Two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, compared 209 people receiving optimized therapy plus a placebo to 426 people receiving optimized therapy plus 150 mg maraviroc once daily and 414 patients receiving optimized therapy plus 150 mg maraviroc twice daily. At 48 weeks, 55% of participants receiving maraviroc once daily and 60% of participants receiving the drug twice daily achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies/mL compared with 26% of those taking placebo; about 44% of the once-daily and 45% of the twice-daily maraviroc group had a viral load of less than 50 copies/mL compared with about 23% of those who received placebo.

To establish the antiviral activity, clinical outcomes, safety, and tolerability of rilematovir (low or high dose) in children aged ≥ 28 days and ≤ 3 years with RSV disease. CROCuS was a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive phase II study, wherein children aged ≥ 28 days and ≤ 3 years with confirmed RSV infection who were either hospitalized (Cohort 1) or treated as outpatients (Cohort 2) were randomized (1:1:1) to receive rilematovir (low or high dose) or placebo. Study treatment was administered daily as an oral suspension from days 1 to 7, with dosing based on weight and age groups. The primary objective was to establish antiviral activity of rilematovir by evaluating the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of RSV viral load in nasal secretions from baseline through day 5. Severity and duration of RSV signs and symptoms and the safety and tolerability of rilematovir were also assessed through day 28 (± 3). In total, 246 patients were randomized, treated, and included in the safety analysis population (Cohort 1: 147; Cohort 2: 99). Of these, 231 were included in the intent-to-treat-infected analysis population (Cohort 1: 138; Cohort 2: 93). In both cohorts, demographics were generally similar across treatment groups. In both cohorts combined, the difference (95% confidence interval) in the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve of RSV RNA viral load through day 5 was - 1.25 (- 2.672, 0.164) and - 1.23 (- 2.679, 0.227) log Data from the combined cohort suggest that rilematovir has a small but favorable antiviral effect of indeterminate clinical relevance compared with placebo, as well as a favorable safety profile.

The method was fully validated in mouse plasma and partial validation was performed in eight different homogenates originating from brain, kidney, liver, lung, small intestine, small intestine content, spleen, and testis. Sample preparation was performed using 96-well plates for fast and efficient analysis. Protein precipitation was done by addition of 20 µL acetonitrile containing monensin as internal standard to 10 µL sample.

M18.4 was observed at very low levels in human plasma. 4. In the human AME study, pradigastat was recovered in the feces as parent drug, confounding the assessment of pradigastat absorption and the important routes of elimination. However, considering pradigastat exposure after oral and intravenous dosing, this data suggests that pradigastat was completely bioavailable in the radiolabeled AME study and therefore completely absorbed. 5. Pradigastat is eliminated very slowly into the feces, presumably via the bile. Renal excretion is negligible. Oxidative metabolism is minimal. The extent to which pradigastat is eliminated via metabolism to M18.4 could not be established from these studies due to the inherent instability of glucuronides in the gastrointestinal tract. Pradigastat, a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 inhibitor, has activity in common metabolic diseases associated with abnormal accumulation of triglycerides. In vitro studies suggest that glucuronidation is the predominant metabolism pathway for elimination of pradigastat in humans and confirmed the role of uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, UGT1A1, -1A3, and -2B7. The in vitro studies using atazanavir as a selective inhibitor of UGT1A1 and -1A3 indicated that these enzymes contribute ∼55% toward the overall glucuronidation pathway. Therefore, a clinical study was conducted to assess the potential for drug interaction between pradigastat and probenecid (purported general UGT inhibitor) or atazanavir (selective UGT1A1, -1A3 inhibitor). The study included 2 parallel cohorts, each with 3 sequential treatment periods and 22 healthy subjects per cohort. The 90%CI of the geometric mean ratios for Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss of pradigastat were within 0.80-1.25 when administered in combination with probenecid. However, the Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss of pradigastat decreased by 31% (90%CI: 0.62-0.78) and 26% (0.67-0.82), respectively, when administered in combination with atazanavir. This magnitude of decrease in pradigastat steady-state exposure is not considered clinically relevant. Pradigastat was well tolerated by all subjects, either alone or in combination with atazanavir or probenecid. Pradigastat, a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor, has been studied in familial chylomicronemia syndrome. To evaluate the effects of supratherapeutic concentrations of pradigastat on the QTc interval, 2 studies were conducted. The first study assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single escalating intravenous doses of pradigastat (10, 30, 100, and 115 mg over 60 minutes) in healthy adults. Single intravenous doses were safe, well tolerated, and at the higher doses resulted in supratherapeutic pradigastat exposure. The second was a parallel, 3-arm thorough QTc study in which healthy male subjects were randomized to pradigastat (115 mg intravenously), moxifloxacin (400 mg oral, positive control), or placebo. Following intravenous administration, pradigastat exposure peaked at 4 times the therapeutic concentration and did not prolong the baseline-adjusted and placebo-corrected QTc intervals. During the 60-minute pradigastat infusion, a number of infusion reactions and a small mean decrease in QTc were observed. Both effects disappeared when the infusion was stopped, suggesting that an infusate excipient may have been responsible. As expected, moxifloxacin significantly increased the QTc interval at multiple points, confirming the study's sensitivity to detect a true positive effect. Pradigastat is therefore unlikely to increase the risk of dysrhythmias associated with QTc prolongation in humans.",Pradigastat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007753941463306546), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031811606604605913)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25854859/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25889044/?utm_source=openai), [biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/anji-pharma-completes-patient-enrollment-in-phase-2-study-of-pradigastat-in-functional-constipation?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=342, start_index=6, title='Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of pradigastat, a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor in overweight or obese, but otherwise healthy human subjects', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25854859/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=342, start_index=6, title='Effect of the DGAT1 inhibitor pradigastat on triglyceride and apoB48 levels in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25889044/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=342, start_index=6, title='Anji Pharma Completes Patient Enrollment in Phase 2 Study of Pradigastat in Functional Constipation - BioSpace', type='url_citation', url='https://www.biospace.com/anji-pharma-completes-patient-enrollment-in-phase-2-study-of-pradigastat-in-functional-constipation?utm_source=openai')])"

In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, sertindole was found to be slightly less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, as effective as ziprasidone, approximately as effective as chlorpromazine and asenapine, and slightly more effective than lurasidone and iloperidone. == Adverse effects == Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Headache Ejaculation failure Insomnia Dizziness Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include: Urine that tests positive for red and/or white blood cells Sedation (causes less sedation than most antipsychotic drugs according to a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs.

In a trial of 2000 patients on taking sertindole, 27 patients died unexpectedly, including 13 sudden deaths. Lundbeck cites the results of the Sertindole Cohort Prospective (SCoP) study of 10,000 patients to support its claim that although sertindole does increase the QTc interval, this is not associated with increased rates of cardiac arrhythmias, and that patients on sertindole had the same overall mortality rate as those on risperidone. Nevertheless, in April 2009 an FDA advisory panel voted 13-0 that sertindole was effective in the treatment of schizophrenia but 12-1 that it had not been shown to be acceptably safe. As of October 2010, the drug has not been approved by the FDA for use in the USA. === European Union === In the European Union, sertindole was approved and marketed in 19 countries from 1996, but its marketing authorization was suspended by the European Medicines Agency in 1998 and the drug was withdrawn from the market. In 2002, based on new data, the EMA's CHMP suggested that Sertindole could be reintroduced for restricted use in clinical trials, with strong safeguards including extensive contraindications and warnings for patients at risk of cardiac dysrhythmias, a recommended reduction in maximum dose from 24 mg to 20 mg in all but exceptional cases, and extensive ECG monitoring requirement before and during treatment. As of September 2020, sertindole is authorized in several countries of the European Union. == References ==",Serdolect,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00033885458833537996)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertindole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Sertindole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertindole?utm_source=openai')])"

In places where infections are not common, it is a second line treatment after paromomycin when a person has no symptoms. For people who are symptomatic, it is used after treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole. It is taken by mouth. Diloxanide generally has mild side effects. Side effects may include flatulence, vomiting, and itchiness. During pregnancy it is recommended that it be taken after the first trimester. It is a luminal amebicide meaning that it only works on infections within the intestines. Diloxanide came into medical use in 1956. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in much of the developed world as of 2012. == Medical uses == Diloxanide furoate works only in the digestive tract and is a lumenal amebicide. It is considered second line treatment for infection with amoebas when no symptoms are present but the person is passing cysts, in places where infections are not common. Paromomycin is considered the first line treatment for these cases. For people who are symptomatic, it is used after treatment with ambecides that can penetrate tissue, like metronidazole or tinidazole. Diloxanide is considered second-line, while paromomycin is considered first line for this use as well. == Adverse effects == Side effects include flatulence, itchiness, and hives. In general, the use of diloxanide is well tolerated with minimal toxicity. Although there is no clear risk of harm when used during pregnancy, diloxanide should be avoided in the first trimester if possible. Diloxanide furoate is not recommended in women who are breast feeding, and in children <2 years of age. == Pharmacology == Diloxanide furoate destroys trophozoites of E. histolytica and prevents amoebic cyst formation. The exact mechanism of diloxanide is unknown. Diloxanide is structurally related to chloramphenicol and may act in a similar fashion by disrupting the ribosome The prodrug, diloxanide furoate, is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract to release the active drug, diloxanide. 90% of each dose is excreted in the urine and the other 10% is excreted in the feces. == Society and culture == It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

319,"('Chlormethine (hydrochloride)', 'Mechlorethamine hydrochloride', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Chlormethine', 'Nitrogen mustard')",Medical,"Nitrogen mustards (NMs) are cytotoxic organic compounds with the bis(2-chloroethyl)amino ((ClC2H4)2NR) functional group. Although originally produced as chemical warfare agents, they were the first chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of cancer. Nitrogen mustards are nonspecific DNA alkylating agents. == Name == Nitrogen mustards are not related to the mustard plant or its pungent essence, allyl isothiocyanate; the name comes from the pungent smell of chemical weapons preparations. == Chemical warfare == During World War II, nitrogen mustards were studied at the Yale School of Medicine by Alfred Gilman and Louis Goodman, and in December 1942, they started classified human clinical trials of nitrogen mustards for the treatment of lymphoma. In early December of 1943, an incident during the air raid on Bari, Italy, led to the release of mustard gas that affected several hundred soldiers and civilians. Medical examination of the survivors showed a decreased number of lymphocytes. After World War II was over, the Bari incident and the Yale group's studies eventually converged prompting a search for other similar compounds. Due to its use in previous studies, the nitrogen mustard known as ""HN2"" became the first chemotherapy drug mustine. == Examples == The nitrogen mustard drug mustine (HN2), is no longer commonly in use in its original IV formulation because of excessive toxicity. Other nitrogen mustards developed include cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, uramustine, melphalan, and bendamustine. Bendamustine has recently re-emerged as a viable chemotherapeutic treatment. Nitrogen mustards that can be used for chemical warfare purposes are tightly regulated. Their weapon designations are: HN1: bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine HN2: bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine HN3: tris(2-chloroethyl)amine Normustard (mustine without a methyl group on the nitrogen atom; bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine) can be used in the synthesis of piperazine drugs such as mazapertine, aripiprazole & fluanisone. Canfosfamide was also made from normustard. Some nitrogen mustards of opiates were also prepared, although these are not known to be antineoplastic. Examples include chlornaltrexamine and chloroxymorphamine. == Mechanism of action == Nitrogen mustards form cyclic ammonium ions (aziridinium ions) by intramolecular displacement of the chloride leaving group by the amine nitrogen atom. This aziridinium group then alkylates DNA once it is attacked by the N-7 nucleophilic center on the guanine base. A second attack after the displacement of the second chlorine atom forms the second alkylation step that results in the formation of interstrand cross-links (ICLs) as it was shown in the early 1960s. At that time, it was proposed that the ICLs were formed between N-7 atom of guanine residue in a 5'-d(GC) sequence. Later it was clearly demonstrated that nitrogen mustards form a 1,3 ICL in the 5'-d(GNC) sequence. The strong cytotoxic effect caused by the formation of ICLs is what makes NMs an effective chemotherapeutic agent. Other compounds used in cancer chemotherapy that have the ability to form ICLs are cisplatin, mitomycin C, carmustine, and psoralen. These kinds of lesions are effective at forcing the cell to undergo apoptosis via p53, a protein which scans the genome for defects. Note that the alkylating damage itself is not cytotoxic and does not directly cause cell death. == Safety == Nitrogen mustards are powerful and persistent blister agents. HN1, HN2, HN3 are therefore classified as Schedule 1 substances within the Chemical Weapons Convention. Production and use is therefore strongly restricted. == See also == Mustard gas Sulphur mustard == References == == Further reading == Stanford University School of Medicine (2013).

It is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), of the tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) A, B and C, C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). The most common side effects include tiredness, constipation, dysgeusia (taste disturbances), edema (swelling with fluid retention), dizziness, diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick), dysesthesia (unpleasant and abnormal feeling when touched), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), anemia (low red blood cell count), increased weight, increased blood creatinine (possible sign of kidney problems), pain, cognitive disorders (problems with ability to think, learn and remember), vomiting, cough, and fever. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2019, in Australia in May 2020, and in the European Union in July 2020. == Medical uses == In the US, entrectinib is indicated to treat patients whose cancers are ROS1-positive (have a specific genetic feature (biomarker)). It is to be used in those with solid tumors that: Entrectinib is not approved for use in those less than twelve years of age. In the European Union, entrectinib as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents twelve years of age and older with solid tumours expressing a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have not received a prior NTRK inhibitor who have no satisfactory treatment options. It is also indicated for the treatment of adults with ROS1 positive, advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with ROS1 inhibitors. == Side effects == The common side effects of entrectinib include fatigue, constipation, dysgeusia, edema, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, dysesthesia, dyspnea, myalgia, cognitive impairment, weight gain, cough, vomiting, fever, arthralgia and vision disorders. The most serious side effects of entrectinib are congestive heart failure, central nervous system effects, skeletal fractures, hepatotoxicity, hyperuricemia, QT prolongation and vision disorders. == History == In the U.S., entrectinib has orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of neuroblastoma and orphan drug designation for treatment of TrkA-, TrkB-, TrkC-, ROS1- and ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). It has an EU orphan designation for neuroblastoma. FDA approved entrectinib for people with ROS1-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours. It is first FDA-approved treatment designed to target both ROS1 and NTRK that also shows response in cancer that has spread to the brain. In June 2019, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved the agent for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with NTRK fusion–positive, advanced recurrent solid tumors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved entrectinib based on the evidence from four clinical trials of 355 patients with various types of solid tumors: Trial 1 (EudraCT 2012-000148-88), Trial 2 (NCT02097810), Trial 3 (NCT02568267), and Trial 4 (NCT02650401). The trials were conducted in the United States, Europe and Asia/Pacific region. The FDA granted entrectinib accelerated approval, priority review, breakthrough therapy, and orphan drug designation. The approval of Rozlytrek was granted to Genentech, Inc. == Mechanism of action == The process of tumorigenesis frequently involves protein kinase activation events, which can result from either mutations, or chromosomal rearrangements. Gene rearrangements, leading to the expression of constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinase receptors, have been increasingly identified as a common feature of malignancies over the last three decades, and success has been demonstrated using these rearrangements as targets for drug development. The expression of such gene fusions in a tumor can create a phenomenon termed 'oncogene addiction' in which the tumor becomes dependent on signaling by the aberrant kinase pathway, thus rendering its survival and continued proliferation exquisitely sensitive to targeted inhibition with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Expression of the proteins encoded by these tyrosine kinase fusion genes can, in most cases, be shown to function independently as oncogenic drivers, capable of activating critical downstream pathways involved in the malignant phenotype, resulting in transformation of cells in vitro. Some of the most important kinases that have been shown to undergo rearrangement in human cancers include the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1 kinase, and the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases (NTRKs). Entrectinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with specificity, at low nanomolar concentrations, for all of three Trk proteins (encoded by the NTRK1, 2, and 3 genes, respectively) as well as the ROS1, and ALK receptor tyrosine kinases. The drug is orally administered, once daily, and is being studied in patients whose tumors have been shown to have fusions in NTRK1/2/3, ALK, or ROS1. As a ROS1 inhibitor, entrectinib has demonstrated in cellular anti-proliferative studies to have a 36-fold greater potency against ROS1 as compared with another commercially available ROS1 inhibitor, crizotinib. Entrectinib has also demonstrated in-vitro efficacy against potential Trk inhibitor resistance mutations such as NTRK1 F589L, NTRK1 V573M, NTRK1 G667S. == Clinical development == Entrectinib is currently being tested in a global phase II basket clinical trial called STARTRK-2. Interim results from two ongoing phase 1 trials have been reported at the 2016 AACR American Association for Cancer Research Conference in April 2016: among the patients treated with entrectinib, four patients had tumors harboring NTRK fusions, including patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mCRC, salivary gland cancer, and astrocytoma. The preliminary results seen with entrectinib in the phase I studies of patients with NTRK/ROS1/ALK fusions have led to the initiation of an open-label, multicenter, global, phase II basket study to examine the use of entrectinib in patients having tumors with these gene rearrangements. The study will enroll any patient with a solid tumor having evidence of an NTRK/ROS1/ALK fusion, assuming the patient meets all other entry criteria. Examples of such tumor types include NSCLC, mCRC, salivary gland cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, cholangiocarcinoma, lymphoma and others. == Society and culture == === Legal status === It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2019, and in Australia in May 2020. === Economics === Investigations of entrectinib were conducted by Ignyta Pharmaceuticals.

It is generally used as its 5-O-phosphorylated form known as fludarabine phosphate, sold under the brand name Fludara among others. It is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. These include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is given by injection into a vein or by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, fever, rash, shortness of breath, numbness, vision changes, and feeling tired. Severe side effects include brain dysfunction, low blood cell counts, and lung inflammation. Use in pregnancy will likely result in harm to the fetus. Fludarabine is in the purine analog family of medications and works by interfering with the duplication of DNA. Fludarabine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Fludarabine is highly effective in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, producing higher response rates than alkylating agents such as chlorambucil alone. Fludarabine is used in various combinations with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone and rituximab in the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. As part of the FLAG or FLAMSA regimen, fludarabine is used together with cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Because of its immunosuppressive effects, fludarabine is also used in some conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant. == Side effects == Fludarabine is associated with profound lymphopenia, and as a consequence, increases the risk of opportunistic infections. People who have been treated with fludarabine will usually be asked to take co-trimoxazole or to use monthly nebulised pentamidine to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The profound lymphopenia caused by fludarabine renders patients susceptible to transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, an oftentimes fatal complication of blood transfusion. For this reason, all patients who have ever received fludarabine should only be given irradiated blood components. Fludarabine causes anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, requiring regular blood count monitoring. Some patients require blood and platelet transfusion, or G-CSF injections to boost neutrophil counts. Fludarabine is associated with the development of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a proportion of patients. Difficulties are often encountered when harvesting peripheral blood stem cells from patients previously treated with fludarabine. == Pharmacology == Fludarabine is a purine analog, and can be given both orally and intravenously. Fludarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by interfering with ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. It is active against both dividing and resting cells. Being phosphorylated, fludarabine is ionized at physiologic pH and is effectually trapped in blood. This provides some level of specificity for blood cells, both cancerous and healthy. == History == Fludarabine was produced by John Montgomery and Kathleen Hewson of the Southern Research Institute in 1968. == Names == Fludarabine is generally administered as its 5-O-phosphorylated form known as fludarabine phosphate, which is rapidly dephosphorylated to fludarabine in the plasma. == References ==",Fludarabine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002671123365871608)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine,https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/fludarabinephosphate,https://www.oncolink.org/cancer-treatment/oncolink-rx/fludarabine-fludara-r ', [])"

Pemigatinib works by blocking FGFR2 in tumor cells to prevent them from growing and spreading. Pemigatinib belongs to a group of medicines called protein kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking enzymes known as protein kinases, particularly those that are part of receptors (targets) called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). FGFRs are found on the surface of cancer cells and are involved in the growth and spread of the cancer cells. By blocking the tyrosine kinases in FGFRs, pemigatinib is expected to reduce the growth and spread of the cancer. The most common adverse reactions are hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia (electrolyte disorders), alopecia (spot baldness), diarrhea, nail toxicity, fatigue, dysgeusia (taste distortion), nausea, constipation, stomatitis (sore or inflammation inside the mouth), dry eye, dry mouth, decreased appetite, vomiting, joint pain, abdominal pain, back pain and dry skin. Ocular (eye) toxicity is also a risk of pemigatinib. Additional common adverse reactions include rash, anemia, epistaxis, serous retinal detachment, extremity pain, dyspepsia, blurred vision, peripheral edema, and dizziness. == Medical uses == Pemigatinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or rearrangement that have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. In the United States it is also indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) rearrangement. Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare form of cancer that forms in bile ducts, which are slender tubes that carry the digestive fluid bile from the liver to gallbladder and small intestine. Pemigatinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) that is locally advanced (when cancer has grown outside the organ it started in, but has not yet spread to distant parts of the body) or metastatic (when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body) and who have tumors that have a fusion or other rearrangement of a gene called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). == History == Pemigatinib was approved for use in the United States in April 2020 along with the FoundationOne CDX (Foundation Medicine, Inc.) as a companion diagnostic for patient selection. The approval of pemigatinib in the United States was based on the results the FIGHT-202 (NCT02924376) multicenter open-label single-arm trial that enrolled 107 participants with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement who had received prior treatment. The trial was conducted at 67 sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. During the clinical trial, participants received pemigatinib once a day for 14 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off, in 21-day cycles until the disease progressed or the patient experienced an unreasonable level of side effects. To assess how well pemigatinib was working during the trial, participants were scanned every eight weeks. The trial used established criteria to measure how many participants experienced a complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors during treatment (overall response rate). The overall response rate was 36% (95% CI: 27%, 45%), with 2.8% of participants having a complete response and 33% having a partial response. Among the 38 participants who had a response, 24 participants (63%) had a response lasting six months or longer and seven participants (18%) had a response lasting 12 months or longer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for pemigatinib priority review, breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted approval of Pemazyre to Incyte Corporation. On 24 August 2018, orphan designation (EU/3/18/2066) was granted by the European Commission to Incyte Biosciences Distribution B.V., the Netherlands, for pemigatinib for the treatment of biliary tract cancer.

In vitro studies suggest a synergistic anti-tumor potential for the combination of tenalisib with the histone-deacetylase inhibitor, romidepsin. This multicenter, open-label, phase I/II study was designed to characterize the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of oral tenalisib twice-daily and intravenous romidepsin administered on days 1, 8 and 15 in 28-day cycles in adults with relapsed/refractory TCL. Phase I/dose escalation determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/optimal doses of tenalisib and romidepsin. The phase II/dose expansion assessed the safety and anti-tumor activity of the combination at MTD/optimal dose. Overall, 33 patients were enrolled. In dose escalation, no dose-limiting toxicity was identified. Hence, the recommended doses for dose expansion were tenalisib 800 mg twice daily orally, and romidepsin 14 mg/m2 intravenous. Overall treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade reported in >15% of patients were nausea, thrombocytopenia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, decreased appetite, neutropenia, vomiting, fatigue, anemia, dysgeusia, weight loss, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Twenty-three patients (69.7%) had related grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events. The overall objective response rate in evaluable patients was 63.0% (peripheral TCL: 75% and cutaneous TCL: 53.3%), with a complete response and partial response of 25.9% and 37.0% respectively. The median duration of response was 5.03 months. Co-administration of tenalisib and romidepsin did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin. Overall, tenalisib and romidepsin combination demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile supporting its further development for relapsed/refractory TCL (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT03770000). Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary Syndrome (SS) are the most common subtypes of cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL). Advanced-stage MF/SS have poor prognoses and may be refractory to multiple systemic treatments. These cases can be difficult to achieve and maintain complete response and there is a need for novel therapeutics. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by Tenalisib presents one such emerging drug. We report a relapsed/refractory SS patient achieving complete remission using the combination of Tenalisib and Romidepsin and subsequently maintaining long-duration CR with Tenalisib monotherapy. Tenalisib (RP6530) is a novel, highly specific, dual phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3K) δ/γ inhibitor with nano-molar potency. This was a phase I, open-label, 3 + 3 dose escalation, maximum tolerated dose determination study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of tenalisib in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Tenalisib was administered orally twice/thrice daily in 28-day cycles with starting dose of 25 mg twice daily. Thirty-five patients were enrolled across 11 dose levels. No dose limiting toxicity was reported at any of the dose levels. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events irrespective of causality were asthenia and cough in 15 (43%) patients and pyrexia in 13 (37%) patients. The most frequently reported related treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Related grade 3/4 adverse events were limited to events of hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia, and diarrhea. Pharmacokinetics showed rapid absorption. Based on maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma-concentration time curve, dose proportionality was observed up to 400 mg dose. Of 31 patients included in the efficacy analysis, complete response was seen in 2 (7%) patients and partial response in 4 (13%) patients, with an overall response rate of 19% and a disease-control rate of 61%. The median duration of response was 5.7 months. Responders demonstrated a marked downregulation of phospho-AKT on C1D8. Tenalisib demonstrated acceptable safety up to 1200 mg twice a day with no dose-limiting toxicities. Consistent clinical response was seen at doses 200 mg BID and above.

It is also under development for the treatment of uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding in women. The medication was under investigation for the treatment of prostate cancer and enlarged prostate in men as well, but development for these conditions was discontinued. Elagolix is taken by mouth once or twice per day. It can be taken for up to 6 to 24 months, depending on the dosage. Side effects of elagolix include menopausal-like symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, amenorrhea, mood changes, anxiety, and decreased bone density, among others. Elagolix is a GnRH antagonist, or an antagonist of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), the biological target of the hypothalamic hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). By blocking the GnRHR, it dose-dependently suppresses the gonadal production and hence circulating levels of sex hormones such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Elagolix is a short-acting GnRH antagonist, and can be used to achieve either partial or more substantial suppression of sex hormone levels. Reduced estrogen levels in the endometrium are responsible for the efficacy of elagolix in the treatment of endometriosis. Elagolix was first described in 2008 and was approved for medical use in July 2018. It has been described as a ""second-generation"" GnRH modulator due to its non-peptide and small-molecule nature and its oral activity. Unlike GnRH agonists and older GnRH antagonists, which are peptides and first-generation GnRH modulators, elagolix is not a GnRH analogue as it is not structurally related to GnRH. Elagolix was the first second-generation and orally active GnRH modulator to be introduced for medical use. The introduction of elagolix in the United States and Canada was followed by that of relugolix (brand name Relumina), the next second-generation GnRH antagonist, in Japan in January 2019. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Elagolix is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in premenopausal women. Endometriosis is a condition in which the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus, grows outside of the uterus into surrounding tissues and causes symptoms such as pelvic pain and infertility. Around 10% of women may be affected by endometriosis. Elagolix significantly decreases symptoms of dysmenorrhea (menstrual pelvic pain), non-menstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) in women with endometriosis. The medication is used at a lower dosage of 150 mg once per day or at a higher dosage of 200 mg twice per day, depending on the severity of symptoms. The effectiveness of elagolix in the treatment of symptoms of endometriosis was demonstrated in the 6-month Elaris Endometriosis I and II (EM-I and EM-II) phase III clinical trials. In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had a clinical response with respect to dysmenorrhea was 46.4% in the lower-dose elagolix group and 75.8% in the higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 19.6% in the placebo group; in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding percentages were 43.4% and 72.4%, as compared with 22.7% (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had a clinical response with respect to non-menstrual pelvic pain was 50.4% in the lower-dose elagolix group and 54.5% in the higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 36.5% in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for all comparisons); in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding percentages were 49.8% and 57.8%, as compared with 36.5% (P = 0.003 and P < 0.001, respectively). The reductions in symptoms of endometriosis with elagolix resulted in an improved quality of life. The duration of use of elagolix in the treatment of endometriosis should be limited due to a progressive risk of bone loss, and the lowest effective dosage should be used. Elagolix can be used for up to 24 months at the 150 mg once per day dosage and for up to 6 months at the 200 mg twice per day dosage. Because of its relatively short duration, elagolix should be taken at approximately the same time each day. In the case of twice-daily administration, elagolix should be taken at approximate 12-hour intervals, for instance once in the morning and once at night. It can be taken with or without food. Elagolix is approved only for the treatment of endometriosis. Other approved and off-label uses of GnRH antagonists in general are the same as those of GnRHR desensitization therapy with GnRH agonists such as leuprorelin, and include uterine fibroids and breast cancer in premenopausal women, prostate cancer in men, precocious puberty in children, and hormone therapy in transgender adolescents and adults, among others. === Available forms === Elagolix is available in the form of Orilissa 150 and 200 mg oral tablets. The 150 mg tablets are light pink, oblong, and film-coated with ""EL 150"" debossed on one side, while the 200 mg tablets are light orange, oblong, and film-coated with ""EL 200"" debossed on one side. The inactive ingredients in the tablets include mannitol, sodium carbonate monohydrate, pregelatinized starch, povidone, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, talc, and a distinct color additive (carmine high tint in the 150 mg tablets and iron oxide red in the 200 mg tablets). == Contraindications == Contraindications of elagolix include pregnancy, known osteoporosis, severe hepatic impairment, and concomitant use with strong organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 inhibitors such as ciclosporin and gemfibrozil. Elagolix may increase the risk of miscarriage in early pregnancy. Women should avoid pregnancy while taking elagolix, for instance by using birth control, and should discontinue the medication if they become or wish to become pregnant. Elagolix should not be used in women with osteoporosis because it may increase the risk of further bone loss. Severe hepatic impairment is associated with 7-fold increased exposure to elagolix, which may increase the risk of bone loss. In women with moderate hepatic impairment, which is associated with 3-fold increased exposure to elagolix, the medication at 200 mg twice per day should not be used, while 150 mg once per day should be used for no more than 6 months. OATP1B1 inhibitors are likely to greatly increase exposure to elagolix similarly to moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Combined birth control is not contraindicated with elagolix, but because of the estrogen component, is expected to decrease the effectiveness of elagolix in the treatment of endometriosis, and hence is not recommended. Other forms of birth control, such as non-hormonal birth control, can be used instead. Elagolix is not contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding, but it is unknown whether the medication is excreted in breast milk or if it has adverse effects on milk production or the breastfed child. The use of elagolix in women who are breastfeeding should be considered carefully, weighing both benefits and risks. == Side effects == The side effects of elagolix are in general similar to menopausal symptoms. The most common side effects of elagolix (incidence ≥10%) are hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, nausea, and amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation). The next most frequent side effects of elagolix (incidence ≥5%) are insomnia, anxiety, arthralgia (joint pain), depression, and mood changes. Less common side effects of elagolix (incidence ≥3% and <5%) include decreased sex drive, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight gain, dizziness, constipation, and irritability. Other common side effects of elagolix include decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and changes in the blood lipid profile. Rare but serious adverse effects that were observed during elagolix therapy in clinical trials included appendicitis (0.3%), abdominal pain (0.2%), and back pain (0.2%), though it is unknown if these were due to elagolix. Other serious adverse effects of elagolix may include bone loss, miscarriage, suicidality, and elevated liver enzymes. Elagolix was discontinued due to side effects by 5 to 10% of women in clinical trials, with the most common reasons being hot flashes or night sweats, nausea, and decreased BMD. Elagolix dose- and duration-dependently decreases BMD in premenopausal women with long-term therapy. After 6 months of treatment with elagolix, lumbar spine BMD was decreased by 0.3 to 1.3% with 150 mg once per day and by 2.5 to 3.1% with 200 mg twice per day. The decrease in BMD during elagolix therapy may not be fully reversible with discontinuation, as only partial recovery was observed 12 months after discontinuation of therapy. The cause of the decrease in BMD with elagolix is estrogen deficiency, and is analogous to that associated with postmenopause. The consequences of the effects of elagolix on BMD are unknown, but may be an increase in the risk of bone loss and fractures. This is why the duration of use of elagolix should be limited. In women with risk factors for bone loss and osteoporosis, such as a history of low-trauma fracture, assessment of BMD may be considered. Elagolix should not be used in premenopausal women with known osteoporosis. Supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D during treatment with elagolix has not been studied, but may be beneficial for helping to maintain bone health. Elagolix decreases the amount, intensity, and duration of menstrual bleeding. Amenorrhea, the cessation of menstruation, was observed in 4 to 17% of women with 150 mg once per day and in 7 to 57% of women with 200 mg twice per day, compared to less than 1% of women given placebo. The decreased menstrual bleeding caused by elagolix may impede the ability to recognize pregnancy in a timely manner. Based on its mechanism of action, elagolix may increase the risk of miscarriage in early pregnancy, and so should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. If pregnancy is suspected, pregnancy testing can be performed. Elagolix decreases the rate of ovulation and thereby decreases the likelihood of pregnancy, but has not been shown to be a fully effective contraceptive and should not be relied on to prevent pregnancy. The incidence of depression and mood changes in clinical trials with elagolix was increased in premenopausal women taking elagolix relative to placebo. Mood- and depression-type side effects such as altered mood, mood swings, depressed mood, depression, depressive symptoms, and tearfulness occurred in 3 to 6% of women with 150 mg per day and in 5 to 6% of women with 200 mg twice per day, compared to 2 to 3% in women given placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior occurred in a few women (0.2–0.4%), with one suicide observed. People taking elagolix with new or existing depressive symptoms should be promptly evaluated to determine whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks. In those with new or existing depressive symptoms, referral to a mental health professional, as appropriate, may be warranted. Immediate medical attention should be sought for those with suicidal ideation and behavior. Elagolix dose-dependently produced elevated liver enzymes, including elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase of at least 3-fold the upper limit, in clinical trials. This was observed in one woman (0.2%) with 150 mg once per day and in five women (1.1%) with 200 mg twice per day, compared to one woman (0.1%) given placebo. Medical attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of liver injury, such as jaundice, are noticed. The lowest effective dosage of elagolix may be used to minimize the risk of liver problems, and in those who develop elevated liver enzymes during elagolix therapy, prompt evaluation should be done to determine whether the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks. == Overdose == In the event of an overdose of elagolix, the person should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and should be treated on a symptomatic basis as needed. Elagolix has been assessed in clinical studies at a dose as high as a single administration of 1,200 mg, which resulted in concentrations of the medication that were 17 times higher than with the typical high clinical dosage of 200 mg twice per day. No adverse effects were mentioned. Chronic overdosage of elagolix may result in greater suppression of estradiol levels and a consequent increased risk of bone loss with long-term therapy. == Interactions == Elagolix has a number of potential drug interactions with other medications. Elagolix is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme CYP3A, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 may alter the metabolism of elagolix and increase or decrease its circulating levels. The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole has been found to increase peak levels of and total exposure to a single 150 mg dose of elagolix by about 2-fold. Paradoxically, rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and other CYP450 enzymes, increased peak levels of and total exposure to a single 150 mg dose of elagolix as well. A single dose of rifampin increased peak levels of elagolix by 4.4-fold and total exposure by 5.6-fold, whereas continuous rifampin therapy increased peak levels of elagolix by 2-fold and total exposure by 1.7-fold. The use of elagolix at 200 mg twice per day concomitantly with rifampin is not recommended, whereas the concomitant use of elagolix at 150 mg once per day with rifampin should be limited to 6 months. No significant changes in exposure to elagolix were observed with concomitant administration of rosuvastatin (a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BCRP), sertraline (a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6), or fluconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4). Elagolix is a substrate of the hepatic OATP1B1 transporter. Levels of elagolix have been found to be increased by 78% in people with a genotype characterized by reduced OATP1B1 transporter function. The concomitant use of elagolix with medications that inhibit OATP1B1 may increase elagolix levels, and the use of elagolix with strong OATP1B1 inhibitors like ciclosporin and gemfibrozil, which may markedly increase elagolix exposure, is contraindicated. Elagolix is a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A, and may decrease levels of medications that are substrates of CYP3A4. In addition, elagolix is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, and may increase levels of medications that are substrates of P-glycoprotein, such as digoxin. Elagolix has been found to increase exposure to digoxin and ethinylestradiol, whereas it has been found to decrease exposure to rosuvastatin, midazolam, norethisterone, norelgestromin, and norgestrel. Because combined birth control pills and other forms of combined birth control contain an estrogen, and because elagolix treats endometriosis by decreasing estrogen levels in the endometrium, these form of hormonal birth control are likely and expected to decrease the effectiveness of elagolix in the treatment of this condition. The effect of progestogen-only birth control on the effectiveness of elagolix in endometriosis is unknown. However, progestogens are antiestrogenic in the uterus, and high-dose progestin therapy is known to be effective in the treatment of endometriosis similarly to GnRH antagonists. On the basis of limited clinical research, combined birth control pills have also been found to be effective in the treatment of endometriosis, but are likely not as effective as GnRH modulator monotherapy. It is advised that women use non-hormonal methods of birth control during elagolix therapy and for one week following discontinuation of elagolix. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Elagolix acts as a potent and selective competitive antagonist of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), the biological target of the hypothalamic peptide hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). As such, it is a GnRH antagonist. The affinity (KD) of elagolix for the GnRHR is 54 pM. By blocking the GnRHR in the pituitary gland, elagolix suppresses the GnRH-induced secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary, and thereby decreases the production of sex hormones by the gonads. In women, elagolix dose-dependently suppresses the production of ovarian hormones including estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, and thereby decreases the circulating levels of these hormones. In men, GnRH modulators suppress the testicular production of testosterone and estradiol, decreasing the circulating levels of these hormones similarly. Unlike previous GnRH agonists and antagonists, referred to collectively as GnRH analogues, elagolix is a non-peptide and small-molecule compound that can be taken orally. Estrogens like estradiol stimulate the growth of the endometrium, and thereby aggravate symptoms of endometriosis. By suppressing estrogen production and levels, elagolix decreases the growth of the endometrium and decreases endometriosis symptoms such as pelvic pain. Elagolix is a short-acting GnRH antagonist, with a terminal half-life of typically about 4 to 6 hours. Because of the short duration of elagolix in the body, the activation of the GnRHR by GnRH is not fully blocked throughout the day with once-daily administration of elagolix. As a result, gonadotropin and sex hormone levels are only partially suppressed when elagolix is taken once per day. In addition, the degree of suppression can be dose-dependently adjusted as needed, for instance with higher-dose twice-daily administration to achieve greater hormonal suppression. Because of its short duration in the body, the effects of elagolix are rapidly reversible upon discontinuation. In addition, due to its partial and incomplete suppression of estradiol levels, the side effects of elagolix, such as hot flashes and decreased BMD, are lower than with first-generation GnRH modulators. In clinical trials, elagolix produced dose-dependent decreases in gonadotropin, estradiol, and progesterone levels in women. Median levels of estradiol were partially suppressed to 42 pg/mL (follicular phase levels) with 150 mg once daily and were fully or near-fully suppressed to 12 pg/mL (postmenopausal levels) with 200 mg twice daily. In a 21-day study in premenopausal women, the effects of elagolix on FSH levels were found to be maximal at a dosage of 300 mg twice per day or above, whereas its effects on LH and estradiol levels were maximal at a dosage of 200 mg twice per day or above. Levels of progesterone were maintained at anovulatory levels (<2 ng/mL) across the 21-day study period at dosages of elagolix of 100 mg twice per day and above. A dosage of elagolix of 400 mg twice per day appears to produce no greater suppression in gonadotropin or estradiol levels than a dosage of 300 mg twice per day in premenopausal women. Suppression of gonadotropin and sex hormone levels with elagolix occurs rapidly, within hours, and upon discontinuation of elagolix, gonadotropin and sex hormone levels remain suppressed for at least 12 hours, but show recovery within 24 to 48 hours. As a consequence of its suppression of gonadotropin and sex hormone levels, elagolix inhibits ovulation in women. Over the course of three menstrual cycles, the ovulation rate with elagolix was 50% at 150 mg once daily and 32% at 200 mg twice daily. Because ovulation is triggered by a surge in estradiol levels at mid-cycle, estrogen exposure during elagolix therapy might be greater around this time in some women. In addition to its activity as a GnRH antagonist, elagolix is a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. As a result, elagolix may affect the metabolism and/or transport of other medications, and this may contribute to drug interactions with elagolix. === Pharmacokinetics === Elagolix is taken by the oral route of administration, in contrast to other GnRH modulators. The oral bioavailability of elagolix in humans is not described in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for the medication, but in animal research elagolix showed a low oral bioavailability of 5.8% in rats and 11% in monkeys. Following administration, elagolix is rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations occurring after 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The drug accumulation ratio of elagolix at 150 mg once per day is 0.98 and at 200 mg twice per day is 0.89, indicating that it is not accumulated in the body with continuous administration. At steady state, peak levels of elagolix at 150 mg once per day are 574 ng/mL and at 200 mg twice per day are 774 ng/mL while area-under-the-curve levels of elagolix at 150 mg once per day are 1,292 ng•hour/mL and at 200 mg twice per day are 1,725 ng•hour/mL. A toxicology study found that levels of elagolix in women after a single dose of 1,200 mg were 17 times higher than in women taking 200 mg twice daily. Taking elagolix with a high-fat meal has been found to decrease its peak levels by 36% and its area-under-the-curve levels by 24%. In terms of distribution, the plasma protein binding of elagolix is 80% and its blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.6. The volume of distribution at steady state is 1,674 L at 150 mg once per day and 881 L at 200 mg twice per day. Elagolix is metabolized in the liver, with the major pathway being by CYP3A and minor pathways including by CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. The terminal half-life of elagolix is typically about 4 to 6 hours. A study found that its half-life was 2.4 to 6.3 hours with a single dose and was 2.2 to 10.8 hours with continuous administration. The oral clearance of elagolix is 123 L/hour at 150 mg once per day and 144 L/hour at 200 mg twice per day. The major pathway of elimination of elagolix is hepatic metabolism. Elagolix is taken up from the circulation into the liver by the hepatic OATP1B1 carrier. In people with two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1 521T>C; SLCO1B1 521 C/C genotype), plasma levels of elagolix have been found to be increased by 78% relative to in people with normal OATP1B1 function (SLCO1B1 521T/T genotype). The frequency of this reduced function OATP1B1 genotype is generally less than 5% in most racial and ethnic groups. Elagolix is excreted less than 3% in urine and 90% in feces. Exposure to elagolix is not affected by renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment, but is increased by approximately 3-fold in women with moderate hepatic impairment and by approximately 7-fold in women with severe hepatic impairment. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of elagolix between individuals of different racial and ethnic groups. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of elagolix were unaffected by body weight and body mass index. Peak and area-under-the-curve levels of elagolix have been shown to be altered by CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole and CYP3A4 inducers like rifampin. Inhibitors of OATP1B1 may increase circulating levels of elagolix, and elagolix is considered to be contraindicated in combination with strong OATP1B1 inhibitors. Elagolix is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, but the effect of inhibitors and inducers of P-glycoprotein on the pharmacokinetics of elagolix is unknown. Elagolix itself is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. == Chemistry == Elagolix is a small-molecule and non-peptide compound. This is in contrast to GnRH analogues such as leuprorelin and cetrorelix, which are peptides and analogues of GnRH. Other small-molecule and non-peptide orally active GnRH antagonists besides elagolix include linzagolix, opigolix, relugolix, and sufugolix, although none of these compounds have been introduced for medical use at this time. Elagolix is used as elagolix sodium, the sodium salt of elagolix. It is a white to off white to light yellow powder. The compound is freely soluble in water. The chemical name of elagolix sodium is sodium 4-({(1R)-2-[5-(2-fluoro-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-{[2-fluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}-4-methyl-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl]-1-phenylethyl}amino)butanoate. It has a molecular formula of C32H29F5N3O5Na and a molecular weight of 653.58 g/mol. The free acid form of elagolix has a molecular formula of C32H29F5N3O5 and a molecular weight of 631.60 g/mol. == History == Elagolix was first described in the literature in 2005. It was originally developed by the pharmaceutical company Neurocrine Biosciences, and was later developed together by Neurocrine Biosciences and AbbVie (previously Abbott Laboratories). In June 2010, Neurocrine Biosciences and Abbott announced a global agreement to develop and commercialize elagolix for the treatment of endometriosis. The medication completed phase III clinical trials for endometriosis in November 2016. Two phase III clinical trials, the Elaris Endometriosis I and II (EM-I and EM-II) studies, were conducted. The studies included almost 1,700 women, about 950 of whom were treated with elagolix. In September 2017, AbbVie filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for elagolix for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis in the United States. The medication was approved by the FDA for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain in the United States on 23 July 2018. It was the first new medication to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of endometriosis in more than a decade. Elagolix was the first member of a new class of GnRH modulators described as ""second-generation"" due to their non-peptide and small-molecule nature and oral activity to be marketed. A second member of this group, relugolix (brand name Relumina), was introduced in Japan in January 2019. In addition to endometriosis, elagolix is under development for the treatment of uterine fibroids and menorrhagia. It is in phase III clinical trials for these indications. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Elagolix is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. It is also known by its former developmental code names NBI-56418 and ABT-620. === Brand names === Elagolix is marketed under the brand name Orilissa. === Availability === Elagolix is available in the United States and Canada. A similar medication, relugolix, is available in Japan. === Economics === Prior to its introduction, elagolix was estimated to cost about US$850 per month. It is not available as a generic medication. == Research == As of November 2018, elagolix in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of uterine fibroids (uterine leiomyoma) and menorrhagia (abnormally heavy bleeding during menstruation) in women. An efficacy and safety study of elagolix in combination with add-back estradiol, an estrogen, and norethisterone acetate, a progestin, for the treatment of menorrhagia associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women has been published. The medication was also under investigation for the treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) in men, but development for these indications was discontinued. == References == == Further reading == Ezzati M, Carr BR (January 2015).

Our findings provide insight into rational-directed precision chemo and immunotherapy therapy in PDAC. Being the fourth most fatal malignancy worldwide, pancreatic cancer is on track to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2030. Gemcitabine is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Gemcitabine Elaidate (Gem Elaidate) is a lipophilic derivative which allows hENT1-independent intracellular delivery of gemcitabine and better pharmacokinetics and entrapment in a nanocarrier. Cancer cells and neovasculature are negatively charged compared to healthy cells. Palmitoyl-DL-carnitine chloride (PC) is a Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor which also provides a cationic surface charge to nanoliposomes for targeting tumor neovasculature and augmented anticancer potency. The objectives of our study are: (a) to develop and characterize a PKC inhibitor-anchored Gem Elaidate-loaded PEGylated nanoliposome (PGPLs) and (b) to investigate the anticancer activity of Gem Elaidate and PGPLs in 2D and 3D models of pancreatic cancer. The optimized PGPLs resulted in a particle size of 80 ± 2.31 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.15 ± 0.05 and a ζ-potential of +31.6 ± 3.54 mV, with a 93.25% encapsulation efficiency of Gem Elaidate in PGPLs. Our results demonstrate higher cellular uptake, inhibition in migration, as well as angiogenesis potential and significant apoptosis induced by PGPLs in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids of pancreatic cancer cells. Hence, PGPLs could be an effective and novel nanoformulation for the neovasculature-specific delivery of Gemcitabine Elaidate to treat PDAC.",Gemcitabine (elaidate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009542917250655591), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018161199986934662)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011047814972698689), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/1e86dcfc5f6642869e9fc31bd106585b?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=114, start_index=6, title='Gemcitabine elaidate - Drug Targets, Indications, Patents - Synapse', type='url_citation', url='https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/1e86dcfc5f6642869e9fc31bd106585b?utm_source=openai')])"

It is taken by mouth. Compared with warfarin it has fewer drug interactions. It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo and approved in July 2011, in Japan for prevention of venous thromboembolisms following lower-limb orthopedic surgery. It was also approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2015, for the prevention of stroke and non–central-nervous-system systemic embolism. It was approved for use in the European Union in June 2015. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == In the United States, edoxaban is indicated to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism following five to ten days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of blood clots in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. In the European Union, edoxaban is indicated for preventing blood clots in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who also have at least one risk factor, such as having had a previous stroke, high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure or being 75 years of age or older. It is also used to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent either of these from reoccurring. == Contraindications and notes == Edoxaban is often contraindicated in people (incomplete list): with active pathological bleeding who are pregnant or breastfeeding who have conditions that increase bleeding risks. Examples: liver disease associated with coagulopathy and relevant bleeding risk, current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent brain injury or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, known or suspected esophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities who have uncontrolled and severe high blood pressure who use any other anticoagulants Edoxaban (incomplete list): is enhanced by the following strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin or ketoconazole. Concomitant use of these and edoxaban may require 30 mg doses of edoxaban (instead of 60 mg). The efficacy of edoxaban may decrease when it is used with strong P-gp inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John's Wort. If these medications are used with edoxaban, caution is advised. interacts with antiplatelets, NSAIDs, SSRIs and SNRIs. inferior to warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 95 ml/min. == Adverse effects == May affect up to 1 in 10 people: stomach ache abnormal results of blood tests that measure liver function anemia bleeding from the skin, nose, vagina, bowel, mouth, throat or stomach rash bloody urine dizziness feeling sick headache itching May affect up to 1 in 100 people: bleeding in the eyes, brain, after a surgical operation or other types of bleeding blood in the spit when coughing reduced number of platelets in blood allergic reaction hives May affect up to 1 in 1000 people: bleeding in the muscles, joints, abdomen, heart or inside the skull. == Overdose == Edoxaban overdose can cause serious bleeding. No approved antidotes for edoxaban overdose exist as of April 2021. Hemodialysis does not significantly contribute to edoxaban clearance. Andexanet alfa has been studied as an antidote for edoxaban overdose, but has only been approved for reversing rivaroxaban and apixaban effects by the FDA and the EMA as of 2019. == Mechanism of action == Edoxaban is a direct, selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of human factor Xa, with an inhibitory constant (Ki) value of 0.561 nM. In coagulation, uninhibited factor Xa forms a prothrombinase complex with factor Va on platelet surfaces. Prothrombinases turn prothrombins to thrombins. Thrombins turn blood-soluble fibrinogens to insoluble fibrins, which are the main components of blood clots. == Pharmacokinetics == In human, 15–150 mg oral doses of edoxaban reach their maximum concentrations in blood 1–2 hours after ingestion. With 60 mg doses of isotope labeled edoxaban, 97% of the total radiation was detected after oral administration, with 62% from feces and 35% from urine. 49% of the total radiation from the feces and 24% from the urine were from edoxaban, the rest from its metabolites. Metabolism occurs mostly via CES1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and enzymatic hydrolysis. CES1 oxidizes the tertiary amide carbonyl carbons of edoxabans to carboxylic acid groups. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 oxidize edoxabans via hydroxylation or demethylation. In hydrolysis, 2-amino-5-chloropyridine moiety of edoxaban is removed. Glucuronidation occurs to a lesser extent via glucuronosyltransferases. == References ==",Edoxaban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5139465176616795e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002165798214264214)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoxaban?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Edoxaban', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoxaban?utm_source=openai')])"

Other serious side effects may include QT prolongation, sudden death, pancreatitis, and liver problems. It is not safe for use during pregnancy. Nilotinib is a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor and works by interfering with signalling within the cancer cell. Nilotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is approved as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Nilotinib is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+)-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia. It is indicated for the treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase; adults with chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia resistant to or intolerant to prior therapy that included imatinib; and children with chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy. == Adverse effects == Nilotinib has a number of adverse effects including headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, muscle and joint pain, rash and other skin conditions, flu-like symptoms, and reduced blood cell count. Less typical side effects are those of the cardiovascular system, such as high blood pressure, various types of arrhythmia, and prolonged QT interval. Nilotinib can also affect the body's electrolyte and glucose balance. Though lung-related adverse effects are rare when compared with imatinib and dasatinib, there is a case report of acute respiratory failure from diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a people taking nilotinib. Nilotinib carries a black box warning in the United States for possible heart complications. Contraindications include long QT syndrome, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, pregnancy, planned pregnancy, lactation and galactose/lactose intolerance. Cautions include: Dose reduction has been recommended in people with liver problems which involves recommendation of lower starting dose and monitoring of any hepatic function abnormalities. Hepatitis B virus reactivation may also occur. == Interactions == Nilotinib has been reported as a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Interaction of nilotinib with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may alter its hepatic disposition and can lead to transporter mediated drug-drug interactions. Nilotinib is an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 transporter but not for OATP-1B3. It is a substrate for CYP3A4 and hence grapefruit juice and other CYP3A4 inhibitors will increase its action and inducers like St. John's wort will decrease it. Patients report that pomegranates and starfruit may also interfere. == Pharmacology == Nilotinib inhibits the kinases BCR-ABL, KIT, LCK, EPHA3, EPHA8, DDR1, DDR2, PDGFRB, MAPK11 and ZAK. Structurally related to imatinib, It is 10–30 fold more potent than imatinib in inhibiting Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity and proliferation of Bcr-Abl expressing cells. == History == Nilotinib was developed by Novartis. It was developed based on the structure of the Abl-imatinib complex to address imatinib intolerance and resistance. == Society and culture == === Legal status === It was approved for medical use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2007, the European Union in November 2007, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January 2021, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in January 2008. == Research == === Parkinson's disease === There is weak evidence that nilotinib may be beneficial with Parkinson's disease (PD), with a small clinical trial suggesting it might halt progression and improve symptoms. However, there were significant side effects including infection, liver function tests abnormalities, hallucinations and heart attack, and the benefit in PD disappeared at follow up after drug discontinuation, raising question as to whether it was truly a disease modifying therapy. Nilotinib is currently undergoing phase II studies for treatment of Parkinson's. Scientists and medical professionals have advised caution with over-optimistic interpretation of its effects in Parkinson's due to the significant media hype surrounding the small and early clinical trial. Dystonia and cognitive impairment have also been reported as side effects. === Other === Novartis announced in April 2011, that it was discontinuing a phase III trial of nilotinib as the first-line treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee. Interim results showed Tasigna is unlikely to demonstrate superiority compared to Novartis's Gleevec (imatinib)*, the current standard of care in this setting. Low dose nilotinib is also being investigated for use in Alzheimer's disease, as well as for ALS, dementia and Huntington's disease. Nioltinib can be prepared as an amorphous solid distribution with resonant acoustic mixing in an attempt to avoid the interaction issues Tasigna has with food. Some work was done with 26 healthy volunteers, but a larger study has not been attempted. == References ==",Tasigna,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6927575416048057e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000436925794929266)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/tasigna.html ', [])"

The aim of this study was to characterize the metabolites of tuxobertinib in liver microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes and to propose the metabolic pathways. The metabolites were generated by individually incubating tuxobertinib (5 μM) with rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes, NADPH, and at 37°C for 60 min. The samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/Orbitrap-MS) using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. The metabolites were characterized and identified by their accurate MS and MS/MS data. Totally, 18 metabolites were detected, and their structure was characterized. All these metabolites were -NADPH-dependent. The metabolic pathways of tuxobertinib included O-dealkylation, hydroxylation, oxidative deamination, dehydrogenation, and the opening of morpholine.

333,"('Apalutamide', 'Erleada', 'Apalutamide (arn-509)', 'Apalutamide [inn]', 'Apalutamidearn509')",Medical,"Apalutamide, sold under the brand name Erleada among others, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) medication used for the treatment of prostate cancer. It is an androgen receptor inhibitor. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of apalutamide when added to castration include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, high blood pressure, rash, falls, bone fractures, and an underactive thyroid. Rarely, it can cause seizures. The medication has a high potential for drug interactions. Apalutamide is an antiandrogen, and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In doing so, it prevents the effects of these hormones in the prostate gland and elsewhere in the body. Apalutamide was first described in 2007, and was approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in February 2018. It is the first medication to be approved specifically for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. == Medical uses == Apalutamide is indicated for the treatment of people with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer and the treatment of people with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Apalutamide is used in conjunction with castration, either via bilateral orchiectomy or gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH analogue) therapy, as a method of androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It is also a promising potential treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which the NSAA enzalutamide and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate are used to treat. == Contraindications == Contraindications of apalutamide include pregnancy and a history of or susceptibility to seizures. == Side effects == Apalutamide has been found to be well tolerated in clinical trials, with the most common side effects reported when added to surgical or medical castration including fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Other side effects have included rash, falls and bone fractures, and hypothyroidism, as well as seizures (in 0.2%), among others. Apalutamide is an expected teratogen and has a theoretical risk of birth defects in male infants if taken by women during pregnancy. It may impair male fertility. When used as a monotherapy (i.e., without surgical or medical castration) in men, NSAAs are known to produce additional, estrogenic side effects like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and feminization in general by increasing estradiol levels. Similarly to the related second-generation NSAA enzalutamide but unlike first-generation NSAAs like flutamide and bicalutamide, elevated liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity have not been reported with apalutamide. Case reports of rare interstitial lung disease with apalutamide exist similarly to with first-generation NSAAs however. == Overdose == There is no known antidote for overdose of apalutamide. General supportive measures should be undertaken until clinical toxicity, if any, diminishes or resolves. == Interactions == Apalutamide has a high potential for drug interactions. In terms of effects of apalutamide on other drugs, the exposure of substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, P-glycoprotein, ABCG2, or OATP1B1 may be reduced to varying extents. In terms of effects of other drugs on apalutamide, strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase levels of apalutamide or its major active metabolite N-desmethylapalutamide, while mild to moderate CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to affect their exposure. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Apalutamide acts as a selective competitive silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), via the ligand-binding domain, and hence is an antiandrogen. It is similar both structurally and pharmacologically to the second-generation NSAA enzalutamide, but shows some advantages, including higher antiandrogenic activity as well as several-fold reduced central nervous system distribution. The latter difference may reduce its comparative risk of seizures and other central side effects. Apalutamide has 5- to 10-fold greater affinity for the AR than bicalutamide, a first-generation NSAA. The acquired F876L mutation of the AR identified in advanced prostate cancer cells has been found to confer resistance to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. A newer NSAA, darolutamide, is not affected by this mutation, nor has it been found to be affected by any other tested/well-known AR mutations. Apalutamide may be effective in a subset of prostate cancer patients with acquired resistance to abiraterone acetate. ==== Other activities ==== Apalutamide shows potent induction potential of cytochrome P450 enzymes similarly to enzalutamide. It is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and a weak inducer of CYP2C9, as well as an inducer of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. In addition, apalutamide is an inducer of P-glycoprotein, ABCG2, and OATP1B1. Apalutamide binds weakly to and inhibits the GABAA receptor in vitro similarly to enzalutamide (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 3.0 and 2.7 μM, respectively), but due to its relatively lower central concentrations, may have a lower risk of seizures in comparison. Apalutamide has been found to significantly and concentration-dependently increase QT interval. === Pharmacokinetics === The mean absolute oral bioavailability of apalutamide is 100%. Mean peak levels of apalutamide occur 2 hours following administration, with a range of 1 to 5 hours. Food delays the median time to peak levels of apalutamide by approximately 2 hours, with no significant changes in the peak levels themselves or in area-under-curve levels. Steady-state levels of apalutamide are achieved following 4 weeks of administration, with an approximate 5-fold accumulation. Peak concentrations for 160 mg/day apalutamide at steady-state are 6.0 μg/mL (12.5 μmol/L), relative to peak levels of 16.6 μg/mL (35.7 μmol/L) for 160 mg/day enzalutamide and mean (R)-bicalutamide levels of 21.6 μg/mL (50.2 μmol/L) for 150 mg/day bicalutamide. The mean volume of distribution of apalutamide at steady-state is approximately 276 L. The plasma protein binding of apalutamide is 96%, while that of its major metabolite N-desmethylapalutamide is 95%, both irrespective of concentration. Apalutamide is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. A major active metabolite, N-desmethylapalutamide, is formed by these enzymes, with similar contribution of each of these enzymes to its formation at steady-state. Following a single oral dose of 200 mg apalutamide, apalutamide represented 45% and N-desmethylapalutamide 44% of total area-under-curve levels. The mean elimination half-life of apalutamide at steady-state is 3 to 4 days. Fluctuations in apalutamide exposure are low and levels are stable throughout the day, with mean peak-to-trough ratios of 1.63 for apalutamide and 1.27–1.3 for N-desmethylapalutamide. After a single dose of apalutamide, its clearance rate (CL/F) was 1.3 L/h, while its clearance rate increased to 2.0 L/h at steady-state. This change is considered to be likely due to CYP3A4 auto-induction. Approximately 65% of apalutamide is excreted in urine (1.2% as unchanged apalutamide and 2.7% as N-desmethylapalutamide) while 24% is excreted in feces (1.5% as unchanged apalutamide and 2% as N-desmethylapalutamide). == Chemistry == Apalutamide is a structural analogue of enzalutamide and RD-162. It is a pyridyl variant of RD-162. Enzalutamide and RD-162 were derived from the nonsteroidal androgen RU-59063, which itself was derived from the first-generation NSAA nilutamide and by extension from flutamide. == History == Apalutamide was originated by the University of California system and was developed primarily by Janssen Research & Development, a division of Johnson & Johnson. It was first described in the literature in a United States patent application that was published in November 2007 and in another that was submitted in July 2010. A March 2012 publication described the discovery and development of apalutamide. A phase I clinical trial of apalutamide was completed by March 2012, and the results of this study were published in 2013. Information on phase III clinical studies, including ATLAS, SPARTAN, and TITAN, was published between 2014 and 2016. Positive results for phase III trials were first described in 2017, and Janssen submitted a New Drug Application for apalutamide to the United States Food and Drug Administration on 11 October 2017. Apalutamide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, under the brand name Erleada, for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in February 2018. It was subsequently approved in Canada, the European Union, and Australia. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Apalutamide is the generic name of the medication and is its international nonproprietary name. It is also known by its developmental code names ARN-509 and JNJ-56021927. === Brand names === Apalutamide is marketed under the brand names Erleada and Erlyand. === Availability === Apalutamide is available in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Australia. == References == == Further reading == Chong JT, Oh WK, Liaw BC (2018).

Rucaparib is a first-in-class pharmaceutical drug targeting the DNA repair enzyme poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1). It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include tiredness or weakness, nausea (feeling sick), increased levels of creatinine (which may indicate kidney problems) and liver enzymes in the blood (which may indicate liver damage), vomiting, anaemia (low red blood cell counts), decreased appetite, dysgeusia (taste disturbances), diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) and abdominal pain (belly ache). == Medical uses == Rucaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adults with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. In the United States, rucaparib is also indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Rucaparib inhibits ""the contraction of isolated vascular smooth muscle, including that from the tumours of cancer patients. It also reduces the migration of some cancer and normal cells in culture."" As a PARP inhibitor, rucaparib is expected to be more effective in the 9% of pancreatic cancers with a BRCA mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2). == History == It was discovered as part of a collaboration between scientists working at the Northern Institute of Cancer Research and Medical School of Newcastle University and Agouron Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, California. It was being developed by Clovis Oncology until it was sold to Pharmaand GmbH (Pharma&) as part of Clovis's bankruptcy proceedings. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In December 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an accelerated approval for use in cases of pretreated advanced ovarian cancer. It was designated an orphan medicinal product in the European Union in October 2012. In March 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization, intended for the treatment of relapsed or progressive ovarian cancer. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2018. == Research == === Clinical trials === After the FDA approval, TRITON2 and TRITON3 mCRPC studies were initiated in order to determine how patients with prostate cancer will respond to the rucaparib drug. The studies for these two trials are still going on and the estimated dates for the first results are range between 2019 and 2022. The ARIEL3 and ARIEL4 are two randomized, double-blind phase III studies. The ARIEL3 study was designed to evaluate the effect of the investigational agent as a maintenance treatment for the advanced platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients compared placebo after their response to at least two prior chemotherapies. The top-line results from the study were presented at the ESMO 2017 congress and right after that, it was published in the Lancet journal in September 2017. The findings showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with Rubraca than placebo. Recently, in October 2017, a supplemental sNDA for the rucaparib ARIEL3 maintenance treatment has been submitted to the FDA. Interim results from the ARIEL4 study to evaluate how patients will best respond to treatment with rucaparib compared with chemotherapy show a decrease in overall survival compared to standard of care. A detrimental effect in terms of overall survival (OS) has been observed for rucaparib compared to the chemotherapy-containing control arm (19.6 months and 27.1 months respectively with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 1.550 (95% CI: 1.085, 2.214), p=0.0161) following a planned interim analysis (IA) in the post-approval randomized controlled study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4). == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT01968213 for ""A Study of Rucaparib as Switch Maintenance Following Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Patients With Platinum-Sensitive, High-Grade Serous or Endometrioid Epithelial Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal or Fallopian Tube Cancer (ARIEL3) "" at ClinicalTrials.gov ""Rubraca (rucaparib): restriction of indication"".

It has additional off-target antagonism at α1 receptors, without appreciable antimuscarinic or antihistaminergic properties, limiting side effects associated with other atypical antipsychotics. === Pharmacokinetics === After taking the medication by mouth, lumateperone reaches maximum plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours and has a terminal elimination half-life of 18 hours. Lumateperone is a substrate for numerous metabolic enzymes, including various glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms (UGT1A1, 1A4, and 2B15), aldo-keto reductase (AKR) isoforms (AKR1C1, 1B10, and 1C4), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, 2C8, and 1A2). Lumateperone does not cause appreciable inhibition of any common CYP450 enzymes. It is not a substrate for p-glycoprotein. == History == The FDA approved lumateperone based on evidence from three clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT01499563, Trial 2/NCT02282761 and Trial 3/NCT02469155) that enrolled 818 adult participants with schizophrenia. The trials were conducted at 33 sites in the United States. Trials 1 and 2 provided data on the benefits and side effects of lumateperone, and Trial 3 provided data on side effects only. Three trials provided data for the approval of lumateperone. In each trial, hospitalized participants with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either lumateperone or a comparison treatment (placebo or active comparator) once daily for four weeks (Trials 1 and 2) or six weeks (Trial 3). Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trials were completed. Trials 1 and 2 provided data for the assessment of benefits and side effects through four weeks of therapy. Benefit was assessed by measuring the overall improvement in the symptoms of schizophrenia. Trial 3 provided data for the assessment of side effects only during six weeks of therapy. Two Phase III lumateperone monotherapy studies were conducted and completed for the treatment of bipolar depression, those being trial Study 401 and Study 404. A third trial, Study 402, aims to test lumateperone in addition to lithium or valproate, the data pertaining this trial is due out in 2020. Study 401 was conducted solely in the United States while Study 404 was a global study and included patients from the US. Of the entire Study 404 population (381 patients), two-thirds were from Russia and Colombia. At the completion of the two monotherapy Phase III trials only Study 404 met its primary endpoint and one of its secondary endpoints. In Study 404, patients received 42 mg lumateperone once daily or placebo for six weeks. Study 404 patients saw an improvement of depressive symptoms compared to placebo as documented by a change in MADRS total score of 4.6. == References == == External links == ""Lumateperone"".

In this context, the toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist selgantolimod (SLGN) has been investigated in preclinical models and clinical trials for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, little is known regarding its action on immune effectors within the liver. Our aim was to characterise the transcriptomic changes and intercellular communication events induced by SLGN in the hepatic microenvironment. We identified  Hepatic  Our transcriptomic characterisation of SLGN sheds light into the programmes regulating KC activation. Furthermore, in addition to its previously described effect on established HBV infection and adaptive immunity, we show that SLGN impairs HBV entry. Altogether, SLGN may contribute through KCs to remodelling the intrahepatic immune microenvironment and may thus represent an important component of future combinations to cure HBV infection. Selgantolimod (GS-9688) is a Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonist that suppresses HBV in vitro. In a phase II study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of weekly selgantolimod treatment in virally suppressed individuals with chronic HBV taking oral antiviral treatment. Forty-eight patients were randomized into two cohorts (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive and -negative [n = 24 each]) to receive oral selgantolimod 3 mg, 1.5 mg, or placebo (2:2:1) once weekly for 24 weeks while maintaining oral antivirals. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a ≥1 log10 IU/ml decline in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from baseline to week 24. Post-treatment, patients continued on oral antivirals for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was reached by one participant, who was HBeAg-negative and received selgantolimod 1.5 mg. In contrast with placebo-treated patients (n = 9), only selgantolimod-treated patients (n = 39 total) had HBsAg declines greater than 0.1 log Oral selgantolimod up to 3 mg once weekly for 24 weeks was generally safe and well tolerated and led to serologic changes associated with progression to durable cure in two individuals by week 48. NCT03491553. The only robust criterion for stopping treatment in chronic hepatitis B is loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (known as functional cure), which is rare during nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. It is likely that novel antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies will be needed to achieve finite functional cure. Selgantolimod is an oral Toll-like receptor 8 agonist that has shown antiviral activity in vitro as well as safety in a phase I clinical trial with weekly dosing. In this phase II study, selgantolimod therapy was associated with transient increases in serum cytokines, rapid redistribution of circulating immune cell subsets, modest reductions in HBsAg and HBeAg levels, and occasional loss of HBsAg (5%) and HBeAg (16%) among participants with chronic hepatitis B on nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy with viral suppression. Our results support continued development of selgantolimod as a component of a future hepatitis B cure regimen. Novel finite therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are needed, since lifelong treatment is usually required with current available oral antivirals. This phase II study (NCT03615066) evaluated the safety, pharmacodynamics, and antiviral activity of selgantolimod (a Toll-like receptor 8 agonist [TLR8]) with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). Viremic patients with CHB not receiving treatment were stratified by HBeAg status and randomized 2:2:1 to TAF 25 mg/day with selgantolimod 3 mg orally once weekly (QW), selgantolimod 1.5 mg QW, or placebo. Combination therapy continued until week (W)24, followed by TAF monotherapy until W48; patients then discontinued TAF and were followed until W96 (treatment-free follow-up [TFFU] period). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion with ≥1 log Sixty-seven patients received study drug; 27 were followed during TFFU. Nausea, headache, vomiting, fatigue, and dizziness were the most common adverse events. Most adverse events were grade 1. Alanine aminotransferase flares were not observed up to W48. Four patients experienced alanine aminotransferase and hepatitis flares during TFFU; all had HBV DNA increases. Selgantolimod increased serum cytokines and chemokines and redistributed several circulating immune cell subsets. No patients achieved the primary efficacy endpoint. Mean HBsAg changes were -0.12, -0.16, and -0.12 log Selgantolimod up to 3 mg was safe and well tolerated. Pharmacodynamics and antiviral activity in viremic patients support continued study of selgantolimod in combination CHB therapies. Novel therapeutics for chronic HBV infection are needed to achieve a functional cure. In this study, we confirmed the safety and tolerability of selgantolimod (formerly GS-9688, a TLR8) when administered with tenofovir alafenamide over 24 weeks in viremic patients with chronic HBV infection. Overall, declines in HBsAg levels with selgantolimod treatment were modest; subgroup analysis indicated that patients with alanine aminotransferase levels greater than the upper limit of normal had significantly greater declines compared to those with normal alanine aminotransferase levels (-0.20  NCT03615066 be found at https://www.gileadclinicaltrials.com/transparency-policy/.",Selgantolimod,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.8980677345534787e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000916418619453907)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00100?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=6, title='Discovery of GS-9688 (Selgantolimod) as a Potent and Selective Oral Toll-Like Receptor 8 Agonist for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B | Journal of Medicinal Chemistry', type='url_citation', url='https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00100?utm_source=openai')])"

343,"('Levamlodipine besylate', '(s)-amlodipine besylate', 'Levoamlodipine besylate', 'Levamlodipine', '(s)-amlodipine')",Medical,"Levamlodipine (INN), also known as levoamlodipine or S-amlodipine is a pharmacologically active enantiomer of amlodipine. Amlodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker used as an antihypertensive and antianginal agent. It was approved by the U.S. FDA in December 2019 and is currently marketed under the brand name Conjupri. == Mechanism of action == Amlodipine blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium into the vascular and cardiac smooth muscles resulting in vasodilation and hence a fall in blood pressure. Levamlodipine is an allosteric modulator and acts on the L-type of calcium channels. Receptor binding studies have shown that out of the two forms only the (S)-enantiomer of amlodipine binds to and blocks L-type calcium channels whereas the (R)-enantiomer has no activity on these channels. The precise mechanisms by which levamlodipine relieves angina have not been fully explored, but are thought to include the following: Decreases peripheral resistance by arteriolar vasodilatation leading to the reduction in oxygen requirement and energy consumption of cardiac smooth muscles. Decreases coronary vascular resistance and can lead to an increase in coronary blood flow. == Pharmacokinetics and metabolism == Administration of levamlodipine (2.5 mg) as a single dose gives maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 8.3 to 9.3 ng/mL in 2 to 3 hrs (Tmax). It is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Levamlodipine shows approximately 93% plasma protein binding in hypertensive patients. The mean AUC0–t value (t = 48 hrs) of levamlodipine tablets (2.5 mg) is 95±14 ng·hr/mL. The plasma elimination half-life of levamlodipine has been found to be 31±13 hrs. == Clinical experience == Various clinical studies have shown that levamlodipine has more selectivity and better efficacy than (R)-amlodipine. In pooled data, from three comparative studies conducted in 200 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, 2.5 mg of levamlodipine was found to be equivalent in its blood pressure lowering efficacy to 5 mg of amlodipine. The average reduction in systolic BP was 19±3 vs 19±4, 20±2 vs 19±3 and 20±2 vs 19±3 mm of Hg recorded in standing, supine and sitting position respectively for levamlodipine compared to racemic amlodipine. The studies also reported a significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels with levamlodipine, which was not seen with amlodipine. Efficacy and safety of levamlodipine (2.5 mg, once daily) has been evaluated in the patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Levamlodipine effectively reduced the systolic BP (mean reduction 22±14 mm of Hg) in all grades of ISH. After 28 days of the treatment, overall responder rate was 73%. It significantly reduced the systolic and diastolic BP within 4 weeks with a responder rate of 96.5%. Elderly hypertensives with diabetes mellitus exhibits higher response to levamlodipine therapy than non-diabetic patients. Levamlodipine is an effective switch-over option for the elderly patients who experience oedema and other adverse events with racemic amlodipine. == Safety and tolerability == The use of racemic amlodipine is commonly associated with adverse events like peripheral edema and other side effects like headache, dizziness, flushing and abdominal pain. Controlled clinical trials showed that levamlodipine is rarely associated with these side effects. No controlled clinical study of levamlodipine has been performed in patients with hepatic impairment and renal impairment. Clinical studies in patients with normal liver function have shown that there is no elevation in the hepatic enzymes with the use of levamlodipine. However, caution should be taken while administering levamlodipine to such patients. In a postmarketing surveillance study, levamlodipine (2.5/5 mg) was found to be well tolerated (n = 1859) in patients with hypertension. Out of 314 patients, who reported peripheral edema with conventional amlodipine were switched over to levamlodipine and edema was resolved in 310 patients (98.72%) at the end of 4 weeks. Only in 4 patients was edema sustained. Only 30 patients (out of 1859) reported side effects. These side effects included vertigo, tachycardia, cough, headache, fever, mild difficulty in breathing and edema. Adverse events were mild in nature and no serious adverse events were reported. == Society and culture == Aside from the U.S., levamlodipine is currently marketed in Brazil under the brand name Novanlo (Biolab Sanus) and in India as Eslo (Zuventus Healthcare Ltd.), Asomex (Emcure Pharmaceutical Ltd.) and Espin (Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd.). == References ==",Levamlodipine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7417760065873154e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003469580551609397)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levamlodipine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Levamlodipine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levamlodipine?utm_source=openai')])"

It was developed by Merck Sharp & Dohme in 1971, as MK647, after showing promise in a research project studying more potent chemical analogs of aspirin. It was first sold under the brand name Dolobid, marketed by Merck & Co., but generic versions are now widely available. It is classed as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is available in 250 mg and 500 mg tablets. == Mechanism of action == Like all NSAIDs, diflunisal acts by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, hormones which are involved in inflammation and pain. Diflunisal also has an antipyretic effect, but this is not a recommended use of the drug. It has been found to inhibit p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), which are epigenetic regulators that control the levels of proteins that cause inflammation or are involved in cell growth. It has been reported that diflunisal has some antibacterial activity in vitro against Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS). == Duration of effect == Though diflunisal has an onset time of 1 hour, and maximum analgesia at 2 to 3 hours, the plasma levels of diflunisal will not be steady until repeated doses are taken. The long plasma half-life is a distinctive feature of diflunisal in comparison to similar drugs. To increase the rate at which the diflunisal plasma levels become steady, a loading dose is usually used. It is primarily used to treat symptoms of arthritis, and for acute pain following oral surgery, especially removal of wisdom teeth. Effectiveness of diflunisal is similar to other NSAIDs, but the duration of action is twelve hours or more. This means fewer doses per day are required for chronic administration. In acute use, it is popular in dentistry when a single dose after oral surgery can maintain analgesia until the patient is asleep that night. == Medical uses == Pain, mild to moderate Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Injury to tendons Inflammation ATTR amyloidosis === Amyloidosis === Both diflunisal and several of its analogues have been shown to be inhibitors of transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis, a disease which currently has few treatment options. Phase I trials have shown the drug to be well tolerated, with a small Phase II trial (double-blind, placebo-controlled, 130 patients for 2 years) in 2013 showing a reduced rate of disease progression and preserved quality of life. However a significantly larger Phase III trial would be needed to prove the drugs effectiveness for treating this condition. == Side effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. === Gastrointestinal === The inhibition of prostaglandins has the effect of decreasing the protection given to the stomach from its own acid. Like all NSAIDS, this leads to an increased risk of stomach ulcers, and their complications, with long-term use. Elderly users of diflunisal are at greater risk for serious GI events. Increased risk of GI events including bleeding, ulceration, and stomach or intestine perforation.

It is an orally available poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor marketed by Pfizer for the treatment of advanced breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations. Talazoparib is similar to the first in class PARP inhibitor, olaparib. The most common adverse reactions of any grade were fatigue, anemia, nausea, neutropenia, headache, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea, decreased appetite. It was approved in October 2018, in the United States and June 2019, in the European Union for germline BRCA-mutated, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In January 2024, the European Commission approved talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adults. == Medical uses == Talazoparib is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is indicated for the treatment of people with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm), HER2‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer; and, in combination with enzalutamide, for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). == Side effects == The most serious side effects in studies were related to the blood forming system and included anaemia (low red blood cell count), neutropenia (low neutrophil blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Serious forms of these conditions (grade 3 to 4) occurred in 39%, 21% and 15% of patients, respectively. Other adverse effects such as headache, nausea, hair loss and fatigue were mostly mild. The FDA label includes warnings and precautions for myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, myelosuppression, and embryo-fetal toxicity. == Interactions == Combination with drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein or BCRP may increase talazoparib concentrations in the body. == Mechanism of action == Talazoparib acts as an inhibitor of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) which aids in single strand DNA repair. Cells that have BRCA1/2 mutations are susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of PARP inhibitors because of an accumulation of DNA damage. Talazoparib is theorized to have a higher potency than olaparib due to the additional mechanism of action called PARP trapping. PARP trapping is the mechanism of action where the PARP molecule is trapped on the DNA, which interferes with the cells ability to replicate. Talazoparib is found to be ~100 fold more efficient in PARP trapping than olaparib. However, this increased potency may not translate directly to clinical effectiveness as many other factors must be considered. == History == The approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating breast cancer was based on EMBRACA (NCT01945775), an open‑label trial randomizing 431 participants (2:1) with gBRCAm HER2‑negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer to receive talazoparib (1 mg) or physician's choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine). All participants were required to have a known deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCA mutation and must have received no more than three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Participants were required to have received treatment with an anthracycline and/or a taxane (unless contraindicated) in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and/or metastatic treatment setting. The trial was conducted at 145 sites in the US, Europe, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and Australia. The efficacy of talazoparib used to treat prostate cancer was evaluated in TALAPRO-2 (NCT03395197), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-cohort trial enrolling 399 participants with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus either talazoparib 0.5 mg or placebo daily. Participants were required to have a prior orchiectomy and, if not performed, received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs. Participants with prior systemic therapy for mCRPC were excluded; however, prior CYP17 inhibitors or docetaxel for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) was permitted. Randomization was stratified by previous treatment with a CYP17 inhibitor or docetaxel. HRR genes (ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, or RAD51C) were assessed prospectively using tumor tissue and/or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based next generation sequencing assays. == Society and culture == === Economics === Talazoparib was developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and Medivation Inc. acquired all worldwide rights to talazoparib in August 2015. Medivation acquired talazoparib for $410 million with additional payments of up to $160 million in royalties and milestones.

Darifenacin has not been implicated in causing liver enzyme elevations or clinically apparent acute liver injury. Darifenacin hydrobromide is a selective muscarinic M(3) receptor antagonist that is indicated for use in treatment of overactive bladder disorder. Darifenacin was found to have a short terminal elimination half-life after intravenous and immediate-release oral dosage forms (3-4 hours) but this increased with a prolonged-release (PR) formulation (14-16 hours). The absolute bioavailability of darifenacin from 7.5 and 15 mg PR tablets was estimated to be 15.4% and 18.6%, respectively. With repeated once-daily oral administration of the PR formulation, peak plasma concentrations of darifenacin are achieved approximately 7 hours post-dose. After oral administration, darifenacin is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and very little unchanged drug (<2%) is recovered in the faeces. Steady state is achieved after 6 days of once-daily administration of the PR formulation. As expected, values of peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve are dose dependent, although the increase in plasma concentrations is proportionally greater than the increase in dose owing to saturation of presystemic metabolism. From intravenous administration, it has been established that darifenacin possesses a moderate-to-high hepatic extraction ratio, with high plasma clearance (36-52 L/h) and a volume of distribution (165-276L) that exceeds total body water. It is highly protein bound (98%), primarily to alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Darifenacin is subject to extensive hepatic metabolism, with 3% of unchanged drug excreted in urine and faeces. Metabolism is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 2D6 and 3A4, the main metabolic routes being monohydroxylation in the dihydrobenzfuran ring, dihydrobenzfuran ring opening, and N-dealkylation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen. Several possibly important drug-drug interactions have been identified with darifenacin, including ketoconazole, erythromycin and fluconazole, each of which increases darifenacin mean C(max) by 9.52-, 2.28- and 1.88-fold, respectively. When given with imipramine, darifenacin causes 1.6-fold higher plasma concentrations of the antidepressant and its major metabolite. Moderate hepatic impairment, but not renal insufficiency, has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of the drug. The pharmacokinetic profile of darifenacin is not affected by food.

Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy were treated with oral daily CP-547,632 in combination with paclitaxel 225 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC = 6 every 3 weeks. Pharmacokinetics parameters for CP-547,632 and paclitaxel were determined independently and during co-administration. Seventy patients were enrolled and 68 patients were treated, 37 in phase 1 and 31 in phase 2 (14 with the combination and 17 with chemotherapy alone). Dose-limiting toxicity of CP-547,632 250 mg by mouth daily in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin was grade 3 rash and grade 3 diarrhea despite medical intervention. CP-547,632 did not significantly affect the pharmacologic profiles of paclitaxel and carboplatin. No subject had CR. In phase I, seven subjects (22.6%) had a confirmed partial response. In phase II, four subjects (28.6%) receiving CP-547,632 plus chemotherapy had a confirmed partial response. In the phase II chemotherapy alone group, four subjects (25%) had a confirmed partial response. The combination of CP-547,632 and paclitaxel and carboplatin was well-tolerated at doses up to 200 mg by mouth daily. Dose-limiting toxicity of CP-547,632 at 250 mg consisted of diarrhea and rash. CP-547,632 did not increase the objective response rate to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFRs) is a key pathway initiating endothelial cell proliferation and migration resulting in angiogenesis, a requirement for human tumor growth and metastasis. Abrogation of signaling through VEGFR by a variety of approaches has been demonstrated to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth. Small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinase have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis, inhibit tumor growth, and prevent metastases. Our goal was to discover and characterize an p.o. active VEGFR-2 small molecule inhibitor. A novel isothiazole, CP-547,632, was identified as a potent inhibitor of the VEGFR-2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) kinases (IC(50) = 11 and 9 nM, respectively). It is selective relative to epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor beta, and other related TKs. It also inhibits VEGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in a whole cell assay with an IC(50) value of 6 nM. After oral administration of CP-547,632 to mice bearing NIH3T3/H-ras tumors, VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in tumors was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion (EC(50) = 590 ng/ml). These plasma concentrations correlated well with the observed concentrations of the compound necessary to inhibit VEGF-induced corneal angiogenesis in BALB/c mice. A sponge angiogenesis assay was used to directly compare the inhibitory activities of CP-547,632 against FGF receptor 2 or VEGFR-2; this compound potently inhibits both basic FGF and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. The antitumor efficacy of this agent was evaluated after once daily p.o. administration to athymic mice bearing human xenografts and resulted in as much as 85% tumor growth inhibition. CP-547,632 is a well-tolerated, orally-bioavailable inhibitor presently under clinical investigation for the treatment of human malignancies.","Cp 547,632",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001584850688232109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0010375360725447536), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031919742468744516)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0005530327325686812)])","('INFO; https://www.glpbio.com/gc38575.html,https://www.biocompare.com/11119-Chemicals-and-Reagents/16341887-CP-547-632/,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/cp-547632-cas-252003-65-9-mexhy-13302-5,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/cp-547-632-cas-252003-65-9,https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/data/drug/details/d00ypr,https://www.glpbio.com/cp-547632.html,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~821472,https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/cp-547632-hydrochloride-cas-252003-71-7-mexhy-13302b-50,https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_IN_CB82473822.htm,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~824551,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/10370762,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB12962 ', [])"

The extent of metabolism of [(14)C]tanzisertib was variable, with <10% metabolized in dog and human, <20% metabolized in rabbit and monkey and >75% metabolized in rat and mouse. Primary metabolic pathways in human and dog hepatocytes, were direct glucuronidation and oxidation of cyclohexanol to a keto metabolite, which was subsequently reduced to parent or cis-isomer, followed by glucuronidation. Rat and mouse produced oxidative metabolites and cis-isomer, including direct glucuronides and sulfates of tanzisertib and cis-isomer. 2. Enzymology of oxido-reductive pathways revealed that human aldo-keto reductases AKR1C1, 1C2, 1C3 and 1C4 were responsible for oxido-reduction of tanzisertib, CC-418424 and keto tanzisertib. Characterizations of enzyme kinetics revealed that AKR1C4 had a high affinity for reduction of keto tanzisertib to tanzisertib compared to other isoforms.

CC-418424 (S-cis isomer of tanzisertib) was the major plasma metabolite in rats (38.4-46.4% of plasma radioactivity), while the predominant plasma metabolite in humans and dogs was M18 (tanzisertib-/CC-418424 glucuronide), representing 7.7 and 3.2% of plasma radioactivity, respectively. Prevalent biliary metabolite in rats and dogs, M18 represented 16.8 and 17.1% of dose, respectively. 4.

355,"('Etifoxine',)",Medical,"Etifoxine, sold under the trade name Stresam among others, is a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, primarily indicated for short-term management of adjustment disorder, specifically instances of situational depression accompanied by anxiety, such as stress-induced anxiety. Administration is by mouth. Side effects associated with etifoxine use include slight drowsiness, headache, skin eruptions, and allergic reactions. In rare cases, etifoxine has been linked to severe skin and liver toxicity, as well as menstrual bleeding between periods. Unlike benzodiazepines, etifoxine does not cause sedation or lack of coordination. Etifoxine acts as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator and as a ligand for translocator proteins. Both mechanisms are conjectured to contribute to its anxiolytic properties. Etifoxine was developed in the 1960s and was introduced for medical use in France in 1979. Its marketed in 53 countries worldwide, although it remains unavailable in the United States. Throughout the 2010s and early 2020s, the safety profile of etifoxine was scrutinized within France and the European Union, prompted by reports of toxicity. The investigation revealed that instances of toxicity were infrequent, and etifoxine was allowed to remain on the market. == Medical uses == Etifoxine has historically been used in the treatment of ""psychosomatic manifestations of anxiety"", for instance ""autonomic dystonia, particularly with cardiovascular expression"". Subsequently, the indication for etifoxine has been more formalized as treatment of adjustment disorder (situational depression) with anxiety (ADWA) (e.g., stress-related anxiety). Etifoxine has been found to reduce scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) in people with adjustment disorder with anxiety by approximately 50 to 75% after 4 weeks of treatment in clinical trials (e.g., AMETIS, ETILOR, ETIZAL, STRETI studies). The medication is similarly effective or more effective than benzodiazepines like lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam and more effective than buspirone for adjustment disorder with anxiety on the basis of directly comparative randomized controlled trials. However, in the AMETIS study, both etifoxine and lorazepam failed to show greater effectiveness over placebo. In the trials comparing etifoxine to clonazepam, lorazepam, and alprazolam, total daily doses of the benzodiazepines were limited to their maintenance dose, set at 1 mg, 2 mg, and 1.5 mg, respectively, in t.i.d. Such an inflexible dosing regime limits the utility benzodiazepines offer in practice; e.g. lorazepam and alprazolam can be used as needed for situational anxiety in which continuous use is unnecessary or excessive, while clonazepam can be titrated to response when continuous relief is indicated, up to a maximum of 4 mg a day, four times greater than the dose used in comparison with etifoxine over the 24 week duration of the trial. In general, they offer a degree of personalization that is not possible with etifoxine. Indeed, better evidence is required before etifoxine can be said to replace benzodiazepines in practice, especially considering the trials above were relatively small in size, along with the high attrition rates and lack of personalization of the benzodiazepines used. The usual dosage of etifoxine (as the hydrochloride salt) is 150 to 200 mg per day in divided doses of 50 to 100 mg two to three times per day (e.g., 50 mg–50 mg–100 mg). It is taken for a few days to a few weeks, but no longer than 12 weeks. === Available forms === Etifoxine is provided in the form of oral capsules containing 50 mg etifoxine hydrochloride. == Contraindications == Etifoxine is contraindicated in people with circulatory shock, severe liver impairment, severe kidney impairment, myasthenia gravis, galactosemia (due to lactose in the drug formulation), severe respiratory failure, and hypersensitivity (allergy) to etifoxine. The medication is not recommended in children or adolescents under the age of 18 and is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to insufficient data. Caution is warranted with regard to combining etifoxine and other central depressants such as benzodiazepines, central analgesics, antipsychotics, sedative antihistamines, and alcohol. == Side effects == Side effects of etifoxine include slight drowsiness and headache. Rarely, etifoxine can cause benign skin eruptions or rashes and allergic reactions such as hives and angioedema. Etifoxine shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syndromes than those of benzodiazepines. No cases of misuse or dependence with etifoxine were identified in a French pharmacovigilance survey, which is also in contrast to benzodiazepines. Etifoxine has been associated rarely with cases of severe dermal toxicity and liver toxicity. Skin and subcutaneous disorders are the most frequently reported, but these generally resolve after drug cessation. A 2012 review of etifoxine by the French National Pharmacovigilance Committee determined that etifoxine was safe and continued to provide a favorable alternative to benzodiazepine anxiolytics. The committee found (for a ten-year pharmacovigilance period) that safety concerns were rare or very rare and that the incidence of idiosyncratic hepatic (liver) problems were very rare. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Unlike benzodiazepines, etifoxine may produce its anxiolytic effects through a dual mechanism, by directly binding to GABAA receptors and (purportedly, exact binding site undetermined) to the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO). This results in stimulation of the biosynthesis of endogenous neurosteroids, for instance allopregnanolone, a highly potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator. At GABAA receptors etifoxine binds at the α+β− interface and preferentially potentiates α2β3γ2 and α3β3γ2 receptor types. This direct allosteric potentiation can only be observed at relatively high concentrations (starting at >1 mM) and is perhaps not physiologically relevant at normal human doses. This is different from benzodiazepines and etifoxine can be used alongside benzodiazepines to potentiate their effects without competing for binding sites; however, it also means that the direct effects of etifoxine are not reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. === Pharmacokinetics === Etifoxine is taken via oral administration. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is well-absorbed, with a bioavailability of 90%. The time to peak levels of etifoxine is 2 to 3 hours. The plasma protein binding of etifoxine is 88 to 95%. It does not bind to blood cells. The drug is known to cross the placental barrier. Etifoxine is metabolized in the liver into several metabolites. One of these metabolites, diethyletifoxine, is pharmacologically active. The elimination half-life of etifoxine is 6 hours and of diethyletifoxine is almost 20 hours. Etifoxine is eliminated in three phases. The drug is excreted mainly in urine in the form of metabolites. It is also excreted in bile. Only small amounts are excreted unchanged. == Chemistry == Etifoxine is a nonbenzodiazepine—that is, it is similarly a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator but its chemical structure is distinct from that of benzodiazepines. Instead, it is a benzoxazine derivative. Etifoxine is used pharmaceutically as the hydrochloride salt. (S)-Etifoxine, the (S) enantiomer of etifoxine, was under development by Anvyl Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neuropathic pain, but development was discontinued. A deuterated form of etifoxine with improved pharmacokinetics known as deuterated etifoxine (GRX-917) is under development by GABA Therapeutics for the treatment anxiety and mood disorders. == History == Etifoxine was developed by Hoechst in the 1960s. It was introduced for medical use in France in 1979. Since at least 2000, etifoxine has been marketed by the French pharmaceutical company Biocodex. Following reports of post-marketing toxicity, the safety of etifoxine was reassessed by the French government and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In January 2022, the EMA ""finalized its review of Stresam and concluded that the medicine can continue to be used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, but it must not be used in patients who previously had severe skin reactions or severe liver problems after taking etifoxine."" == Society and culture == === Names === Etifoxine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known by the older and much-lesser-used synonym etafenoxine and by its developmental code name Hoe 36801. Etifoxine is marketed under the brand name Stresam. It has also been marketed under the brand name Strezam, specifically in Russia. === Availability === Etifoxine has been marketed in 53 countries as of 2022. Some of the countries in which etifoxine has been marketed include Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Ukraine. Etifoxine is not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of the European Union, and hence is not marketed in these regions. However, etifoxine is marketed in five European Union member states (France, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania). == See also == Alpidem == References == == Further reading == == External links == Stesam (etifoxine hydrochloride) Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) Stresam (etifoxine hydrochloride) Patient Leaflet Stresam (etifoxine hydrochloride) Package Insert Etifoxine French Commission Nationale de Pharmacovigilance Review (Original French) Etifoxine French Commission Nationale de Pharmacovigilance Review (English Translation) Etifoxine European Medicines Agency Assessment Report",Etifoxine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9907753085135482e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.953480184776708e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etifoxine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Etifoxine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etifoxine?utm_source=openai')])"
356,"('Chloropyramine hydrochloride', 'Chloropyramine', 'Halopyramine', 'Chlorpyramine', 'Anaphylline')",Medical,"Chloropyramine is a first-generation antihistamine drug approved in several Eastern European countries such as Russia for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and other atopic (allergic) conditions. Related indications for clinical use include angioedema, allergic reactions to insect bites, food and drug allergies, and anaphylactic shock. Chloropyramine is known as a competitive reversible H1 receptor antagonist (also known as an H1 inverse agonist), meaning that it exerts its pharmacological action by competing with histamine for the H1 subtype histamine receptor. By blocking the effects of histamine, the drug inhibits the vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and tissue edema associated with histamine release in the tissue. The H1 antagonistic properties of chloropyramine can be used by researchers for the purposes of blocking the effects of histamine on cells and tissues. In addition, chloropyramine has some anticholinergic properties. Chloropyramine's anticholinergic properties and the fact that it can pass through the blood–brain barrier are linked to its clinical side effects such as drowsiness, weakness, vertigo, fatigue, dry mouth, constipation, and rarely — visual disturbances and increase of intraocular pressure. == Contraindications == Contraindications for parenteral or oral administration include benign prostatic hyperplasia, peptic ulcer, pyloric and duodenal stenosis, uncontrolled glaucoma, pregnancy and breast-feeding. It is not intended for the management of acute bronchospasm. It should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular diseases, and asthma. == Adverse effects == In children, it can induce agitation, and in many adult patients, dizziness may be observed. Because of the pronounced sedative effect, the preparation should be prescribed cautiously in drivers and people working with machines. A large study on people 65 years old or older linked the development of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia to the ""higher cumulative"" use of first-generation antihistamines, due to their anticholinergic properties. == Interactions == Chloropyramine should not be used internally with MAO inhibitors. Because of its anticholinergic activity, concurrent administration with cholinomimetics is not advisable. Chloropyramine should also not be used internally with alcohol, sedatives, and hypnotics because of the potentiation of the effects. General anesthetics, opioids, and other depressants potentiate the sedative effect of chloropyramine. == Dosage == In cases of severe allergic reactions, chloropyramine can be injected intramuscularly or intravenously. Oral administration: In adults, 25 mg can be taken 3 to 4 times daily (up to 150 mg); in children over 5 years old, 25 mg can be taken 2 to 3 times daily. For external application, the skin or the eye conjunctiva can be treated up to several times a day by applying a thin layer of cream or ointment containing 1% chloropyramine hydrochloride. == Trade names == Allergopress, Chimpharm AD (KZ) Allergosan, Sopharma AD (BG, GE, LV) Suprastin, Egis Pharmaceuticals PLC (GE, HU, KZ, LT, LV, UA, RU) Supralgon, Biopharm JSC (GE) Supranorm-Tsiteli A, Rompharm Co.

357,"('Triclocarban', 'Solubacter', 'Cutisan', 'Procutene', 'Genoface')",Medical,"Triclocarban (sometimes abbreviated as TCC) is an antibacterial chemical once common in, but now phased out of, personal care products like soaps and lotions. It was originally developed for the medical field. Although the mode of action is unknown, TCC can be effective in fighting infections by targeting the growth of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Additional research seeks to understand its potential for causing antibacterial resistance and its effects on organismal and environmental health. == Usage == Triclocarban has been used as an antimicrobial and antifungal compound since the 1960s. It was commonly found in personal care products as an antimicrobial in soaps, lotions, deodorants, toothpaste, and plastic. As of 2005 about 80% of all antimicrobial bar soap sold in the United States contained triclocarban. In 2011 United States consumers were spending nearly 1 billion dollars annually on products containing triclocarban and triclosan. In December 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all companies to prove within the next year, that triclocarban is not harmful to consumers. Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, and Avon began phasing out antibacterial ingredients due to health concerns. By 2016 usage of triclocarban in soaps had declined to 40%, and that September the FDA banned triclocarban, triclosan and 17 other common antibacterial chemicals by September 2017, for their failure to be proven safe, or more effective than plain soap and water. == Chemical structure and properties == Triclocarban, 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea, is a white powder that is insoluble in water. While triclocarban has two chlorinated phenyl rings, it is structurally similar to carbanilide compounds often found in pesticides (such as diuron) and some drugs. Chlorination of ring structures is often associated with hydrophobicity, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of living organisms. For this reason, chlorine is also a common component of persistent organic pollutants. Triclocarban is incompatible with strong oxidizing reagents and strong bases, reaction with which could result in safety concerns such as explosion, toxicity, gas, and heat. === Synthesis of triclocarban === There are two commercial routes used for the production of triclocarban, using the reaction of isocyanates with nucleophiles such as amines to form ureas: 4-chlorophenylisocyanate is reacted with 3,4-dichloroaniline 3,4-dichlorophenylisocyanate is reacted with 4-chloroaniline The purity specification in the draft USP monograph for triclocarban is: not less than 97.0% w/w. The purity of commercial production is greater, 98% w/w. == Mechanism of action == === Bacteria === Triclocarban is predominantly active against gram positive bacteria (bacteria with a thick peptidoglycan wall). The precise mechanism of action of triclocarban is unknown, but it is shown to be bacteriostatic, which prevents bacterial proliferation. === Humans === The specific mechanism of action for triclocarban's health effects on humans, like in bacteria, is unclear. Generally, in vitro, triclocarban enhances the gene expression of other steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and cortisol. It is hypothesized that the compound acts similar to cofactors or coactivators that modulate the activity of estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. Experiments show that triclocarban activates constitutive androstane receptor and estrogen receptor alpha both in vivo and in vitro and might have the potential to alter normal physiological homeostasis. Activation of these receptors amplifies gene expression and, in doing so, may be the mechanistic base of triclocarban's health impact on humans. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether triclocarban increases the activity of sex steroid hormones by binding to the receptors or by binding to and sensitizing the receptor coactivators. == Antibacterial properties == Triclocarban acts to treat both initial bacterial skin and mucosal infections as well as those infections at risk for superinfection. In vitro, triclocarban has been found to be effective against various strains of staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. It has been shown to be effective as an antibacterial even at very low levels. Triclocarban's minimum inhibitory concentration has been found to range from 0.5 to 8 mg/L for these various strains. Triclocarban is unquestionably bacteriostatic only for gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, which suggests that the mechanism of triclocarban's antibacterial activity is through its destabilization of bacterial cell walls. === Resistance === Exposure of organisms like fish, algae, and humans to low levels of triclocarban and other antibacterial chemicals kills weak microbes and allows the stronger, resistant strains to proliferate. As microbes share genes, an increase in resistant strains increases the probability that weak microbes acquire these resistance genes. The consequence is a new colony of drug resistant microbes. When resistant microbes are exposed to antimicrobials, they increase their expression of genes that confer this resistance. The risk of bacterial antibiotic resistance has been studied by quantitatively monitoring the abundance of the tetQ gene in wastewater microcosms. As tetQ is the most common resistance gene in the environment and encodes for ribosomal protection proteins, the amount that it expresses correlates with the amount of resistance in a microbial population. The addition of triclocarban was shown to increase the expression of this tetQ gene. TetQ gene expression in bacteria was also found to be significantly increased when multiple antimicrobials such as tetracycline, triclosan, and triclocarban were added to an experimental system at the same time. Combining these compounds affects resistance by creating a situation where co-selection (or natural selection by more than one reagent) for resistance genes occurs. The complex nature of microbial communities and the multitude of antibiotics present in aquatic environments often leads to this sort of dynamic selection event and the multiple resistance patterns seen in naturally occurring bacteria. == Environmental fate == When triclocarban is manufactured, 139 toxic, carcinogenic byproducts, such as 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline, are released. More of these carcinogens can be released upon chemical, physical and biological attack of triclocarban. The duration of triclocarban chemical in personal product use is relatively short. Upon disposal, the triclocarban is washed down the drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, where about 97-98% of triclocarban is removed from the water. Discharge of effluent from these treatment plants and disposal of sludge on land is the primary route of environmental exposure to triclocarban. Research shows that triclocarban and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and sludge (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment. Due to their hydrophobic nature, significant amounts of them in wastewater streams partition into sludge, with concentrations at mg/kg levels. The volume of triclocarban reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ± 194,000 kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 – 48.2% of its total U.S. consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, meadow fescue, carrots and pinto beans. Studies show that substantial quantities of triclocarban (227,000 – 454,000 kg/y) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters. == Environmental concerns == === Waste water === High concentrations of triclocarban may be found in wastewater. As of 2011 it was among the top ten most commonly detected organic wastewater compounds in terms of frequency and concentration. Triclocarban has been found in increasing concentrations over the past five years and is now more frequently detected than triclosan. === Wildlife toxicity === Triclocarban has a hazard quotient rating of greater than one, which indicates the potential for adverse effects on organisms due to toxicity. As triclocarban is found in high concentrations in aquatic environments, there are concerns regarding its toxicity to aquatic species. Specifically, triclocarban has been shown to be toxic to amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants, and traces of the compound have been found in Atlantic dolphins. Triclocarban may disrupt hormones critical to the developmental and endocrine processes in exposed animal wildlife. The neurological and reproductive systems are particularly affected through contact with this compound. Triclocarban may also affect animal wildlife behavior. For example, triclosan and triclocarban are 100–1,000 times more effective in inhibiting and killing algae, crustaceans, and fish than they are in killing microbes. Triclocarban and triclosan have been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins. === Bioaccumulation === Triclocarban bioaccumulation is possible in a number of organisms. Earthworms are known to store this chemical in their bodies and, because of their ecological role as a food source, they have the potential to move triclocarban up the food chain. Microbial species found in soils also bioaccumulate triclocarban. However, the health of these microbes has not been found to be affected by the presence of the chemical. Triclocarban is rapidly accumulated in both algae and adult caged snails. Moreover, triclocarban is more likely than triclosan to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation occurs in plants treated with water containing triclocarban. However, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of triclocarban for humans is represented by vegetable consumption. Thus, the concentration of triclocarban in edible portions of plants is a negligible exposure pathway for humans. The potential for triclocarban to bioaccumulate in plants has been exploited in the construction of wetlands meant to help remove triclocarban from wastewater. These constructed wetlands are considered a cost-effective treatment option for the removal of PPCPs, including triclocarban and triclosan, from domestic water effluent. Such compounds tend to concentrate in the roots of wetland plants. Potential ecological risks associated with this method are the decrease of root systems in wetland plants, reduced nutrient uptake, decreased competitive ability, and increased potential for uprooting. Due to these risks, the long term exposure of wetland ecosystems to wastewater containing triclocarban as a major solution to wastewater pollution is still under discussion. == Health concerns == === Personal care === One study has investigated how triclocarban remains in the human system after using a bar of soap with traces of triclocarban. Analysis of urine samples from human test subjects shows that, after triclocarban has undergone glucuronidation, its oxidative metabolites are less readily excreted than triclocarban itself. This same study performed topical treatments of triclocarban on rats and, by analyzing urine and plasma levels, demonstrated that triclocarban does remain in the organism's system. === Endocrine disorders === Triclocarban induces weak responses mediated by aryl hydrocarbon, estrogen, and androgen receptors in vitro. This has yet to be confirmed in vivo. In vitro, the dihydrotestosterone-dependent activation of androgen receptor-responsive gene expression is enhanced by triclocarban by up to 130%. Triclocarban is also a potent inhibitor of the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in vitro. Additionally, triclocarban amplifies the bioactivity of testosterone and other androgens. This increased activity may have adverse implications for reproductive health. Triclocarban studies on rats exhibited increased size of the specimens' prostate glands. The amplification of sex hormones could promote the growth of breast and prostate cancer. The chemical toxicity of triclocarban with respect to lethality is low (LD50 >5000 mg/kg). Its rate of skin absorption is also low. Repeated low-dose exposure, however, can cause endocrine disruption over time. == Safety == Spillage may increase the risk of human, ecological, and environmental exposure to triclocarban. Immediate removal and restraint of the spill, including triclocarban as dust, is urged. Although triclocarban has few to no direct detrimental effects on health aside from allergic reactions, preventing exposure to triclocarban is recommended. Since triclocarban enters the body through pores, wearing gloves, properly washing hands, and overall proper hygiene reduces the risk of skin exposure and irritation. High concentrations of triclocarban dust may remain in the lungs and inhibit lung and respiratory function. For individuals with prior respiratory conditions, triclocarban exacerbates the severity of respiratory diseases, and proper protection is recommended as a precaution. In case of exposure to triclocarban, the individual is suggested to wash the area with water or to clear the respiratory pathways. In addition to its adverse effects on humans and the environment, solid triclocarban is a fire hazard. It is particularly combustible as dust. Contamination with other oxidizing agents may also result in combustion. == Policy == The Food and Drug Administration began to review the safety of triclocarban and triclosan in the 1970s, but due to the difficulties of finding antimicrobial alternatives, no final policy, or ""drug monograph,"" was established. Legal action by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 2010 forced the FDA to review triclocarban and triclosan. The United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains regulatory control over triclocarban and triclosan. On September 2, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration announced that triclosan and triclocarban must be removed from all antibacterial soap products by late 2017. Triclocarban is similar in its use and adverse health impacts as triclosan, and hexachlorophene which was already prohibited by the FDA. == Current research == Scientists are searching for more sustainable antimicrobials that maintain their effectiveness while being minimally toxic to the environment, humans, and wildlife. This entails low degrees of bioaccumulation and rapid, clean biodegradation in existing wastewater treatment facilities. A lowered potential or no potential for resistance is also preferable. These next generation chemicals should aim to act on a broad spectrum of microbes and pathogens while also being minimally toxic and bioaccumulating in non-target species. Synthesis of these compounds could be improved upon by finding renewable sources for their production that lacks occupational hazards.

358,"('Ex-a2535', 'S6648', 'Compound 8 [pmid: 26509551]', 'Pf 06282999')",Medical," The thiouracil derivative PF-06282999 [2-(6-(5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-2-thioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)acetamide] is an irreversible inactivator of myeloperoxidase and is currently in clinical trials for the potential treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Concerns over idiosyncratic toxicity arising from bioactivation of the thiouracil motif to reactive species in the liver have been largely mitigated through the physicochemical (molecular weight, lipophilicity, and topological polar surface area) characteristics of PF-06282999, which generally favor elimination via nonmetabolic routes. To test this hypothesis, pharmacokinetics and disposition studies were initiated with PF-06282999 using animals and in vitro assays, with the ultimate goal of predicting human pharmacokinetics and elimination mechanisms. Consistent with its physicochemical properties, PF-06282999 was resistant to metabolic turnover from liver microsomes and hepatocytes from animals and humans and was devoid of cytochrome P450 inhibition. In vitro transport studies suggested moderate intestinal permeability and minimal transporter-mediated hepatobiliary disposition. PF-06282999 demonstrated moderate plasma protein binding across all of the species. Pharmacokinetics in preclinical species characterized by low to moderate plasma clearances, good oral bioavailability at 3- to 5-mg/kg doses, and renal clearance as the projected major clearance mechanism in humans. Human pharmacokinetic predictions using single-species scaling of dog and/or monkey pharmacokinetics were consistent with the parameters observed in the first-in-human study, conducted in healthy volunteers at a dose range of 20-200 mg PF-06282999. In summary, disposition characteristics of PF-06282999 were relatively similar across preclinical species and humans, with renal excretion of the unchanged parent emerging as the principal clearance mechanism in humans, which was anticipated based on its physicochemical properties and supported by preclinical studies.

Autoradiographic studies using tritiated W-7 showed that this compound penetrates the cell membrane, is distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, and inhibits proliferation of Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells. Cytoplasmic [3H]W-7 was excluded completely within 6 hr after removal of [3H]W-7 from the culture medium. N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, an analogue of W-7 that interacts only weakly with calmodulin, proved to be a much weaker inhibitor of cell proliferation. CHO-K1 cells were synchronized by shaking during mitosis and then released into the cell cycle in the presence of 25 microM W-7 or 2.5 mM thymidine for 12 hr. Cell division was observed approximately 6 hr later. The results suggest that the effect of W-7 on cell proliferation might be through selective inhibition of the G1/S boundary phase, which is similar to the effect of excess thymidine.

Recent studies have shown that murine double minute2 homolog (MDM2) protein inhibitors are promising anticancer agents. MI-773 is a novel and specific antagonist of MDM2, however, the molecular mechanism of its anti-NB activity remains unclear. NB cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay following MI-773 treatment. Cell cycle progression was analyzed using PI staining and apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V/PI staining. The molecular mechanisms by which MI-773 exerted its effects were investigated using a microarray. The results showed that disturbance of the MDM2/p53 axis by MI-773 resulted in potent suppression of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in NB cells. In addition, microarray analysis showed that MI-773 led to significant downregulation of genes involved in the G MI-773 is a recently developed small-molecule inhibitor of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) proto-oncogene. Preclinical data on the anti-tumour activity of MI-773 are limited and indicate that tumour cell lines (CLs) with mutated TP53 are more resistant to MI-773 than wild type TP53. Here, we explored the compound's therapeutic potential in vitro using a panel of 274 annotated CLs derived from a diversity of tumours. MI-773 exhibited a pronounced selectivity and moderate potency, with anti-tumour activity in the sub-micromolar range in about 15% of the CLs. The most sensitive tumour types were melanoma, sarcoma, renal and gastric cancers, leukaemia, and lymphoma. A COMPARE analysis showed that the profile of MI-773 was similar to that of Nutlin-3a, the first potent inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interactions, and, in addition, had a superior potency. In contrast, it poorly correlates with profiles of compounds targeting the p53 pathway with another mechanism of action. OMICS analyses confirmed that MI-773 was primarily active in CLs with wild type TP53. In silico biomarker investigations revealed that the TP53 mutation status plus the aggregated expression levels of 11 genes involved in the p53 signalling pathway predicted sensitivity or resistance of CLs to inhibitors of p53-MDM2 interactions reliably. The results obtained for MI-773 could help to refine the selection of cancer patients for therapy. Neuroblastoma (NB), which accounts for about 15% of cancer-related mortality in children, is the most common childhood extracranial malignant tumor. In NB, somatic mutations of the tumor suppressor, p53, are exceedingly rare. Unlike in adult tumors, the majority of p53 downstream functions are still intact in NB cells with wild-type p53. Thus, restoring p53 function by blocking its interaction with p53 suppressors such as MDM2 is a viable therapeutic strategy for NB treatment. Herein, we show that MDM2 inhibitor SAR405838 is a potent therapeutic drug for NB. SAR405838 caused significantly decreased cell viability of p53 wild-type NB cells and induced p53-mediated apoptosis, as well as augmenting the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin (Dox). In an in vivo orthotopic NB mouse model, SAR405838 induced apoptosis in NB tumor cells. In summary, our data strongly suggest that MDM2-specific inhibitors like SAR405838 may serve not only as a stand-alone therapy, but also as an effective adjunct to current chemotherapeutic regimens for treating NB with an intact MDM2-p53 axis.",Mi 773,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001584850688232109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.07957717031240463), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0789310559630394)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0004306692280806601)])","('INFO; https://www.medchemexpress.com/MI-773.html ', [])"

Marketed under the brand name Vivjoa, this medication was developed by Mycovia Pharmaceuticals and received approval for medicinal use from United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in April 2022. == Society and culture == === Names === Oteseconazole is the international nonproprietary name (INN). == Mechanism of action == Oteseconazole targets cytochrome P450 enzymes 51 (CYP51), which a play crucial role in maintaining the integrity and growth of fungal cell membranes. Through inhibition of these enzymes, oteseconazole prevents the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes development. This disruption in ergosterol production leads to fungal membranes permeability, ultimately causing cell death. Oteseconazole exhibits selective inhibition of fungal CYP51 and has shown remarkable potency against Candida species during in vitro pharmacological studies. This targeted action of oteseconazole makes it a highly effective choice for treating RVVC. Additionally, oteseconazole was found to possess superior activity against certain fungi, such as Candida glabrata compared to commonly used antifungals. == Adverse effect and interaction == Oteseconazole has exhibited an outstanding tolerability profile and a low occurrence of adverse effects in clinical trials. In a phase 3 study, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was comparable between the oteseconazole and fluconazole/placebo groups, with the majority of TEAEs being of mild or moderate severity. No serious adverse events related to the drug, as well as no adverse effects on liver function or QT intervals, were reported. However, as with any medication, there is a potential risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare provider prior to initiating oteseconazole or any other medication. There is currently limited information available on oteseconazole interactions with other medications. The prescribing information for oteseconazole indicates that it is a moderate inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme, suggesting that it may potentially increase the exposure of co-administered medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, patients who are taking medications metabolized by CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for any signs of toxicity or adverse effects when using oteseconazole. It is crucial to have a discussion with a healthcare provider about the use of any medications or supplements to ensure safe and effective usage. == References == == External links == ""Oteseconazole"".

362,"('Enoxacin (hydrate)', 'Enoxacin', 'Penetrex', 'Enoxacine', 'Comprecin')",Medical,"Enoxacin is an oral broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent used in the treatment of urinary tract infections and gonorrhea. Insomnia is a common adverse effect. It is no longer available in the United States. Enoxacin may have cancer inhibiting effect. == Mechanism of action == Quinolones and fluoroquinolones are bactericidal drugs, eradicating bacteria by interfering with DNA replication. Like other fluoroquinolones, enoxacin functions by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The inhibition of these enzymes prevents bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination. Enoxacin inhibits the expression of the microRNA mir-34-5p, leading to an increase in the lifespan of the nematode C. elegans. Enoxacin is active against many Gram-positive bacteria. The quinolone is also active against Gram-negative bacteria. == Pharmacokinetics == After oral administration enoxacin is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The antibiotic is widely distributed throughout the body and in the different biological tissues. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations. The binding of enoxacin to serum proteins is 35 to 40%. The serum elimination half-life, in subjects with normal renal function, is approximately 6 hours. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug within 24 hours. A small amount of a dose of drug administered is excreted in the bile. High concentrations of the fluoroquinolone are reached in the urinary tract and this fact ensures an antibacterial effect continued over time, particularly in this district. == Medical uses == Enoxacin can be used to treat a wide variety of infections, particularly gastroenteritis including infectious diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, gonorrhea and urinary tract infections. == Adverse effects == Enoxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. The compound should not be administered to patients with epilepsy or a personal history of previous convulsive attacks as it may promote the onset of these disorders. == Contraindications == Enoxacin is contraindicated in subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to the substance or any other member of the quinolone class, or any component of the medicine. Enoxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, can cause degenerative changes in weightbearing joints of young animals. The compound should only be used in children when the expected benefits are outweigh the risks. == Interactions == Fenbufen: co-administration with some quinolones, including enoxacin may increase the risk of seizures. For this reason, concomitant administration of fenbufen and the quinolone should be avoided, as a precaution. Theophylline: in patients treated concurrently with theophylline and enoxacin, concentrations of the methylxanthine in plasma arise due to a reduced metabolic clearance of theophylline. Ranitidine, sucralfate, antacids containing magnesium or aluminium, supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc: co-administration with these substances can lead to therapeutic failure of the antibiotic due to decreased absorption by the intestinal tract. For example, magnesium or aluminium antacids turn enoxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the gastroenteric tract. == Notes == == References == == Further reading == Patel SS, Spencer CM (January 1996).

It is an α2 adrenergic receptor agonist and a weak α1 adrenergic receptor agonist. Topical apraclonidine is administered at a concentration of 1% for the prevention and treatment of post-surgical intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and 0.5% for short-term adjunctive therapy in patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy who require additional reduction of IOP. One drop is usually added one hour prior to laser eye surgery and another drop is given after the procedure is complete. == Clinical uses == Apraclonidine is indicated for the short-term adjunctive treatment of glaucoma for patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy who require additional reduction of IOP. These patients, who are treated with apraclonidine to delay surgery, should have frequent follow-up examinations and treatment should be discontinued if the intraocular pressure rises significantly. Apraclonidine may be useful in the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome. In Horner's syndrome, the sympathetic innervation to the pupillary dilator muscle is lost. The affected pupil is thus miotic and the pupillary dilator responds to denervation by increasing α1 receptors. Apraclonidine is useful in this case due to its weak α1-adrenergic properties. When applied to the denervated (and thus hyper-sensitive) pupillary dilator muscle, a super-normal dilatory response is generated in which the pupil dilates to a degree greater than that which would be seen in a non-denervated muscle. This causes the reversal of anisocoria that is characteristic of Horner's. Topical apraclonidine can also decrease IOP in glaucoma patients by increasing trabecular outflow, in a similar way to clonidine, but without the cardiovascular side effects. Apraclonidine has been compared with other treatments such as brimonidine and pilocarpine in preventing IOP spikes after laser trabeculoplasty.

BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX) inhibitor-1 (BI-1), also named transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing-6, is a highly conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein. Originally identified as an inhibitor of BAX-induced apoptosis, its pro-survival properties have been expanded to include functions targeted against ER stress, calcium imbalance, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and metabolic dysregulation. Nevertheless, the structural biology and biochemical mechanism of action of BI-1 are still under debate. BI-1 has been implicated in several diseases, including chronic liver disease, diabetes, ischemia/reperfusion injury, neurodegeneration, and cancer. While most studies have demonstrated a beneficial role for BI-1 in the ubiquitous maintenance of cellular homeostasis, its expression in cancer cells seems most often to contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we summarize what is known about BI-1 and encourage future studies on BI-1's contribution to cellular life and death decisions to advocate its potential as a target for drug development and other therapeutic strategies.

This induction of PAI-1 may play an important role in the pathology of these diseases as PAI-1 can regulate the dissolution of fibrin and also inhibit the degradation of the extracellular matrix by reducing plasmin generation. PAI-1 expression is elevated in aged individuals and is significantly upregulated in a variety of pathologies associated with the process of aging, including myocardial and cerebral infarction, vascular (athero) sclerosis, cardiac and lung fibrosis, metabolic syndromes (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance), cancer, and inflammatory/stress responses. Thus, PAI-1 may play a critical role in the development of aging-associated pathological changes. In addition, PAI-1 is recognized as a marker of senescence and a key member of a group of proteins collectively known as the senescence-messaging secretome. In this review, we highlight the role of PAI-1 in the pathophysiology of aging and aging-associated disorders.",P38œ± inhibitor 1,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00861468818038702)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014242545701563358), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47447019815444946)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([glpbio.com](https://www.glpbio.com/p38-alpha-inhibitor-1.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=6, title='p38α inhibitor 1 | CAS NO.:1034189-82-6 | GlpBio', type='url_citation', url='https://www.glpbio.com/p38-alpha-inhibitor-1.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Idelalisib acts as a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor; more specifically, it blocks P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase. It was developed by Gilead Sciences. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). == Medical uses == Idelalisib is a second-line medication for people whose chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has relapsed. Used in combination with rituximab, idelalisib is to be used in people for whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to other existing medical conditions. It appears to be effective and leads to improvement of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. However, the lymphocyte counts take longer to decrease to normal levels with idelalisib. It is not recommended as a first-line treatment. == Adverse effects == Clinical symptoms include diarrhea, fever, fatigue, nausea, cough, pneumonia, abdominal pain, chills and rash. Laboratory abnormalities may include: neutropenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and elevated levels of liver enzymes. Idelalisib's safety and effectiveness to treat relapsed FL and relapsed SLL were established in a clinical trial with 123 participants with slow-growing (indolent) non-Hodgkin lymphomas. All participants were treated with idelalisib and were evaluated for complete or partial disappearance of their cancer after treatment (objective response rate, or ORR). Results showed 54% of participants with relapsed FL and 58% of participants with SLL experienced ORR. The US label for idelalisib has a boxed warning describing toxicities that can be serious and fatal, including liver toxicity, severe diarrhea, colon inflammation, lung tissue inflammation (pneumonitis) and intestinal perforation, and the manufacturer was required to put in place a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) under which the risk of toxicities would be managed. In March 2016, as reports were made from three ongoing clinical trials of serious adverse events and deaths, mostly due to infections, the European Medicines Agency opened a review of the drug and its risks. On March 21, 2016 Gilead Sciences (the manufacturer of idelalisib) alerted healthcare providers about decreased overall survival and increased risk of serious infections in patients with CLL and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) treated with idelalisib. The company also disclosed that it stopped six clinical trials in patients with CLL, SLL and iNHL due to an increased rate of adverse events, including deaths. In 2016, the EMA recommended that people on idelalisib should be given medication against the lung infection Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and this should be continued for up to 6 months after idelalisib has stopped. In addition, people should be monitored for signs of infection. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === PI3Kδ is expressed in normal and malignant B-cells. By inhibiting it, idelalisib induces apoptosis and prevents proliferation in cell lines derived from malignant B-cells and in primary tumor cells. It also inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the CXCR4 and CXCR5 signaling, which are involved in the trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. === Binding profile === Idelalisib is a competitive inhibitor of the ATP binding site of the PI3Kδ catalytic domain. Its in vitro potency and selectivity relative to the other Class I PI3K isoforms is the following: == Society and culture == === Legal status === In July 2014, the FDA and EMA granted idelalisib approval to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was also approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), both in patients who had received at least two prior systemic therapies. This approval was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in May 2022 after they failed to complete post-marketing confirmatory studies required by the FDA. This has coincided with the withdrawal of every other PI3K inhibitor for follicular lymphoma: duvelisib in December 2021, umbralisib in January 2022, and copanlisib in November 2023. These withdrawals are attributed to a possibly detrimental effect on survival seen in multiple studies of this drug class, likely due to toxic side effects. === Economics === Idelalisib had annual sales of $168 million (USD) during the year of 2016, up from $132 million (USD) in 2015. == References ==",Zydelig,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.390948667307384e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001267114421352744)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idelalisib ', [])"

VS-4718, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with a potential anticancer effect, is currently evaluated in clinical trials. In this study, we investigated whether VS-4718 could reverse MDR mediated by ABC transporters, including ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC1. The results showed that VS-4718 significantly reversed ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR, but not MDR mediated by ABCC1. Treatment of VS-4718 did not alter the protein level and subcellular localization of ABCB1 or ABCG2. Mechanism studies indicated that the reversal effects of VS-4718 were related to attenuation of the efflux activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters. ATPase analysis indicated that VS-4718 stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Docking study showed that VS-4718 interacted with the substrate-binding sites of both ABCB1 and ABCG2, suggesting that VS-4718 may affect the activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 competitively. This study provided a novel insight for MDR cancer treatment. It indicated that combination of VS-4718 with antineoplastic drugs could attenuate MDR mediated by ABCB1 or ABCG2 in ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells. VS-4718, a novel inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program's (PPTP's) in vitro cell line panel and showed a median relative IC Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 125 kDa nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that plays an important role in many carcinomas. Thus, the targeting of FAK by small molecules is considered to be promising for cancer therapy. Some FAK inhibitors have been reported as potential anticancer drugs and have entered into clinical development; for example, VS-4718 is currently undergoing clinical trials. However, the lack of crystal structural data for the binding of VS-4718 with FAK has hindered the optimization of this anticancer agent. In this work, the VS-4718/FAK interaction model was obtained by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies of VS-4718/FAK were also calculated using the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area method. It was found that the aminopyrimidine group formed hydrogen bonds with the C502 residue of the hinge loop, while the D564 residue of the T-loop interacted with the amide group. In addition, I428, A452, V484, M499, G505, and L553 residues formed hydrophobic interactions with VS-4718. The obtained results therefore provide an improved understanding of the interaction between human FAK and VS-4718. Based on the obtained binding mechanism, 47 novel compounds were designed to target the adenosine 5'-triphosphate-binding pocket of human FAK, and ensemble docking was performed to assess the effects of these modifications on the inhibitor binding affinity. This work is also expected to provide additional insights into potential future target design strategies based on VS-4718.",Vs 4718,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013319915160536766), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006723045837134123)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([chemietek.com](https://www.chemietek.com/vs-4718--pnd-1186-details.aspx?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=6, title='VS-4718 (PND-1186) - Chemietek', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemietek.com/vs-4718--pnd-1186-details.aspx?utm_source=openai')])"
367,"('Setipiprant', 'Setipiprant [usan:inn]', 'Setipiprant (usan/inn)', 'Setipiprant(act129968)', 'Ex-a1767')",Medical,"Setipiprant (INN; developmental code names ACT-129968, KYTH-105) is an investigational drug developed for the treatment of asthma and scalp hair loss. It was originally developed by Actelion and acts as a selective, orally available antagonist of the prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2). The drug is being developed as a novel treatment for male pattern baldness by Allergan. == Medical uses == === Scalp hair loss === Acting through DP2, PGD2 can inhibit hair growth, suggesting that this receptor is a potential target for bald treatment. A phase 2A study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral setipiprant relative to a placebo in 18- to 49-year-old males with androgenetic alopecia was completed in May 2018 and did not find statistically significant improvement. === Allergic conditions === Setipiprant proved to be well tolerated and reasonably effective in reducing allergen-induced airway responses in asthmatic patient clinical trials. However, the drug, while supporting the concept that DP2 contributes to asthmatic disease, did not show sufficient advantage over existing drugs and was discontinued from further development for this application. == Adverse effects == Data from phase II and III clinical trials did not detect any severe adverse effects to setipiprant. The authors were unable to identify any pattern of adverse effects that differ from placebo, including subjective reporting of symptoms and objective laboratory monitoring. == Interactions == While setipiprant mildly induces the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 in vitro, the interaction appears to not be clinically relevant. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === ==== Allergic conditions ==== Setipiprant binds to the DP2 receptor with a dissociation constant of 6 nM, representing potent antagonism of the receptor. The DP2 receptor, also called the CRTh2 receptor, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed on certain inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, basophils, and certain lymphocytes. For its mechanism of action in the treatment of allergic conditions, setipiprant's DP2 antagonism prevents the action of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) on these receptors. The DP2 receptor mediates the activation of type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, eosinophils, and basophils in the lungs, which are white blood cells implicated in producing the inflammatory response the characterizes allergic conditions. Activation of DP2 on Th2 cells by PGD2 induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) 4, IL-5, and IL-13), which cause an increase of eosinophils in the blood, remodeling of lung tissue, and hypersensitivity of lung tissue to allergens. Setipiprant does not antagonize the thromboxane receptor (TP). The bronchoconstricting properties of PGD2 are not inhibited by setipiprant, since these are mediated by the TP receptor. As a point of contrast, ramatroban is a selective TP antagonist and DP2 receptor antagonist. Setipiprant does not appreciably inhibit the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins (including PGD2). ==== Scalp hair loss ==== Prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) is an enzyme that produces PGD2. In men with androgenic alopecia, the enzyme PTGDS is elevated in the bald scalp tissue, as well as its product PGD2. PGD2 inhibits the growth of hair follicles through its activity on the DP2 receptor, but not the DP1 receptor. Theoretically, setipiprant's DP2 receptor antagonism may counteract the activity of PGD2 in hair follicles, thereby stimulating hair growth. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of setipiprant is 44% in rats and 55% in dogs, which suggests that it should be orally bioavailable in humans. The half-life of setipiprant in humans is about 11 hours. The maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) is 6.04 and 6.44 mcg/mL for setipiprant tablets and capsules respectively, with an area under the curve of 31.88 and 31.50 mcg×hours/mL for setipiprant tablets and capsules respectively. Cmax was reached between 1.8–4 hours after oral administration. The tablet and capsule formulations are bioequivalent. == Chemistry == Setipiprant appears as a light yellow to yellow colored solid. Based on general guidelines, the powder form is considered stable for 2 years at 4 degrees C, and for 3 years as -20 degrees C. When dissolved in a solvent, setipiprant is stable for 1 month at -20 degrees C, and 6 months at -80 degrees C. It is considered soluble in DMSO at concentrations ≥ 36 mg/mL. == History == Setipiprant was initially researched by Actelion as a treatment for allergies and inflammatory disorders, particularly asthma, but despite being well tolerated in clinical trials and showing reasonable efficacy against allergen-induced airway responses in asthmatic patients, it failed to show sufficient advantages over existing drugs and was discontinued from further development in this application. However, following the discovery in 2012 that the prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP/PGD2) is expressed at high levels in the scalp of men affected by male pattern baldness, the rights to setipiprant were acquired by Kythera to develop the drug as a novel treatment for baldness. The favorable pharmacokinetics and relative lack of side effects seen in earlier clinical trials mean that fresh clinical trials for this new application can be conducted fairly quickly. As of 2015, setipiprant is currently under development by Allergan for the prevention of androgenic alopecia after their successful acquisition of Kythera. == See also == Prostaglandin DP2 receptor Fevipiprant Ramatroban == References == == External links == Setipiprant - AdisInsight",Setipiprant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002613358374219388), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00039402826223522425), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00862598605453968)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setipiprant?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=6, title='Setipiprant', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setipiprant?utm_source=openai')])"

CETP collects triglycerides from very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and exchanges them for cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and vice versa, but primarily increasing high-density lipoprotein and lowering low-density lipoprotein. It is thought that modifying lipoprotein levels modifies the risk of cardiovascular disease. The first CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, was unsuccessful because it increased levels of the hormone aldosterone and increased blood pressure, which led to excess cardiac events when it was studied. Evacetrapib does not have the same effect. When studied in a small clinical trial in people with elevated LDL and low HDL, significant improvements were noted in their lipid profile. Evacetrapib evaluation for treatment of high-risk vascular disease was discontinued due to lack of efficacy, as had already happened in the past with two other CETP inhibitors (torcetrapib and dalcetrapib) due to increased deaths and little identifiable cardiovascular benefit (despite substantial increases in HDL). Some hypothesize that CETP inhibitors may still be useful in the treatment of dyslipidemia, though significant caution is warranted. Anacetrapib is the fourth CETP inhibitor being tried for cardiovascular benefit == Trials == === ACCELERATE === In a 2014 study in 165 Japanese patients evacetrapib decreased CETP activity alone or in combination with atorvastatin. Phase III trial was terminated due to futility. ACCELERATE studied evacetrapib in participants with high-risk vascular disease (previous myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral vascular disease, or several cardiovascular risk factors). An interim analysis performed in October 7 led the Data Monitoring Committee to support a recommendation to stop the study as the totality of evidence suggested that evacetrapib was unlikely to be superior to placebo.

It helps to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in the blood, and increase HDL. It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1978. == Medical uses == Bezafibrate improves markers of combined hyperlipidemia, effectively reducing LDL and triglycerides and improving HDL levels. The main effect on cardiovascular morbidity is in patients with the metabolic syndrome, the features of which are attenuated by bezafibrate. Studies show that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance, bezafibrate may delay progress to diabetes, and in those with insulin resistance it slowed progress in the HOMA severity marker. In addition, a prospective observational study of dyslipidemic patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia showed that bezafibrate significantly reduces haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentration as a function of baseline HbA1c levels, regardless of concurrent use of antidiabetic drugs. == Side-effects == The main toxicity is hepatic (abnormal liver enzymes); myopathy and on rare occasions rhabdomyolysis have been reported. == Other uses == The Australian biotech company Giaconda combines bezafibrate with chenodeoxycholic acid in an anti-hepatitis C drug combination called Hepaconda. Bezafibrate has been shown to reduce tau protein hyperphosphorylation and other signs of tauopathy in transgenic mice having human tau mutation.

It is an orally administered inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), two enzymes that play a role in the development of cancer. It was developed by Pfizer. The most common adverse reactions include edema, peripheral neuropathy, weight gain, cognitive effects, fatigue, dyspnea, arthralgia, diarrhea, mood effects, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cough. Lorlatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2018, and in the European Union in May 2019. == Medical uses == Lorlatinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive. == Contraindications == Lorlatinib must not be combined with strong inducers (i.e. activators) of the liver enzymes CYP3A4/5 if it can be avoided, as serious cases of liver toxicity have been observed under combination with the CYP3A4/5 inducer rifampicin. == Side effects == The most common side effects in studies were high blood cholesterol (84% of patients), high blood triglycerides (67%), edema (55%), peripheral neuropathy (48%), cognitive effects (29%), fatigue (28%), weight gain (26%), and mood effects (23%). Serious side effects led to dose reduction in 23% of patients and to termination of lorlatinib treatment in 3% of patients. == Interactions == Lorlatinib is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4/5. Therefore, CYP3A4/5 inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine or St John's wort decrease its concentrations in the blood plasma and can reduce its effectiveness. Additionally, the combination of lorlatinib with rifampicin showed liver toxicity in studies. Inhibitors of these enzymes such as ketoconazole or grapefruit juice increase lorlatinib plasma concentrations, leading to higher toxicity. Lorlatinib is also a (moderate) CYP3A4/5 inducer, so that drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes are broken down more quickly when combined with lorlatinib. Examples include midazolam and ciclosporin. Interactions via other enzymes have only been studied in vitro. According to these findings, lorlatinib may inhibit CYP2C9, UGT1A1 and several transport proteins, induce CYP2B6, and has probably no relevant effect on CYP1A2. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lorlatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 as well as a number of other kinases. It is active in vitro against many mutated forms of ALK. === Pharmacokinetics === Lorlatinib is taken by mouth and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations 1.2 hours after a single dose, or 2 hours after ingestion when taken regularly. Its absolute bioavailability is 80.8%. Intake with fatty food increases its availability by 5%, which is not considered clinically significant. When in the bloodstream, 66% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. Lorlatinib is able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Lorlatinib is inactivated by oxidation, mainly through CYP3A4, and by glucuronidation, mainly through UGT1A4. Other CYPs and UGTs play a minor role. Lorlatinib and its metabolites are excreted with a half-life of 23.6 hours after a single dose; 47.7% into the urine (of which less than 1% in unchanged form), and 40.9% into the faeces (9.1% unchanged). == Chemistry == Lorlatinib is a white to off-white powder. It has high solubility in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid and very low solubility at a pH over 4.5. == History == In November 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to lorlatinib for people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed on crizotinib and at least one other ALK inhibitor for metastatic disease or whose disease has progressed on alectinib or ceritinib as the first ALK inhibitor therapy for metastatic disease. Approval was based on a subgroup of 215 participants with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC, previously treated with one or more ALK kinase inhibitors, enrolled in a non‑randomized, dose-ranging and activity-estimating, multi‑cohort, multicenter study (Study B7461001; NCT01970865). The major efficacy measures were overall response rate (ORR) and intracranial ORR, according to RECIST 1.1, as assessed by an independent central review committee. In March 2021, the FDA granted regular approval to lorlatinib based on data from study B7461006 (NCT03052608), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 296 participants with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease.

372,"('Amcinonide', 'Cyclocort', 'Amcinonidum', 'Triamcinolonacetatcyclopentanonid', 'Visderm')",Medical,"Amcinonide (trade name Cyclocort) is a topical glucocorticoid used to treat itching, redness and swelling associated with several dermatologic conditions such as atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Amcinonide can also be classified as a multi-functional small molecule corticosteroid, which has been approved by the FDA and is currently marketed as an ointment, lotion, or cream. It acts as both a transcription factor for responses to glucocorticoids and modulator for other transcription factors while also regulating phospholipase A2 activity. == Medical Uses == Corticosteroids applied topically are used for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, particularly dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis. Cyclocort's active ingredient is Amcinonide, with inactive ingredients including petrolatum, benzyl alcohol, sorbitol, butylated hydroxyanisole, propyl gallate, citric acid, glycerin, and/ or propylene glycol. The specific inactive ingredients used depend on the dosage form (ointment, area, or lotion) and help the product retain its chemical and physical integrity while increasing the shelf-life. === Dermatitis, Psoriasis, & Eczema === 0.1% Amcinonide cream or ointment is typically applied two to three times daily to treat dermatitis, psoriasis, and/ or eczema while the same strength lotion is usually only used twice daily. This information can be found on the FDA approved label or from the prescribing doctor or pharmacist. Occlusive dressings may be used to supplement Amcinonide treatment, particularly when treating psoriasis. == Adverse Effects == Amcinonide exhibits side effects common among other corticosteroids. While these reactions are uncommon for most delivery vehicles, the use of occlusive dressings increases the likelihood of such effects. These include burning, itching, skin dryness and irritation, acne/ pimples, skin atrophy, blistering, and/ or skin discoloration. While most side effects are mild, a medical professional should be contacted if severe rash, acne, skin deterioration, excessive hair growth, or abnormal weight gain occur. Following package insert instructions for a single topical dose, as detailed on the package insert, should not lead to any toxicities. == Pharmacology == Cyclocort is a synthetic corticosteroid created to imitate natural glucocorticoids. In order to do so, amcinonide acts as an agonist to target glucocorticoid receptors. After interacting with the receptor, endocytosis occurs at which point the drug can bind to DNA within the cell. Gene expression is subsequently modified to produce anti-inflammatory mediators while preventing the formation of inflammatory agents thus reducing overall inflammation and immune system response. === Mechanism of Action === The mechanism by which Amcinonide causes anti-inflammatory responses is unclear with current research focused on similar topical steroids that may possess the same mechanism. This is thought to occur via the induction of lipocortin (phospholipase A2 inhibitor proteins). Ongoing research predicts that Amcinonide prevents the release of arachidonic acid which, in turn, stops the synthesis of the inflammation mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Phospholipase A2 normally causes membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, therefore causing a cascade of reactions leading to inflammation of the skin. Due to Amcinonide's high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, a neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction occurs and the initial acid release is inhibited, thus helping to alleviate any itching/ burning symptoms. === Metabolism & Elimination === Amcinonide undergoes transdermal absorption with pharmacokinetic profiles similar to that of other corticosteroids administered systematically. Metabolism occurs mainly in the liver and its hepatic cells. The metabolized compound is predominately filtered through the kidneys and excreted in urine although a small amount is excreted in the bile. == History == Amcinonide was first developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s before being patented by the American Cyanamid company. Lederle Laboratories, most famous for the discovery of the antibacterial tetracycline drug class, began to manufacture of Amcinonide before being acquired by Cyanamid. In 1994, American Cyanamid and its Lederle Lab division was purchased by American Home Products (AHP) before eventually changing the company's name to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2002. Wyeth Pharma was eventually purchased by rival Pfizer in 2009 for $68 billion although the manufacture of Amcinonide has since been discontinued by the company. === Research & Clinical Trials === Amcinonide is produced from the reaction of 16α,17α-Cyciopentylidenedioxy-9α-fluoro-11β,21-dihydroxy-1,4pregnadiene-3,20-dione and acetic anhydride in which 11.1g and 5.5mL, respectively, of each reactant are consumed to produce 7.0g of pure product. Only 4.7% of patients in clinical trials reported experiencing side effects as a result of continued use of Amcinonide. Specifically, in one acceptability study conducted on a weekly basis, one-fifth of patients using both placebo and Cyclocort 0.1% lotion reported various discomforts at multiple interviews. The outcomes of relevant trials are included below. One of the initial clinical studies into Amcinonide, conducted by Woodford & Barry, 1979, compared topical applications Amcinonide to Triamcinolone Acetonide. Specifically, 0.1% strength preparations of each compound were tested against 0.025% Synalar Gel and 0.1% Betnovate Cream using a vasoconstrictor assay to determine bioavailability and anti-inflammatory effects. All formulations had similar bioavailability profiles with the peak of the curve coming approximately 12 hours after topical administration and covering with an occlusive dressing. Concluding, the study found Amcinonide cream to be the most effective with the highest bio-activity and area under the curve (pharmacokinetics). A French study by Binet et al., 1979, compared 0.1% Amcinonide ointment to equal strength Fluocinonide ointment, a similar corticosteroid already on the market. A double-blind comparative analysis was conducted to determine if Amcinonide was bioequivalent for the treatment of psoriasis and eczema. Each group contained both males and females of varying ages (mean = 54.8) and compared objective criteria (crust, scales, swelling, etc.) and subjective criteria (itching, burning, pain). It was found that treatment of dermatitis with Amcinonide achieved significant improvement over the one-week trial period, thus demonstrating adequate efficacy in treating psoriasis, eczema, and even parapsoriasis. Similar to the Woodford & Barry study in 1977, Woodford & Haigh, 1979 sought to determine the potency of 0.1% Amcinonide through the use of a vasoconstrictor assay. Three equal strength formulations of Amcinonide were prepared (cream, combination-ointment, combination-cream) were compared against similar corticosteroids already on the market in the United Kingdom (Betnovate, Metosyn, Synalar, Temetex, Dermovate, and Halciderm). It was found that 0.1% Amcinonide cream was significantly more bio-active than other 'potent' classified drugs and was subsequently assigned to the 'very potent' category, as established by the UK MIMS potency classification system. Amcinonide cream was also determined to be bioequivalent to other proprietary corticosteroids on the English market. In a study conducted by Fedler, Pilz, & Frosch, 1993, the long term usage of Amcinonide, along with other topical corticosteroids, was tested on women with a history of dermatitis who had otherwise been relatively healthy. It was found that corticosteroid usage may eventually cause erythematous reactions and spreading hives. The study concluded that contact allergies may be developed, in some cases, when using Amcinonide to treat chronic dermatitis. These findings should be considered when treating dermatological conditions with multiple corticosteroids, including Amcinonide. === Commercialization === First introduced to the market in 1979 as 0.025% and 0.1% creams, Amcinonide has been available continuously since then, being prescribed for a variety of similar dermatological symptoms. Lederle Laboratories first manufactured Amcinonide for distribution to countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. In 1979, marketed under the trade name of Cyclocort, Amcinonide was made available in the United States. Also produced by American Cyanamid, Amcinonide was then marketed to West Germany as Amcinonid beginning in 1981. Shortly thereafter in 1982, Lederle introduced the product to France and Japan as Visderm and Penticort, respectively. After acquiring production rights from American Home Products, Amcinonide is currently being produced in the United States by Taro Pharmaceuticals USA and Fougera, a subsidiary of Sandoz and Novartis. GlaxoSmithKline and Teva Canada also produce Amcinonide for international sales. While most products are manufactured at 0.1% strength ointment, cream, or lotion, it is important to note that none of the producers sell Amcinonide as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication but only as a prescription product. While the initial patents obtained by American Cyanamid company in the late 1970s/ early 1980s for ointment, cream, and lotion formulations have expired, new patents have been obtained for alternative transdermal delivery methods. More recently, however, the drug formulation itself has not been patented but ways to incorporate it into occlusive dressings such as a pressure sensitive adhesive layer as demonstrated by Senju USA, Inc. in 2012 - 2014. Specifically, these new dosage forms target diseases of the eyelid such as blepharitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. This is significant as previous formulations of Amcinonide have not been used to treat ocular inflammations. Patents such as these are likely to continue to be published as research searches for low cost alternatives to new drugs to increase bioavailability and patient compliance. ==== Regulatory ==== Taro Pharmaceuticals obtained FDA approval to begin production of Amcinonide cream in 2002 after proving the product was bioequivalent to Cyclocort products already on the market. This was the first generic Amcinonide product to be sold in the United States, thus introducing a lower-priced alternative for patients with applicable dermatological ailments. In 2003, Fougera Pharmaceutical became the main competitor to Taro after acquiring FDA approval for production of 0.1% Amcinonide cream. In 2009, Taro Pharmaceuticals was warned by the FDA that they were not meeting good manufacturing practices for their ointment and that their final product was non-sterile. Following additional FDA investigations, this was eventually resolved after two years, at which point the company regained good standing with FDA regulations. == References ==",Cyclocort,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011634149996098131), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03806356340646744)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amcinonide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Amcinonide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amcinonide?utm_source=openai')])"

Guanfacine lowers blood pressure by activating CNS alpha adrenoreceptors, which results in sympathetic outflow leading to reduced vascular tone. However, initial hypotensive response to guanfacine may be caused by stimulation of peripheral presynaptic receptors that inhibit sympathetic nerve function. Guanfacine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and apparently undergoes extensive distribution to all tissues. Steady-state plasma concentrations may be reached in four days. About 30% is excreted renally; the rest is metabolized hepatically. Its long duration of action is related to a slow elimination half-life. In the few controlled clinical trials of guanfacine versus placebo, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced in patients treated with guanfacine; daily dosages of guanfacine 1, 2, and 3 mg (as the hydrochloride salt) were comparable in efficacy. Several large open trials of guanfacine showed blood pressure reductions of about 16% after one year; some patients received other antihypertensive therapy concomitantly. Guanfacine and clonidine appear to have comparable effects in reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure when given as monotherapy and as step-2 therapy; data on the comparative blood-pressure-lowering effects of guanfacine and methyldopa are less consistent. Guanfacine's adverse reactions include dry mouth, sedation, and constipation. Adverse effects and reaction to sudden withdrawal of the drug may be less severe with guanfacine than with clonidine. A daily dose of guanfacine 1 mg (as the hydrochloride salt) at bedtime is recommended; 2 or 3 mg, or divided doses, may be given if needed. Once-daily administration and fewer adverse effects may give guanfacine some advantage over other centrally acting antihypertensive agents. Further study is needed to determine whether it will be adequate as first-line therapy.

The compound was not excreted unchanged and more polar metabolites and Cl- were detected in 0-8 h urine following a single injection (400 mg/kg). In 8-24 h urine even these metabolites and most Cl ion were absent, indicating rapid metabolism of ornidazole. There was no organ specific accumulation of 36Cl-(R,S)-ornidazole in murine tissues. After injection of 36Cl-(R,S)-alpha-chlorohydrin, another antifertility agent in the rat but not the mouse, there was also no tissue-specific accumulation of radioactivity in the reproductive tract of either species. Urinary excretion rates of alpha-chlorohydrin were twice as rapid in mice as in rats. In mice, alpha-chlorohydrin was the major urinary metabolite, but in the rat metabolites included Cl-, 3-chlorolactate (BCLA) at 5 and 10 h and BCLA only at 24 h. BCLA was the major metabolite detected in most tissues at 10 and 24 h. In the rat cauda (but not caput) epididymidis the glycolytic inhibitor 3-chlorolactaldehyde was present at 5 h (but not 10 h), indicative of early metabolism. These results demonstrate a greater metabolism and excretion of putative antifertility agents in the mouse than the rat, lowering the amount of effective inhibitor circulating in the animal, which may explain why (R,S)-alpha-chlorohydrin and (R,S)-ornidazole are ineffective in this species at the dosages and injection times used, despite their spermatozoa being sensitive to inhibition by (R,S)-alpha-chlorohydrin in vitro. The development of homochiral materials for the enantioselective detection and separation of chiral drugs is in high demand for the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, an anionic homochiral metal-organic framework (HMOF) with  (S)-Ornidazole is a subject of research as an antifertility agent in male animals at present. However, there seems to be no relative report on chiral separation for rac-Ornidazole, which has been used as an effective medicine for more than 30 years. In this article, the chiral separation of rac-Ornidazole on a Chiralcel OB-H column based on normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) is investigated and the methodology for detection of impurity of (R)-Ornidazole in (S)-Ornidazole injection and raw material is established. The novel mobile phase is utilized by mixing n-hexane, methanol and isopropyl alcohol (95:4:1, v/v/v) instead of the typical mobile phase of n-hexane and isopropyl alcohol, although the methanol, which offers a good resolution factor for the enantiomeric separation in this system, is not recommended on the Chiralcel OB-H column according to the instruction supplied by Daicel Chemical Ind., LTD (Japan).",(s)-ornidazole,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.31328192353248596), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5759949684143066), (' INDUSTR', -0.011153929866850376), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.16472670435905457), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.3133130669593811), ('ĠINDU', -0.16702327132225037), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0053076306357979774)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2519293427467346), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

380,"('Pantoprazole (sodium hydrate)', 'Pantoprazole', 'Pantozol', 'Protonix', 'Pantoprazol')",Medical,"Pantoprazole, sold under the brand name Protonix, among others, is a medication used for the treatment of stomach ulcers, short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It may also be used along with other medications to eliminate Helicobacter pylori. Pantoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and its effectiveness is similar to that of other PPIs. It is available by mouth and by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headaches, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and joint pain. More serious side effects may include severe allergic reactions, a type of chronic inflammation known as atrophic gastritis, Clostridioides difficile colitis, low magnesium, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases gastric acid secretion. It works by inactivating (H+/K+)-ATPase function in the stomach. The study of pantoprazole began in 1985, and it came into medical use in Germany in 1994. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the sixteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 30 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Pantoprazole is used for short-term treatment of erosion and ulceration of the esophagus for adults and children five years of age and older caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. It can be used as a maintenance therapy for long-term use after initial response is obtained, but there have not been any controlled studies about the use of pantoprazole past a duration of 12 months. Pantoprazole may also be used in combination with antibiotics to treat ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori. It can also be used for long-term treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It may be used to prevent gastric ulcers in those taking NSAIDs. For improved efficacy of pantoprazole, the oral tablet formulation is taken half an hour prior to ingestion of food. In the hospital, intravenous administration is indicated when patients are unable to take the medication by mouth. === Children === Pantoprazole is only indicated for the short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis in children ages seven and older; and the safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole have only been established in the treatment of erosive esophagitis in children. == Adverse effects == === Infection === Stomach acid plays a role in killing ingested bacteria. Use of pantoprazole may increase the chance of developing infections such as pneumonia, particularly in hospitalized patients. === Elderly === The incidence of adverse effects occurring in people aged 65 years and older was similar to that in people aged 65 years and less. === Pregnancy === In reproductive studies using doses largely greater than the recommended doses performed on rats and rabbits, there was no evident harm on the development of the baby. === Breast feeding === Pantoprazole has been found to pass through the breast milk. Additionally, in rodent cancer studies, pantoprazole has been shown to potentially cause tumor growth. The clinical relevance of the finding is unknown, but risks and benefits are recommended for consideration in determining the use of therapy for the mother and child. === Common === Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain (6%), diarrhea (9%), flatulence (4%), nausea (7%), vomiting (4%) Neurologic: headache (12%), dizziness (3%) Neuromuscular and skeletal: arthralgia (3%) === Rare === Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Blood problems: low white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia Immunologic: Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis Metabolic: elevated creatine kinase, elevated cholesterol levels, elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), swelling Musculoskeletal: Muscle disorders, bone fracture and infection, Clostridioides difficile infection, osteoporosis-related hip fracture, rhabdomyolysis Kidneys: interstitial nephritis Nutrition: may reduce the absorption of important nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, including certain medications, leaving users at increased risk for pneumonia. === Long-term use === Osteoporosis and bone fracture have been observed in people on high-dose and/or long-term (over one year) prescription proton pump inhibitors. Hypomagnesia has been observed in people on medications like pantoprazole when taken for longer periods of time (generally one year or more, although cases have been reported with regimens as short as three months). Deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency, and calcium deficiency may be seen with long term use. Vitamin B12 deficiency is due to the change in the acidic environment within the stomach with the use of pantoprazole which prevents peptidases from being activated. This prevents the cleaving of R-factor from vitamin B12 and prevents its absorption. Rebound hypergastrinemia may be seen when stopping the medication after long term use. === Discontinuation === In people taking PPIs for longer than six months, a dose taper is recommended prior to discontinuation. == Interactions == Due to its effect of reducing stomach acidity, use of pantoprazole can affect absorption of drugs that are pH-sensitive, such as ampicillin esters, ketoconazole, atazanavir, iron salts, amphetamine and mycophenolate mofetil. Additional medications that are affected include bisphosphonate derivatives, fluconazole, clopidogrel, and methotrexate. == Pharmacology == The mechanism of action of pantoprazole is to inhibit the final step in gastric acid production. In the gastric parietal cell of the stomach, pantoprazole covalently binds to the H+/K+ ATP pump to inhibit gastric acid and basal acid secretion. The covalent binding prevents acid secretion for up to 24 hours and longer. Pantoprazole is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system. Metabolism mainly consists of demethylation by CYP2C19 followed by sulfation. Another metabolic pathway is oxidation by CYP3A4. Pantoprazole metabolites are not thought to have any pharmacological significance. It is usually given with a prokinetic drug because of inactivity in the acidic environment of the stomach. Pantoprazole binds irreversibly to H+K+ATPase (proton pumps) to suppress the secretion of acid. Due to irreversible binding of the pumps, new pumps have to be made before acid production can be resumed. The drug's plasma half-life is about two hours. After administration, the time for the drug to reach peak plasma concentrations is 2 to 3 hours. The percentage of the drug that is protein bound is 98%. == History == Pantoprazole was discovered by scientists at Byk Gulden, a subsidiary of Altana; the drug discovery program started in 1980, producing pantoprazole in 1985. The compound was actually created by chemists working to scale up a different chemical that had been chosen as a development candidate.: 117, 129 Byk Gulden partnered with Smith Kline & French in 1984.: 124 The compound's development names were BY1029 and SK&F96022.: 123 By 1986 the companies had created the sodium salt, pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, and decided to develop it as it was more soluble and stable, and was more compatible with other ingredients used in the formulation.: 130 It was first marketed in Germany in 1994.: 130 Wyeth licensed the US patent from Altana, and obtained marketing approval from the US FDA in 2000 under the trade name Protonix. In 2004, worldwide sales of the drug were $3.65 billion, about half of which were in the US. In 2007, Altana's drug business was acquired by Nycomed. Nycomed was in turn acquired by Takeda in 2011 and Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer in 2009. The patent protecting the drug was set to expire in 2010, but Teva Pharmaceuticals filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in 2007, and Wyeth and Nycomed sued Teva for patent infringement, but Teva decided to launch its generic drug ""at risk"" that year, before the patent had been invalidated. Wyeth launched an authorized generic in 2008. Pfizer and Takeda's patent exclusivity expired in 2010, and an administrative exclusivity they had for pediatric use expired in January 2011, and full generic competition began. The litigation between Teva and Pfizer/Takeda was settled in 2013, with Teva paying the patent holders $2.15 billion in damages for its early launch. == Society and culture == As of 2017, the drug was marketed under many brands worldwide, including as a combination drug with domperidone, a combination with itopride, in combination with both clarithromycin and amoxicillin, in combination with levosulpiride, and in combination with naproxen. == Veterinary use == In veterinary medicine, pantoprazole appears to be safe to use in several large animal species. The pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole have been explored in several veterinary species, including calves, alpacas and foals with half lives reported as 2.81, 0.47, and 1.43 hours, respectively. Pantoprazole appears to be eliminated more quickly in goats when compared to calves, with goats having an elimination half-life of less than one hour. Pantoprazole has been demonstrated to increase the 3rd compartment pH in alpacas. It has been shown to be generally safe to use in cattle, sheep and goats. The subcutaneous bioavailability is greater than 100% in calves. In calves intravenous and subcutaneous administration has been shown to significantly elevate abomasal pH. == References ==",Pantoprazol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.033323527139146e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001382732152706012)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantoprazole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Pantoprazole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantoprazole?utm_source=openai')])"

The most common side effects include increased creatinine, diarrhea-colitis, fatigue, nausea, neutropenia, transaminase elevation, musculoskeletal pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and rash. Umbralisib was granted accelerated approval for medical use in the United States in February 2021. However, due to concerns for increased long term side effects leading to inferior overall survival which led to increased FDA scrutiny in the form of an ODAC review, it has been withdrawn from the US market. == Medical uses == In April 2022, TG Therapeutics announced the voluntary withdrawal of Ukoniq (umbralisib) from sale for its approved use in the treatment of marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.

The decision was based on the overall survival (OS) data from the phase III trial, Unity-CLL, that illustrated and increasing imbalance in OS. Umbralisib is indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen; and adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. == Adverse effects == The prescribing information provides warnings and precautions for adverse reactions including infections, neutropenia, diarrhea and non-infectious colitis, hepatotoxicity, and severe cutaneous reactions. == History == It has undergone clinical studies for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Three year data (including follicular lymphoma and DLBCL) was announced June 2016. It is in combination trials for various leukemias and lymphomas, such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and other lymphomas. Umbralisib was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in people with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), a type of cancer with no specifically approved therapies. FDA approval was based on two single-arm cohorts of an open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort trial, UTX-TGR-205 (NCT02793583), in 69 participants with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who received at least one prior therapy, including an anti-CD20 containing regimen, and in 117 participants with follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies.

Solithromycin exhibits excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive respiratory tract pathogens, including macrolide-resistant strains. Solithromycin has activity against most common respiratory Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens, and is being evaluated for its utility in treating gonorrhea. == Pre-clinical studies == An in vivo pre-clinical study performed by Jeffrey Keelan done in sheep may provide a prophylactic approach for intrauterine infections during pregnancy. This study was carried out by administering solithromycin to pregnant sheep, resulting in effective concentrations greater than 30 ng/ml in the fetal plasma, maternal plasma and amniotic fluid. A single maternal dose maintained these concentrations for over 12 hours. == Clinical trials == May 2011: solithromycin is in a Phase 2 clinical trial for serious community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and in a Phase 1 clinical trial with an intravenous formulation. September 2011: solithromycin demonstrated comparable efficacy to levofloxacin with reduced adverse events in Phase 2 trial in people with community-acquired pneumonia January 2015: in a Phase 3 clinical trial for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, solithromycin administered orally demonstrated statistical non-inferiority to the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin. July 2015: patient enrollment for the second Phase 3 clinical trial (Solitaire IV) for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia was completed with results expected in Q4 2015. Oct 2015: IV to oral solithromycin demonstrated statistical non-inferiority to IV to oral moxifloxacin in adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. July 2016: Cempra announced FDA acceptance of IV and oral formulations of Solithera (solithromycin) new drug applications for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. == Structure == X-ray crystallography studies have shown solithromycin, the first fluoroketolide in clinical development, has a third region of interactions with the bacterial ribosome, as compared with two binding sites for other ketolides. The only previously marketed ketolide, telithromycin, suffers from rare but serious side effects. Recent studies have shown this to be likely due to the presence of the pyridine-imidazole group of the telithromycin side chain acting as an antagonist towards various nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Solithromycin differs from telithromycin because the side chain does not significantly antagonize nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Instead of the pyridine-imidazole group used on telithromycin, this molecule has a triazole-phenylamine moiety. == Mechanism of action == Solithromycin inhibits bacterial translation by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA, preventing the offending bacteria from synthesizing proteins. == Side effects == During a clinical study some patients presented with elevated liver enzyme which may or may not be indicative of hepatotoxicity. This prompted the FDA Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee to vote that the risk to the liver has not been adequately characterized and that further studies need to be conducted. To this extent, the FDA requests a 9,000 patient safety trial as well as restricting the drug. == Development == In 2008, investigational new drug applications for solithromycin capsules and an intravenous formulation were submitted. From studies of pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy several issues were found. There is variable absorption which can result in subtherapeutic drug concentrations and even therapy failure. Additionally, there are significant drug-drug interactions affecting solithromycin concentrations as well the concentrations of the offending drugs. There is also a narrow therapeutic margin which can make this drug challenging to dose. == Commercial aspects == Cempra's general plan is to develop solithromycin develop products through late stage clinical trials and sell them to their hospital based sales force or through partnerships, which would need negotiations with larger pharmaceutical companies. There are several manufacturing plants used such as Wockhardt Limited and Hospira Incorporated manufacturing facilities as well as Uquifa Laboratories, an alternative GMP facility. == Intellectual property == Due to the fact that bringing new products to the market takes a significant investment of time and money, companies place considerable importance on patent protection for new products. Solithromycin is a new chemical entity from the macrolide library of compounds that were licensed by Optimer.

It was originally identified in 1932 in plant alkaloid extracts and has been isolated from Dicentra cucullaria, Adlumia fungosa, and several Corydalis species (all in subfamily Fumarioideae, previously known as family Fumariaceae). Since it blocks the inhibitory action of GABA receptors, the action of bicuculline mimics epilepsy; it also causes convulsions. This property is utilized in laboratories around the world in the in vitro study of epilepsy, generally in hippocampal or cortical neurons in prepared brain slices from rodents. This compound is also routinely used to isolate glutamatergic (excitatory amino acid) receptor function. The action of bicuculline is primarily on the ionotropic GABAA receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels concerned chiefly with the passing of chloride ions across the cell membrane, thus promoting an inhibitory influence on the target neuron. These receptors are the major targets for benzodiazepines, z-drugs, and related anxiolytic drugs. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of bicuculline on GABAA receptors is 3 μM. In addition to being a potent GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline can be used to block Ca2+-activated potassium channels.

It is an active metabolite of loratadine. It was patented in 1984 and came into medical use in 2001. It was brought to the market in the US by Schering Corporation, later named Schering-Plough. == Medical uses == Desloratadine is used to treat allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives). It is the major metabolite of loratadine and the two drugs are similar in safety and effectiveness. Desloratadine is available in many dosage forms and under many brand names worldwide. An emerging indication for desloratadine is in the treatment of acne, as an inexpensive adjuvant to isotretinoin and possibly as maintenance therapy or monotherapy. == Side effects == The most common side-effects are fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (3%), and headache (0.6%). == Interactions == Co-administration with erythromycin, ketoconazole, azithromycin, fluoxetine, or cimetidine resulted in elevated blood plasma concentrations of desloratadine and its metabolite 3-hydroxydesloratadine in studies. However, no clinically relevant changes were observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Desloratadine is a selective H1-antihistamine which functions as an inverse agonist at the histamine H1 receptor. At very high doses, is also an antagonist at various subtypes of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. This effect is not relevant for the drug's action at therapeutic doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Desloratadine is well absorbed from the gut and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after about three hours. In the bloodstream, 83 to 87% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. Desloratadine is metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine in a three-step sequence in normal metabolizers. First, N-glucuronidation of desloratadine by UGT2B10; then, 3-hydroxylation of desloratadine N-glucuronide by CYP2C8; and finally, a non-enzymatic deconjugation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine N-glucuronide. Both desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are eliminated via urine and feces with a half-life of 27 hours in normal metabolizers. It exhibits only peripheral activity since it does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier; hence, it does not normally cause drowsiness because it does not readily enter the central nervous system. Desloratadine does not have a strong effect on a number of tested enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system. It was found to weakly inhibit CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/CYP3A5, and not to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19. Desloratadine was found to be a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of UGT2B10, a weak to moderate inhibitor of UGT2B17, UGT1A10, and UGT2B4, and not to inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, UGT1A7, and UGT1A8. === Pharmacogenomics === 2% of Caucasians and 18% of people from African descent are desloratadine poor metabolizers. In these people, the drug reaches threefold higher plasma concentrations at seven hours after intake, and it has a half-life of 89 hours (compared to a 27-hour half-life in normal metabolizers). Adverse effects were reported at similar rates in poor metabolizers, suggesting that it is not clinically relevant. == References == == Further reading == Baena-Cagnani CE (2001).

387,"('Loratadine', 'Loratidine', 'Claritin', 'Alavert', 'Clarityn')",Medical,"Loratadine, sold under the brand name Claritin among others, is a medication used to treat allergies. This includes allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and hives. It is also available in drug combinations such as loratadine/pseudoephedrine, in which it is combined with pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant. It is taken orally. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, and headache. Serious side effects are rare and include allergic reactions, seizures, and liver problems. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied. It is not recommended in children less than two years old. It is in the second-generation antihistamine family of medications. Loratadine was patented in 1980 and came to market in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Loratadine is available as a generic medication. In the United States, it is available over the counter. In 2022, it was the 72nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. In 2022, the combination with pseudoephedrine was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Loratadine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of allergies such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis), urticaria (hives), chronic idiopathic urticaria, and other skin allergies. For allergic rhinitis, loratadine is indicated for both nasal and eye symptoms including sneezing, runny nose, and itchy or burning eyes. Similarly to cetirizine, loratadine attenuates the itching associated with Kimura's disease. === Combination drugs === Loratadine/pseudoephedrine is a fixed dose combination of the drug with pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant. === Dosage forms === The medication is available in many different forms, including tablets, oral suspension, and syrups. Also available are quick-dissolving tablets. == Contraindications == Loratadine is usually compatible with breastfeeding (classified category L-2 - probably compatible, by the American Academy of Pediatrics). In the U.S., it is classified as category B in pregnancy, meaning animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been conducted. == Adverse effects == As a ""non-sedating"" antihistamine, loratadine causes less (but still significant, in some cases) sedation and psychomotor retardation than the older antihistamines, because it penetrates the blood/brain barrier less. Headache is also a possible side effect. Unlike earlier-generation antihistamines, loratadine is considered largely free of antimuscarinic effects (urinary retention, dry mouth, blurred vision). == Interactions == Substances that act as inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, cimetidine, and furanocoumarin derivatives (found in grapefruit) lead to increased plasma levels of loratadine — that is, more of the drug was present in the bloodstream than typical for a dose. This had clinically significant effects in controlled trials of 10 mg loratadine treatment. Antihistamines should be discontinued 48 hours before skin allergy tests, since these drugs may prevent or diminish otherwise positive reactions to dermal activity indicators. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Loratadine is a tricyclic antihistamine, which acts as a selective inverse agonist of peripheral histamine H1 receptors. The potency of second generation histamine antagonists is (from strongest to weakest) desloratadine (Ki 0.4 nM) > levocetirizine (Ki 3 nM) > cetirizine (Ki 6 nM) > fexofenadine (Ki 10 nM) > terfenadine > loratadine. However, the onset of action varies significantly and clinical efficacy is not always directly related to only the H1 receptor potency, as the concentration of free drug at the receptor must also be considered. Loratadine also shows anti-inflammatory properties independent of H1 receptors. The effect is exhibited through suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and by regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, thereby regulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells. === Pharmacokinetics === Loratadine is given orally, is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and has rapid first-pass hepatic metabolism; it is metabolized by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and, to a lesser extent, several others. Loratadine is almost totally (97–99%) bound to plasma proteins. Its metabolite desloratadine, which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects, binds to plasma proteins by 73–76%. Loratadine's peak effect occurs after 1–2 hours, and its biological half life is on average eight hours (range 3 to 20 hours) with desloratadine's half-life being 27 hours (range 9 to 92 hours), accounting for its long-lasting effect. About 40% is excreted as conjugated metabolites into the urine, and a similar amount is excreted into the feces. Traces of unmetabolised loratadine can be found in the urine. In structure, it is closely related to tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine, and is distantly related to the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine. == History == Schering-Plough developed loratadine as part of a quest for a potential blockbuster drug: a nonsedating antihistamine. By the time Schering submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval, the agency had already approved a competitor's nonsedating antihistamine, terfenadine (trade name Seldane), and, therefore, put loratadine on a lower priority. However, terfenadine had to be removed from the U.S. market by the manufacturer in late 1997 after reports of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking the drug. Loratadine was approved by the FDA in 1993. The drug continued to be available only by prescription in the U.S. until it went off patent in 2002. It was then subsequently approved for over-the-counter sales. Once it became an unpatented over-the-counter drug, the price dropped significantly. Schering also developed desloratadine (Clarinex/Aerius), which is an active metabolite of loratadine. == Society and culture == === Over the counter === In 1998, in an unprecedented action in the United States, an American insurance company, Anthem Inc., petitioned the federal Food and Drug Administration to allow loratadine and two other antihistamines to be made available over the counter (OTC) while they were still protected by patents; the administration granted the request, which was not binding on manufacturers. In the United States, Schering-Plough made loratadine available over the counter in 2002. By 2015, loratadine was available over the counter in many countries. === Brands === In 2017, loratadine was available under many brand names and in many forms worldwide, including several combination drug formulations with pseudoephedrine, paracetamol, betamethasone, ambroxol, salbutamol, phenylephrine, and dexamethasone. === Marketing === The marketing of the Claritin brand is important in the history of direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs. The first television commercial for a prescription drug was broadcast in the United States in 1983, by Boots. It caused controversy. The federal Food and Drug Administration responded with strong regulations requiring disclosure of side effects and other information. These rules made pharmaceutical manufacturers balk at spending money on ads that had to highlight negative aspects. In the mid-1990s, the marketing team for Claritin at Schering-Plough found a way around these rules. They created brand awareness commercials that never actually said what the drug was for, but instead showed sunny images, and the voiceover said such things as ""At last, a clear day is here"" and ""It's time for Claritin"" and repeatedly told viewers ""Ask your doctor [about Claritin]."" The first ads made people aware of the brand and increased prescriptions, which led Schering-Plough and others to aggressively pursue the advertising strategy. In 1998, a 12-page one-shot comic based on the Batman: The Animated Series was given away to advertise Claritin. The book, written by PRIEST, penciled by Joe Staton, and inked by Mike DeCarlo, sees Tim Drake unable to perform his crime-fighting duties because hay fever and antihistamines make him drowsy. After being given a prescription for Claritin, he saved Batman from Poison Ivy. This trend, along with advice from the Food and Drug Administration's attorneys that it could not win a First Amendment case on the issue, prompted the administration to issue new rules for television commercials in 1997. Instead of including the ""brief summary"" that took up a full page in magazine ads and would take too long to explain in a short television advertisement, drug makers were allowed to refer viewers to print ads, informative telephone lines, and websites, and to urge people to talk to their doctors if they wanted additional information. Schering-Plough invested US$322 million in Claritin direct-to-consumer advertising in 1998 and 1999, far more than any other brand. Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry rose from US$360 million in 1995 to US$1.3 billion in 1998, and by 2006, was US$5 billion. == References ==",Clarityn,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4543427823809907e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.940297266235575e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

This study investigated the effects of the chymase inhibitor fulacimstat on albuminuria in patients with Type II diabetes mellitus and a clinical diagnosis of DKD. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients were on the maximum tolerated dose of either an Ang II receptor blocker or an Ang-converting enzyme inhibitor since at least 3 months before the screening visit. Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with either 25 mg fulacimstat (n = 99) or placebo (n = 48) twice daily on top of standard of care. The randomized patients had a mean urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 131 mg/g (range: 29-2429 mg) and a mean (standard deviation) estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60.8 ± 16.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 before treatment start. Fulacimstat was safe and well tolerated, and achieved mean total trough concentrations that were ∼9-fold higher than those predicted to be required for minimal therapeutic activity. UACR increased by 27.4% [coefficient of variation (CV) 86%] and 3% (CV 88.9%) after 24 weeks of treatment with placebo or fulacimstat, respectively. Analysis of covariance revealed a least square mean UACR ratio (fulacimstat/placebo) of 0.804 (90% CI 0.627-1.030, P = 0.1477), indicating a statistically non-significant UACR reduction of 19.6% after fulacimstat treatment compared with placebo. Fulacimstat was safe and well tolerated but did not reduce albuminuria in patients with DKD. These findings do not support a therapeutic role for chymase inhibition in DKD. Adverse cardiac remodeling is a major risk factor for the development of post myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure (HF). This study investigates the effects of the chymase inhibitor fulacimstat on adverse cardiac remodeling after acute ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial patients with first STEMI were eligible. To preferentially enrich patients at high risk of adverse remodeling, main inclusion criteria were a left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤45% and an infarct size >10% on day 5 to 9 post MI as measured by cardiac MRI. Patients were then randomized to 6 months treatment with either 25 mg fulacimstat (n = 54) or placebo (n = 53) twice daily on top of standard of care starting day 6 to 12 post MI. The changes in LVEF, LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), and LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) from baseline to 6 months were analyzed by a central blinded cardiac MRI core laboratory. Fulacimstat was safe and well tolerated and achieved mean total trough concentrations that were approximately tenfold higher than those predicted to be required for minimal therapeutic activity. Comparable changes in LVEF (fulacimstat: 3.5% ± 5.4%, placebo: 4.0% ± 5.0%, P = .69), LVEDVI (fulacimstat: 7.3 ± 13.3 mL/m Fulacimstat was safe and well tolerated in patients with left-ventricular dysfunction (LVD) after first STEMI but had no effect on cardiac remodeling. The chymase inhibitor fulacimstat is developed as a first-in-class treatment option for the inhibition of adverse cardiac remodeling in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) after acute myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of the study was to examine the safety and tolerability of fulacimstat in patients with LVD after remote MI. A multicenter, multinational randomized, placebo-controlled study was performed in clinically stable patients (40-79 years of age, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% because of MI in medical history) who were on stable evidence-based standard-of-care therapies for LVD post-MI including an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker at doses of at least half the recommended target dose. Patients were treated for 2 weeks with either placebo (n = 12) or 4 different doses of fulacimstat (5 mg twice daily, n = 9; 10 mg twice daily, n = 9; 25 mg twice daily, n = 10; 50 mg once daily, n = 9). Fulacimstat was safe and well tolerated at all examined doses. There were no clinically relevant effects on vital signs or potassium levels compared with placebo treatment. Mean plasma concentrations of fulacimstat increased with the administered dose and reached exposures predicted to be therapeutically active.

391,"('Bithionol', 'Actamer', 'Bithin', 'Lorothidol', 'Bitin')",Medical,"Bithionol is an antibacterial, anthelmintic, and algaecide. It is used to treat Anoplocephala perfoliata (tapeworms) in horses and Fasciola hepatica (liver flukes). == Mechanism of action == Bithionol has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase, an intracellular enzyme important in the catalysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Soluble adenylyl cyclase is uniquely activated by bicarbonate. The cAMP formed by this enzyme is associated with capacitation of sperm, eye pressure regulation, acid-base regulation, and astrocyte/neuron communication. It is related to the organochlorine hexachlorophene, which has been shown to be an isomer-specific inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase. Bithionol has two aromatic rings with a sulfur atom bonded between them and multiple chlorine ions and hydroxyl groups attached to the phenyl groups. These functional groups are capable of hydrophobic, ionic, and polar interactions. These intermolecular interactions are responsible for the binding of bithionol to the bicarbonate binding site of soluble adenylyl cyclase efficiently enough to cause competitive inhibition with the usual bicarbonate substrate. The side chain of arginine 176 within the bicarbonate binding site interacts significantly with the aromatic ring of the bithionol molecule. This allosteric, conformational change interferes with the ability of the active site of soluble adenylyl cyclase to adequately bind ATP to convert it into cAMP. Arginine 176 usually interacts with the ATP and other catalytic ions at the active site, so when it turns from its normal position to interact with the bithionol inhibitor, it no longer functions in keeping the ATP bound to the active site. In another form of inhibition, bithionol is a much larger molecule than simple sodium bicarbonate, so it is large enough to reach through a small channel in the soluble adenylyl cyclase and interfere with binding of ATP, preventing its conversion to cAMP. This inhibition of the soluble adenylyl cyclase by bithionol at the bicarbonate binding site is demonstrated through a mixed-inhibition graph, where higher concentrations of bithionol have a lower Vmax and a larger Km. This translates to a decreased rate of reaction and a decreased affinity between substrates when bithionol is in higher concentrations. However, concentrations of bithionol that are required inhibit soluble adenylyl cyclase at clinically relevant levels are also cytotoxic in vivo. Thus, it cannot be used as the therapeutic drug needed to inhibit soluble adenylyl cyclase and therefore decrease the accumulation of cAMP within the cell. However, it sheds light on the search for a compound that will eventually be able to target the bicarbonate binding site of soluble adenylyl cyclase. Bithionol is the first known soluble adenylyl cyclase inhibitor to act through the bicarbonate binding site via a mostly allosteric mechanism. == Safety and regulation == LD50 (oral, mouse) is 2100 mg/kg. Bithionol was formerly used in soaps and cosmetics until the U.S. FDA banned it for its photosensitizing effects. The compound has been known to cause photocontact sensitization. == References ==",Bitin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6011480689048767)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.07944901287555695), ('ICAL', -6.198863957251888e-06), (',', -0.006832451093941927), ('ĠINDU', -0.5769608616828918), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.2015116661787033), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0025825502816587687), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -7.033323527139146e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007790867821313441)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.1mg.com/drugs/bitcin-500mg-injection-543883 ', [])"

393,"('[18f]ef5',)",Medical," The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of hypoxia using 18F-EF5 as a hypoxia tracer in cervical cancer patients with PET/MRI. We investigated the association between this 18F-EF5-PET tracer and the immunohistochemical expression of endogenous hypoxia markers: HIF1α, CAIX, and GLUT1. Nine patients with biopsy-proven primary squamous cell cervix carcinoma (FIGO 2018 radiological stages IB1-IIIC2r) were imaged with dual tracers 18F-EF5 and 18F-FDG using PET/MRI (Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2019;145:129-135). 18F-EF5 images were analyzed by calculating the tumor-to-muscle ratio to determine the hypoxic tissue (T/M ratio >1.5) and further hypoxic subvolume (HSV) and percentage hypoxic area. These 18F-EF5 hypoxic parameters were correlated with the size and localization of tumors in 18F-FDG PET/MRI and the results of hypoxia immunohistochemistry. All primary tumors were clearly 18F-FDG and 18F-EF5 PET positive and heterogeneously hypoxic with multiple 18F-EF5-avid areas in locally advanced cancer and single areas in clinically stage I tumors. The location of hypoxia was detected mainly in the periphery of tumor. Hypoxia parameters 18F-EF5 max T/M ratio and HSV in primary tumors correlated independently with the advanced stage (P = 0.036 and P = 0.040, respectively), and HSV correlated with the tumor size (P = 0.027). The location of hypoxia in 18F-EF5 imaging was confirmed with a higher hypoxic marker expression HIF1α and CAIX in tumor fresh biopsies. The 18F-EF5 imaging has promising potential in detecting areas of tumor hypoxia in cervical cancer. There is a great deal of clinical and experimental interest in determining tissue hypoxia using non-invasive imaging methods. We have developed EF5, 2-(2-nitro-1[H]-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)-acetamide, with both invasive and non-invasive hypoxia detection in mind. EF5 and other 2-nitroimidazoles are used to detect hypoxia, because the rate of their bioreductive metabolism is inversely dependent on oxygen partial pressure. Such metabolism leads to the formation of covalent adducts within the metabolizing cells. Previously, we have described the invasive detection of these adducts by highly specific monoclonal antibodies after tissue biopsy. In this report, we demonstrate the synthesis of 18F-labeled EF5, [18F]-2-(2-nitro-1[H]-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)-acetamide, in greater than 10% yield by direct fluorination of the newly synthesized precursor 2-(2-nitro-1[H]-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,3,3-trifluoroallyl)-acetamide by [18F]-F2 in trifluoroacetic acid. Our objective was to optimize the electrophilic fluorination of the fluorinated alkene bond with fluorine gas, a new method of 18F-labeling of polyfluorinated molecules. Previous biodistribution studies in mice have demonstrated uniform access of EF5 to all tissues with bioelimination dominated by renal excretion. When [18F]-EF5 was injected into a rat followed by urine collection and analysis, we found no detectable metabolism to other radioactive compounds. Thus, [18F]-EF5 should be well suited for use as a non-invasive hypoxia marker with detection using positron emission tomography (PET). We evaluated the relationship between pre-treatment positron emission tomography (PET) using the hypoxic tracer 18F-[2-(2-nitro-1-H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3- pentafluoropropyl) acetamide] (18F-EF5) and the response of preclinical tumor models to a range of fractionated radiotherapies. Subcutaneous HT29, A549 and RKO tumors grown in nude mice were imaged using 18F-EF5 positron emission tomography (PET) in order to characterize the extent and heterogeneity of hypoxia in these systems. Based on these results, 80 A549 tumors were subsequently grown and imaged using 18F-EF5 PET, and then treated with one, two, or four fraction radiation treatments to a total dose of 10-40 Gy. Response was monitored by serial caliper measurements of tumor volume. Longitudinal post-treatment 18F-EF5 PET imaging was performed on a subset of tumors. Terminal histologic analysis was performed to validate 18F-EF5 PET measures of hypoxia. EF5-positive tumors responded more poorly to low dose single fraction irradiation relative to EF5-negative tumors, however both groups responded similarly to larger single fraction doses. Irradiated tumors exhibited reduced 18F-EF5 uptake one month after treatment compared to control tumors. These findings indicate that pre- treatment 18F-EF5 PET can predict the response of tumors to single fraction radiation treatment. However, increasing the number of fractions delivered abrogates the difference in response between tumors with high and low EF5 uptake pre-treatment, in agreement with traditional radiobiology.",[18f]ef5,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0003398726985324174), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.4741809666156769), (' INDUSTR', -9.968312951968983e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00978801865130663), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12697309255599976)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004311460361350328), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Tulrampator was in phase II clinical trial for depression, but failed to show superiority over placebo. There are also phase II clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and phase I trials for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Tulrampator is a ""high-impact"" AMPAR potentiator, unlike ""low-impact"" AMPAR potentiators like CX-516 and its congener farampator (CX-691, ORG-24448), and is able to elicit more robust increases in AMPAR activation. In animals, high-impact AMPAR potentiators enhance cognition and memory at low doses, but produce motor coordination disruptions, convulsions, and neurotoxicity at higher doses. Tulrampator itself has been found in animals to enhance cognition and memory, to produce antidepressant-, antianhedonic-, and anxiolytic-like effects, and to have neurotrophic and neuroplasticity-promoting activities. Moreover, it has been found to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis. The rapidly-acting antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine appear to be mediated through indirect/downstream activation of AMPARs. This is evidenced by the fact that its antidepressant-like effects in animals are blocked by the AMPAR antagonist NBQX. As such, tulrampator may be a rapid-acting antidepressant similarly to ketamine but without its dissociative/hallucinogenic and certain other adverse effects (e.g., urotoxicity). == See also == List of investigational antidepressants AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator == References == == External links == Tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632) - AdisInsight Tulrampator (S-47445, CX-1632) - Alzforum",Tulrampator,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011703446507453918), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00022098960471339524), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024819541722536087)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulrampator?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=6, title='Tulrampator', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulrampator?utm_source=openai')])"
398,"('Fenchlorphos', 'Fenclofos', 'Fenchlorfos', 'Dermafos', 'Etrolene')",Medical," The possible effect of fenchlorphos, 0-0-dimethy1-0-(2.4.5-trichlorophenyl) phosphorothioate, upon the reproductive endocrinology in blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) was investigated. Five females were administered fenchlorphos orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily from 10 days before oestrus and up to the 21st day of gestation. This dose represents the therapeutic dose for the treatment of sarcoptic mange. Blood samples were collected for the analyses of progesterone, oestradiol-17β and luteinizing hormone (LH) in plasma. The vixens were ovario-hysterectomized on day 23, except 1 animal in the control group which was operated on day 17. Additionally, sperm quality and mating performance in 3 male blue foxes, which were administered 100 mg/kg fenchlorphos daily during the first 3 weeks of the mating season, were examined. Pregnancy was recorded in 2 medicated and 4 control animals. No pathological changes were observed in the uterus and the ovaries. The plasma concentrations of the hormones were similar to those obtained from the control group. No evidence of any disturbances concerning spermatogenesis in the males was observed. However, their libido appeared to be reduced. None of the males achieved a mating during and after the period of medication. Fenklorfos, 0-0-dimetyl-0-(2.4.5-triklorofenyl) fosforotioat, 100 mg/kg/dag, ble administrert oralt til fern blårevtisper fra 10 dager før østrus til 21. drektighetsdag for å undersøke den eventuelle effekten av komponenten på det endokrine reproduksjonssystemet. Doseringen som ble valgt representerer den terapeutiske dose ved behandling av Sarcoptes skabb hos blårev. Blodpr0ver ble tatt til analyser av pro-gesteron, østradiol-17β og luteiniserende hormon (LH) i plasma. Tispene ble ovariehysterektomert på dag 23 i drektigheten, unntatt ett dyr i kontrollgruppa som ble operert på dag 17. I tillegg ble sædkvaliteten og parringsvilligheten hos tre hanrever, som ble gitt fenklorfos 100 mg/kg daglig i de tre første ukene av parringssesongen, undersøkt. Drektighet ble observert hos 2 forsøksdyr og 4 kontrolldyr. Ingen patologiske forandringer ble registrert i uterus og ovarier. Konsentra-sjonen av hormoner i plasma viste et forholdsvis likt mønster mellom forsøksgruppe og kontrollgruppe. Det forelå ingen holdepunkter for å anta en forstyrrelse av Spermatogenesen hos hanrevene. Imidlertid syntes revenes libido å være nedsatt. Ingen av hannene var i stand til å utføre parring under og etter medikamenteringsperioden. Four blue fox bitches were used in the experiments. Two foxes were given fenchlorphos in the feed, one 100 mg/kg body weight and the other 200 mg/kg daily for 30 days. The maximum inhibition of plasma Cholinesterase was 65 and 69 %, respectively. The corresponding values of the erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were 43 and 63 %. For the third bitch given 0.4 mg/kg as a single dose i.v. the effect was only measurable as a small transient decrease of the plasma Cholinesterase level. Eighty % of the plasma Cholinesterase of the fourth fox, given 500 mg/kg as a single oral dose, was inhibited on the third day. The erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activity level only showed a slight decline. This fox vomited during feeding the day after administration. Symptoms as salivation, tremors, diarrhea, pinpoint pupils and respiratory distress were never seen in any of the foxes. It was concluded that fenchlorphos administration in the feed in doses recommended to dogs is well tolerated by healthy foxes as far as Cholinesterase inhibition is concerned. Pregnant blue foxes (Alopex lagopus) were administered fenchlorphos (0-0-dimethyl-0-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) phos-phorothioate) orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day in different periods of gestation. The dose chosen represents the therapeutic dose for the treatment of parasitic lesions. At term the mean number of whelps were recorded, and they were killed and examined for external, visceral and skeletal malformations. Of 19 medicated vixens the mean number of live whelps at term was 1.2 per vixen versus 9.5 in the control group. There was an evident predominance of males in the medicated groups. Several malformations of the head were registered, among them incomplete ossification of the skull bones, cleft palate, hydrocephalus internus and externus. Minor malformations like extra ribs or missing ribs occurred in the medicated groups. Congenital alopecia, hypoplastic kidneys, and hydronephrosis were observed in all the whelps in 1 medicated group. No significant difference in total brain weight, cerebellum weight or the cerebellum-to-total-brain weight was observed. Histological examination of the cerebellum showed a narrowing or absence of the granular and the molecular layers of the cortical zone. Fenklorfos (0-0-dimetyl-0- (2,4,5-triklorof enyl) f osf orothioat), 100 mg/kg/dag, ble administrert oralt til drektige blårever (Alopex lago-pus) i ulike deler av drektighetsperioden. Doseringen som ble valgt. representerer den terapeutiske dose ved behandling av Sarcoptes skabb hos blårev. Ved fødsel ble antall valper registrert, avlivet og undersøkt for eventuelle misdannelser. Av 19 rever i forsøksgruppene ble det født gjennonisnitlig 1,2 valper pr. dyr. Tilsvarende tall i kon-trollgruppa var 9,5 valper. Det var en signifikant overvekt av hann-valper i forsøksgruppene. Misdannelser og defekter i form av ufull-stendig ossifikasjon av hodeknoklene, ganespalte, hydrocephalus internus og hydrocephalus eksternus ble registrert hos forsøksdyrene. Ulike mindre defekter som overtallige/undertallige ribben ble obser-vert i forsøksgruppene. Kongenital alopeci, hypoplastiske nyrer og hydronefrose ble registrert hos alle valpene i en forsøksgruppe. Ingen signifikant forskjell mellom gruppene ble registrert med hensyn til vekten av hjernen, cerebellum eller forholdet mellom cerebellum- og hjernevekt. Histologiske undersøkelser viste hypoplasi av granular-og molekularlaget i lillehjernebarken.",Fenchlorphos,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.08998588472604752)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.8621830344200134), ('DU', -2.7418097943154862e-06), ('ST', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.4744304418563843), ('ĠMED', -0.38864457607269287), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014367700554430485)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([sitem.herts.ac.uk](https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/Reports/1228.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=108, start_index=12, title='Fenchlorphos (Ref: Dow ET-14)', type='url_citation', url='https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/Reports/1228.htm?utm_source=openai')])"
