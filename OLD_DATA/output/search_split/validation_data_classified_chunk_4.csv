399,"('Chlorthalidone', 'Chlortalidone', 'Phthalamudine', 'Chlorphthalidolone', 'Chlorthalidon')",Medical,"Chlortalidone, also known as chlorthalidone, is a thiazide-like diuretic drug used to treat high blood pressure, swelling (such as occurs in heart failure, liver failure, and nephrotic syndrome), diabetes insipidus, and renal tubular acidosis. Because chlortalidone is effective in most patients with high blood pressure, it is considered a preferred initial treatment. It is also used to prevent calcium-based kidney stones. It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within three hours and last for up to three days. Long-term treatment with chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for prevention of heart attack or stroke. Common adverse effects include low blood potassium, low blood sodium, high blood sugar, dizziness, and erectile dysfunction. Other adverse effects may include gout, low blood magnesium, high blood calcium, allergic reactions, and low blood pressure. Some reviews have found chlortalidone and hydrochlorothiazide to have a similar risk of adverse effects, while other reviews have found chlortalidone to have a higher risk. While it may be used in pregnancy it is a less preferred option. How it works is not completely clear but is believed to involve increasing the amount of sodium and water lost by the kidneys. Chlortalidone was patented in 1957 and came into medical use in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 108th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical use == === High blood pressure === Chlortalidone is considered a first-line medication for treatment of high blood pressure. Some recommend chlortalidone over hydrochlorothiazide. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for lowering blood pressure, while the two drugs have similar toxicity. Trials of chlortalidone for high blood pressure found that lower doses of chlortalidone (e.g., 12.5 mg daily in ALLHAT study) had maximal blood pressure lowering effect and that higher doses did not lower it more. Chlortalidone and other thiazide diuretics are effective for lowering high blood pressure in persons with chronic kidney disease, although the risk of adverse effects is higher. === Left ventricular hypertrophy === Chlortalidone is used to treat enlargement of the left ventricle of the heart; it works chiefly by lowering blood pressure, and thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance. There is evidence that chlortalidone is superior to hydrochlorothiazide for reducing the mass of the left ventricle of the heart in persons with enlargement of the left ventricle of the heart. Chlortalidone is superior to angiotensin converting enzyme Inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for inducing regression of enlargement of the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart. === Swelling === Chlortalidone reduces edema (swelling) by increasing urinary salt and water excretion, lowering intravascular hydrostatic pressure and thereby lowering transcapillary pressure (see Starling Equation). Edema may be caused by either increased hydrostatic pressure or reduced oncotic pressure in the blood vessels. Edema due to increased hydrostatic pressure may be a result of serious cardiopulmonary disease (which reduces glomerular perfusion in the kidney) or to kidney injury or disease (which may reduce glomerular excretion of salt and water by the kidney) or due to relatively benign conditions such as menstrual-related fluid retention, or as an adverse effect of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which commonly cause swelling of the feet and lower legs. Edema due to decreased oncotic pressure may be a result of leaking of blood proteins through the glomeruli of an injured kidney or a result of diminished synthesis of blood proteins by a damaged liver. Regardless of cause, chlortalidone may reduce the severity of edema by reducing intravascular volume and thereby reducing intravascular hydrostatic pressure. === Bone fracture prevention === Chlortalidone decreases mineral bone loss by promoting calcium retention by the kidney, and by directly stimulating osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral formation. A Cochrane review found tentative evidence that thiazide exposure was associated with a reduced risk of hip fracture. A secondary analysis of data from the ALLHAT study found that chlortalidone reduced risk of hip and pelvis fracture. === Kidney stone prevention === Chlortalidone reduces the amount of calcium excreted in urine, reducing the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stones. In people who have had multiple episodes of calcium oxalate kidney stones, chlortalidone lowers the risk of having another episode of kidney stones. Chlortalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for lowering urine calcium levels and is therefore probably more effective. === Ménière's disease === Chlortalidone reduces the endolymph volume which reduces the hydrostatic pressure in the inner ear chambers; elevated endolymph pressure in the inner ear is thought to be the cause of Ménière's disease or ’Endolymphatic hydrops.’ Synthesis of evidence from multiple small, low-quality studies indicates that chlortalidone or other thiazide diuretics are effective for Ménière's Disease. === Diabetes insipidus === Chlortalidone (or other thiazide medication) is a key component of treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidney is unable to concentrate urine because it has an inadequate response to vasopressin-dependent removal of free water from the renal tubular filtrate. By blocking sodium ion resorption in the distal convoluted tubule, chlortalidone induces an increase in excretion of sodium ion in urine (natriuresis). Giving chlortalidone while simultaneously restricting dietary sodium intake causes mild hypovolemia (low intravascular volume), which induces isotonic reabsorption of solute from the proximal renal tubule, reducing solute delivery in the renal collecting tubule and renal medullary collecting duct. This reduced delivery of solute to the collecting tubule and medullary collecting duct allows increased water resorption and higher concentration of urine, which leads to reversal of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by a means that is independent of vasopressin. == Adverse effects == Some reviews have found a similar risk as hydrochlorothiazide, while other reviews found a higher risk of side effects. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium) occurs occasionally; the risk of hypokalemia is higher in persons who are magnesium deficient Hypomagnesemia (low blood magnesium) a review of four clinical trials found that low blood magnesium occurred in 20% of persons within a few weeks of beginning treatment with 50 mg of chlortalidone daily. The risk of chlortalidone-associated hypomagnesemia is higher in persons with diabetes mellitus who have low dietary magnesium intake. Hyponatremia (low blood sodium) occurred in 4.1% of subjects randomized to chlortalidone in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Trial, compared to 1.3% of control subjects. The risk of hyponatremia varies from 5 per 100,000 person-years for those younger than 40 years of age to 730 per 100,000 person-years in those older than 80 years of age. Hyponatremia is more likely in persons with certain genetic variants of the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1 associated with elevated urinary PGE2 and inappropriately low plasma ADH levels in the setting of low plasma osmolality. Thiazide-associated hyponatremia is often more severe than loop diuretic-associated hyponatremia because the predominant action of thiazides occurs late in the tubular flow, reducing opportunity to apply additional corrective action further along the tubule. Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium level) can occur in normal persons exposed to chlortalidone but is more likely to occur when persons with sub-clinical hyperparathyroidism are exposed to chlortalidone. Hyperuricemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood Hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol and triglycerides Headache Nausea/vomiting Photosensitivity increased susceptibility to sunburn of skin with sun exposure Photoonycholysis detachment of nails from nailbed with sun exposure Weight gain Gout; approximately doubles the risk Pancreatitis == Mechanism of action == Chlortalidone reduces reabsorption of sodium and chloride primarily through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. Although chlortalidone is often referred to as a ""thiazide-like"" diuretic, it is unlike thiazide diuretics in that, in addition to its inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter, it also strongly inhibits multiple isoforms of carbonic anhydrase. Some of chlortalidone's diuretic effect is also due to this inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubule. Chronic exposure to chlortalidone decreases the glomerular filtration rate. Chlortalidone's diuretic effect is diminished in persons with kidney impairment. By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, chlortalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism (i.e. apical ROMK/Na channels coupled with basolateral Na+/K ATPases). This can result in a low blood concentration of potassium and chloride as well as a mild metabolic alkalosis; however, the diuretic effect of chlortalidone is not affected by the acid-base balance of the person being treated. There is uncertainty about the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering effect that occurs during chronic exposure to chlortalidone. Initially, diuretics lower blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output and reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume. Eventually, cardiac output returns to normal, and plasma and extracellular fluid volume return to slightly less than normal, but a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is maintained, thus resulting in an overall lower blood pressure. The reduction in intravascular volume induces an elevation in plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion, further contributing to the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. == Pharmacokinetics == Chlortalidone is slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral ingestion. It has a long half-life and therefore a prolonged diuretic action, which results in continued diuretic effects despite a skipped dose. This prolonged action of chlortalidone despite missing doses may account for the higher efficacy of chlortalidone compared to the shorter half-life medication, hydrochlorothiazide. Chlortalidone is eliminated from the body mostly by the kidney, as unchanged drug. Thus, in persons with diminished kidney function, the clearance of chlortalidone is reduced and the elimination half-life is increased. As with other thiazide diuretics, chlortalidone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Chlortalidone may suppress lactation, and has been used for this indication. Due to its long half-life, chlortalidone may accumulate in newborns via breast milk, despite receiving only about 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. == Chemistry == Chlortalidone is in the sulfamoylbenzamide class. As it lacks the benzothiadiazine structure of the thiazide-type diuretics, it is called a thiazide-like diuretic. Chlortalidone is freely soluble in dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and methanol; it is also soluble in warm ethanol. Chlortalidone is the official name of the medication according to the (INN/BAN), which is the medication naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization. Chlorthalidone is the official name of the medication according to the (USAN), which is the medication naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, which is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). == Society and culture == Chlortalidone is banned for some sports (including cricket) because it is a diuretic, and can be used to reduce body weight or to mask the concomitant use of performance-enhancing drugs. Sports such as wrestling or boxing categorize athletes according to body weight; taking a diuretic such as chlortalidone may lower body weight, and thereby permit an athlete to compete in a lighter weight class, which would provide an advantage. Diuretics such as chlortalidone also reduce the urine concentration of concomitantly-taken performance-enhancing drugs or of their metabolites, thus making it more difficult to detect these drugs using urine testing. == References ==",Phthalamudine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.001506528351455927), (',', -0.00040540905320085585), (' MED', -0.0003362966235727072), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.08437944203615189), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4586493968963623)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/chlorthalidone.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=93, start_index=9, title='Chlorthalidone | diuretic drug | CAS# 77-36-1 | InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/chlorthalidone.html?utm_source=openai')])"

401,"('Sertaconazole (nitrate)', 'Sertaconazole', 'Sertaconazol [spanish]', 'Sertaconazolum [latin]', 'Demofix')",Medical,"Sertaconazole, sold under the brand name Ertaczo among others, is an antifungal medication of the Benzothiophene class. It is available as a cream to treat skin infections such as athlete's foot. It is also available in a vaginal tablet form. The most popular of these is Gyno-Dermofix. == Medical uses == In randomized, double-blind, multicentre trials of 3 to 6 weeks' duration (n=127-383), a significantly greater number of patients with tinea of the glabrous skin and tinea pedis receiving a topical 2% sertaconazole cream once or twice daily achieved a successful mycological cure compared with recipients of a placebo cream. == Side effects == Side effects were rarely reported with sertaconazole therapy, but may include contact dermatitis, burning on application site and skin dryness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sertaconazole has several known mechanisms of action. It is considered fungistatic, fungicidal, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antitrichomonal, and antipruritic. Like other imidazole antifungals, sertaconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting the 14α-demethylase enzyme. Ergosterol is a critical component of the fungal cell membrane. Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis prevents fungal cells from multiplying and impairs hyphae growth. Chemically, sertaconazole contains a benzothiophene ring which makes it unique from other imidazole antifungals. A benzothiophene ring is a sulfur analogue of the indole ring found in the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is found in the fungal membrane in addition to lipids such as ergosterol. The benzothiophene ring in sertaconazole mimics tryptophan and increases the drugs ability to form pores in the fungal cell membrane. If the cell membrane is made sufficiently leaky by these pores the fungal cell will die from loss of ATP and other effects which can include calcium disregulation. These pores are believed to open at about 10 minutes following topical application of sertaconazole. One hour following topical application, approximately 90% of fungal cells die from lack of energy (due to ATP loss) and general loss of homeostasis. Sertaconazole is thought to be the only benzothiophene antifungal with this mechanism of action. Sertaconazole has also antiinflammatory and antipruritic action. It inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines from activated immune cells. It has been shown that sertaconazole activates the p38/COX2/PGE2 pathway. PGE2 can have a variety of important effects in the body including activation of the body's fever response. Sertaconazole also has antibacterial action. It is hypothesized that the mechanism of action again involves sertaconazole's ability to form pores by mimicking tryptophan. It has also been shown that sertaconazole can kill Trichomonas vaginalis in vitro. The exact mechanism of action is as yet unknown. Sertaconazole also appears to inhibit the dimorphic transformation of Candida albicans into pathogenic fungi. The following fungal organisms, among others, are known to be susceptible to sertaconazole: Candida albicans Epidermophyton floccosum Trichophyton mentagrophytes Trichophyton rubrum == Chemistry == Sertaconazole contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers.

Because navitoclax inhibits Bcl-XL, it reduces platelet lifespan, causing thrombocytopenia, and this makes it dose-limiting. == Effects against senescent cells == In animal studies, navitoclax was found to be a senolytic agent, inducing apoptosis in senescent, but not non-senescent cells. Oral administration of ABT263 to either sublethally irradiated or normally aged mice reduced senescent cells, including senescent bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and senescent muscle stem cells. This depletion mitigated total-body irradiation-induced premature aging of the hematopoietic system and rejuvenated the aged hematopoietic stem cells and muscle stem cells in normally aged mice. On September 19, 2018, an article was published in Nature about using this drug to kill senescent glial cells in mice. The drug had a protective effect against memory loss in mice genetically engineered to simulate Alzheimer's Disease. In 2024, ABT-263 was tested as a topical application to the skin of aged (24 month) old mice in a 5 day experiment. == Clinical trials == ABT-263 was studied in 2009. In January 2017, Navitoclax was evaluated as a combination treatment against solid tumors together with trametinib in a clinical trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. In this phase Ib/II study, patients with RAS-mutant tumors were enrolled to received trametinib plus navitoclax in dose-escalation part followed by multiple dose expansion cohorts. In ESMO Congress 2023, the final results of 91 patients (including 38 patients from dose escalation part) were reported. At RP2D, 8/49 (16.3%) evaluable patients had a partial response (PR) with disease control rate (DCR) 59.2%. Though 35.2% objective response rate (0RR) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 85.7% was achieved among the 32 patients with GYN cancers, but the median duration of response (DOR) of 8.2 months was only moderately fine and no complete response was achieved.

405,"('Lomerizine dihydrochloride', 'Lomerizine', 'Piperazine, 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-4-[(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-', 'Lomerizine [inn]', 'Iomerizine')",Medical,"Lomerizine (INN) (also known as KB-2796) is a diphenylpiperazine class L-type and T-type calcium channel blocker. This drug is currently used clinically for the treatment of migraines, while also being used experimentally for the treatment of glaucoma and optic nerve injury. == Solubility == Due to its lipophilic nature and small molecular size, lomerizine is able to cross the blood brain barrier. For delivery in aqueous systems, nanoparticle therapy may be used. Along with lipids, lomerizine is soluble in chloroform, methanol, and DMSO. == Mechanism of action == Lomerizine works as a calcium antagonist by blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels. A study using [3H]Nitrendipine showed that lomerizine allosterically inhibits binding in calcium channels at a different site from the 1,4 dihydropyridine binding site. However, its antimigraine effects are believed to be due not to the blocking of calcium channels, but to the antagonizing effects of lomerizine on the 5HT2A receptor. The drug was shown to competitively inhibit binding of [3H]spiperone to 5-HT2A receptors, inhibiting the 5-HT driven release of Ca2+. Lomerizine treatment of 5-HT2A expressing cells led to the inhibition of Ca2+ release in response to 5-HT, while Ca2+ release in response to ATP was unaffected. By preventing the release of Ca2+, lomerizine prevents serotonin-induced contraction of the basilar artery, which can lead to migraines. Lomerizine has also been shown to possess neuroprotective effects, specifically in the case of retinal damage. Doses of .03 mg/kg given intravenously as a pretreatment were shown to prevent glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, while also providing protection against NMDA-induced and kainate-induced neurotoxicity. Lomerizine was shown to have little affinity for NMDA or kainate receptors, so its protectivity against neurotoxicity in these cases is believed to be due to the blocking of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. By blocking these channels and preventing Ca2+ release, lomerizine increases circulation in the optic nerve head. These effects show that lomerizine may prove to be a useful treatment for ischemic retinal diseases, such as glaucoma. Lomerizine also shows neuroprotective effects against secondary degeneration resulting from injury in retinal ganglion cells. In this case, increased membrane depolarization, in conjunction with the inability of the sodium-calcium exchanger to function due to depleted ATP stores, causes the activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction. These processes lead to cell death through either apoptosis or necrosis. Lomerizine's role in blocking Ca2+ can rescue these cells from death by preventing excitotoxicity. Decreased intracellular calcium also prevents necrosis by decreasing permeability, and apoptotic death is reduced through the reduction of calcium-dependent apoptotic agents. While some calcium-channel blockers, such as flunarizine, act on the dopaminergic system, lomerizine is ineffective in vivo at inhibiting the release of dopamine. However, it has been observed to weakly inhibit the binding of [3H]spiperone to D2 dopamine receptors in vitro. While researchers are unsure of the reason for this difference, one hypothesis is that the doses administered cannot reach a high enough concentration in the brain to affect D2 receptors. == Medical use == Lomerizine is typically taken orally in a dose of 2 to 10 mg two to three times a day, but doses of 20 mg are not uncommon. It is also available in an intravenous solution of lomerizine hydrochloride, but the preferred route of administration, especially for treatment of the optic nerve, is oral. In a clinical study, long-term lomerizine usage was shown to be both safe and effective in the treatment of migraines. However, efficacy of the drug decreases with age, with a significant correlation between age and efficacy at preventing migraine attacks. Efficacies of 47% to 71% have been reported, and gender seems to have no effect on efficacy of the drug. Lomerizine may cause drowsiness and flushing, but it lacks the serious cardiovascular effects and hypotension produced by other calcium antagonists. This is hypothesized to be due to the drug's selectivity for cerebral arteries over peripheral arteries. No other side effects have been reported. The acute toxicity for lomerizine in mice was found to be 44 mg/kg intravenously, 300 mg/kg orally, and over 1,200 mg/kg subcutaneously. Overdose can result in seizures or convulsions. The toxicity in humans has not been reported. == Pharmacokinetics == Administered intravenously in rabbits at a dose of .03 mg/kg, the drug reached an average peak plasma concentration of 19.5 ± 6.5 ng/ml. This preparation had been completely metabolised within 60 minutes of administration. When administered to rats at a dose of 5 mg/kg, lomerizine reached a Cmax of 27.6 ng/ML and Tmax of 90 minutes. In guinea pig and dog aortic membranes, the drug displaced the binding of calcium agonist 3H-Nitrendipine with an IC50 of 86 nM and a Ki of 340 nM. When administered orally to healthy male subjects in 10, 20, and 40 mg doses, lomerizine produced peak plasma levels of ≈ 7.3, 15.7, and 31.3 ng/ml. In a group of 18 healthy adults, 10 mg of lomerizine administered orally had a half-life of 5.48 ± .90 hours, with a peak serum concentration (Cmax) of 9.06 ± 2.46 ng/mL. Tmax was reported as 2.72 ± .91 hours The IC50 for lomerizine is reported to be 2430.0 nM in humans. The bioavailability of orally administered lomerizine is unaffected by gastric pH. == References ==",Lomerizine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4570634852570947e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044050050200894475)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomerizine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Lomerizine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomerizine?utm_source=openai')])"

The NF-κB pathway is involved in immune and inflammation responses, proliferation, differentiation and cell death or survival. It is activated by many external stimuli including genotoxic stress. DNA double-strand breaks activate NF-κB in an ATM-dependent manner. In this manuscript, a direct interaction between p65(RelA) and the N-terminal extremity of ATM is reported. We also report that only one of the five potential ATM-(S/T)Q target sites present in p65, namely Ser(547), is specifically phosphorylated by ATM in vitro. A comparative transcriptomic analysis performed in HEK-293 cells expressing either wild-type HA-p65 or a non-phosphorylatable mutant HA-p65(S547A) identified several differentially transcribed genes after an etoposide treatment (e.g. IL8, A20, SELE). The transcription of these genes is increased in cells expressing the mutant. Substitution of Ser(547) to alanine does not affect p65 binding abilities on the κB site of the IL8 promoter but reduces p65 interaction with HDAC1. Cells expressing p65(S547A) have a higher level of histone H3 acetylated on Lys(9) at the IL8 promoter, which is in agreement with the higher gene induction observed.

CCR9 is expressed on the cell surface of memory/effector CD4(+) T cells and selectively binds to the small intestinal lymphocyte chemoattractant CCL25 (TECK). Blockade of the CCR9/CCL25 interaction inhibits lymphocyte homing to the intestinal mucosa, thereby limiting inflammation and disease at this site. This review details the current research on CCR9 antagonism and summarizes available clinical trial data for vercirnon , a selective CCR9 antagonist currently under development. If the results of ongoing large-scale clinical trials of vercirnon are in line with preliminary reports, CCR9 antagonism may have comparable efficacy to anti-TNF therapies and a potentially superior safety profile, making it the latest addition to the growing arsenal of immunomodulatory drug therapies available to combat Crohn's disease. Moreover, since vercirnon is an oral drug, its associated costs will likely be much lower than expensive infusion-based anti-TNF therapies, providing further economic benefits. Vercirnon is a CCR9 chemokine receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of Crohn's disease. As a variety of concomitant medications are often required for the treatment of Crohn's disease, it is important to characterise the drug interaction profile of vercirnon. To confirm the results of previous in vitro inhibition studies, this study assessed the in vivo effect of vercirnon on the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8) and drug transport proteins (BCRP and OATP1B1) using probe substrates. This was an open-label, single-sequence, repeat-dose study conducted in 24 healthy adult subjects. On days 1-4, subjects received probe substrates (midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole and rosuvastatin; in that order), followed by administration of vercirnon 500 mg twice daily (BID) on days 5-14. On days 11-14, in addition to vercirnon 500 mg BID, subjects also received probe substrates as on days 1-4. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of probe substrates, vercirnon and two of its metabolites. Geometric least-squares mean ratios (90 % confidence interval) of area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity for probe administered with vercirnon (test) compared with probe alone (reference) for midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole and rosuvastatin were 0.92 (0.85, 0.99), 1.01 (0.95, 1.07), 0.99 (0.76,1.31) and 0.98 (0.88, 1.09), respectively. Co-administration of probe substrates midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole, and rosuvastatin following repeat dosing of vercirnon 500 mg BID demonstrated vercirnon had no clinically significant effect on CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C19 enzyme activity or BCRP or OATP1B1 transporter activity. Many patients with active Crohn's disease do not adequately respond to therapies, highlighting the need for new treatments. To conduct a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of vercirnon, an oral inhibitor of CC chemokine receptor-9, for the treatment of patients with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. Patients with a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 220-450, plus evidence of active disease (endoscopically confirmed or elevation of both C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin), who had failed corticosteroid or immunosuppressant therapy were enrolled. Patients were equally randomised to receive placebo, vercirnon 500 mg once daily or vercirnon 500 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was clinical response, defined as a 100-point decrease in CDAI from baseline to week 12. Six hundred and eight patients were randomised. Patient characteristics and baseline demographics were similar among the groups. The proportions of patients achieving a clinical response were 25.1%, 27.6% and 27.2% for placebo, once daily and twice daily respectively; treatment differences were not significant (2.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI -6.1% to 11.0%, P = 0.546 for once daily vs. placebo, and 2.1%; 95% CI -6.5% to 10.7%, P = 0.648 for twice daily vs. placebo). Adverse events were reported in 69.8%, 73.3% and 78.1% with serious adverse events in 8.9%, 5.9%, and 6.0% of patients in the placebo, once-daily and twice-daily groups, respectively.

In March 2018, marketing authorisations for flupirtine were withdrawn following a European Medicines Agency recommendation based on the finding that the restrictions introduced in 2013 had not been sufficiently followed in clinical practice, and cases of serious liver injury still occurred including liver failure. Flupirtine is a selective neuronal potassium channel opener (SNEPCO) that also has NMDA receptor antagonist and GABAA modulatory properties. It first became available in Europe in 1984 under the brand name Katadolon and after it went off patent many generic brands were introduced. == Uses == Flupirtine is used as an analgesic for acute pain, in moderate-to-severe cases. Its muscle relaxant properties make it popular for back pain and other orthopaedic uses, but it is also used for migraines, in oncology, postoperative care, and gynaecology. In 2013 due to issues with liver toxicity, the European Medicines Agency restricted its use to acute pain, for no more than two weeks, and only for people who cannot use other painkillers. == Side effects == The most serious side effect is frequent hepatotoxicity which prompted regulatory agencies to issue several warnings and restrictions. Flupirtine is devoid of negative psychological or motor function effects, or effects on reproductive function. == Abuse and dependence == Although some studies have reported flupirtine has no addictive properties, there was suggestion that it may possess some abuse potential and liability. There were at least two registered cases of flupirtine abuse. Drug tolerance does not develop in most cases, but has individually occurred. == Mechanism of action == Flupirtine is a selective neuronal potassium channel opener that also has indirect NMDA receptor antagonist and GABAA receptor modulatory properties. == History == Flupirtine was discovered and developed between the 1970s and the 1990s by Chemiewerk Homburg in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which became Degussa Pharma Group and then through mergers, ASTA Pharma and Asta Medica. Retigabine, in which the pyridine group in flupirtine is replaced with a phenyl group, was discovered as part of the same program and has a similar mechanism of action. It was approved for the treatment of pain in 1984 in Europe under the brand name Katadolon. As of 2013 it was used in 11 member countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Slovak Republic. Many generics entered the European market around 2011. It was never introduced to the United States market for any indication but in 2008, Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now called Synthetic Biologics, Inc.) obtained an option to license issued and patent pending applications relating to flupirtine's use in the treatment of ophthalmic indications, particularly retinitis pigmentosa. In 2010 retigabine was approved by the FDA as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures in treatment-experienced patients. As of 2016 it is marketed under many brand names, including Efiret, Flupigil, Flupirtin, Flupirtina, Flupirtine, Flupizen, Fluproxy, Katadolon, Metanor, Trancolong, and Zentiva. == Research == Flupirtine has been noted for its neuroprotective properties, and has been investigated for possible use in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It has also been proposed as a possible treatment for Batten disease. Flupirtine underwent a clinical trial as a treatment for multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia. Flupirtine showed promise for fibromyalgia due to its different action than the three approved by U.S. FDA drugs: pregabalin, milnacipran, and duloxetine. Additionally, there are case reports regarding flupirtine as a treatment for fibromyalgia.

It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, which licensed EVG from Japan Tobacco in March 2008. The drug gained approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on August 27, 2012, for use in adult patients starting HIV treatment for the first time as part of the fixed dose combination known as Stribild. On September 24, 2014, the FDA approved Elvitegravir as a single pill formulation under the trade name Vitekta. On November 5, 2015, the FDA approved the drug for use in patients affected with HIV-1 as a part of a second fixed dose combination pill known as Genvoya. According to the results of the phase II clinical trial, patients taking once-daily elvitegravir boosted by ritonavir had greater reductions in viral load after 24 weeks compared to individuals randomized to receive a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor. == Medical uses == In the United States, elvitegravir can be obtained either as part of the combination pills Stribild or Genvoya, or as the single pill formulation Vitekta. Vitekta is FDA approved to be used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have previous treatment experience with antiretroviral therapy. It must be used in combination with a protease inhibitor that is coadministered with ritonavir as well as additional antiretroviral drug(s). == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of taking elvitegravir are diarrhea (in 7% of patients) and nausea (4%). Other side effects that occurred in more than 1% of people are headache, tiredness, rashes, and vomiting. == Interactions and contraindications == Elvitegravir is metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A. Substances that induce this enzyme can reduce elvitegravir concentrations in the body, potentially triggering the development of resistant virus strains. Consequently, co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated; examples are rifampicin, the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, as well as St John's wort. Glucuronidation of elvitegravir is facilitated by the enzymes UGT1A1 and 3, resulting in increased blood plasma levels when taken together with strong UGT1A inhibitors such as ritonavir and other HIV protease inhibitors. (But ritonavir also increases elvitegravir levels by inhibiting CYP3A.) Furthermore, elvitegravir is a weak to medium inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A, and a number of UGTs; the clinical relevance of these findings is however unclear. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Elvitegravir inhibits the enzyme integrase of HIV-1, and of HIV-2 to a lesser extent. The virus needs this enzyme to integrate its genetic code into the host's DNA. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is taken by mouth. When taken together with ritonavir and a meal, it reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after four hours. Bioavailability is better with fatty meals. In the bloodstream, 98–99% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized mainly by CYP3A oxidation, and secondly by UGT1A1 and 3 glucuronidation. Nearly 95% are excreted via the feces, and the rest via urine. Plasma half-life when combined with ritonavir is 8.7 to 13.7 hours. == References == == External links == ""Elvitegravir"".

A multicenter, open-label phase Ib trial was conducted in Japan. Patients in Part 1 and Part 2-B received 0.2 mg amiselimod while those in Part 2-A received 0.4 mg amiselimod for 24 weeks. Seventeen subjects received 0.2 or 0.4 mg amiselimod. Amiselimod and amiselimod-P plasma concentrations increased dose-dependently. Peripheral blood lymphocyte count decreased in all patients after amiselimod treatment, with no clear dose response. There were no serious/severe adverse events (AEs) or clinically meaningful cardiac effects. Five subjects were withdrawn from amiselimod treatment following a decrease in lymphocyte count to <200/μl. Anti-double stranded-DNA antibody decreased from baseline to Week 24/end of treatment (EOT), with those in 2 subjects (22.2%) decreasing to within the normal range. Total SLE disease activity index 2000 score decreased by ≥4 at EOT in 7 of 17 subjects. Amiselimod was generally well tolerated. While no serious AEs or infectious AEs led to discontinuation, low lymphocyte counts of <200/μl were observed as a laboratory abnormality. Our findings suggest the potential efficacy of amiselimod for patients with SLE.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02307643. Amiselimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator in development for inflammatory bowel disease. It is converted to its active metabolite, amiselimod phosphate (amiselimod-P), and has a long half-life and slow accumulation to steady state. We evaluated a multiple-dose titration regimen to determine the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of amiselimod and amiselimod-P at steady state for the 0.4 mg QD therapeutic dose on day 13 and for the 0.8 mg QD supratherapeutic dose on day 26. We also investigated the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of amiselimod on absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs). A randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel study with a nested crossover design assessed amiselimod and amiselimod-P. Healthy adults received a single dose of placebo followed by oral amiselimod, which was upwardly titrated in doses ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 mg QD to rapidly achieve steady-state concentrations for the 0.4 mg QD and 0.8 mg QD doses within a 28-day treatment period. The PK parameters of amiselimod and amiselimod-P (on days 1, 13 and 26) included the geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation percentage [CV%]) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), median (minimum, maximum) time to Cmax (Tmax), geometric mean (geometric CV%) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the last measurable concentration, and geometric mean (geometric CV%) AUC from time 0 to 23.5 hours post dose (AUC0-23.5). Multidose PD were evaluated by changes in ALCs. The PK population included 95 amiselimod-treated participants and the PD population included 190 participants who received amiselimod or placebo. On day 13, the steady-state AUC and Cmax for amiselimod 0.4 mg QD increased by 10-fold for amiselimod and by 4-fold for amiselimod-P compared with day 1. On day 26, the steady-state AUC0-23.5 and Cmax for amiselimod 0.8 mg QD increased by 1.9-fold for amiselimod and by 1.8-fold for amiselimod-P compared with day 13. The median Tmax of plasma amiselimod and amiselimod-P were similar on all 3 days and were reached at 11 to 12 hours post dose for amiselimod and at 10 hours post dose for amiselimod-P. The mean ALCs for amiselimod exhibited a gradual decrease from pre-dose (1.681 × 103/uL) to a nadir of 0.424 × 103/uL on day 27. The abbreviated amiselimod dosing titration regimen reached steady state within 14 days for the therapeutic 0.4 mg QD regimen and within 26 days for the supratherapeutic 0.8 mg QD regimen; expected decreases in ALCs were observed following amiselimod. This double-blind study evaluated the cardiac safety of amiselimod. Healthy adults (n = 190) were randomized (2:1:1) to receive (1) oral placebo (day -1), followed by oral amiselimod (days 1-26), which was upwardly titrated from 0.4 to 1.6 mg once daily to achieve steady-state concentrations comparable with 0.4 (therapeutic) and 0.8 mg (supratherapeutic) once daily, and placebo (day 27); (2) placebo (day -1), oral moxifloxacin 400 mg (day 1; positive control), followed by placebo (days 1-27); or (3) placebo (days -1 to 26), followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg (day 27). No participant had a corrected QT interval by Fredericia (QTcF) >500 milliseconds or a change from baseline (dQTcF) >60 milliseconds. The upper limits of the 90%CIs for the differences in least-squares mean difference in dQTcF between amiselimod and placebo on days 13 and 26 were <10 milliseconds. Area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 23.5 hours after dosing and maximum plasma concentration of amiselimod and amiselimod-P (active metabolite) at steady-state concentrations for the 0.8-mg dose on day 26 were approximately double that observed with the 0.4-mg dose on day 13.

It is also used to treat adults with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. It reversibly inhibits sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in the renal proximal convoluted tubule to reduce glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion. Common side effects include hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), urinary tract infections, genital infections, and volume depletion (reduced amount of water in the body). Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common side effect in people with type 1 diabetes. Serious but rare side effects include Fournier gangrene. It was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb in partnership with AstraZeneca. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 115th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. Dapagliflozin is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Dapagliflozin is used along with diet, exercise, and usually with other glucose-lowering medications, to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin, in addition to other SGLT2-inhibitors, was shown to reduce the rate of decline in kidney function and kidney failure in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic adults when added to the existing treatment regimen. Dapagliflozin is also considered as an option for people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with a LVEF <40%. It can be given regardless of current diabetes status, in addition to standard medical therapy. Recent studies have indicated that the use of dapagliflozin and other medications from the SGLT-2 inhibitor class can reduce the risk of worsening heart failure, death, and hospitalization from cardiovascular disease. SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalisation due to heart failure in people with or without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease A small number of meta-analyses and cohort studies have shown that dapagliflozin is superior to others such as empagliflozin. In the European Union, dapagliflozin is indicated in adults: for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise: as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance; in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure; for the treatment of chronic kidney disease In November 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that dapagliflozin should no longer be used to treat type 1 diabetes. === Effects in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease === In 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) expanded the indications for dapagliflozin to include the treatment of people who have chronic kidney disease but do not have diabetes. Clinical trials have shown the following effects of such a treatment. The DIAMOND trial (2017–2019) showed in treatment periods of six weeks no improvement of excess proteins in the urine (proteinuria), a significant deterioration of the kidney's filtration rate (reversible within 6 weeks after dapagliflozin discontinuation), and a significant mean loss of body weight of 1.5 kg. The DAPA-CKD trial (2017–2020) showed in a median treatment period of 2.4 years of participants who had already been under ACE inhibitor (ACE) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy that the events of a sustained decline of 50% in the kidney's filtration rate, kidney failure, or death occurred statistically around eight months later in the treatment group than in the placebo group. In the first 12-16 months of treatment, however, the kidney filtration rate was worse in the treatment group than in the placebo group, being slightly less negative in the treatment group than in the placebo group only thereafter. == Adverse effects == Since dapagliflozin leads to heavy glycosuria (sometimes up to about 70 grams per day), it can lead to rapid weight loss and tiredness. The glucose acts as an osmotic diuretic (this effect is the cause of polyuria in diabetes), which can lead to dehydration. The increased amount of glucose in the urine can also worsen the infections already associated with diabetes, particularly urinary tract infections and thrush (candidiasis). Rarely, the use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor medication, including dapagliflozin, is associated with necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also called Fournier gangrene. Dapagliflozin is also associated with hypotensive reactions. Concerns exist that it may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetic patients. However, the DEPICT-1 and DEPICT-2 trials showed that dapagliflozin caused additional diabetic ketoacidosis events in the Type I diabetic patients who received dapagliflozin. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, and trouble breathing. Dapagliflozin can cause dehydration, serious urinary tract infections, and genital yeast infections. Elderly people and people with kidney dysfunction, low blood pressure, or who are on diuretic medications should have their volume status and kidney function assessed. Individuals with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis should also be assessed. Dapagliflozin can cause low blood sugar when combined with insulin. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis after surgery, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT-2 inhibitors to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should each be stopped at least three days before, and ertugliflozin should be stopped at least four days before scheduled surgery. The glucose-lowering effect of dapagliflozin starts to diminish in people with chronic kidney disease with reduced kidney function (eGFR <45mL/min), and may not be as effective for glycemic control. However, studies have demonstrated a renoprotective effect in reducing kidney function decline, dapagliflozin can still be used to reduce kidney function decline regardless of diabetes status. Therefore, while dapagliflozin can be used in people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease to prevent kidney function decline, further interventions may be needed for glycemic control. == Chemistry == The first synthesis of dapagliflozin was disclosed in a patent filed by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2002. The two main carbon-containing fragments are combined by the reaction of an aryl lithium with a trimethylsilyl-protected gluconolactone. The trimethylsilyl groups are then removed by treatment with methanesulfonic acid in methanol. This gives an intermediate with an unwanted methoxy group at the anomeric centre, which is removed by reaction with triethylsilane in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate. This route, as well as others developed for the manufacture of the drug, have been reviewed. == Mechanism of action == Dapagliflozin inhibits subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2), which are responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminated through the urine. In combination with metformin, dapagliflozin at standard treatment dose of 10 mg daily lowered HbA1c by 0.54-0.84% (5.9-9.3 mmol/mol) when compared to metformin monotherapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and normal renal function. Its protective effects in heart failure are attributed primarily to haemodynamic effects, where SGLT2 inhibitors potently reduce intravascular volume through osmotic diuresis and natriuresis. This consequently may lead to a reduction in preload and afterload, thereby alleviating cardiac workload and improving left ventricular function. === Selectivity === The IC50 for SGLT2 is less than one-thousandth of the IC50 for SGLT1 (1.1 versus 1390 nmol/L), so that the drug does not interfere with intestinal glucose absorption. == Names == Dapagliflozin is the International nonproprietary name (INN), and the United States Adopted Name (USAN). The fixed-dose combination product, dapagliflozin/metformin extended-release, is sold under the brand name Xigduo XR. In July 2016, the fixed-dose combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin was authorized for medical use in the European Union and is sold under the brand name Qtern. The combination drug was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2017, where it also is sold under the brand name Qtern. In May 2019, the fixed-dose combination of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin hydrochloride as extended-release tablets was approved in the United States to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes when used in combination with diet and exercise. The FDA granted the approval of Qternmet XR to AstraZeneca. The combination drug was authorized for use in the European Union in November 2019, and is sold under the brand name Qtrilmet. == History == In 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion on the drug. Dapagliflozin was found effective in several studies in participants with type 2 diabetes. The main measure of effectiveness was the level of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which indicates how well blood glucose is controlled. In two studies involving 840 participants with type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin when used alone decreased HbA1c levels by 0.66% more than placebo (a dummy treatment) after 24 weeks. In four other studies involving 2,370 participants, adding dapagliflozin to other diabetes medicines decreased HbA1c levels by 0.54–0.68% more than adding placebo after 24 weeks. In a study involving 814 participants with type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin used in combination with metformin was at least as effective as a sulphonylurea (another type of diabetes medicine) used with metformin. Both combinations reduced HbA1c levels by 0.52% after 52 weeks. A long-term study, involving over 17,000 participants with type 2 diabetes, looked at the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease. The study indicated that dapagliflozin's effects were in line with those of other diabetes medicines that also work by blocking SGLT2. In two studies involving 1,648 participants with type 1 diabetes whose blood sugar was not controlled well enough on insulin alone, adding dapagliflozin 5 mg decreased HbA1c levels after 24 hours by 0.37% and by 0.42% more than adding placebo. Dapagliflozin was authorized for medical use in the European Union in November 2012. It is sold in a number of European countries. Dapagliflozin was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2014. In 2020, the US FDA expanded the indications for dapagliflozin to include treatment for adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. It is the first in this particular drug class, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, to be approved to treat adults with New York Heart Association's functional class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The results of the DAPA-HF and DECLARE-TIMI 58 clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of dapagliflozin compared to placebo in improving survival in adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction by 17%. They both showed a reduction in the number of hospitalizations from worsening heart failure, cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. The safety and effectiveness of dapagliflozin were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4,744 participants. The average age of participants was 66 years and more participants were male (77%) than female. To determine the drug's effectiveness, investigators examined the occurrence of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a once-daily dose of either 10 mg of dapagliflozin or a placebo (inactive treatment). After about 18 months, people who received dapagliflozin had fewer cardiovascular deaths, hospitalizations for heart failure, and urgent heart-failure visits than those receiving the placebo. In July 2020, the FDA granted AstraZeneca a Fast Track Designation in the US for the development of dapagliflozin to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in adults following a heart attack. In August 2020, detailed results from the Phase III DAPA-CKD trial reportedly showed that dapagliflozin on top of standard of care reduced the composite measure of worsening of renal function or risk of cardiovascular or renal death by 39% compared to placebo (p<0.0001) in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion. The results were consistent in patients both with and without type 2 diabetes. In April 2021, the FDA expanded the indications for dapagliflozin to include reducing the risk of kidney function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease who are at risk of disease progression. The efficacy of dapagliflozin to improve kidney outcomes and reduce cardiovascular death in people with chronic kidney disease was evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind study of 4,304 participants. In February 2023, the EU authorized dapagliflozin for extended use to cover heart failure patients across the full spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), including those with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction. == Society and culture == === Legal status === A generic version of dapagliflozin was approved by the US FDA in February 2022, but cannot be sold until October 2025. A generic version was approved in Canada in May 2023. In January 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for a generic version of Forxiga, which has been authorized in the EU since November 2012. Dapagliflozin Viatris was authorized for medical use in the European Union in March 2023. == Research == A systematic review concluded that dapagliflozin reduced heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality in people with HFrEF (i.e., congestive heart failure) and diabetes. == References ==",Farxiga,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1086402082582936e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -7.712543447269127e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/farxiga.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Farxiga: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/farxiga.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a derivative of the early insecticide DDT and an isomer of p,p'-DDDTooltip dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) and is also known as 2,4'-(dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane (o,p'-DDD). == Medical uses == Mitotane has been produced by Bristol Myers Squibb but it is marketed as an orphan drug for adrenocortical carcinoma due to the small number of patients in need of it. Its main use is in those patients who have persistent disease despite surgical resection, those who are not surgical candidates, or those who have metastatic disease. In a 2007 retrospective study of 177 patients from 1985 to 2005 showed a significant increase in the recurrence-free interval after radical surgery followed by mitotane when compared to surgery alone. The drug is also sometimes used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. == Side effects == The use of mitotane is unfortunately limited by side effects, which, as reported by Schteingart et al., include anorexia and nausea (88%), diarrhea (38%), vomiting (23%), decreased memory and ability to concentrate (50%), rash (23%), gynecomastia (50%), arthralgia (19%), and leukopenia (7%). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mitotane is an inhibitor of the adrenal cortex. It acts as an inhibitor of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), and also of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), 18-hydroxylase (aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2), and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) to a lesser extent. In addition, mitotane has direct and selective cytotoxic effects on the adrenal cortex, via an unknown mechanism, and thereby induces permanent adrenal atrophy similarly to DDD. == Chemistry == Analogues of mitotane include aminoglutethimide, amphenone B, and metyrapone. == History == Mitotane was introduced in 1960 for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Mitotane is the generic name of the medication and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Mitotane is sold under the brand name Lysodren. == Veterinary use == Mitotane is also used to treat Cushing's disease (pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome) in dogs.

415,"('Dutasteride', 'Gg 745', 'Gi 198745', 'Avodart', 'Avolve')",Medical,"Dutasteride, sold under the brand name Avodart among others, is a medication primarily used to treat the symptoms of a benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate not associated with cancer. A few months may be required before benefits occur. It is also used for scalp hair loss in men and as a part of hormone therapy in transgender women. It is usually taken by mouth. The most commonly reported side effects of dutasteride, although rare, include sexual dysfunction and depression. In the largest available study of 6,729 men with BPH, 9% experienced erectile dysfunction (compared to 5.7% treated with a placebo), 3.3% experienced decreased sex drive (vs 1.6% of placebo), and 1.9% had enlarged breasts (vs 1% of placebo). Exposure during pregnancy is specifically contraindicated because antiandrogens such as dutasteride have been shown to interfere with the sexual development of male fetuses. Dutasteride was patented in 1993 by Glaxo Wellcome (later known as GSK after additional mergers) and was approved for medical use in 2001. In the United States and elsewhere, it is available as a generic medication. In 2018, it was the 291st-most commonly prescribed medication in the US with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer === Dutasteride is used for treating BPH, colloquially known as an ""enlarged prostate"". It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. for this indication. A 2010 Cochrane review found a 25–26% reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitor chemoprevention. === Scalp hair loss and excessive hair growth === Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia in South Korea and Japan at a dosage of 0.5 mg per day. Several studies have found it to induce hair regrowth in men more rapidly and to a greater extent than even the highest approved dosage of finasteride. The superior effectiveness of dutasteride relative to finasteride for this indication is because the inhibition of 5α-reductase and consequent reduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production within the hair follicles is more complete with dutasteride. Dutasteride is also used off-label in the treatment of female pattern hair loss. Other 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride (a type 2 inhibitor) have been used off-label to treat excessive hair growth in women with hirsutism. Since dutasteride is an inhibitor of both type 1 and 2 5α-reductases, it could theoretically be a more effective therapy for hirsutism. However, dutasteride is not recommended for this indication due to a lack of supportive clinical evidence and a substantial risk of birth defects in female patients who inadvertently become pregnant. === Transgender hormone therapy === Dutasteride is sometimes used as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women in combination with an estrogen and/or another antiandrogen such as spironolactone. It may be useful for preventing and treating scalp hair loss and can also be used as a general antiandrogen for in those who have issues tolerating spironolactone, though as a α-reductase inhibitor it has limited effects compared to AR antagonists. === Available forms === Dutasteride is provided in the form of soft, oil-filled gelatin capsules containing 0.5 mg dutasteride each. == Contraindications == Women who are or who may become pregnant should not handle the drug. Dutasteride can cause birth defects in male fetuses, specifically ambiguous genitalia and undermasculinization. This is due to its antiandrogenic effects similar to what is seen in 5α-reductase deficiency. For the same reason, women who are currently pregnant should never take dutasteride. People taking dutasteride should not donate blood to prevent birth defects if a pregnant woman receives blood and should also not donate blood for at least 6 months after the cessation of treatment due to the drug's long elimination half-life. Children and people with known significant hypersensitivity (e.g., serious skin reactions, angioedema) to dutasteride should not take it. == Adverse effects == Dutasteride has overall been found to be well tolerated in studies of both men and women, producing minimal side effects. Adverse effects include headache and gastrointestinal discomfort. Isolated reports of menstrual changes, acne, and dizziness also exist. A small risk of sexual side effects has been documented in men taking the drug during the first few months of therapy. The FDA added a black-box warning to dutasteride in 2011 describing an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer in those who take the drug. No direct mechanistic link between 5α-reductase inhibitors and prostate cancer has been established. This is not due to a direct link between dutasteride or other 5α-reductase inhibitors and cancer per se, but rather that those who take 5α-reductase inhibitors may have a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and therefore increases in PSA (which are an indicator of possible cancer) may be masked in those who take the drug. This is thought to delay cancer diagnosis so that patients taking 5α-reductase inhibitors present with a higher-grade tumor at the time of diagnosis. The American Urological Association advises that increased risk for patients taking these drugs leads to higher prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. The AUA also advises that this affect can be alleviated with more frequent screening and lower PSA cutoffs for diagnostic biopsies in men taking dutasteride or other 5α-reductase inhibitors. Dutasteride is known to reduce the growth and prevalence of benign prostate tumors. A 2018 meta-analysis found no higher risk of breast cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Sexual and mood side effects, such as erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, depression, and reduced semen volume occur in as many as 4.8% of patients taking 5α-reductase inhibitors including dutasteride. In affected men, semen volume is decreased an average of 30%, with a smaller subgroup of patients also experiencing a decrease of sperm motility of 6 to 12%. Sperm shape and function are unaffected and the impact on male fertility is unknown. These negative effects reverse by 3–4 months after discontinuation of the drug. In a study of 6,729 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, a condition where the prostate grows unassociated with cancer), 9% had erectile dysfunction (compared to 5.7% treated with a placebo), 3.3% experienced decreased sex drive (vs 1.6% of placebo), and 1.9% had enlarged breasts (vs 1% of placebo). These effects were noted to resolve over time, with many fewer men reporting any adverse effects by the end of the 4-year study. The rate of discontinuation of the drug due to adverse effects was less than 5%. A subset of men affected by sexual and mood side effects report persistent loss of libido, depression, and erectile dysfunction for several years after discontinuing treatment. This remains a highly contested topic in the academic literature due to disagreements about whether the nocebo effect may play a role, whether self-report questionnaires are reliable for this data, and whether enough objective evidence exists to conclude these effects are persistent after discontinuation of the drug. The Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation (PFSF) was created with a medical advisory board to study the topic (finasteride is a similar 5α-reductase inhibitor) and lawsuits alleging harm from the drug are ongoing. Concerns from the PFSF and other patient advocates led the FDA to add a black-box warning to Finasteride for possible risks of suicide in June 2022. Some experts have questioned the basis of the black-box warning, given that it relies on anecdotal patient-reported outcomes rather than prospective trials. == Overdose == No specific antidote for overdose of dutasteride is known, since the drug is extremely safe and well tolerated. Research studies show that even at 100 times the normal dose, dutasteride is not lethal. Treatment of dutasteride overdose should be based on symptoms and should be with supportive therapies. The long elimination half-life of dutasteride should be taken into consideration in the event of an overdose of the medication. Dutasteride has been used in clinical studies at doses of up to 40 mg/day for a week (80 times the therapeutic dosage) and 5 mg/day for 6 months (10 times the therapeutic dosage) with no significant safety concerns or additional side effects. == Current investigations == Dutasteride has been studied in combination with bicalutamide in the treatment of prostate cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating whether dutasteride may be an effective treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), because dutasteride may inhibit the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid metabolite, which may be responsible for some of the debilitating symptoms of PMDD. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Dutasteride belongs to a class of drugs called 5α-reductase inhibitors, which block the action of the 5α-reductase enzymes that convert testosterone into DHT. It inhibits all three forms of 5α-reductase, and can decrease DHT levels in the blood by up to 98%. Specifically it is a competitive, mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibitor of all three isoforms of 5α-reductase, types I, II, and III (IC50Tooltip Half-maximal inhibitory concentration values are 3.9 nM for type I and 1.8 nM for type II). This is in contrast to finasteride, which is similarly an irreversible inhibitor of 5α-reductase but only inhibits the type II and III isoenzymes. As a result of this difference, dutasteride is able to achieve a reduction in circulating DHT levels of up to 98%, whereas finasteride is able to achieve a reduction of only 65 to 70%. In spite of the differential reduction in circulating DHT levels, the two drugs decrease levels of DHT to a similar extent of approximately 85 to 90% in the prostate gland, where the type II isoform predominates. Since 5α-reductases degrade testosterone to DHT, the inhibition of these enzymes could theoretically cause an increase in testosterone. A 2018 review found that initiation of 5α-reductase inhibitors did not result in a consistent increase in testosterone levels. Among the studies analyzed, there was no statistically significant change in testosterone levels from 5α-reductase inhibitors overall, though men with lower baseline testosterone levels did show an increase. In addition to inhibition of DHT production, 5α-reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride are also neurosteroidogenesis inhibitors, preventing the 5α-reductase-mediated biosynthesis of various neurosteroids, including allopregnanolone (from progesterone), THDOCTooltip tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (from deoxycorticosterone), and 3α-androstanediol (from testosterone). These neurosteroids are potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor and have shown antidepressant, anxiolytic, and pro-sexual effects in animal research. For this reason, decreased neurosteroid production is one hypothesized mechanism for sexual dysfunction and depression associated with 5α-reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of dutasteride is about 60%. Consumption with food does not adversely affect its absorption. Peak plasma levels occur 2 to 3 hours after administration. Dutasteride is present in semen at levels up to 3 ng/ml, with no significant effects on DHT levels of sexual partners. The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4. It has three major metabolites: 6'-hydroxydutasteride, 4'-hydroxydutasteride, and 1,2-dihydrodutasteride. The former two are formed by CYP3A4, while the latter is not. All three metabolites are active; 6'-hydroxydutasteride has similar 5α-reductase inhibitor potency as dutasteride, while the other two are less potent. Dutasteride has an extremely long terminal or elimination half-life of about 4 to 5 weeks. Its elimination half-life is increased in the elderly (170 hours for men aged 20–49 years, 300 hours for men aged >70 years). No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly nor in patients with renal impairment. Because of its long elimination half-life, dutasteride requires 5 to 6 months to reach steady-state concentrations. It also remains in the body for a long time after discontinuation and can be detected up to 4 to 6 months. In contrast to dutasteride, finasteride has a short terminal half-life of only 5 to 8 hours. Dutasteride is eliminated mainly in the feces (40%) as metabolites. A smaller portion (5%) is eliminated unchanged in the urine. == Chemistry == Dutasteride, also known as N-[2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-oxo-4-aza-5α-androst-1-ene-17β-carboxamide, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 4-azasteroid. It is an analogue of finasteride in which the tert-butyl amide moiety has been replaced with a 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group. == History == Dutasteride was patented in 1996 and was first described in the scientific literature in 1997. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of BPH in November 2001, and was introduced on the United States market the following year under the brand name Avodart. Dutasteride has subsequently been introduced in many other countries, including throughout Europe and South America. The patent protection of dutasteride expired in November 2015, so the drug has since become available in the United States in a variety of low-cost generic formulations. It was approved for the treatment of scalp hair loss in South Korea in 2009 and in Japan in 2015. It has not been approved for this indication in the United States, though it is often used off-label. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Dutasteride is the generic name of the drug Avodart and its international nonproprietary name, United States Adopted Name, British Approved Name, and Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Dutasteride is sold primarily under the brand name Avodart, but also in combination with tamsulosin under the brand names Combodart, Duodart, and Jalyn. Dutasteride is also available in India in combination with alfuzosin under the brand names Alfusin-D and Dutalfa. === Availability === Dutasteride is available widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Europe, Australia, South Africa, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere. It is available as a generic medication in many countries, including the United States. == References == == Further reading ==",Avodart,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7523612768854946e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005558376433327794)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/avodart.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Avodart: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/avodart.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The most common side effect is diarrhea, which affects nearly all patients. Other common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tiredness, belly pain, rash, decreased appetite, stomatitis (sore, inflamed mouth), and muscle spasms. == Medical uses == In the European Union and the United States, neratinib is indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of adults with early stage (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab based therapy. In the United States, it is also indicated, in combination with capecitabine, for the treatment of adults with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting. == Contraindications == Women who are pregnant should not take it, and women should not become pregnant while taking it, and women who are breast-feeding should not use it, as it can cause harm to the fetus and to the baby. == Adverse effects == Neratinib can cause life-threatening diarrhea in some people and mild to moderate diarrhea in almost everyone; people who take it are also at risk for complications of diarrhea like dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Similarly, there is a risk of severe liver damage and many patients have some level of it; symptoms of liver damage include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and high levels of eosinophils. In addition to the above, more than 10% of people taking it have nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, sores on their lips, stomach upset, decreased appetite, rashes, and muscle spasms. == Interactions == People taking neratinib should not also take gastric acid reducing agents including proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists; antacids may be used three hours before of after taking it. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 increase the activity of neratinib and can make adverse effects worse, and drugs that induce CYP3A4 make neratinib less active and can reduce its efficacy. Neratinib also inhibits p-glycoprotein and effectively raises the dose of drugs like digoxin that depend on it for elimination. == Pharmacology == Like lapatinib and afatinib, it is a dual inhibitor of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinases. It inhibits them by covalently binding with a cysteine side chain in those proteins. Unlike related noncovalent inhibitors, neratinib is effective against the T790M resistant variant of EGFR. Neratinib has an IC50 of 59 nM against HER2 and shows weak inhibition against KDR and Scr with IC50 values of 0.8 μM and 1.4 μM, respectively. In BT474 cells, neratinib reduces HER2 autophosphorylation, and inhibited cyclin D1 expression while reduced proliferation has been observed A431 cells when treated with neratinib at concentrations of 3 or 5 nM. In xenograft models with 3T3/neu tumors oral administration of neratinib at 10, 20, 40 or 80 mg/kg was able to inhibit tumor growth while in SK-OV-3 models doses of 5 and 60 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth. == Cell Biology == Neratinib is found to strongly reduce the amount of HER2 released by extracellular vescicles and to enhance the capacity of clathrin mediated endocytosis. However, despite HER2 mediated signaling downregulation, Neratinib exerts only a modest effect on HER2 trafficking at IC50 of 6nM in SKBR3 cells. == Chemistry == Neratinib is a 4-anilino-3-cyano quinoline derivative. == History == Neratinib was discovered and initially developed by Wyeth; Pfizer continued development up to Phase III in breast cancer, and licensed it to Puma Biotechnology in 2011. It was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2017, for the extended adjuvant treatment of adults with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, (after adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy). Approval was based on the ExteNET trial (NCT00878709), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of neratinib following adjuvant trastuzumab treatment.

417,"('Isoxazole, 33', 'Ex-a2526', 'S7459')",Medical," Fear-inducing memories can be state dependent, meaning that they can best be retrieved if the brain states at encoding and retrieval are similar. Restricted access to such memories can present a risk for psychiatric disorders and hamper their treatment. To better understand the mechanisms underlying state-dependent fear, we used a mouse model of contextual fear conditioning. We found that heightened activity of hippocampal extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, believed to impair fear and memory, actually enabled their state-dependent encoding and retrieval. This effect required protein kinase C-βII and was influenced by miR-33, a microRNA that regulates several GABA-related proteins. In the extended hippocampal circuit, extrasynaptic GABAA receptors promoted subcortical, but impaired cortical, activation during memory encoding of context fear. Moreover, suppression of retrosplenial cortical activity, which normally impairs retrieval, had an enhancing effect on the retrieval of state-dependent fear. These mechanisms can serve as treatment targets for managing access to state-dependent memories of stressful experiences. To determine whether activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) alters cellular and plasma cholesterol homeostasis as a result of regulation of Srebp-2 and miR-33. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data identified an FXR response element within intron 10 of the Srebp-2 gene. Consistent with this observation, treatment of mice with FXR-specific agonists (GSK2324 or GW4064) rapidly increased hepatic levels of Srebp-2 mRNA, precursor sterol response element binding protein 2 (pSREBP-2) protein, and miR-33. Furthermore, miR-33 targets, that include ABCA1 (ATP binding cassette transporter A1), NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor), and CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1), were all reduced in GSK2324-treated mice. In contrast, neither nuclear SREBP-2 protein (nSREBP-2) nor SREBP-2 target genes were induced after FXR activation. The inability to process pSREBP-2 to nSREBP-2 is likely a consequence of the induction of insulin INSIG-2A (induced gene 2A) by FXR agonists. Finally, we show that FXR-dependent induction of both Srebp-2 and miR-33 is ablated in Scap(-/-) mice that lack nuclear SREBP-2. We demonstrate that the activation of FXR uncouples the expression of nuclear SREBP-2 and miR-33, and the regulation of their respective target genes. Further, we conclude that the FXR agonist-dependent increase in miR-33 requires transcription of the Srebp-2 gene. Influenza A virus (FLUAV) is a significant human pathogen. In silico structural analysis (PMID 28628827) has suggested that the FDA-approved drug paliperidone interferes with the binding of the FLUAV polymerase subunit PB2 to the nucleoprotein NP. We found that paliperidone inhibits FLUAV A/PR/8/34 early after infection of canine MDCK II, human A549, and human primary bronchial cells, but not at late time points. No effect was detectable against the strains A/Hamburg/05/2009 and A/WSN/33. Moreover, paliperidone indeed disturbed the interaction between the PB2 and the NP of A/PR/8/34 and reduced early viral RNA and protein synthesis by approximately 50%. Thus, paliperidone has measurable but transient and virus-strain-restricted effects on FLUAV.","Isoxazole, 33",PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.002928138244897127), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.030148398131132126)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/14/5/468,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8156388/,https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C288142&Mask=30 ', [])"
418,"('Sodium dichloroacetate', 'Dichloracetic acid', 'Acetic acid, dichloro-', 'Dichloroethanoic acid', 'Dichlorethanoic acid')",Medical,"Dichloroacetic acid (DCA), sometimes called bichloroacetic acid (BCA), is the organic compound with formula CHCl2CO2H. It is an analogue of acetic acid, in which 2 of the 3 hydrogen atoms of the methyl group have been replaced by chlorine atoms. Like the other chloroacetic acids, it has various practical applications. The salts and esters of dichloroacetic acid are called dichloroacetates. == Reactions == The chemistry of dichloroacetic acid is typical for halogenated organic acids. It is an alkylating agent. It forms esters. It is a member of the chloroacetic acids family. As such it is more acidic than acetic acid. It fully dissociates into dichloroacetate when dissolved in water, consistent with it pKa of 1.35, pure dichloroacetic acid is classed as a strong organic acid; it is very corrosive and extremely destructive to tissues of the mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract via inhalation. == Natural occurrence == DCA has been shown to occur in nature in at least one seaweed, Asparagopsis taxiformis and also in the mushroom Russula nigricans. It is a trace product of the chlorination of drinking water and is produced by the metabolism of various chlorine-containing drugs or chemicals. DCA is typically prepared by the reduction of trichloroacetic acid (TCA). DCA is prepared from chloral hydrate also by the reaction with calcium carbonate and sodium cyanide in water followed by acidifying with hydrochloric acid. As a laboratory reagent, both DCA and TCA are used as precipitants to prompt macromolecules such as proteins to precipitate out of solution. == Therapeutic uses == Salts of DCA have been studied as potential drugs because they inhibit the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Although preliminary studies found that DCA can slow the growth of certain tumors in animal studies and in vitro studies, as of 2012 insufficient evidence supported the use of DCA for cancer treatment. === Lactic acidosis === A randomized controlled trial in children with congenital lactic acidosis found that while DCA was well tolerated, it was ineffective in improving clinical outcomes. A separate trial of DCA in children with MELAS (a syndrome of inadequate mitochondrial function, leading to lactic acidosis) was halted early, as all 15 of the children receiving DCA experienced significant nerve toxicity without any evidence of benefit from the medication. A randomized controlled trial of DCA in adults with lactic acidosis found that while DCA lowered blood lactate levels, it had no clinical benefit and did not improve hemodynamics or survival. Thus, while early case reports and pre-clinical data suggested that DCA might be effective for lactic acidosis, subsequent controlled trials have found no clinical benefit of DCA in this setting. In addition, clinical trial subjects were incapable of continuing on DCA as a study medication owing to progressive toxicities. === Cancer === In 2007 reports emerged in the press and via the Internet that Evangelos Michelakis and coworkers at the University of Alberta had reported that sodium dichloroacetate reduced tumors in rats and killed cancer cells in vitro. Because the drug cannot be patented, financing the broad and expensive testing required to obtain FDA approval is problematic. The US Food and Drug Administration enforces the law that prohibits the sale of substances with the suggestion that they are cancer treatments unless they have been approved by the FDA. The American Cancer Society in 2012 stated that ""available evidence does not support the use of DCA for cancer treatment at this time."" Physicians warned of potential problems if people attempt to try DCA outside a controlled clinical trial. One problem with attempting this is obtaining the chemical. One fraudster was sentenced to 33 months in prison for selling a white powder containing starch, but no DCA, to people with cancer. The only monitored in vivo dosage of five human patients with glioblastoma with DCA was not designed to test its efficacy against their cancer. This study was rather to see whether it could be given at a specific dosage safely without causing side effects (e.g. neuropathy). All five patients were receiving other treatments during the study. Observations in vitro and of tumours extracted from those five patients suggest that DCA might act against cancer cells by depolarising abnormal mitochondria found in glioblastoma cancer cells – allowing the mitochondria to induce apoptosis (cell death) of the malignant cells. In vitro work with DCA on neuroblastomas (which have fewer recognised mitochondrial abnormalities) showed activity against malignant, undifferentiated cells. A 2016 case report discussed and reviewed the application of DCA in central nervous system malignancies. A 2018 study found that DCA could trigger a metabolic switch from glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to mitochondrial OXPHOS and increase reactive oxygen stress affecting tumor cells. These effects were not observed in non-tumor cells. === Neuropathy === Neuropathy has been a problem in some clinical trials with DCA causing them to be effectively halted, but a 2008 BJC review found that it has not occurred in other DCA trials. The mechanism of DCA induced neuropathy is not well understood. On the one hand in vitro work with nerves has suggested a mechanism for the neuropathic effect of DCA; with DCA showing a dose and exposure dependent demyelination of nerves (stripping of the nerve 'sheath'), which demyelination was partially reversible over time, following washout of DCA. On the other hand, the 2008 review in BJC states ""This neurotoxicity resembled the pattern of length-dependent, axonal, sensorimotor polyneuropathy without demyelination."" with regard to the 2006 study by Kaufman et al. === Heart failure === DCA has been investigated as a treatment for post-ischemic recovery. There is also evidence that DCA improves metabolism by NADH production stimulation, but may lead to a depletion of NADH in normoxia. == See also == Dalapon (dichloropropionic acid) == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0868 Sodium dichloroacetate (DCA) dosage and usage",Dichloroethanoic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('IND', -0.12962491810321808), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.38696393370628357), (' FOOD', -0.8610404133796692)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.3691810071468353), ('ICAL', -1.0609570381348021e-05), (',', -0.014206582680344582), ('ĠINDU', -0.06652054935693741), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38699349761009216)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.10020667314529419), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL; https://oehha.ca.gov/water/chemicals/haloacetic-acids-dichloroacetic-acid,https://www.osha.gov/chemicaldata/695,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK294278/ ', [])"

Residual symptoms could be due to nasal neuronal hyperresponsiveness caused by stimulation of the ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). SB-705498 is a TRPV1 antagonist that has been developed in an intranasal formulation for treatment of AR. This randomized, double-blind, 3-way incomplete block crossover study evaluated the effects of 8 days treatment with SB-705498 12 mg alone, SB-705498 12 mg plus fluticasone propionate 200 μg (FP), FP 200 μg alone or placebo on allergen-induced symptoms in 70 patients with AR. The primary endpoint was total nasal symptom score (TNSS), expressed as mean over 4 hours or maximum TNSS during allergen challenge in the Vienna Challenge Chamber on 8th day of treatment. At the end of treatment, there were no differences in allergen-induced mean TNSS between SB-705498 alone and placebo or between SB-705498 plus FP and FP alone. Treatment with FP and SB-705498 plus FP resulted in a significant decrease in TNSS vs. placebo. Mean (90% CI) treatment differences in TNSS over 0 - 4 hours were: SB-705498 - placebo: -0.2 (-0.9, 0.4); SB-705498 plus FP - FP: 0.7 (0.2, 1.2); FP - placebo: -2.9 (-3.4, -2.5); SB-705498 plus FP - placebo: -2.3 (-2.8, -1.8). SB-705498 had no impact on diary card symptoms, nasal airflow or Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire scores. SB-705498 was well tolerated and pharmacokinetics exposure results supported the dosing regimen. SB-705498 12 mg for 8 days did not alleviate the allergen-induced symptoms of AR, or provide additional relief of symptoms when in combination with FP. Despite engagement of the TRPV1 receptor there was no translation to clinical efficacy, suggesting redundancy in symptom pathways. To assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of intranasal SB-705498, a selective TRPV1 antagonist. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical studies were performed: (i) an intranasal SB-705498 first time in human study to examine the safety and PK of five single escalating doses from 0.5 to 12 mg and of repeat dosing with 6 mg and 12 mg twice daily for 14 days and (ii) a PD efficacy study in subjects with non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) to evaluate the effect of 12 mg intranasal SB-705498 against nasal capsaicin challenge. Single and repeat dosing with intranasal SB-705498 was safe and well tolerated. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar for SB-705498 and placebo and no dose-dependent increase was observed. Administration of SB-705498 resulted in less than dose proportional AUC(0,12 h) and Cmax , while repeat dosing from day 1 to day 14 led to its accumulation. SB-705498 receptor occupancy in nasal tissue was estimated to be high (>80%). Administration of 12 mg SB-705498 to patients with NAR induced a marked reduction in total symptom scores triggered by nasal capsaicin challenge. Inhibition of rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and burning sensation was associated with 2- to 4-fold shift in capsaicin potency. Intranasal SB-705498 has an appropriate safety and PK profile for development in humans and achieves clinically relevant attenuation of capsaicin-provoked rhinitis symptoms in patients with NAR. The potential impact intranasal SB-705498 may have in rhinitis treatment deserves further evaluation. Nasal sensory nerves play an important role in symptoms associated with rhinitis triggered by environmental stimuli. Here, we propose that TRPV1 is pivotal in nasal sensory nerve activation and assess the potential of SB-705498 as an intranasal therapy for rhinitis. The inhibitory effect of SB-705498 on capsaicin-induced currents in guinea pig trigeminal ganglion cells innervating nasal mucosa was investigated using patch clamp electrophysiology. A guinea pig model of rhinitis was developed using intranasal challenge of capsaicin and hypertonic saline to elicit nasal secretory parasympathetic reflex responses, quantified using MRI. The inhibitory effect of SB-705498, duration of action and potency comparing oral versus intranasal route of administration were examined. SB-705498 concentration-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced currents in isolated trigeminal ganglion cells (pIC50 7.2). In vivo, capsaicin ipsilateral nasal challenge (0.03-1 mM) elicited concentration-dependent increases in contralateral intranasal fluid secretion. Ten per cent hypertonic saline initiated a similar response. Atropine inhibited responses to either challenge. SB-705498 inhibited capsaicin-induced responses by ∼50% at 10 mg·kg⁻¹ (oral), non-micronized 10 mg·mL⁻¹ or 1 mg·mL⁻¹ micronized SB-705498 (intranasal) suspension. Ten milligram per millilitre intranasal SB-705498, dosed 24 h prior to capsaicin challenge produced a 52% reduction in secretory response. SB-705498 (10 mg·mL⁻¹, intranasal) inhibited 10% hypertonic saline responses by 70%. The paper reports the development of a guinea pig model of rhinitis. SB-705498 inhibits capsaicin-induced trigeminal currents and capsaicin-induced contralateral nasal secretions via oral and intranasal routes; efficacy was optimized using particle-reduced SB-705498.

420,"('Nadifloxacin', 'Jinofloxacin', 'Acuatim', 'Nadixa', 'Nadifloxacine')",Medical,"Nadifloxacin (INN, brand names Acuatim, Nadiflox, Nadoxin, Nadixa, Activon) is a topical fluoroquinolone antibiotic for the treatment of acne vulgaris. It is also used to treat bacterial skin infections. == Pharmacology == === Antibacterial spectrum === In vitro studies of nadifloxacin showed potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against aerobic Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, including Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Nadifloxacinshowed potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which was similar to potency against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The drug was also active against new quinolone-resistant MRSA. Nadifloxacin does not show cross-resistance with other new fluoroquinolones. === Mechanism of action === Nadifloxacin inhibits the enzyme DNA gyrase that is involved in bacterial DNA synthesis and replication, thus inhibiting the bacterial multiplication. Nadifloxacin in addition to determine a therapeutic antibacterial action, can have a sebostatic and anti-inflammatory action, thus contributing to the improvement of the clinical condition of the patient. === Pharmacokinetics === Following a single topical application of 10 g nadifloxacin 1% cream to normal human back skin, the highest plasma concentration was determined to be 107 ng/mL with an elimination half-life of 19.4 hours. Approximately 0.09% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine over 48 hours post- dosing. The plasma concentration reached a steady state on Day 5 of repeated administration study when nadifloxacin 1% cream was applied at 5 g twice daily to normal healthy individuals for a period of 7 days. The plasma concentration reached a peak of 4.1 ng/ml at 8 hours post-final dosing with an elimination half-life of 23.2 hours. The urinary excretion rate reached 0.16% on Day 7. == Clinical use == In some European countries, the drug has been approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris. In a 2013 multicenter, randomized clinical study with a total of 184 Japanese patients with moderate to severe acne, adapalene 0.1% gel plus nadifloxacin 1% cream (combination therapy) showed a significant efficacy in decrement of inflammatory papulopustular lesions. In patients with skin lesions, topical application of nadifloxacin can result in plasma concentrations of 1 to 3 ng/ml. Consequently, some authors argued that it should not be used to treat relatively harmless diseases like acne vulgaris, risking the development of quinolone resistances. == Adverse effects == During the treatment some patients may develop some adverse effects predominantly of the skin and subcutaneous tissue: burning and itching (in absolute the most common side effect), contact dermatitis, dryness and skin irritation. == References ==",Nadixa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.47413310408592224), (' PERSONAL', -3.531315314830863e-06), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00023147765023168176), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062026772648096085)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Rimonabant is an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and was first-in-class for clinical development. == History == Rimonabant is a selective CB1 receptor blocker and was discovered and developed by Sanofi-Aventis. On 21 June 2006, the European Commission approved the sale of rimonabant in the then-25-member European Union as a prescription drug for use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2, or patients with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia. It was first in its class to be approved anywhere in the world. Rimonabant was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval in the United States in 2005; in 2007, the FDA's Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) concluded that Sanofi-Aventis failed to demonstrate the safety of rimonabant and voted against recommending the anti-obesity treatment for approval. The application was deemed not-approvable by FDA, and the company cancelled plans for a re-submission. The drug was approved in Brazil in April 2007. In October 2008, the European Medicines Agency recommended the suspension of Acomplia after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had determined that the risks of Acomplia outweighed its benefits due to the risk of serious psychiatric problems, including suicide. In November 2008 an advisory committee in Brazil recommended suspension as well, and that month Sanofi-Aventis suspended sale of the drug worldwide. The EMA approval was withdrawn in January 2009. In 2009 India prohibited the manufacture and sale of the drug. == Adverse effects == Data from clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed that rimonabant caused depressive disorders or mood alterations in up to 10% of subjects and suicidal ideation in around 1%, and in Europe it was contraindicated for people with any psychiatric disorder, including depressed or suicidal individuals. Data from a large, randomized, clinical trial (CRESCENDO) with > 9,000 patients receiving rimonabant treatment demonstrated a rate of psychiatric adverse events (anxiety, depression, depressed mood, or insomnia) of greater than 30%. Additionally, nausea and upper respiratory tract infections were very common adverse effects (occurring in more than 10% of people); common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) included gastroenteritis, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and other sleep disorders, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, tendonitis, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and increased risk of falling. The FDA's advisory committee concurred with concerns raised by the review divisions. Based on human and on animal data, it appeared that the therapeutic window with regard to CNS toxicity, and specifically seizures was narrow. EMA postmarketing surveillance data suggested that the risk of psychiatric disorders in people taking rimonabant was doubled. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Rimonabant is an inverse agonist of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Originally thought to be selective for the CB1 receptor, rimonabant was subsequently also found to act as an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor. == Chemistry == The chemical synthesis of rimonabant is described as follows: == Research == Along with the clinical trials in obesity that generated the data submitted to regulatory authorities, rimonabant was also studied in clinical trials for diabetes, atherosclerosis, and smoking cessation. == See also == Drinabant – a cannabinoid receptor antagonist developed for prescription drug use that triggered severe psychiatric side effects. == References ==",Zimulti,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.023263998329639435), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.660974445869215e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008630122058093548)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/history/zimulti.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=6, title='Zimulti (rimonabant): What is it and is it FDA approved? - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/history/zimulti.html?utm_source=openai')])"

This study aimed to characterize the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics of supinoxin and attempt physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in rats. Supinoxin has good permeability, comparable to that of metoprolol (high permeability compound) in Caco-2 cells, with negligible net absorptive or secretory transport observed. After an intravenous injection at a dose range of 0.5-5 mg/kg, the terminal half-life (i.e., 2.54-2.80 h), systemic clearance (i.e., 691-865 mL/h/kg), and steady state volume of distribution (i.e., 2040-3500 mL/kg) of supinoxin remained unchanged, suggesting dose-independent (i.e., dose-proportional) pharmacokinetics for the dose ranges studied. After oral administration, supinoxin showed modest absorption with an absolute oral bioavailability of 56.9-57.4%.

426,"('Pimecrolimus', 'Elidel', 'Elidel (tn)', 'Pimecrolimus [usan:inn:ban]', 'Pimecrolimus (jan/usan/inn)')",Medical,"Pimecrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug of the calcineurin inhibitor class used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema). It is available as a topical cream. It was developed and formerly marketed by Novartis under the trade name Elidel. == Medical uses == It has been proven to be effective in various inflammatory skin diseases, e.g., seborrheic dermatitis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, oral lichen planus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are both calcineurin inhibitors and function as immunosuppressants. === Atopic dermatitis === If topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, short-term treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be tried. Both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are effective and safe to use in AD. == Side effects == In January 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Elidel packaging would be required to carry a black box warning regarding the potential increased risk of lymph node or skin cancer, as for the similar drug tacrolimus, whereas current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of such new drugs. Importantly, although the FDA has approved updated black-box warning for tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, the recent report of the American Academy of Dermatology Association Task Force finds that there is no causal proof that topical immunomodulators cause lymphoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer, and systemic immunosuppression after short-term or intermittent long-term topical application seems an unlikely mechanism. Another recent review of evidence concluded that postmarketing surveillance shows no evidence for this systemic immunosuppression or increased risk for any malignancy. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health further concluded with moderate-certainty evidence that the two drugs were not associated with any increased risk of cancer. However, strong debates and controversies continue regarding the exact indications of immunomodulators and their duration of use in the absence of active controlled trials. Dermatologists' and allergists' professional societies, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, have protested the inclusion of the black box warning. The AAAAI states ""None of the information provided for the cases of lymphoma associated with the use of topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus in AD indicate or suggest a causal relationship."" == Pharmacology == Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam derivative. It has been shown in vitro that pimecrolimus binds to FKBP1A and also inhibits calcineurin. Thus pimecrolimus inhibits T-cell activation by inhibiting the synthesis and release of cytokines from T-cells. Pimecrolimus also prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells. Pimecrolimus, like tacrolimus, belongs to the ascomycin class of macrolactam immunosuppressives, acting by the inhibition of T-cell activation by the calcineurin pathway and inhibition of the release of numerous inflammatory cytokines, thereby preventing the cascade of immune and inflammatory signals. Pimecrolimus has a similar mode of action to that of tacrolimus but is more selective, with no effect on dendritic (Langerhans) cells. It has lower permeation through the skin than topical steroids or topical tacrolimus although they have not been compared with each other for their permeation ability through mucosa. In addition, in contrast with topical steroids, pimecrolimus does not produce skin atrophy. == Development and production == Pimecrolimus was developed by Novartis. Its development number was ascomycin derivative ASM 981. The New Drug Application (NDA) was filed December 15, 2000. It received US FDA approval on December 13, 2001. At its US approval, it was one of the first new eczema treatments introduced since the topical corticosteroids of the 1950s. It is available as a topical cream, once marketed by Novartis. Since early 2007, Galderma has been promoting the compound in Canada.

It is being studied as a radiation protection agent. Chemically, it is the sodium salt of 4-carboxystyryl-4-chlorobenzylsulfone. == Clinical trials == The results of two Phase I clinical studies in healthy human volunteers indicate that subcutaneously injected Ex-Rad is safe and well tolerated, with ""no evidence of systemic side effects"". A study in mice demonstrated the efficacy of Ex-Rad by increasing the survival rate of mice exposed to typically lethal whole-body irradiation. The study tested oral and parenteral administration of Ex-Rad for both pre- and post-exposure radiomitigation. Research on Ex-Rad has involved collaboration with the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cellular Biology at Georgetown University, Long Island University's Arnold & Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, and the Department of Oncological Sciences at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. == Mechanism of action == Onconova reports that Ex-Rad protects cells exposed to radiation against DNA damage, and that the drug's mechanism of action does not involve scavenging free radicals or arresting the cell cycle. Instead, they claim it employs a ""novel mechanism"" involving ""intracellular signaling, damage sensing, and DNA repair pathways"". Ex-RAD is a chlorobenzylsulfone derivative that works after free radicals have damaged DNA. Onconova CEO Ramesh Kumar believes this is a better approach than trying to scavenge free radicals. “Free radicals are very short-lived, and so the window of opportunity to give a drug is very narrow,” he says.

On the basis of structural comparison with a different biaryl pyrazole template and supported by dozens of high-resolution crystal structures of p38alpha inhibitor complexes, PH-797804 is predicted to possess a high level of specificity across the broad human kinase genome. We used a structural bioinformatics approach to identify two selectivity elements encoded by the TXXXG sequence motif on the p38alpha kinase hinge: (i) Thr106 that serves as the gatekeeper to the buried hydrophobic pocket occupied by 2,4-difluorophenyl of PH-797804 and (ii) the bidentate hydrogen bonds formed by the pyridinone moiety with the kinase hinge requiring an induced 180 degrees rotation of the Met109-Gly110 peptide bond. The peptide flip occurs in p38alpha kinase due to the critical glycine residue marked by its conformational flexibility. Kinome-wide sequence mining revealed rare presentation of the selectivity motif. Corroboratively, PH-797804 exhibited exceptionally high specificity against MAP kinases and the related kinases.

429,"('Clindamycin (hydrochloride)', 'Clindamycin', 'Chlolincocin', 'Clinimycin', 'Dalacine')",Medical,"Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic medication used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including osteomyelitis (bone) or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, acute otitis media (middle ear infections), and endocarditis. It can also be used to treat acne, and some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In combination with quinine, it can be used to treat malaria. It is available by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as a cream or a gel to be applied to the skin or in the vagina. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and pain at the site of injection. It increases the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile colitis about fourfold and thus is only recommended for use when other antibiotics are not appropriate. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein. Clindamycin was first made in 1966 from lincomycin. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 147th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clindamycin is used primarily to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. In people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. It is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne. === Acne === For the treatment of acne, in the long term, the combined use of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide was similar to salicylic acid plus benzoyl peroxide. Topical clindamycin plus topical benzoyl peroxide is more effective than topical clindamycin alone. === Susceptible bacteria === It is most effective against infections involving the following types of organisms: Aerobic Gram-positive cocci, including some members of the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (e.g. pneumococcus) genera, but not enterococci. Anaerobic, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including some Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, although resistance is increasing in Bacteroides fragilis. Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (such as Pseudomonas, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella) are resistant to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae. A notable exception is Capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus: 0.016 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.002 μg/mL – >256 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes: <0.015 μg/mL – >64 μg/mL === D-test === When testing a gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a ""D-test"" to determine if there is a sub-population of bacteria present with the phenotype known as iMLSB. This phenotype of bacteria are resistant to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B group of antibiotics, however, the resistance mechanism is only induced by the presence of 14-membered ring macrolides, such as erythromycin. During a D-test, bacteria of the iMLSB phenotype demonstrate in vitro erythromycin-induced in vitro resistance to clindamycin. This is because of the activity of the macrolide-inducible plasmid-encoded erm gene. To perform a D-test, an agar plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with erythromycin, one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20 mm apart on the plate. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is D-shaped, the test result is positive. Despite the apparent susceptibility to clindamycin in the absence of erythromycin, a positive D-test precludes therapeutic use of clindamycin. This is because the erythromycin-inducible erm gene is prone to mutations causing the inducible activity to switch to constitutive (permanently switched on). This in turn, may lead to the therapeutic failure of clindamycin. If the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used. === Malaria === Given with chloroquine or quinine, clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing. === Other === Clindamycin may be useful in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Many strains of MRSA are still susceptible to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA is becoming increasingly resistant. While it has been used in intraabdominal infections, such use is generally not recommended due to resistance. Clindamycin is used in cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes the death of the bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis). Clindamycin has been proven to decrease the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to about a third of the risk of untreated women. The combination of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment for severe babesiosis. Clindamycin may also be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in combination with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Clindamycin, either applied to skin or taken by mouth, may also be used in hidradenitis suppurativa. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions associated with systemic clindamycin therapy – found in over 1% of people – include: diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps and/or rash. High doses (both intravenous and oral) may cause a metallic taste. Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulations – found in over 10% of people – include: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or peeling of skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion). Additional side effects include contact dermatitis. Common side effects – found in over 10% of people – in vaginal applications include fungal infection. Rarely – in less than 0.1% of people – clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasias, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzyme levels, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and/or hepatotoxicity. === Clostridioides difficile === Pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially lethal condition commonly associated with clindamycin, but which also occurs with other antibiotics. Overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results in the production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use of clindamycin during pregnancy is generally considered safe. Clindamycin is classified as compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, the WHO categorizes it as ""avoid if possible"". It is classified as L2 probably compatible with breastfeeding according to Medications and Mothers' Milk. A 2009 review found it was likely safe in breastfeeding mothers, but did find one complication (hematochezia) in a breastfed infant which might be attributable to clindamycin. LactMed lists potentially negative gastrointestinal effects in babies whose mothers take it while breastfeeding but did not see that as justification to stop breastfeeding. == Interactions == Clindamycin may prolong the effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its similarity to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means they should not be given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance. == Chemistry == Clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic produced by the actinobacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis. It is obtained by 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. The synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by BJ Magerlein, RD Birkenmeyer, and F Kagan on the fifth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in 1966. It has been on the market since 1968. Clindamycin is white or yellow powder that is very soluble in water. The topically used clindamycin phosphate is a phosphate-ester prodrug of clindamycin. == Mechanism of action == Clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. At higher concentrations, it may be bactericidal. It is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. The binding is reversible. Clindamycin is more effective than lincomycin. The X-ray crystal structures of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Haloarcula marismortui have been determined; the structure of the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus has also been reported. == Society and culture == === Economics === Clindamycin is available as a generic medication and is relatively inexpensive. === Available forms === Clindamycin preparations that are taken by mouth include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). Oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, due to its extremely foul taste and odor. Clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. It is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment. Several combination acne treatments containing clindamycin are also marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as BenzaClin (Sanofi-Aventis), Duac (a gel form made by Stiefel), and Acanya, among other trade names—and, in the United States, a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as Ziana. In India, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by Olive Health Care and sold as Clinsup-V. In Egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by Biopharmgroup sold as Vagiclind indicated for vaginosis. Clindamycin is available as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use. (The exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not available as a generic in the US). == Veterinary use == The veterinary uses of clindamycin are quite similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, for which it is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. They can be used both by mouth and topically. A disadvantage is that bacterial resistance can develop fairly quickly. Gastrointestinal upset may also occur. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT04370548 for ""DARE-BV1 in the Treatment of Bacterial Vaginosis (DARE-BVFREE)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Clinimycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5760051012039185), (' PERSONAL', -3.03521392197581e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008479424752295017), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0235219094902277)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20141343772411346)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 27,395 participants with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease to receive rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily), or aspirin (100 mg once daily). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction. The study was stopped for superiority of the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group after a mean follow-up of 23 months. The primary outcome occurred in fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group than in the aspirin-alone group (379 patients [4.1%] vs. 496 patients [5.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.86; P<0.001; z=-4.126), but major bleeding events occurred in more patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group (288 patients [3.1%] vs. 170 patients [1.9%]; hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.05; P<0.001). There was no significant difference in intracranial or fatal bleeding between these two groups. There were 313 deaths (3.4%) in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group as compared with 378 (4.1%) in the aspirin-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.96; P=0.01; threshold P value for significance, 0.0025). The primary outcome did not occur in significantly fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-alone group than in the aspirin-alone group, but major bleeding events occurred in more patients in the rivaroxaban-alone group. Among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, those assigned to rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin had better cardiovascular outcomes and more major bleeding events than those assigned to aspirin alone. Rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily) alone did not result in better cardiovascular outcomes than aspirin alone and resulted in more major bleeding events. (Funded by Bayer; COMPASS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01776424 .). Patients with peripheral artery disease who have undergone lower-extremity revascularization are at high risk for major adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in this context are uncertain. In a double-blind trial, patients with peripheral artery disease who had undergone revascularization were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin or placebo plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation for vascular causes, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding, defined according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) classification; major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) was a secondary safety outcome. A total of 6564 patients underwent randomization; 3286 were assigned to the rivaroxaban group, and 3278 were assigned to the placebo group. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 508 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 584 in the placebo group; the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence at 3 years were 17.3% and 19.9%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.96; P = 0.009). TIMI major bleeding occurred in 62 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 44 patients in the placebo group (2.65% and 1.87%; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97 to 2.10; P = 0.07). ISTH major bleeding occurred in 140 patients in the rivaroxaban group, as compared with 100 patients in the placebo group (5.94% and 4.06%; hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.84; P = 0.007). In patients with peripheral artery disease who had undergone lower-extremity revascularization, rivaroxaban at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin was associated with a significantly lower incidence of the composite outcome of acute limb ischemia, major amputation for vascular causes, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes than aspirin alone. The incidence of TIMI major bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of ISTH major bleeding was significantly higher with rivaroxaban and aspirin than with aspirin alone. (Funded by Bayer and Janssen Pharmaceuticals; VOYAGER PAD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02504216.). Current guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but head-to-head trial data do not exist to guide the choice of DOAC. To do a large-scale comparison between all DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) in routine clinical practice. Multinational population-based cohort study. Five standardized electronic health care databases, which covered 221 million people in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Patients who were newly diagnosed with AF from 2010 through 2019 and received a new DOAC prescription. Database-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and all-cause mortality between DOACs were estimated using a Cox regression model stratified by propensity score and pooled using a random-effects model. A total of 527 226 new DOAC users met the inclusion criteria (apixaban,  Residual confounding is possible. Among patients with AF, apixaban use was associated with lower risk for GIB and similar rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, ICH, and all-cause mortality compared with dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. This finding was consistent for patients aged 80 years or older and those with chronic kidney disease, who are often underrepresented in clinical trials.

431,"('Rivaroxaban', 'Xarelto', '(s)-5-chloro-n-((2-oxo-3-(4-(3-oxomorpholino)phenyl)oxazolidin-5-yl)methyl)thiophene-2-carboxamide', 'Rivaroxaban (xarelto)', 'Xarelto (tn)')",Medical,"Rivaroxaban, sold under the brand name Xarelto among others, is an anticoagulant medication (blood thinner) used to treat and prevent blood clots. Specifically it is used to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli and prevent blood clots in atrial fibrillation and following hip or knee surgery. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include bleeding. Other serious side effects may include spinal hematoma and anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. Compared to warfarin it has fewer interactions with other medications. It works by blocking the activity of the clotting protein factor Xa. Rivaroxaban was patented in 2007 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2011. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 90th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Rivaroxaban is indicated to reduce risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation; for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis; for the treatment of pulmonary embolism; for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism in people undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery; for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients; to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in people with coronary artery disease; to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in people with peripheral artery disease, including people after recent lower extremity revascularization due to symptomatic peripheral artery disease; for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism in children from birth to less than 18 years of age; for thromboprophylaxis in children aged two years of age and older with congenital heart disease after the Fontan procedure. In those with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban appears to be as effective as warfarin in preventing strokes and embolic events in patients who are classified as moderate-to-high risk, as defined by a score of a number of specific medical conditions. In July 2012, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended rivaroxaban to prevent and treat venous thromboembolism. == Contraindications == When undergoing surgeries, due to the concern over managing bleeding, rivaroxaban can be discontinued 24 hours prior to low-bleeding risk surgery and 48-72 hours prior to high-bleeding risk surgeries. Once the surgery is over, it can be recommenced after 1 to 3 days with doctor consultation. Dosing recommendations do not recommend administering rivaroxaban with drugs known to be strong combined CYP3A4/P-glycoprotein inhibitors because this results in significantly higher plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban. A small retrospective cohort study reported that the use of moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as amiodarone or verapamil, increased the risk of bleeding when administered with rivaroxaban. Although this increase was not statistically significant, there was a trend showing increased bleeding in the rivaroxaban with moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors group. Therefore, it is important to monitor for bleeding when concurrently on rivaroxaban and moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors. == Adverse effects == The most serious adverse effect is bleeding, including severe internal bleeding. As of 2015, post-marketing assessments showed liver toxicity, and further studies are needed to quantify this risk. In 2015, rivaroxaban accounted for the highest number of reported cases of serious injury among regularly monitored medications to the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS). === Reversal agent === In October 2014, Portola Pharmaceuticals completed Phase I and II clinical trials for andexanet alfa as an antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors with few adverse effects, and started Phase III trials. Andexanet alfa was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2018, under the trade name AndexXa. == Mechanism of action == Rivaroxaban inhibits both free and bound Factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. It is a selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with an onset of action of 2.5 to 4 hours. Inhibition of Factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting both thrombin formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin (activated Factor II), and no effects on platelets have been demonstrated. It allows predictable anticoagulation and dose adjustments and routine coagulation monitoring; dietary restrictions are not needed. Unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux also inhibit the activity of factor Xa, indirectly, by binding to circulating antithrombin (AT III) and must be injected, whereas the orally active warfarin, phenprocoumon, and acenocoumarol are vitamin K antagonists, decreasing a number of coagulation factors, including factor X. Rivaroxaban has predictable pharmacokinetics across a wide spectrum of people (age, gender, weight, race) and has a flat dose response across an eightfold dose range (5–40 mg). The oral bioavailability is dose-dependent. Doses of rivaroxaban under 10 mg can be taken with or without food, as it displayed high bioavailability independent of whether food was consumed or not. If rivaroxaban is given at oral doses of 15 mg or 20 mg, it needs to be taken with food to aid in drug absorption and achieve appropriate bioavailability (≥ 80%). == Chemistry == Rivaroxaban bears a striking structural similarity to the antibiotic linezolid: both drugs share the same oxazolidinone-derived core structure. Accordingly, rivaroxaban was studied for any possible antimicrobial effects and for the possibility of mitochondrial toxicity, which is a known complication of long-term linezolid use. Studies found that neither rivaroxaban nor its metabolites have any antibiotic effect against Gram-positive bacteria. As for mitochondrial toxicity, in vitro studies published before 2008 found the risk to be low. == History == Rivaroxaban was initially developed by Bayer. In the United States, it is marketed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a part of Johnson & Johnson). It was the first available direct factor Xa inhibitor which is taken by mouth. == Society and culture == === Economics === Using rivaroxaban rather than warfarin costs 70 times more, according to Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager. As of 2016, Bayer claimed that the drug was licensed in 130 countries and that more than 23 million patients had been treated. === Legal status === In September 2008, Health Canada granted marketing authorization for rivaroxaban to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in people who have undergone elective total hip replacement or total knee replacement surgery. In the same month, the European Commission also granted marketing authorization of rivaroxaban to prevent venous thromboembolism in adults undergoing elective hip and knee replacement. In July 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rivaroxaban for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in adults undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery. In November 2011, the US FDA approved rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. === Legal action === In March 2019, over 25,000 lawsuits in the US about rivaroxaban were settled for $775 million. Plaintiffs accused the drugmakers of not warning about the bleeding risks, claiming their injuries could have been prevented had doctors and patients been provided adequate information. == Research == Researchers at the Duke Clinical Research Institute have been accused of withholding clinical data used to evaluate rivaroxaban. Duke tested rivaroxaban in a clinical trial known as the ROCKET AF trial. The clinical trial, published 2011, found rivaroxaban to be more effective than warfarin in reducing the likelihood of ischemic strokes in participants with atrial fibrillation. The validity of the study was called into question in 2014, when pharmaceutical sponsors Bayer and Johnson & Johnson revealed that the INRatio blood monitoring devices used were not functioning properly, A subsequent analysis by the Duke team published in February 2016, found that this had no significant effect on efficacy and safety in the trial. == References ==",Xarelto,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3232143828645349e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021824838768225163)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/xarelto.html ', [])"
432,"('Dalbavancin (hydrochloride)', 'Dalbavancin', 'Dalbavancin b0', 'A-a-1', 'Bi 397')",Medical,"Dalbavancin, sold under the brand names Dalvance in the US and Xydalba in the EU (both by AbbVie) among others, is a second-generation lipoglycopeptide antibiotic medication. It belongs to the same class as vancomycin, the most widely used and one of the treatments available to people infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Dalbavancin is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide that was designed to improve upon the natural glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin. It is derived from a complex of glycopeptide antibiotics, referred to as A-40926, that is produced by a new strain of Actinomadura. Dalbavancin has been referred to in the scientific literature by a series of names: MDL-63397, A-!-1, BI-397, VER-001. These different labels reflected where the research had been carried out: MDL representing Merrell-Dow-Lepetit, where the initial complex was discovered; BI referring to BioSearch Italia where Dalbavancin itself was first synthesized; VER referring to Versicor (which Biosearch Italia merged with to create Vicuron Pharmaceuticals). The phase I, II and III clinical trials were carried out of by Vicuron and the initial NDA filed. Vicuron was acquired by Pfizer in 2005, which decided to not further develop Dalbavancin at that time, subsequently selling the rights to Durata Therapeutics in 2009. It possesses in vitro activity against a variety of Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). It is a once-weekly, two-dose antibiotic, the rights to which Actavis acquired when it bought Durata Therapeutics in 2014. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved dalbavancin in May 2014, for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by certain susceptible bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, in intravenous dosage form. == Medical uses == Dalbavancin is considered a long-lasting antibiotic due to its prolonged half-life (14.4 d), high protein binding capacity, and intense tissue penetration. It binds reversibly to plasma proteins at approximately 93%, allowing for sustained drug concentrations over time. Dalbavancin demonstrates good tissue distribution, reaching therapeutic levels in skin structures, synovial fluid (found in joints), and bone tissue within 24 hours after administration. The benefits of this long-lasting nature are less frequent dosing requirements while maintaining efficacy. Dalbavancin is an antibiotic used to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA infections have become problematic in the community and in healthcare settings due to resistance to many available antibiotics. Because dalbavancin has demonstrated efficacy against MRSA and other microorganisms to treat serious or life-threatening infections, it was the first drug approved as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) act, which is part of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act. It has strong activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus. Based on MIC data and other studies, dalbavancin is more potent and bactericidal and therefore requires lower concentrations than vancomycin against these organisms. Dalbavancin also shows in vitro activity against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Other Gram-positive organisms belonging to the Bacillus spp., Listeria spp., and Corynebacterium spp. may show in vitro susceptibility, and dalbavancin may exhibit activity against enterococci expressing the VanB or VanC phenotype of acquired resistance against vancomycin. There is no clinically significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity to dalbavancin can occur, causing issues such as skin reactions or anaphylaxis. Caution is advised for patients with known hypersensitivity to other glycopeptides. There is currently no data on cross-reactivity between dalbavancin and vancomycin. == Side effects == The most common adverse reactions encountered in Phase II and Phase III trials were nausea (5.5%), headache (4.7%), and diarrhea (4.4%), as well as rash (2.7%) and itchiness (2.1%). Other less frequent but serious adverse reactions included hematologic disorders, hepatotoxicity, Clostridioides difficile colitis, bronchospasm, infusion-related reactions including Red Man Syndrome, and anaphylactic shock. In trials, dalbavancin was associated with higher rates of hemorrhagic events compared to comparator groups and should be a precaution in patients undergoing surgery or taking anticoagulants. Patients on dalbavancin also had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels that were 3 times the upper normal limit, some even having elevations 10 times the upper normal limit; however, eight of the twelve dalbavancin-treated patients had comorbid conditions that could affect their ALT, compared to only one patient in the comparator group. There is no evidence of ototoxicity associated with dalbavancin. === Drug interactions === Clinical drug-drug interactions with dalbavancin have not been studied, and dalbavancin does not appear to interact with cytochrome P450 substrates, inhibitors, or inducers. It was found to have an in vitro synergistic interaction with the antimicrobial oxacillin, but the clinical significance of this interaction has yet to be established. === Pregnancy and lactation === The use of dalbavancin in pregnant women has not been studied sufficiently and should only occur when the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Animal studies did not show embryo or fetal toxicity at doses that were 1.2 and 0.7 times the human dose. However, delayed fetal maturation was observed at a dose that was 3.5 times the human dose. While dalbavancin is excreted in rat milk, it is unknown if it is excreted in human milk. It should be used in nursing mothers only when the potential benefit exceeds the potential risk. There is no evidence in animals of teratogenicity. == Production and composition == Dalbavancin is manufactured by fermentation of a selected Nonomuraea strain to generate the natural glycopeptide complex A-40926. This precursor is then selectively esterified at the carboxyl group of its sugar moiety, its peptidyl carboxyl group is amidated and the ester of the N-acylaminoglucuronic acid carboxyl group is saponified. The outcome is a compound mixture of two closely related structural families — A and B — that can be further subdivided into a total of five subtypes (see table below). At least ten different dalbavancin components have been described, of which the B0 component makes up around 80–98 wt%. == Mechanism of action == Dalbavancin is a lipoglycopeptide belonging in the same glycopeptide class as vancomycin. Similar to other glycopeptides, dalbavancin exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting cell wall biosynthesis. It binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanyl residue on growing peptidoglycan chains and prevents transpeptidation from occurring, preventing peptidoglycan elongation and cell wall formation. Dalbavancin also dimerizes and anchors itself in the lipophilic bacterial membrane, thereby increasing its stability in the target environment and its affinity for peptidoglycan. Antimicrobial activity correlates with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration for Staphylococcus aureus. == Metabolism == When evaluated by in vitro studies, the metabolism of dalbavancin was minimally impacted by the human hepatic CYP450 system. Further investigations with either inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme system demonstrated no changes in the elimination or clearance of dalbavancin, and the metabolism of model compounds of these CYP systems was not altered by the dalbavancin. Hydroxy-dalbavancin, a minor metabolite that has only been identified in urine, was also not changed in its formation or elimination with these enzyme models. == History == Dalbavancin has undergone a phase-III clinical trial for adults with complicated skin infections, but in December 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said more data were needed before approval. Pfizer withdrew its marketing applications to conduct another phase-III clinical trial in September 2008. Durata Therapeutics acquired the rights to dalbavancin in December 2009, and has initiated two new phase-III clinical trials for treatment of ABSSSIs. Preliminary results in 2012 were promising. About 1,289 adults with ABSSSI were given dalbavancin or vancomycin randomly, and dalbavancin was found to exhibit efficacy comparable to vancomycin. In May 2014, dalbavancin was approved for medical use in the United States for ABSSSIs, including MRSA and Streptococcus pyogenes infections. == References ==",Dalbavancin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.960446742392378e-06), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013195598148740828)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbavancin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Dalbavancin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbavancin?utm_source=openai')])"

In active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, siponimod decreases the risk of disability and multiple sclerosis relapses. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials of siponimod, the most common adverse effects were headache, high blood pressure, and liver function test abnormalities. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Siponimod binds selectively to some of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor forms—including sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1—found on lymphocytes and other cell types. Siponimod may be very similar to fingolimod but preventing lymphopenia, one of its main side effects, by preventing egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes. Siponimod may be more selective in the particular sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (five in number) that it modulates. It is selective for the -1 and -5 SIP receptors. == History == In March 2019, siponimod was approved in the United States to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. The efficacy of siponimod was shown in a clinical trial of 1,651 patients that compared siponimod to placebo in people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis who had evidence of disability progression in the prior two years and no relapses in the three months prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to three-month confirmed progression in disability. The trial was conducted at 294 centers in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, South America, and the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval of Mayzent to Novartis. Siponimod was approved for medical use in Australia in October 2019. In January 2020, siponimod was approved in the European Union for the treatment of adults with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease evidenced by relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity. == References ==",Siponimod,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010346830822527409), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001311216183239594)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siponimod?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Siponimod', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siponimod?utm_source=openai')])"

Unexpectedly, the endogenous low expression of ABCG2 is sufficient to confer cancer cells resistance to MLN7243. The ABCG2 ATPase assay and HPLC assay suggested that MLN7243 can significantly stimulate ABCG2 ATPase activity and be pumped out from ABCG2-overexpressing cells by ABCG2. The docking analysis also implied that MLN7243 binds to ABCG2 drug-binding pocket with optimal binding affinity.

Maribavir is a cytomegalovirus pUL97 kinase inhibitor that works by preventing the activity of human cytomegalovirus enzyme pUL97, thus blocking virus replication. The most common side effects include taste disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and fatigue. Maribavir was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2021, and in the European Union in November 2022. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == In the United States, maribavir is indicated to treat people twelve years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 lb) with post-transplant cytomegalovirus infection/disease that does not respond (with or without genetic mutations that cause resistance) to available antiviral treatment for cytomegalovirus. In the European Union, maribavir is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease that are refractory (with or without resistance) to one or more prior therapies, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet in adults who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). == Adverse effects == Adverse effects of maribavir include taste disturbances, nausea, and vomiting. == Contraindications == The cytomegalovirus pUL97 kinase activates ganciclovir and valganciclovir, so coadministration with these medications is not recommended because maribavir may reduce their antiviral activity. == History == Maribavir is licensed by ViroPharma from GlaxoSmithKline in 2003, for the prevention and treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) disease in hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplant patients. The mechanism by which maribavir inhibits HCMV replication is by inhibition of an HCMV encoded protein kinase enzyme called UL97 or pUL97. Maribavir showed promise in phase II clinical trials and was granted fast track status, but failed to meet study goals in a phase III trial. However, the dosage used in the phase III trial may have been too low to be efficacious. A phase II study with maribavir demonstrated that prophylaxis with maribavir displayed strong antiviral activity, as measured by statistically significant reduction in the rate of reactivation of CMV in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplants. In an intent-to-treat analysis of the first 100 days after the transplant, the number of subjects who required pre-emptive anti-CMV therapy was statistically significantly reduced with maribavir compared to placebo. ViroPharma conducted a phase III clinical study to evaluate the prophylactic use for the prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. In February 2009, ViroPharma announced that the phase III study failed to achieve its goal, showing no significant difference between maribavir and a placebo at reducing the rate at which CMV DNA levels were detected in patients. The safety and efficacy of maribavir were evaluated in a phase III, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial that compared maribavir with a treatment assigned by a researcher running the study, which could include one or two of the following antivirals used to treat cytomegalovirus: ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. In the study, 352 transplant recipients with cytomegalovirus infections who did not respond (with or without resistance) to treatment randomly received maribavir or treatment assigned by a researcher for up to eight weeks. The study compared the two groups' plasma cytomegalovirus DNA concentration levels at the end of the study's eighth week, with efficacy defined as having a level below what is measurable. Of the 235 participants who received maribavir, 56% had levels of cytomegalovirus DNA below what was measurable versus 24% of the 117 participants who received an investigator-assigned treatment. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for maribavir orphan drug, breakthrough therapy and priority review designations. The FDA granted the approval of Livtencity to Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 15 September 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Livtencity, intended for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and/or disease that is refractory to one or more prior therapies.

443,"('Nebivolol (hydrochloride)', 'R 065824 hydrochloride', 'Levonebivolol', 'Nebivolol', 'Sssr-nebivolol')",Medical,"Nebivolol is a beta blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. As with other β-blockers, it is generally a less preferred treatment for high blood pressure. It may be used by itself or with other blood pressure medication. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, nausea, and headaches. Serious side effects may include heart failure and bronchospasm. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and dilating blood vessels. Nebivolol was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1997. It is available as a generic medication in the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was the 173rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == It is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Nebivolol is used in the treatment of angina, to decrease the heart rate and contractile force. This is relevant in patients who need to decrease the oxygen demand of the heart so that the blood supplied from stenosed or constricted arteries is adequate. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium-channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics are generally preferred over beta blockers for the treatment of primary hypertension in the absence of co-morbidities. == Pharmacology and biochemistry == === β1-selectivity === Beta blockers help patients with cardiovascular disease by blocking β1 receptors, while many of the side-effects of these medications are caused by their blockade of β2 receptors. For this reason, beta blockers that selectively block β1 adrenergic receptors (termed cardioselective or β1-selective beta blockers) produce fewer adverse effects (for instance, bronchoconstriction) than those drugs that non-selectively block both β1 and β2 receptors. In a laboratory experiment conducted on biopsied heart tissue, nebivolol proved to be the most β1-selective of the β-blockers tested, being approximately 3.5 times more β1-selective than bisoprolol. However, the drug's receptor selectivity in humans is more complex and depends on the drug dose and the genetic profile of the patient taking the medication. The drug is highly cardioselective at 5 mg. In addition, at doses above 10 mg, nebivolol loses its cardioselectivity and blocks both β1 and β2 receptors, while the recommended starting dose of nebivolol is 5 mg, sufficient control of blood pressure may require doses up to 40 mg. Furthermore, nebivolol is also not cardioselective when taken by patients with a genetic makeup that makes them ""poor metabolizers"" of nebivolol (and other drugs) or with CYP2D6 inhibitors. As many as 1 in 10 Caucasian people and even more black people are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and therefore might benefit less from nebivolol's cardioselectivity although currently there are no directly comparable studies. Nebivolol while selectively blocking beta(1) receptor acts as a beta(3)-agonist. β3 receptors are found in the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and in brown adipose tissue. Their role in gallbladder physiology is unknown, but they are thought to play a role in lipolysis and thermogenesis in brown fat. In the urinary bladder it is thought to cause relaxation of the bladder and prevention of urination. Due to enzymatic inhibition, fluvoxamine increases the exposure to nebivolol and its active hydroxylated metabolite (4-OH-nebivolol) in healthy volunteers. === Vasodilator action === Nebivolol is unique as a beta-blocker. Unlike carvedilol, it has a nitric oxide (NO)-potentiating, vasodilatory effect via stimulation of β3 receptors. Nebivolol induces vasodilation by stimulating the production of nitric oxide, a natural blood vessel relaxant. This effect is achieved by activating the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) in the cells lining the blood vessels. Unlike traditional β-blockers, nebivolol's unique mechanism of action improves arterial flexibility and reduces peripheral resistance, making it beneficial for hypertensive patients with endothelial dysfunction. The drug's ability to increase NO production persists even after metabolism, offering long-lasting benefits. Nebivolol's distinct approach to promoting NO release has shown promising results in improving endothelial function and managing hypertension in clinical trials. Along with labetalol, celiprolol and carvedilol, it is one of four beta blockers to cause dilation of blood vessels in addition to effects on the heart. === Antihypertensive effect === Nebivolol lowers blood pressure (BP) by reducing peripheral vascular resistance, and significantly increases stroke volume with preservation of cardiac output. The net hemodynamic effect of nebivolol is the result of a balance between the depressant effects of beta-blockade and an action that maintains cardiac output. Antihypertensive responses were significantly higher with nebivolol than with placebo in trials enrolling patient groups considered representative of the U.S. hypertensive population, in black people, and in those receiving concurrent treatment with other antihypertensive drugs. === Pharmacokinetics === Nebivolol plasma protein binding is approximately 98%, mostly to albumin and its half-life of low doses is 12 hours in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers and 19 hours in poor metabolizers. == Contraindications == Severe bradycardia Heart block greater than first degree Patients with cardiogenic shock Decompensated cardiac failure Sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place) Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) Patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. == Side effects == Side effects might include headache, tiredness, dizziness, lightheadedness, reduced blood flow to extremities, bradycardia. == Controversies == === Pharmacology of side-effects === Several studies have suggested that nebivolol has reduced typical beta-blocker-related side effects, such as fatigue, clinical depression, bradycardia, or impotence. However, according to the FDABystolic is associated with a number of serious risks. Bystolic is contraindicated in patients with severe bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, decompensated cardiac failure, sick sinus syndrome (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh > B) and in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of the product. Bystolic therapy is also associated with warnings regarding abrupt cessation of therapy, cardiac failure, angina and acute myocardial infarction, bronchospastic diseases, anesthesia and major surgery, diabetes and hypoglycemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral vascular disease, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers use, as well as precautions regarding use with CYP2D6 inhibitors, impaired renal and hepatic function, and anaphylactic reactions. Finally, Bystolic is associated with other risks as described in the Adverse Reactions section of its PI. For example, a number of treatment-emergent adverse events with an incidence greater than or equal to 1 percent in Bystolic-treated patients and at a higher frequency than placebo-treated patients were identified in clinical studies, including headache, fatigue, and dizziness. === FDA warning letter about advertising claims === In August 2008, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to Forest Laboratories citing exaggerated and misleading claims in their launch journal ad, in particular over claims of superiority and novelty of action. == History == Mylan Laboratories licensed the US and Canadian rights to nebivolol from Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. in 2001.

Clevidipine is used IV only and practitioners titrate this drug to lower blood pressure. It has a half-life of approximately one minute. It is rapidly inactivated by esterases. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on August 1, 2008. == Basic chemical and pharmacological properties == Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, highly selective for vascular, as opposed to myocardial, smooth muscle and, therefore, has little or no effect on myocardial contractility or cardiac conduction. It reduces mean arterial blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. Clevidipine does not reduce cardiac filling pressure (pre-load), confirming lack of effects on the venous capacitance vessels. No increase in myocardial lactate production in coronary sinus blood has been seen, confirming the absence of myocardial ischemia due to coronary steal. Clevidipine is rapidly metabolized by esterases in the blood and extravascular tissues. Therefore, its elimination is unlikely to be affected by hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) dysfunction. Clevidipine does not accumulate in the body, and its clearance is independent of body weight. The initial phase half-life is approximately 1 minute and the terminal half-life is approximately 15 minutes. Clevidipine will still be rapidly metabolized in pseudocholinesterase-deficient patients. Clevidipine is formulated as a lipid emulsion in 20% soybean oil (Intralipid) and contains approximately 0.2 g of fat per mL (2.0 kcal/ml). Clevidipine also contains glycerin (22.5 mg/mL), purified egg yolk phospholipids (12 mg/mL), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. Clevidipine has a pH of 6.0–8.0 In the perioperative patient population Clevidipine produces a 4–5% reduction in systolic blood pressure within 2–4 minutes after starting a 1–2 mg/hour IV infusion. In studies up to 72 hours of continuous infusion, there was no evidence of tolerance. In most patients, full recovery of blood pressure is achieved in 5–15 minutes after the infusion is stopped. === Stereochemistry === Clevidipine contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, ie a 1: 1 mixture of ( R ) – and the ( S ) - form: == Dosage and administration == Aseptic technique should be used when handling Cleviprex since it contains phospholipids and can support microbial growth. Cleviprex is administered intravenously and should be titrated to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored continually during infusion. Cleviprex is a single use product that should not be diluted and should not be administered in the same line as other medications. Once the stopper is punctured, Cleviprex should be used within 12 hours and any unused portion remaining in the vial should be discarded. Change IV lines in accordance with hospital protocol. An IV infusion at 1–2 mg/hour is recommended for initiation and should be titrated by doubling the dose every 90 seconds. As the blood pressure approaches goal, the infusion rate should be increased in smaller increments and titrated less frequently. The maximum infusion rate for Cleviprex is 32 mg/hour. Most patients in clinical trials were treated with doses of 16 mg/hour or less. Because of lipid load restrictions, no more than 1000 mL (or an average of 21 mg/hour) of Cleviprex infusion is recommended per 24 hours. In clinical studies, no significant changes occurred in serum triglyceride levels in the Cleviprex treated patients. There is little experience with infusion durations beyond 72 hours at any dose. The infusion can be reduced or discontinued to achieve desired blood pressure while appropriate oral therapy is established. == Safety information == Cleviprex is intended for intravenous use. Titrate drug depending on the response of the individual patient to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate continually during infusion, and then until vital signs are stable. Patients who receive prolonged Cleviprex infusions and are not transitioned to other antihypertensive therapies should be monitored for the possibility of rebound hypertension for at least 8 hours after the infusion is stopped. In clinical trials, the safety profile of clevidipine was generally similar to sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, or nicardipine in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Cleviprex is contraindicated in patients with allergies to soybeans, soy products, eggs, or egg products; defective lipid metabolism such as pathologic hyperlipemia (rare genetic disorders characterized by abnormal triglyceride metabolism), lipoid nephrosis, or acute pancreatitis if it is accompanied by hyperlipidemia; and in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Hypotension and reflex tachycardia are potential consequences of rapid upward titration of Cleviprex. In clinical trials, a similar increase in heart rate was observed in both Cleviprex and comparator arms. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can produce negative inotropic effects and exacerbate heart failure. Heart failure patients should be monitored carefully. Cleviprex gives no protection against the effects of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are headache, nausea, and vomiting. Cleviprex should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Maintain aseptic technique while handling Cleviprex. Cleviprex contains phospholipids and can support microbial growth. Do not use if contamination is suspected. Once the stopper is punctured, use or discard within 12 hours. == Drug interactions == No clinical drug interaction studies were conducted. Cleviprex does not have the potential for blocking or inducing any CYP enzymes. == Storage == Cleviprex is available in ready-to-use 50- and 100-mL glass vials at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of clevidipine butyrate. Vials should be refrigerated at 2-8oC (36-46 °F). Cleviprex can be stored to controlled room temperature for up to 2 months. Cleviprex is photosensitive and storage in cartons protects against photodegradation. Protection from light during administration is not required. == Phase III clinical trial results == Cleviprex has been evaluated in 6 Phase III clinical studies including the perioperative and emergency department/intensive care settings. These include ESCAPE-1, ESCAPE-2, ECLIPSE, and VELOCITY trials. ESCAPE-1 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trial of 105 cardiac surgery patients. In ESCAPE-1, Cleviprex had a significantly lower rate of treatment failure when compared with placebo (7.5% vs 82.7%) and a 92.5% rate of success in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) by ≥15%. The median time to reduce SBP ≥15% from baseline was 6 minutes. ESCAPE-2 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy trials of 110 cardiac surgery patients. In ESCAPE-2, Cleviprex had a significantly lower rate of treatment failure when compared with placebo (8.2% vs 79.6%) and a 91.8% treatment success rate. The median time to reduce SBP ≥15% from baseline was 5.3 minutes. The ECLIPSE trials consisted of three safety trials in which 1506 patients were randomized to receive Cleviprex, nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, or nicardipine, for the treatment of hypertension associated with cardiac surgery. The incidence of death, stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and renal dysfunction at 30 days did not differ significantly between the pooled Cleviprex and comparator treatment arms. VELOCITY was an open-label trial of 126 patients with severe hypertension (BP > 180/115 mmHg) in the emergency department and intensive care unit. In VELOCITY, 104 out of 117 patients (88.9%) achieved a target SBP mean decrease of 21.1% at 30 minutes. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Cleviprex Prescribing Information"" (PDF). cleviprex.com.

Cell viability assay, migration assay, invasion assay, immunofluorescence staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, HE staining, Masson staining, and immunohistochemical analysis were used to analyze the KFs and keloid xenografts. In this study, we found that derazantinib inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and collagen production of KFs in vitro. The transcription and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is closely related to collagen deposition and tissue fibrosis, was significantly inhibited. Also, derazantinib inhibited the expression of FGFR1 and PAI-1 and reduced the weight of the implanted keloid from the xenograft mice model.

448,"('Cariprazine (hydrochloride)', 'Cariprazine', 'Cariprazine(rgh188)', 'Cariprazine [usan:inn]', 'Reagila')",Medical,"Cariprazine, sold under the brand name Vraylar among others, is an atypical antipsychotic developed by Gedeon Richter, which is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is also prescribed as an add-on treatment for bipolar depression and major depressive disorder. Cariprazine acts primarily as a D3 and D2 receptor partial agonist, with a preference for the D3 receptor. It is a partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors. It is taken by mouth. The most prevalent side effects include nausea, mild sedation, fatigue, and dizziness. At higher dosages, there is an increased risk for restlessness, insomnia, and tremors. Cariprazine was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2015. It was approved as a generic medication in 2022, but is covered by patents until 2029. == Medical uses == Cariprazine is used to treat patients with schizophrenia and manic, depressive, or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. In the United States it is approved for schizophrenia in adults, acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults and treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression). Cariprazine consistently improved clinical severity across a spectrum of patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia - effectively reducing psychosis, anxiety, manic and depressive symptoms. In Australia, the United Kingdom, and the European Union it is approved only for treating schizophrenia. == Side effects == Side effects may first appear several weeks after starting cariprazine. Cariprazine does not appear to impact prolactin levels, and unlike many other antipsychotics, does not increase the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). In short term clinical trials, extrapyramidal effects, sedation, akathisia, nausea, headache, dizziness, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, and constipation were observed. One review characterized the frequency of these events as ""not greatly different from that seen in patient treated with placebo"" but a second called the incidence of movement-related disorders ""rather high"". Regarding these side effects, the label of cariprazine states, ""The possibility of lenticular changes or cataracts cannot be excluded at this time. ""Cariprazine blocks the effects of THC. Because cariprazine and its active metabolites have long half-lives, many healthcare professionals monitor for adverse effects up to several weeks after starting cariprazine. A longer monitoring period is also indicated for dosage changes, whether they represent an increase or a decrease, because elimination may take several weeks. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Unlike many antipsychotics that are D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, cariprazine is a D2 and D3 partial agonist. It also has a higher affinity for D3 receptors. The D2 and D3 receptors are important targets for the treatment of schizophrenia, because the overstimulation of dopamine receptors has been implicated as a possible cause of schizophrenia. Cariprazine acts to inhibit overstimulated dopamine receptors (acting as an antagonist) and stimulate the same receptors when the endogenous dopamine levels are low. Cariprazine's high selectivity towards D3 receptors could prove to reduce side effects associated with the other antipsychotic drugs, because D3 receptors are mainly located in the ventral striatum and would not incur the same motor side effects (extrapyramidal symptoms) as drugs that act on dorsal striatum dopamine receptors. Cariprazine also acts on 5-HT1A receptors, though the affinity is considerably lower than the affinity to dopamine receptors (seen in monkey and rat brain studies). In the same studies, cariprazine has been noted to produce pro-cognitive effects, the mechanisms of which are currently under investigation. An example of pro-cognitive effects occurred in pre-clinical trials with rats: rats with cariprazine performed better in a scopolamine-induced learning impairment paradigm in a water labyrinth test. This may be due to the selective antagonist nature of D3 receptors, though further studies need to be conducted. This result could be very useful for schizophrenia, as one of the symptoms includes cognitive deficits. Cariprazine has partial agonist as well as antagonist properties depending on the endogenous dopamine levels. When endogenous dopamine levels are high (as is hypothesized in schizophrenic patients), cariprazine acts as an antagonist by blocking dopamine receptors. When endogenous dopamine levels are low, cariprazine acts more as an agonist, increasing dopamine receptor activity. In monkey studies, the administration of increasing doses of cariprazine resulted in a dose-dependent and saturable reduction of specific binding. At the highest dose (300 μg/kg), the D2/D3 receptors were 94% occupied, while at the lowest dose (1 μg/kg), receptors were 5% occupied. Dopamine D2 and D3 receptor occupancy in humans has been summarized as, ""In healthy volunteers, single-dose cariprazine of 0.5 mg occupied up to 12% of striatal D2/D3 receptors, while striatal D2/D3 occupancy after multiple dosing up to cariprazine 1.0 mg/d ranged from 63 to 79% [39]. In an open-label, fixed-dose, 2-week trial in eight males with schizophrenia, PET scans of dorsal striatal regions (caudate nucleus and putamen) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) showed maximum occupancy (‡ 90%) at a 3-mg target dose of cariprazine following 14 d of treatment [40,41]. After 14 d of cariprazine 1.5 mg/d, receptor occupancy was 69% in the caudate nucleus, 69% in the nucleus accumbens, and 75% in the putamen"". Cariprazine, as well as other third generation antipsychotics, possesses a lower chance of exacerbating extrapyramidal symptoms. However the ability to induce akathasia remains relatively high. This may be mediated through a lack of anticholinergic effects (as agents of this class are sometimes used to treat akathisia), as well as a lack of a balanced dopaminergic(D2)/serotonergic(5-HT2A) ratio (compared to the second generation antipsychotics serving a more nuanced profile in this regard). Moreover, partial agonists, through their limited response triggering, ironically often have the tendency to occupy near all targeted receptors at relatively low dosages of the drug. An extreme example is aripiprazole with an average occupancy of 70% (D2) at a 2 mg dose, well below its usual antipsychotic dosage (the often cited threshold of occupancy for an antipsychotic effect is 70%). This could be another reason for akathasia from partial agonists. This Partial agonist activity induces, considered through two depicted schematas in pharmacology (either in determining their intrinsic value of activity making up the proportions of how much of a dose of this molecule binds to postsynaptic (dopamine)receptors to inactivate further exacerbating signalling through agonists with locking the receptor making it unavailable for other molecules and binding to the presynaptic site at autoreceptors in the synaptic cleft which triggers the transmitting with agonistic behaviour, or, binding independently to the site in the synaptic cleft inducing a certain response in relative to its agonist maximum potential to activate its relative receptor, then, depicted as percentage of intrinsic activity for this specific partial agonist) but with both needed to express just a ""half-maximal response"" (caught statistically in EC-responsecurves in a response-inhibited curve for maximal activation in graphes stretched on their longitudes, which it's due to their effect enabling tendency in time) to be able to compete successfully, relative to their dependent natural agonists (in case of antipsychotics dopamine) at full partial agonist concentrations where it happens to turn out luckily that atypical antipsychotics working as partial agonists (or the so-called third generation; e.g. aripiprazole, cariprazine and brexpiprazole) demonstrating near full ""occupation"" or concentration of them in the brain where then this idea of competing and inhibiting dopamin tends to work out (because the alone-giveable possibility what a neuroleptic per definition has to be to called by this name, needs to have an antipsychotic (or positive symptoms erasing effect), e.g. being moodstabilizing), where without the pharmacologic term of a partial agonist would just work out to exacerbate and activate receptors by an unsatisfying concentration of it in the brain. === Pharmacokinetics === Cariprazine has high oral bioavailability and can cross the blood brain barrier easily in humans because it is lipophilic. In rats, the oral bioavailability was 52% (with a dose of 1 mg/kg). Cariprazine is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4), with some minor metabolism by CYP2D6. Cariprazine does not induce the production of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 in the liver, and weakly, competitively inhibits CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. == Research == Positive Phase III study results were published for schizophrenia and mania in early 2012, and for bipolar disorder I depression from a Phase II trial in 2015. Cariprazine is also potentially useful as an add-on therapy in major depressive disorder. It is being developed jointly by AbbVie and Gedeon Richter Plc, with AbbVie responsible for commercialization in the US, Canada, Japan, Taiwan and certain Latin American countries (including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela). In February 2022, AbbVie requested approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Approval was granted by the FDA in December 2022 for cariprazine to be used as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. == References ==",Reagila,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.879423355916515e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002708068350329995)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/reagila ', [])"
449,"('(r)-baclofen', 'Arbaclofen', '(r)-4-amino-3-(4-chlorophenyl)butanoic acid', 'Baclofen', 'R-baclofen')",Medical,"Baclofen, sold under the brand name Lioresal among others, is a medication used to treat muscle spasticity, such as from a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. It may also be used for hiccups and muscle spasms near the end of life, and off-label to treat alcohol use disorder or opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is taken orally or by intrathecal pump (delivered into the spinal canal via an implantable pump device). It is sometimes used transdermally (applied topically to the skin) in combination with gabapentin and clonidine prepared at a compounding pharmacy. It is believed to work by decreasing levels of certain neurotransmitters. Common side effects include sleepiness, weakness, and dizziness. Serious side effects, such as seizures and rhabdomyolysis, may occur if use of baclofen is stopped abruptly. Use during pregnancy is of unclear safety, whilst use during breastfeeding is likely safe, and even more so if oral administration is avoided. The adverse effects and safety profile associated with baclofen when it is combined with sedative drugs (for example alcohol or benzodiazepines) range depending on the dose and the individual. The interaction may increase the sedative effects of all ingested sedatives and as such is not generally recommended. In high doses the interaction can cause de novo seizures. Baclofen was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 104th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Baclofen is primarily used for the treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Use in people with stroke, cerebral palsy, or Parkinson's disease is not recommended. Intrathecal baclofen is used for severe spasticity of spinal cord origin, that is refractive to maximum doses of oral antispasmodic agents, or who experience intolerable side effects. Baclofen may be used off-label as a treatment for alcohol use disorder to reduce the risk of relapse, and to increase the number of days that a person can go without drinking alcohol (abstinence days). It is sometimes used for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and may be superior for this purpose to the more-commonly used clonidine. Baclofen is also used in the treatment of sleep-related painful erections. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, trouble sleeping, nausea and vomiting, poor concentration and recall (resembling dementia), urinary retention, or constipation. === Withdrawal syndrome === Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely if baclofen is administered intrathecally or for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be eased or completely reversed by re-initiating therapy with baclofen. Withdrawal symptoms may include auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, delusions, confusion, agitation, delirium, disorientation, fluctuation of consciousness, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, inattention, memory impairments, perceptual disturbances, itching, anxiety, depersonalization, hypertonia, hyperthermia (higher than normal temperature without infection), formal thought disorder, psychosis, mania, mood disturbances, restlessness, and behavioral disturbances, tachycardia, seizures, tremors, autonomic dysfunction, hyperpyrexia (fever), extreme muscle rigidity resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rebound spasticity. === Abuse === Baclofen, at standard dosing, does not appear to possess addictive properties, and has not been associated with any degree of drug craving. Euphoria is however listed as a common to very common side-effect of baclofen in the BNF 75. There are very few cases of abuse of baclofen for reasons other than attempted suicide. In contrast to baclofen, another GABAB receptor agonist, γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction. These effects are likely mediated not by activation of the GABAB receptor, but rather by activation of the GHB receptor. Baclofen possesses both sedative and anxiolytic properties. == Overdose == Reports of overdose indicate that baclofen may cause symptoms including vomiting, general weakness, sedation, respiratory insufficiency, seizures, dizziness, headaches, itching, hypothermia, bradycardia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, hypertension, hyporeflexia and coma sometimes mimicking brain death. Overdose may require intubation and length of mechanical ventilation required may correlate with serum baclofen levels shortly after ingestion. Symptoms may persist even after the point at which serum baclofen levels are undetectable. == Pharmacology == Chemically, baclofen is a derivative of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is believed to work by activating (or agonizing) GABA receptors, specifically the GABAB receptors. === Pharmacodynamics === Baclofen produces its effects by selectively activating the GABAB receptor. Baclofen is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory ligand, inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Baclofen does not have significant affinity for the GHB receptor, and has no known abuse potential. Agonism of GABAB receptors is thought to be responsible for baclofen's range of therapeutic properties, as GABAB knockout mice are unresponsive to the neurobiological effects of baclofen. Similarly to phenibut (β-phenyl-GABA), as well as pregabalin (β-isobutyl-GABA), which are close analogues of baclofen, baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) has been found to block α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it is weaker relative to phenibut in this action (Ki = 23 and 39 μM for R- and S-phenibut and 156 μM for baclofen). Moreover, baclofen is in the range of 100-fold more potent by weight as an agonist of the GABAB receptor in comparison to phenibut, and in accordance, is used at far lower relative dosages. As such, the actions of baclofen on α2δ subunit-containing VGCCs are likely not clinically relevant. For drug-reward and addiction, baclofen's mechanism of action is thought to be through its effect on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, specifically leading to a decrease in dopamine release associated with alcohol. GABAB receptor activation (GABAB receptor agonist activity) may decrease or inhibit alcohol's ability to activate or fire dopaminergic neurons following exposure to alcohol. Baclofen's mechanism of action when used to treat alcohol use disorder is not thought to be mediated through its muscle-relaxing or sedative properties, however there is evidence to suggest that the GABAB receptor-activation in the limbus may also reduce feelings of anxiety in people with alcohol use disorder. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low: the drug is predominantly excreted unchanged by the kidneys. The serum half-life of baclofen is roughly 2–4 hours; however, one source gives a half-life of 6.8 hr, using a more complex calculation combining urinary and serum data. It therefore needs to be administered frequently throughout the day to control spasticity appropriately. == Chemistry == Baclofen is a white (or off-white) mostly odorless crystalline powder, with a molecular weight of 213.66 g/mol. It is slightly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol, and insoluble in chloroform. == History == Historically, baclofen was designed as a drug for treating epilepsy. It was first synthesized at Ciba-Geigy by the Swiss chemist Heinrich Keberle in 1962. Its effect on epilepsy was ineffective, but it was found that in certain people, spasticity decreased. In 1971, it was introduced as a treatment for certain form of spasticity. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977. Intrathecal baclofen was first introduced in 1984 to treat severe spinal spasticity. This administration route aimed to avoid supraspinal side effects. In his 2008 book, Le Dernier Verre (translated literally as The Last Glass or The End of My Addiction), French-American cardiologist Olivier Ameisen described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave $750,000 to the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004. The researchers concluded, ""In summary, the current study did not find evidence of a positive effect of either low or high doses of baclofen in AD patients. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that baclofen is an effective medication for the treatment of severe, heavy drinking AD patients not responding to or not accepting routine psychosocial interventions."" == Society and culture == === Routes of administration === Baclofen can be administered, orally, intrathecally (directly into the cerebral spinal fluid) using a pump implanted under the skin, or transdermally as part of a pain-relieving and muscle-relaxing topical cream mix (also containing gabapentin and clonidine) prepared at a compounding pharmacy. Intrathecal pumps offer much lower doses of baclofen because they are designed to deliver the medication directly to the spinal fluid rather than going through the digestive and blood system first. A drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid more than 10 times greater than when given orally is achieved with this route. At the same time the blood concentration levels are almost undetectable, thus minimizing side effects. Besides those with spasticity, intrathecal administration is also used in patients with cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis who have severe painful spasms which are not controllable by oral baclofen. With pump administration, a test dose is first injected into the spinal fluid to assess the effect, and if successful in relieving spasticity, a chronic intrathecal catheter is inserted from the spine through the abdomen and attached to the pump which is implanted under the abdomen's skin, usually by the ribcage. The pump is computer-controlled for automatic dosage and its reservoir can be replenished by percutaneous injection. The pump also has to be replaced every five to seven years or so. === Other names === Other names include: Fleqsuvy, Gablofen, Kemstro, Lioresal, Lyvispah, Ozobax. == Research == Baclofen is being studied for the treatment of alcoholism. Evidence as of 2019 is not conclusive enough to recommend its use for this purpose. In 2014, the French drug agency ANSM issued a three-year temporary recommendation allowing the use of baclofen in alcoholism. In 2018, baclofen received a Marketing Authorization for use in alcoholism treatment from the agency if all other treatments are not effective. It is being studied along with naltrexone and sorbitol for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes peripheral neuropathy. It is also being studied for cocaine addiction. Baclofen and other muscle relaxants are being studied for potential use for persistent hiccups. From 2014 to 2017 baclofen misuse, toxicity and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased. == References ==",Baclofen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2397689715726301e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005756151513196528)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclofen?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Baclofen', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclofen?utm_source=openai')])"

451,"('Pleconaril', 'Vp 63843', 'Win 63843', 'Picovir', 'Win-63843')",Medical,"Pleconaril (Picovir) is an antiviral drug that was being developed by Schering-Plough for prevention of asthma exacerbations and common cold symptoms in patients exposed to picornavirus respiratory infections. Pleconaril, administered either orally or intranasally, is active against viruses in the Picornaviridae family, including Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. It has shown useful activity against the dangerous enterovirus D68. == History == Pleconaril was originally developed by Sanofi-Aventis, and licensed to ViroPharma in 1997. ViroPharma developed it further, and submitted a New Drug Application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. The application was rejected, citing safety concerns; and ViroPharma re-licensed it to Schering-Plough in 2003. The Phase II clinical trial was completed in 2007. A pleconaril intranasal spray had reached phase II clinical trial for the treatment of the common cold symptoms and asthma complications. However, the results have yet to be reported. == Mechanism of action == In enteroviruses, pleconaril prevents the virus from exposing its RNA, and in rhinoviruses pleconaril prevents the virus from attaching itself to the host cell. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) contain four structural proteins labeled VP1-VP4. Proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are eight stranded anti-parallel β-barrels. VP4 is an extended polypeptide chain on the viral capsid inner surface. Pleconaril binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the VP1 protein. Pleconaril has been shown in viral assembly to associate with viral particles. Through noncovalent, hydrophobic interactions compounds can bind to the hydrophobic pocket. Amino acids in positions Tyr152 and Val191 are a part of the VP1 drug binding pocket. In Coxsackievirus, pleconaril efficiency correlates to the susceptibility of CVB3 with the amino acid at position 1092 in the hydrophobic pocket. Amino acid 1092 is in close proximity to the central ring of capsid binders. The binding of pleconaril in the hydrophobic pocket creates conformational changes, which increases the rigidity of the virion and decreases the virions' ability to interact with its receptor. Drugs bind with the methylisoxazole ring close to the entrance pocket in VP1, the 3-fluromethyl oxadiazole ring at the end of the pocket and the phenyl ring in the center of the pocket. == Clinical trials == The results of two randomized, double blind, placebo studies found Pleconaril treatment could benefit patients with colds due to picornaviruses. Participants in the studies were healthy adults from Canada and the United States, with self-diagnosed colds that had occurred within 24 hours of trial enrollment. Participants were randomly given a placebo or two 200 mg tablets to take three times daily for five days. To increase absorption it was recommended to be taken after a meal. To monitor the effectiveness of Pleconaril, participants recorded the severity of their symptoms and nasal mucosal samples were obtained at enrollment, day 3, day 6 and day 18. The two studies had a total of 2096 participants and more than 90% (1945) completed the trial. The most common reason for a participant not finishing the trial was an adverse event. Pleconaril treatment showed a reduction in nose blowing, sleep disturbance, and less cold medication used. Another study showed over 87% of virus isolates in cell culture were inhibited by pleconaril. Virus variants were detected in 0.7% of the placebo group and 10.7% of the pleconaril group. Of the two isolates a subject from the placebo group had a resistant virus in cell culture to pleconaril. The other strain was susceptible to the drug. The pleconaril group had 21 virus strains, which remained susceptible. Resistance strains were found in 7 pleconaril patients. A Phase II study that used an intranasal formulation of pleconaril failed to show a statistically significant result for either of its two primary efficacy endpoints, percentage of participants with rhinovirus PCR-positive colds and percentage of participants with asthma exacerbations together with rhinovirus-positive PCR. == Resistance == In human rhinoviruses mutations in amino acids at positions 152 and 191 decrease the efficiency of pleconaril. The resistant HRV have phenylalanine at position 152 and leucine at position 191. In vitro studies have shown resistance to pleconaril may emerge. The wild type resistance frequency to pleconaril was about 5×10−5. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strain Nancy and other mutants carry amino acid substitutions at position 1092 of Ile1092->Leu1092 or Ile1092->Met in VP1. The Ile->Leu mutation causes complete resistance to pleconaril. The study found resistance of CVB3 to pleconaril can be overcome by substitution of the central phenyl group. Methyl and bromine substitutions created an increase of pleconaril activity towards sensitive and resistant strains. Amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic pocket and receptor binding region of viral capsid proteins were shown to have an effect against the sensitivity of capsid binding antivirals. == Side effects == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected pleconaril in 2002 due to the side effects. The most commonly reported side effects were mild to moderate headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Some women were having symptoms of spotting in between periods. Menstrual irregularities were reported by 3.5% of the 320 pleconaril treated women using oral contraceptives and by none of the 291 placebo treated women. In the clinical trial two women became pregnant due to the drug interfering with hormonal birth control by activation of cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes. Other patients have described painful nasal inflammation. == See also == Pocapavir == References ==",Pleconaril,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.014164102263748646), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.158996332786046e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019396792631596327)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleconaril,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11178348/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12008788/ ', [])"

Blocking β adrenergic receptors decreases the heart rate and cardiac output to lower arterial blood pressure. β blockers also decrease renin levels, which ultimately results in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys and therefore a lower blood volume and blood pressure. Penbutolol acts on the β1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. When β1 receptors are activated by a catecholamine, they stimulate a coupled G protein which activates adenylyl to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP ultimately alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases heart rate.: 213–214 Penbutolol blocks this and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure.: 40 The ability of penbutolol to act as a partial agonist proves useful in the prevention of bradycardia as a result of decreasing the heart rate excessively. Penbutolol binding β1 adrenergic receptors also alters kidney functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which will then be converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, causing a decrease in electrolyte and water retention, ultimately increasing water excretion and decreasing blood volume and pressure.: 221 Like propranolol and pindolol, it is a serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist; this discovery by several groups in the 1980s generated excitement among those doing research on the serotonin system as such antagonists were rare at that time.: 111–14 === Pharmacokinetics === Penbutolol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, has a bioavailability over 90%, and has a rapid onset of effect. Penbutolol has a half life of five hours.: Table 10–2, p 252 == Society and culture == === Availability === Penbutolol was approved by the FDA in 1987.

In this multicenter phase I trial (NCT01781429), 135 patients were enrolled to an accelerated 3 + 3 dose-escalation cohort and six distinct dose-expansion cohorts. Dose escalation included 27 patients, dosed from 10 to 900 mg twice daily and established the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of 600 mg twice daily. Ulixertinib exposure was dose proportional to the RP2D, which provided near-complete inhibition of ERK activity in whole blood. In the 108-patient expansion cohort, 32% of patients required dose reduction. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (48%), fatigue (42%), nausea (41%), and dermatitis acneiform (31%). Partial responses were seen in 3 of 18 (17%) patients dosed at or above maximum tolerated dose and in 11 of 81 (14%) evaluable patients in dose expansion. Responses occurred in patients with  Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of the peripheral nervous system. Approximately 80% of relapsed NB show RAS-MAPK pathway mutations that activate ERK, resulting in the promotion of cell proliferation and drug resistance. Ulixertinib, a first-in-class ERK-specific inhibitor, has shown promising antitumor activity in phase 1 clinical trials for advanced solid tumors. Here, we show that ulixertinib significantly and dose-dependently inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation in different NB cell lines, including PDX cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ulixertinib extensively inhibits different oncogenic and neuronal developmental pathways, including EGFR, VEGF, WNT, MAPK, NGF, and NTRK1. The proteomic analysis further revealed that ulixertinib inhibits the cell cycle and promotes apoptosis in NB cells. Additionally, ulixertinib treatment significantly sensitized NB cells to the conventional chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Furthermore, ulixertinib potently inhibited NB tumor growth and prolonged the overall survival of the treated mice in two different NB mice models. Our preclinical study demonstrates that ulixertinib, either as a single agent or in combination with current therapies, is a novel and practical therapeutic approach for NB. Ulixertinib (BVD-523) is a highly potent, selective, and reversible ERK1/2 inhibitor and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. In this study, we investigated whether ulixertinib could antagonize multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The results showed that ulixertinib, at non-toxic concentrations, significantly reversed ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)- and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2)-mediated MDR. In ABCB1-overexpressing cells, ulixertinib antagonized MDR by attenuating the efflux function of ABCB1. Similarly, in ABCG2-overexpressing cells, ulixertinib inhibited the efflux activity of ABCG2 and reversed resistance to substrate anticancer drugs. The reversal effects of ulixertinib were not related to the down-regulation or change of subcellular localization of ABCB1 or ABCG2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that ulixertinib stimulated the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner, and the in silico docking study predicted that ulixertinib could interact with the substrate-binding sites of both ABCB1 and ABCG2. Our finding provides a clue into a novel treatment strategy: a combination of ulixertinib with anticancer drugs to attenuate MDR mediated by ABCB1 or ABCG2 in cancer cells overexpressing these transporters.",Ulixertinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002300474588992074), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015149556566029787)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://tucidinostatinhibitor.com/ulixertinib/ ', [])"
456,"('Lofexidine', 'Lofexidina', 'Lofexidinum', 'Lofexidinum [inn-latin]', 'Lofexidina [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Lofexidine, sold under the brand name Lucemyra among others, is a medication historically used to treat high blood pressure; today, it is more commonly used to help with the physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal. It is taken by mouth. It is an α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist. It was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States in 2018, considering it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == In the United States, lofexidine is approved for the ""mitigation of withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt discontinuation of opioids in adults,"" for a treatment duration of 14 days. In the United Kingdom, lofexidine is commonly used in conjunction with the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone in rapid detoxification cases. When these two drugs are paired, naltrexone is administered to induce an opioid receptor blockade, sending the subject into immediate withdrawal and accelerating the detoxification process, while lofexidine is given to relieve the symptoms associated with the withdrawal including chills, sweating, stomach cramps, muscle pain, and runny nose. === Opioid withdrawal === The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend the use of methadone or buprenorphine as first-line agents in the management of opioid use disorder. However, lofexidine is considered an acceptable alternative for people with mild or uncertain opioid dependence in need of short-term detoxification. Lofexidine is not an opioid. It does not eliminate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal but reduces them. Indeed, one suggested use for lofexidine is to ease withdrawal symptoms of methadone dependence. Its use is approved in the United States for up to 14 days. === Other clinical uses === The possibility of using lofexidine to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms has been investigated, and has not yet been shown to be an effective treatment. It is also used in treatment of cases with postmenopausal hot flashes. === Special populations === Lofexidine's safety in pregnancy or in the setting of breastfeeding are unknown. Caution is warranted if chronic kidney impairment is present. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects that have occurred after taking lofexidine include the following: Slow heart rate Dizziness Sleepiness Dry mouth Low blood pressure QT prolongation In addition, people may experience a sudden jump in blood pressure after stopping lofexidine. == Overdose == The LD50 of lofexidine is above 77 mg/kg in animals. Studies of high-dose, single administrations of lofexidine proved tolerable for animals, but repeat administration induced symptoms consistent with toxicity. In studies on mice, rats, and dogs, these included ataxia, somnolence, and tremors. It is expected that an overdose of lofexidine would result in symptoms akin to its pharmacological side effects in humans, such as bradycardia and hypotension. == Interactions == Many drug-drug interactions with lofexidine are possible. === QT prolongation === Lofexidine prolongs the QT interval, which can result in a severe interaction (torsade de pointes) when combined with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Patient-specific characteristics that increase the risk for a clinically significant drug-drug interaction include: increasing age female sex cardiac disease electrolyte disturbances (low blood potassium) As a result, there are many QT-prolonging drugs that may interact with lofexidine. These include medications such as methadone, amiodarone, citalopram, and fluconazole. Other medications may increase the risk for a low level of potassium in the blood, thereby indirectly increasing the risk for QT prolongation. For example, dexamethasone, hydrochlorothiazide, and theophylline can lower the level of potassium in the blood. === CNS depression === Lofexidine can depress the central nervous system (CNS), which, in combination with other CNS depressants, may reduce a person's ability to perform tasks that require skills and attention. For example, clobazam, gabapentin, and levetiracetam all can depress the CNS. === Hypotension === The risk of hypotension (low blood pressure) is increased when lofexidine is combined with other drugs that lower blood pressure. These may include losartan, metoprolol, and pramipexole. == Pharmacology == Lofexidine is an agonist at the alpha-2A, 2B, and 2C adrenergic receptor subtypes, with the highest activity at the α2A-adrengergic receptor. Ki represents the dissociation constant for lofexidine's binding to a specific subtype of α2 receptor. The smaller the Ki value, the stronger the drug binds to the receptor to exert its activity. Lofexidine inhibits the release of norepinephrine in the central and peripheral nervous system, thereby reducing some of the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, but it has no documented effect on drug craving and endogenous opioid levels. === Pharmacokinetics === Lofexidine's oral bioavailability is about 90%, with extensive oral absorption. Peak plasma concentrations occur at 3 hours after a single administration, with a half-life of 11 hours. Lofexidine is extensively metabolized by the liver, and primarily cleared by the kidney. It is 80–90% plasma protein bound. == Chemistry == Lofexidine exists as a solid at room temperature, with a melting point of 127 degrees C. The pair of ortho chlorine (Cl−) atoms on the phenyl ring are necessary for lofexidine's agonism at the α2A adrenergic receptor subtype; removal of either chlorine atom results in antagonism at the receptor. === Comparison to clonidine === Lofexidine is structurally analogous to clonidine, another α2 adrenergic receptor agonist used for treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms. A comparison of the two structures is shown at right. Both contain an imidazoline ring and a 2,6-dichlorinated phenyl ring. The differences in structure are shown in red, while the similarities are in black. In addition to the structural differences, administration of lofexidine to people who abuse opioids has been shown to be more effective for a longer duration, with fewer withdrawal symptoms than clonidine even after one day. However, clonidine is often preferred as it is substantially cheaper than lofexidine when purchased with a private (non-NHS) prescription. This factor is exacerbated by the considerable number of and quantities of medications prescribed to alleviate the constellation of withdrawal signs and symptoms. Additionally, clonidine has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure. Therefore, although similar to lofexidine, clonidine is most frequently prescribed to treat high blood pressure. == Society and culture == Britannia Pharmaceuticals has licensed lofexidine to be sold by US WorldMeds for sale in North America. In the United Kingdom, the hydrochloride form, lofexidine HCl, has been licensed and sold since 1992 for opioid withdrawal relief in tablet form as BritLofex by Britannia Pharmaceuticals. BritLofex is only available by prescription. Lofexidine was first approved by the US FDA on May 16, 2018, under the brand name Lucemyra, produced by US WorldMeds. It was noted as the first non-opioid drug approved in the US for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. == See also == Methadone Naltrexone Clonidine == References ==",Lofexidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.0265373677830212e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012838016846217215)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618036.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Lofexidine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618036.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Indeed, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials in HLH. Nevertheless, concerns remain for ruxolitinib-induced cytopenias, which are postulated to result from the blockade of JAK2-dependent hematopoietic growth factors. To explore the therapeutic effects of selective JAK inhibition in mouse models of HLH, we carried out studies incorporating the JAK1 inhibitor itacitinib, JAK2 inhibitor fedratinib, and JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. All 3 drugs were well-tolerated and at the doses tested, they suppressed interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Itacitinib, but not fedratinib, significantly improved survival and clinical scores in CpG-induced secondary HLH. Conversely, in primary HLH, in which perforin-deficient (Prf1-/-) mice are infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), itacitinib, and fedratinib performed suboptimally. Ruxolitinib demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy in both HLH models. RNA-sequencing of splenocytes from LCMV-infected Prf1-/- mice revealed that itacitinib targeted inflammatory and metabolic pathway genes in CD8 T cells, whereas fedratinib targeted genes regulating cell proliferation and metabolism. In monocytes, neither drug conferred major transcriptional impacts. Consistent with its superior clinical effects, ruxolitinib exerted the greatest transcriptional changes in CD8 T cells and monocytes, targeting more genes across several biologic pathways, most notably JAK-dependent proinflammatory signaling. We conclude that JAK1 inhibition is sufficient to curtail CpG-induced disease, but combined inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 is needed to best control LCMV-induced immunopathology. The standard primary treatment for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requires prolonged, high-dose systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) that delay reconstitution of the immune system. We used validated clinical and biomarker staging criteria to identify a group of patients with low-risk (LR) GVHD that is very likely to respond to SCS. We hypothesized that itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, would effectively treat LR GVHD without SCS. We treated 70 patients with LR GVHD in a multicenter, phase 2 trial (NCT03846479) with 28 days of itacitinib 200 mg/d (responders could receive a second 28-day cycle), and we compared their outcomes to those of 140 contemporaneous, matched control patients treated with SCSs. More patients responded to itacitinib within 7 days (81% vs 66%, P = .02), and response rates at day 28 were very high for both groups (89% vs 86%, P = .67), with few symptomatic flares (11% vs 12%, P = .88). Fewer itacitinib-treated patients developed a serious infection within 90 days (27% vs 42%, P = .04) due to fewer viral and fungal infections. Grade ≥3 cytopenias were similar between groups except for less severe leukopenia with itacitinib (16% vs 31%, P = .02). No other grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in >10% of itacitinib-treated patients. There were no significant differences between groups at 1 year for nonrelapse mortality (4% vs 11%, P = .21), relapse (18% vs 21%, P = .64), chronic GVHD (28% vs 33%, P = .33), or survival (88% vs 80%, P = .11). Itacitinib monotherapy seems to be a safe and effective alternative to SCS treatment for LR GVHD and deserves further investigation.

There is a great need to identify effective therapy for GC. Crizotinib is a multi-targeted, clinically available oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for lung cancer, but its use for the highly heterogeneous disease of GC is unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer mechanisms of the (S)-crizotinib in inhibiting GC growth. Human GC cell lines (SGC-7901 and BGC-823) and the (S)-crizotinib-resistant BGC-823/R were cultured for determining the effects of (S)-crizotinib on cell viability, apoptosis, oxidant generation, and cell cycle progression. Involvement of ROS, Akt signaling, MTH1, and DNA damage was tested with respective pharmacological blockade. The in vivo anti-tumor effects of (S)-crizotinib were determined using xenograft tumor mice. Results indicated that (S)-crizotinib decreased GC cell viability, induced growth arrest and apoptosis, and increased levels of γH2AX and Ser1981-phosphorylated ATM, which were inhibited by NAC. The anti-cancer mechanism of (S)-crizotinib was independent of MTH1. Moreover, ATM-activated Akt, a pro-survival signal, whose inhibition further enhanced (S)-crizotinib-induced inhibition of GC cell growth and tumor growth in xenograft mice, and re-sensitized resistant GC cells to (S)-crizotinib. (S)-crizotinib reduced GC cell and tumor growth through oxidative DNA damage mechanism and triggered pro-survival Akt signaling. We conclude that inclusion of Akt inhibition (to block the survival signaling) with (S)-crizotinib may provide an effective and novel combination therapy for GC in the clinical setting. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancers and is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Targeted therapy has produced unprecedented outcomes in patients with NSCLC as a number of oncogenic drivers have been found. Crizotinib, a selective small-molecule inhibitor, has been widely used for the treatment of NSCLC patients with ALK gene rearrangements. A recent study has also shown that (S)-enantiomer of crizotinib exhibits anticancer activity by targeting the protein mutT homologue (MTH1). Since this discovery, contradictory studies have cast a doubt on MTH1 as a therapeutic target of (S)-crizotinib. NCI-H460, H1975, and A549 cells and immunodeficient mice were chosen as a model to study the (S)-crizotinib treatment. The changes induced by (S)-crizotinib treatment in cell viability, apoptosis as well as ROS, and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in the cells were analyzed by MTT assay, FACSCalibur, Western blotting, ROS imaging and electron microscopy. Here, we report that MTH1 does not affect survival of NSCLC cells. We found that (S)-crizotinib induces lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) response in cultured NSCLC cells by increasing intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Blockage of ROS production markedly reversed (S)-crizotinib-induced ER stress and cell apoptosis, independent of MTH1. We confirmed these findings in NSCLC xenograft studies and showed that (S)-crizotinib-induced ER stress and cell apoptosis. Our results reveal a novel antitumor mechanism of (S)-crizotinib in NSCLC which involves activation of ROS-dependent ER stress apoptotic pathway and is independent of MTH1 inhibition. Activated RAS GTPase signalling is a critical driver of oncogenic transformation and malignant disease. Cellular models of RAS-dependent cancers have been used to identify experimental small molecules, such as SCH51344, but their molecular mechanism of action remains generally unknown. Here, using a chemical proteomic approach, we identify the target of SCH51344 as the human mutT homologue MTH1 (also known as NUDT1), a nucleotide pool sanitizing enzyme. Loss-of-function of MTH1 impaired growth of KRAS tumour cells, whereas MTH1 overexpression mitigated sensitivity towards SCH51344. Searching for more drug-like inhibitors, we identified the kinase inhibitor crizotinib as a nanomolar suppressor of MTH1 activity. Surprisingly, the clinically used (R)-enantiomer of the drug was inactive, whereas the (S)-enantiomer selectively inhibited MTH1 catalytic activity.

459,"('Crizotinib', 'Xalkori', '(r)-crizotinib', 'Pf 2341066', 'Crizotinib (pf-02341066)')",Medical,"Crizotinib, sold under the brand name Xalkori among others, is an anti-cancer medication used for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Crizotinib inhibits the c-Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is involved in the oncogenesis of a number of other histological forms of malignant neoplasms. It also acts as an ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1) inhibitor. == Medical uses == Crizotinib is indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or relapsed or refractory, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is ALK-positive. It is also indicated for the treatment of unresectable, recurrent, or refractory inflammatory anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive myofibroblastic tumors (IMT). == Mechanism of action == Crizotinib has an aminopyridine structure, and functions as a protein kinase inhibitor by competitive binding within the ATP-binding pocket of target kinases. About 4% of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 ('echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4') and ALK ('anaplastic lymphoma kinase'), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. The kinase activity of the fusion protein is inhibited by crizotinib. Patients with this gene fusion are typically younger non-smokers who do not have mutations in either the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) or in the K-Ras gene. The number of new cases of ALK-fusion NSLC is about 9,000 per year in the U.S. and about 45,000 worldwide. ALK mutations are thought to be important in driving the malignant phenotype in about 15% of cases of neuroblastoma, a rare form of peripheral nervous system cancer that occurs almost exclusively in very young children. Crizotinib is thought to exert its effects through modulation of the growth, migration, and invasion of malignant cells. Other studies suggest that crizotinib might also act via inhibition of angiogenesis in malignant tumors. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In August 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved crizotinib to treat certain late-stage (locally advanced or metastatic) non-small cell lung cancers that express the abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Approval required a companion molecular test for the EML4-ALK fusion. In March 2016, the FDA approved crizotinib in ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer. In October 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of crizotinib to treat non-small cell lung cancers that express the abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. == Research == === Lung cancer === Crizotinib caused tumors to shrink or stabilize in 90% of 82 patients carrying the ALK fusion gene. Tumors shrank at least 30% in 57% of people treated. Most had adenocarcinoma, and had never smoked or were former smokers. They had undergone treatment with an average of three other drugs prior to receiving crizotinib, and only 10% were expected to respond to standard therapy. They were given 250 mg crizotinib twice daily for a median duration of six months. Approximately 50% of these patients had at least one side effect, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some responses to crizotinib have lasted up to 15 months. A Phase III trial, PROFILE 1007, compares crizotinib to standard second line chemotherapy (pemetrexed or taxotere) in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC. Additionally, a phase 2 trial, PROFILE 1005, studies patients meeting similar criteria who have received more than one line of prior chemotherapy. In February 2016, the J-ALEX phase III study comparing alectinib with crizotinib ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC was terminated early because an interim analysis showed that progression-free survival was longer with alectinib. These results were confirmed in a 2017 analysis. === Lymphomas === In people affected by relapsed or refractory ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma, crizotinib produced objective response rates ranging from 65% to 90% and 3 year progression free survival rates of 60–75%. No relapse of the lymphoma was ever observed after the initial 100 days of treatment. Treatment must be continued indefinitely at present. === Other cancers === Crizotinib is also being tested in clinical trials of advanced disseminated neuroblastoma. == References == == External links == ""Crizotinib"".

460,"('Azvudine (hydrochloride)', 'Azvudine')",Medical,"Azvudine is an antiviral drug which acts as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It was discovered for the treatment of hepatitis C and has since been investigated for use against other viral diseases such as AIDS and COVID-19, for which it was granted conditional approval in China. Azvudine was first discovered in 2007. It costs 350 Chinese yuan per 7 days for COVID, as of November 2022. == Medical uses == In July 2021, azvudine became conditionally approved in China for the following indication: ""to treat high-viral-load cases of HIV-1, in combination with a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor"". The approval text describes it as a dual reverse transcriptase and Vif inhibitor. In July 2022, azvudine received emergency conditional approval for COVID-19 in adults. It is believed to work by inhibiting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. == Adverse effects == According to the manufacturer, phase II trials of azvudine in combination with doravirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV patients found an adverse effect profile similar to, but milder, than lamivudine combined with the two drugs. Very common (> 10%) side effects include dizziness, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Common (> 1%) side effects include nausea, elevated blood lipids, fever, insomnia, tiredness, and diarrhea. Detailed numbers are provided by Genuine in the slides and the medication package insert. A boxed warning is present at the beginning of the Chinese package insert, describing a risk of ""decrease in absolute neutrophil count, increase in total bilirubin, increase in glutathione aminotransferase, and increase in blood glucose"". The small (n=10) open-label pilot study for azvudine used alone in COVID reported no adverse events. === Non-human models === Azvudine is found to be mutagenic in in vitro in the Ames test, CHL test, and in vitro in the mice micronucleus test. Azvudine is toxic to the reproductive system of rats and rabbit. The mimimum reproductive NOAEL found for males is 5.0 mg/kg/d and for females 0.5 mg/kg/d. It is excreted in rat breast milk; the NOAEL for rat pups is 1.5 mg/kg/d. Azvudine is mainly toxic to the immune system, bone marrow, and digestive system of model animals. The chronic NOAELs are 0.5 mg/kg/d (rat, 3 months), 0.3 mg/kg/d (rat, 26 weeks), and 0.1 mg/kg/d (beagle dog, 1 month and 39 weeks). For comparison, the chronic human dose for HIV treatment is 0.05 mg/kg/d, using the reference 3 mg dose and an average Chinese body mass of 59.5 kg (2014). == History == Azvudine was first found in literature in a patent filed by Chang Jun-biao of Zhengzhou University. It received its current name in 2009, when researchers at Roche independently discovered it as a Hep C RNA polymerase inhibitor in vitro. In the following years, Chinese scientists tested it in vitro for a number of targets, most importantly HBV (human and duck) and HTLV-1, two viruses with a reverse transcriptase. It was first proposed as an HIV treatment in 2011, when in vitro tests by the Chang group provided positive results. In 2014, its oral pharmokinetics in rats was elucidated. A phase II study (NCT04109183) was finished in March 2019 by Genuine Biotech. In August 2020, the Chang group found that the substance inhibits vif in vitro. In the same month, China's drug regulator (NMPA) decided to fast-track the approval process, labelling it a first-in-class medication. In July 2021, NMPA granted conditional approval for HIV-1. It was included in the 2021 HIV treatment recommendnation by the Chinese Medical Association and Chinese CDC, published October that year. Curiously, no full results of the trial have been made available for this study in any journal detailing the experiment design as of December 2022. Parts of the results are shown on the drug monograph as well as a 2022 slides deck produced by Genuine for the NHSA available on the latter's website. Azvudine was found to inhibit some coronaviruses in vitro around 2020, leading to an interest in its use in COVID. An open-label pilot study on mild and moderate cases was performed in 2020, with mildly positive results. A phase III trial was performed in 2022 in China. In July 2022, China's drug regulator granted conditional approval for it to be used to treat COVID-19, following a local phase III trial. Initially, no detailed description of the said trial was published in any journals, but state media quoted some numbers from the developer: ""40% clinical improvement in 7 days by FNC group, compared to 11% in control"". It is unclear how such ""improvement"" is defined. Four phase III clinical trials investigated azvudine's efficacy and safety in adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The findings indicate that azvudine may reduce the time to eliminate detectable levels of virus (viral load) and improve symptoms faster than standard treatment. In trials, it was reported to be safe with few side effects. However, some studies produced inconsistent results in terms of symptom improvement and severe illness prevention. Additionally, the studies tended to use a smaller number of participants than other major COVID-19 drug trials. == Society and culture == Genuine owns two different tradenames for this medication: 双新艾克 (literally ""dual new AIDS inhibitor"") for HIV use and 捷倍安 (literally ""fast extra safe"") for COVID use. No generics are available. Geniune holds one patent related to the drug: the original 2007 patent on the entire class of 2'-fluorine-4'-substituted nucleotides, purchased from Zhengzhou University. Two other Chinese patents on synthesizing the drug are found on Google Patents, but the owners do not appear to be connected to Geniune. Roche held one 2002 patent, CNA028118480A (CN1516590A), over the broader class of 4'-substituted nucleotides. The patent was voided in 2019 after Riboscience, its new holder, stopped paying fees. == References == == Further reading == Zhu KW (2023).

It is available as an inhaler, cream, pills, and nasal spray. The inhaled form is used in the long-term management of asthma. The cream may be used for dermatitis and psoriasis. The pills have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. The nasal spray is used to treat allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps. Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Beclomethasone dipropionate was first patented in 1962 and used medically in 1972. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 268th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Side effects == Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Occasionally, it may cause a cough upon inhalation. Deposition on the tongue and throat may promote oral candidiasis, which appears as a white coating, possibly with irritation. This may usually be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after using the inhaler. Other adverse drug reaction side effects may rarely include: a smell similar to burning plastic, unpleasant taste, hoarseness or nasal congestion, pain or headache, and visual changes. Allergic reactions may occur, but rarely. Nasal corticosteroids may be associated with central serous retinopathy. == Pharmacology == Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression). Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. == Names == Beclometasone dipropionate is the INN modified and beclomethasone dipropionate is the USAN and former BAN. It is a prodrug of the free form, beclometasone (INN). The prodrug beclometasone is marketed in Norway and Russia.

It is a potent analog of amiloride, and is marketed as the hydrochloride salt (benzamil hydrochloride). As amiloride, benzamil has been studied as a possible treatment for cystic fibrosis, although with disappointing results. == Structure == Benzamil is a benzyl group-containing analog of amiloride. Like amiloride, it is a guanidinium group-containing pyrazine derivative. == Mechanism of action == Benzamil is closely related to amiloride. By adding the benzyl group to the nitrogen of the guanidinium group the activity is increased several hundredfold. Amiloride works by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) thereby inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys (this mechanism is the same for triamterene). This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium. == References == == External links == Media related to Benzamil at Wikimedia Commons",Benzamil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06196891888976097), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0036123041063547134), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06210799887776375)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzamil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10990635/,https://www.invivochem.com/benzamil.html ', [])"

We hypothesized that enhancing NMDAR function by inhibiting the glycine transporter-1 (GLYT1) would improve neuroplasticity and thereby augment benefits of non-pharmacological cognitive training (CT) strategies. This study examined whether co-administration of a GLYT1 inhibitor and computerized CT would have synergistic effects on CIAS. Stable outpatients with schizophrenia participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject, crossover augmentation study. Participants received placebo or GLYT1 inhibitor (PF-03463275) for two 5-week periods separated by 2 weeks of washout. PF-03463275 doses (40 or 60 mg twice daily) were selected to produce high GLYT1 occupancy. To limit pharmacodynamic variability, only cytochrome P450 2D6 extensive metabolizers were included. Medication adherence was confirmed daily. Participants received 4 weeks of CT in each treatment period. Cognitive performance (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery) and psychotic symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) were assessed in each period. 71 participants were randomized. PF-03463275 in combination with CT was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated at the doses prescribed but did not produce greater improvement in CIAS compared to CT alone. PF-03463275 was not associated with improved CT learning parameters. Participation in CT was associated with improvement in MCCB scores. Glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors may ameliorate cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. The dose-related occupancy and target engagement of the GlyT1 inhibitor PF-03463275 were studied to inform optimal dose selection for a clinical trial for cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia. In substudy 1, the effects of PF-03463275 (10, 20, and 40 mg twice a day) on occupancy of GlyT1 were tested using positron emission tomography and  PF-03463275 at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg twice a day produced ∼44%, 61%, 76%, and 83% GlyT1 occupancy, respectively, in SZs with higher ligand binding to GlyT1 in subcortical versus cortical regions. PF-03463275 did not attenuate any ketamine-induced effects but did improve working memory accuracy in healthy control subjects. PF-03463275 increased long-term potentiation only in SZs with peak effects at 40 mg twice a day (∼75% GlyT1 occupancy) and with a profile suggestive of an inverted U dose response. PF-03463275 was well-tolerated. The dose-related GlyT1 occupancy of PF-03463275 is linear. While PF-03463275 did not show evidence of facilitating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function in the ketamine assay, it enhanced neuroplasticity in SZs. These findings provide support for a clinical trial to test the ability of PF-03463275 to enhance cognitive remediation toward addressing cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.",Pf 03463275,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002146204235032201), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006741044111549854)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu](https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/57925/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=6, title='API | pf-03463275', type='url_citation', url='https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/57925/?utm_source=openai')])"

With respect to acute malaria, it is used together with other medications to prevent relapse by Plasmodium vivax. It may be used to prevent all types of malaria. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Other side effects may include methemoglobinemia, trouble sleeping, and anaphylaxis. In people with G6PD deficiency, red blood cell breakdown may occur. Use in pregnancy is not recommended. Tafenoquine is in the 8-aminoquinoline family of medications. The mechanism of action is unclear but it is effective both in the liver and bloodstream. A possible mechanism of action and other novel perspectives have been published. Tafenoquine was approved for medical use in Australia and in the United States in 2018. Tafenoquine is related to primaquine. == Medical use == === Prevention === Tafenoquine may be used to prevent all types of malaria. For this use 200 mg 3 days before travel then 200 mg per week until one week after travel is recommended. === Treatment === Tafenoquine is used for eliminating the hypnozoite stage of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale that is responsible for relapse of these malarial infections, even when the blood stages are successfully cleared. Primaquine for 14 days can also be used for this. The advantage of tafenoquine is that it has a long half-life (2–3 weeks) and therefore a single treatment is sufficient. For this use, a single dose of 300 mg is recommended. It is used with another medication, such as chloroquine, that kills the parasites in the bloodstream. There is a need to determine whether or not tafenoquine kills the numerous, non-circulating asexual P. vivax parasites that are now known to occur in the spleen, bone marrow, and possibly elsewhere in chronic infections. == Chemistry == Tafenoquine contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers.

In an international, adaptive, open-label, dose-finding, phase 1-2 clinical trial, we evaluated rilzabrutinib therapy in previously treated patients with immune thrombocytopenia. We used intrapatient dose escalation of oral rilzabrutinib over a period of 24 weeks; the lowest starting dose was 200 mg once daily, with higher starting doses of 400 mg once daily, 300 mg twice daily, and 400 mg twice daily. The primary end points were safety and platelet response (defined as at least two consecutive platelet counts of ≥50×10 Sixty patients were enrolled. At baseline, the median platelet count was 15×10 Rilzabrutinib was active and associated with only low-level toxic effects at all dose levels. The dose of 400 mg twice daily was identified as the dose for further testing. Overall, rilzabrutinib showed a rapid and durable clinical activity that improved with length of treatment. (Funded by Sanofi; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03395210; EudraCT number, 2017-004012-19.). Pemphigus is a rare but life-threatening autoimmune disease requiring long-term treatment that minimizes corticosteroid (CS) exposure while providing consistent disease control. The phase 2 pemphigus study of oral, reversible, covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor rilzabrutinib demonstrated rapid and sustained efficacy with well-tolerated safety. Adults (aged 18-80 years) were randomized 1:1 to 400 mg rilzabrutinib (n = 65) or placebo (n = 66) twice daily (with CS ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/d) for 37 weeks in the phase 3 PEGASUS study in moderate-to-severe pemphigus vulgaris/pemphigus foliaceus. The primary endpoint of complete remission from week 29 to week 37 with the amended endpoint CS dose ≤10 mg/d was not significant for 13 of 54 (24%) rilzabrutinib versus 10 of 55 (18%) placebo patients with PV (P = .45). Secondary endpoints showed numerical but nonsignificant improvements with rilzabrutinib (vs placebo) in reduced CS use, prolonged complete remission duration, and faster time to first complete remission. Overall, rilzabrutinib was well-tolerated, with similar adverse events reported in both groups. Using minimal CS dose ≤10 mg/d and excluding remote observations, the primary efficacy endpoint was not met. However, results from a prespecified sensitivity analysis using CS dose ≤5 mg/d, considering all observations, and including all patients support Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibition as a viable therapeutic approach for pemphigus. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease associated with autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production, resulting in thrombocytopenia and a predisposition to bleeding. The ongoing, global phase 1/2 study showed that rilzabrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically developed to treat autoimmune disorders, could be an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for ITP. Clinical activity, durability of response, and safety were evaluated in 16 responding patients who continued rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice daily in the long-term extension (LTE) study. At LTE entry, the median platelet count was 87 × 109/L in all patients, 68 × 109/L in those who had rilzabrutinib monotherapy (n = 5), and 156 × 109/L in patients who received concomitant ITP medication (thrombopoietin-receptor agonists and/or corticosteroids, n = 11). At a median duration of treatment of 478 days (range, 303-764), 11 of 16 patients (69%) continued to receive rilzabrutinib. A platelet count of ≥50 × 109/L was reported in 93% of patients for more than half of their monthly visits. The median percentage of LTE weeks with platelet counts ≥30 × 109/L and ≥50 × 109/L was 100% and 88%, respectively. Five patients discontinued concomitant ITP therapy and maintained median platelet counts of 106 × 109/L at 3 to 6 months after stopping concomitant ITP therapy. Adverse events related to treatment were grade 1 or 2 and transient, with no bleeding, thrombotic, or serious adverse events.

Active epithelial-mesenchymal communication (EMC), and the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts are implicated in the causation of renal fibrosis. Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) is a serine/threonine kinase required for the process of mitosis. Dysregulation of AURKA has been demonstrated in the context of various cancers. However, the role of AURKA in CKD-associated fibrosis has not been elucidated. MK-5108, a potent and highly selective AURKA inhibitor, was shown to exhibit anti-cancer activity in recent preclinical and clinical studies. In the present study, we investigated the role of MK-5108 in renal fibrosis employing animal and cell models. In vivo, AURKA was highly expressed in fibrotic kidneys of CKD patients and in mouse kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Post treatment with MK-5108 at the 3rd day after UUO remarkably alleviated renal fibrosis, possibly by inhibiting the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts and suppressing the phenotypic transition of renal cells. Moreover, the enhanced inflammatory factors in obstructive kidneys were also repressed. In vitro, MK-5108 treatment inhibited the pro-fibrotic response in renal cells induced by transforming growth factor-β1. Finally, overexpression of AURKA in renal fibroblasts promoted fibrotic response, while silencing AURKA showed anti-fibrotic effect, further confirming the pro-fibrotic role of AURKA. In this study, inhibition of AURKA by MK-5108 markedly attenuated renal fibrosis. MK-5108 is a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of renal fibrosis in CKD. Aurora-A kinase is a one of the key regulators during mitosis progression. Aurora-A kinase is a potential target for anticancer therapies because overexpression of Aurora-A, which is frequently observed in some human cancers, results in aberrant mitosis leading to chromosomal instability and possibly tumorigenesis. MK-5108 is a novel small molecule with potent inhibitory activity against Aurora-A kinase. Although most of the Aurora-kinase inhibitors target both Aurora-A and Aurora-B, MK-5108 specifically inhibited Aurora-A kinase in a panel of protein kinase assays. Inhibition of Aurora-A by MK-5108 in cultured cells induced cell cycle arrest at the G(2)-M phase in flow cytometry analysis. The effect was confirmed by the accumulation of cells with expression of phosphorylated Histone H3 and inhibition of Aurora-A autophosphorylation by immunostaining assays. MK-5108 also induced phosphorylated Histone H3 in skin and xenograft tumor tissues in a nude rat xenograft model. MK-5108 inhibited growth of human tumor cell lines in culture and in different xenograft models. Furthermore, the combination of MK-5108 and docetaxel showed enhanced antitumor activities compared with control and docetaxel alone-treated animals without exacerbating the adverse effects of docetaxel. MK-5108 is currently tested in clinical trials and offers a new therapeutic approach to combat human cancers as a single agent or in combination with existing taxane therapies. The process of autophagy and its role in survival of human neuroblastoma cell cultures was studied upon addition of an anti-GD2 ganglioside (GD2) 14G2a mouse monoclonal antibody (14G2a mAb) and an aurora A kinase specific inhibitor, MK-5108. It was recently shown that combination of these agents significantly potentiates cytotoxicity against IMR-32 and CHP-134 neuroblastoma cells in vitro, as compared to the inhibitor used alone. In this study we gained mechanistic insights on autophagy in the observed cytotoxic effects exerted by both agents using cytotoxicity assays, RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and autophagy detection methods. Enhancement of the autophagy process in the 14G2a mAb- and MK-5108-treated IMR-32 cells was documented by assessing autophagic flux. Application of a lysosomotropic agent-chloroquine (CQ) affected the 14G2a mAb- and MK-5108-stimulated autophagic flux. It is our conclusion that the 14G2a mAb (40 μg/ml) and MK-5108 inhibitor (0.1 μM) induce autophagy in IMR-32 cells. Moreover, the combinatorial treatment of IMR-32 cells with the 14G2a mAb and CQ significantly potentiates cytotoxic effect, as compared to CQ used alone. Most importantly, we showed that interfering with autophagy at its early and late step augments the 14G2a mAb-induced apoptosis, therefore we can conclude that inhibition of autophagy is the primary mechanism of the CQ-mediated sensitization to the 14G2a mAb-induced apoptosis. Although, there was no virtual stimulation of autophagy in the 14G2a mAb-treated CHP-134 neuroblastoma cells, we were able to show that PHLDA1 protein positively regulates autophagy and this process exists in a mutually exclusive manner with apoptosis in PHLDA1-silenced CHP-134 cells.",Mk 5108,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004418491385877132), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04861435294151306)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16022412478923798), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20053775/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='MK-5108, a highly selective Aurora-A kinase inhibitor, shows antitumor activity alone and in combination with docetaxel - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20053775/?utm_source=openai')])"

The medication inhibits an essential fungal enzyme, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, that is required for protein synthesis. The inhibition of protein synthesis leads to termination of cell growth and then cell death, eliminating the fungal infection. == Medical uses == Tavaborole is used in the treatment of onychomycosis. In clinical trials, tavaborole was more effective than the vehicle (ethyl acetate and propylene glycol) alone in curing onychomycosis. In two studies, fungal infection was eliminated using tavaborole in 6.5% of the cases vs. 0.5% using the vehicle alone, and 27.5% vs. 14.6% using the vehicle alone. == Side effects == Application site exfoliation, erythema (rash), and irritation are possible side effects, and may occur in less than 5% of individuals. == Pharmacology == Tavaborole acts as an inhibitor of fungal leucyl-tRNA synthetase. === Pharmacokinetics === Tavaborole, when prepared with a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and propylene glycol, has the ability to fully penetrate through the human nail. In studies with cadaver fingernails, a 5% solution of tavaborole penetrated the nail an average of 524.7 mcg/cm2 after two weeks of daily use. Tavaborole is detectable in the blood at a level of 3.54 ng/mL after a single use of 0.2 mL of the 5% solution.

The most common adverse reactions are peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. It is the most common type of lung cancer with up to 90% of all lung carcinomas falling into the non-small cell category. Non-small cell lung cancer occurs when healthy cells become abnormal and grow rapidly. One danger of this form of cancer is that there's a high likelihood that the cancer cells will spread from the lungs to other organs and body parts. Cancer metastasis consists of a sequential series of events, and MET exon 14 skipping is recognized as a critical event for metastasis of carcinomas. Mutations leading to MET exon 14 skipping are found in 3-4% of people with lung cancer. Capmatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020. Capmatinib is the first therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations (those that lead to mesenchymal-epithelial transition or MET exon 14 skipping). == Medical uses == Capmatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping. == Adverse effects == Capmatinib can cause interstitial lung disease (a group of lung conditions that causes scarring of lung tissues), pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung tissue), hepatotoxicity (damage to liver cells), photosensitivity, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Based on a clear positive signal for phototoxicity in early laboratory studies in cells, people may be more sensitive to sunlight and should be advised to take precautions to cover their skin, use sunscreen, and not tan while taking capmatinib. Capmatinib may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. == Pharmacology == The drug inhibits c-Met, a tyrosine kinase that plays a role in embryonic development, organogenesis and wound healing, but also in the development of cancer. == History == Capmatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020, along with the FoundationOne CDx assay as a companion diagnostic for capmatinib. Efficacy was demonstrated in the GEOMETRY mono-1 trial (NCT02414139), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multicohort study enrolling 334 participants with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with confirmed MET exon 14 skipping. Some participants were previously treated for their cancer and some were not (treatment-naïve). Participants received capmatinib 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The efficacy was based on results from 97 of the participants. The trial was conducted at 92 sites in the United States, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Taiwan and the UK. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), which reflects the percentage of participants that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR). The efficacy population included 28 participants who had never undergone treatment for non-small cell lung cancer and 69 previously treated participants. The ORR for the 28 participants was 68%, with 4% having a complete response and 64% having a partial response. The ORR for the 69 participants was 41%, with all having a partial response. Of the responding participants who had never undergone treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, 47% had a duration of response lasting 12 months or longer compared to 32.1% of the responding participants who had been previously treated.

The herd of 120 dairy cows, on an average, was housed in the K 98 cow-house and in a calving house equipped with the traditional technology. The non-selective treatment was performed in 125 dairy cows in the form of single administration of Oxymykoin foam (Galena) (70 cows) and Chronicin foam (Galena) (55 cows) after the last milking in lactation. The treatment of 53 bacteriologically positive cows with Oxymykoin foam had 86.8% therapeutic effectiveness; this indicates the excellent effectiveness of the preparation. Five additional new infections arose in this group of cows treated with Oxymykoin. The treatment of 36 bacteriologically positive cows with Chronicin foam had the effectiveness of 63.9%; in almost 2/5 of the treated cows (13 animals) the bacteria causing mastitis persisted in the post-parturient period. Eight new infections occurred in this group of treated cows. The results of the non-selective antibiotic treatment of dairy cows after the last milking in lactation prove the good effectiveness of the method reducing the percentage of infected cows in the period after calving. The effect of the non-selective treatment of dairy cows with antibiotics (Chronicin foam--Galena, and Masticort PS--Poland) and the effect of teat disinfection (Jodonal A--Lachema) at the last milking in lactation was studied as exerted on the reduction in the occurrence of infection processes in mammary gland after calving. The trials were performed with 180 cows in three groups of 60 animals. At the last milking the mammary secretion of each cow was sampled for bacteriological examination. Two cow groups were treated at the same time. The occurrence of infection processes in the mammary gland in the period after calving can be characterized as follows: a) in the period after calving the control group had an increased proportion of cows with an infection process in their udders (from 58.3% at the end of lactation to 68.3% in the period of 14 days following calving); b) in the group treated with Chronicin foam the infection was reduced by 3/5, i. e. from 71.7% of cows infected at the start of drying off to 28.3% with infection process after calving; c) in the group treated with Masticort PS the infection after calving was reduced by 3/4 as compared with the infection at the onset of drying off, i. e. from 80% to 20%.

We evaluated the effects of chronic CHF5074 treatment on brain Abeta pathology in Tg2576 transgenic mice. Twenty-eight animals of 9.5 to 10.5 months of age received CHF5074-medicated diet (375 ppm) or standard diet for 17 weeks. Compared with controls, CHF5074 treatment significantly reduced the area occupied by plaques and the number of plaques in cortex (-52.2 +/- 5.6%, p = 0.0003 and -48.9 +/- 6.6%, p = 0.0004, respectively) and hippocampus (-76.7 +/- 6.4%, p = 0.004 and -66.2 +/- 10.3%, p = 0.037, respectively). Biochemical analysis confirmed the histopathological measures, with CHF5074-treated animals showing reduced total brain Abeta40 (-49.2 +/- 9.2%, p = 0.017) and Abeta42 (-43.5 +/- 9.7%, p = 0.027) levels. In a human neuroglioma cell line expressing Swedish mutated form of amyloid precursor protein (H4swe), CHF5074 reduced Abeta42 and Abeta40 secretion, with an IC50 of 3.6 and 18.4 microM, respectively, values consistent with those measured in the brain of the CHF5074-treated Tg2576 mice (6.4 +/- 0.4 microM). At 5 microM, no effects were observed on Notch intracellular cleavage in human embryonic kidney 293swe cells. CHF5074 was well tolerated by Tg2576 mice. No abnormal findings were observed upon histopathological examination of the gastrointestinal tract, indicating the absence of COX-related toxicity. Semiquantitative histochemical evaluation of goblet cells in the ileum of vehicle- and CHF5074-treated animals yielded similar results, suggesting no effects on Notch pathway. CHF5074 is therefore a promising therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. The drug discovery for disease-modifying agents in Alzheimer disease (AD) is facing a failure of clinical trials with drugs based on two driving hypotheses, i.e. the cholinergic and amyloidogenic hypotheses. In this article we recapitulate the main aspects of AD pathology, focusing on possible mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and inflammation. We then present the pharmacological and neurobiological profile of a novel compound (CHF5074) showing both anti-inflammatory and gamma-secretase modulatory activities, discussing the possible time-window for effective treatment in an AD transgenic mouse model. Finally, the concept of cognitive reserve is introduced as possible target for preventive therapies. CHF5074 has been shown to inhibit brain β-amyloid deposition and attenuate memory deficits in different transgenic mice models of Alzheimer disease. We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 3 ascending dose regimens of CHF5074 (200, 400, and 600 mg/d for 14 d) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study involving 48 healthy subjects. Plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected for measuring drug and main metabolite concentrations and potential biomarkers of pharmacodynamic activity (β-amyloid1-40, β-amyloid1-42, soluble CD40 ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-α). All subjects completed the study, and no serious or severe adverse events were reported. The maximum tolerated dose was close to 600 mg/d with mild diarrhea being the most frequent adverse event at this dose. CHF5074 reached peak plasma levels 2 to 3 hours after drug administration and then was slowly eliminated (t(1/2z)=30 h) in the urine as glucoronide. Systemic exposure to the drug appeared to be dose-proportional with a 2-fold accumulation ratio at steady state. Metabolite plasma levels peaked at 4 to 5 hours and accounted for about 25% of the parent compound. Drug levels in the CSF were dose-proportional. The drug dose-dependently lowered the levels of the soluble CD40 ligand, a marker of microglia activation, in both plasma and CSF samples.","Cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 1-(3',4'-dichloro-2-fluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl)-",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012675831094384193), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011075330898165703)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0250073?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=6, title=""Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for 1-(3',4'-Dichloro-2-fluoro(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (HMDB0250073)"", type='url_citation', url='https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0250073?utm_source=openai')])"

It is typically used together with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical removal of the testicles to treat metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To a lesser extent, it is used at high doses for locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) as a monotherapy without castration. Bicalutamide was also previously used as monotherapy to treat localized prostate cancer (LPC), but authorization for this use was withdrawn following unfavorable trial findings. Besides prostate cancer, bicalutamide is limitedly used in the treatment of excessive hair growth and scalp hair loss in women, as a puberty blocker and component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender girls and women, to treat gonadotropin-independent early puberty in boys, and to prevent overly long-lasting erections in men. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of bicalutamide in men include breast growth, breast tenderness, and hot flashes. Other side effects in men include feminization and sexual dysfunction. Some side effects like breast changes and feminization are minimal when combined with castration. While the medication appears to produce few side effects in women, its use in women is not explicitly approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at this time. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase the likelihood of death from causes other than prostate cancer. Bicalutamide produces abnormal liver changes necessitating discontinuation in around 1% of people. Rarely, it has been associated with cases of serious liver damage, serious lung toxicity, and sensitivity to light. Although the risk of adverse liver changes is small, monitoring of liver function is recommended during treatment. Bicalutamide is a member of the nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) group of medications. It works by selectively blocking the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It does not lower androgen levels. The medication can have some estrogen-like effects in men when used as a monotherapy due to increased estradiol levels. Bicalutamide is well-absorbed, and its absorption is not affected by food. The elimination half-life of the medication is around one week. It shows peripheral selectivity in animals, but crosses the blood–brain barrier and affects both the body and brain in humans. Bicalutamide was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bicalutamide is available as a generic medication. The drug is sold in more than 80 countries, including most developed countries. It was at one time the most widely used antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer, with millions of men with the disease having been prescribed it. Although bicalutamide is also used for other indications besides prostate cancer, the vast majority of prescriptions appear to be for treatment of prostate cancer. == Medical uses == Bicalutamide is approved for and mainly used in the following indications: Metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) in men in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical castration at 50 mg/day Locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) in men as a monotherapy at 150 mg/day (not approved for this use in the United States) In Japan, bicalutamide is uniquely used at a dosage of 80 mg/day both in combination with castration and as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide is also employed for the following off-label (non-approved) indications: To reduce the effects of the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men Androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, excessive hair growth, and scalp hair loss in women as well as high testosterone levels due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women, at 25 to 50 mg/day generally in combination with a birth control pill Feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women in combination with an estrogen usually at 50 mg/day Peripheral precocious puberty in boys at 12.5 to 100 mg/day in combination with an aromatase inhibitor like anastrozole, especially for familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis) Overly long-lasting erections in men at 50 mg per week to 50 mg every other day The medication has been suggested for but has uncertain effectiveness in the following indication: Hypersexuality and paraphilias, particularly in combination with chemical castration For more information on these uses, see the medical uses of bicalutamide article. === Available forms === Bicalutamide is available for the treatment of prostate cancer in most developed countries, including over 80 countries worldwide. It is available in 50 mg, 80 mg (in Japan), and 150 mg tablets for oral administration. The drug is registered for use as a 150 mg/day monotherapy for the treatment of LAPC in at least 55 countries, with the U.S. being a notable exception where it is registered only for use at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with castration. No other formulations or routes of administration are available or used. All formulations of bicalutamide are specifically indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer alone or in combination with surgical or medication castration. Due to the low water solubility of bicalutamide, bicalutamide in oral bicalutamide tablets is micronized to ensure small and consistent particle sizes and optimize oral bioavailability. A combined formulation of bicalutamide and the GnRH agonist goserelin in which goserelin is provided as a subcutaneous implant for injection and bicalutamide is included as 50 mg tablets for oral ingestion is marketed in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos CP (Zoladex–Cosudex Combination Pack). == Contraindications == Bicalutamide is pregnancy category X, or ""contraindicated in pregnancy"", in the U.S., and pregnancy category D, the second most restricted rating, in Australia. As such, it is contraindicated in women during pregnancy, and women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant are strongly recommended to take bicalutamide only in combination with adequate contraception. It is unknown whether bicalutamide is excreted in breast milk, but many drugs are excreted in breast milk, and for this reason, bicalutamide treatment is similarly not recommended while breastfeeding. In individuals with severe, though not mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, there is evidence that the elimination of bicalutamide is slowed, and hence, caution may be warranted in these patients as circulating levels of bicalutamide may be increased. In severe hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of the active (R)-enantiomer of bicalutamide is increased by about 1.75-fold (76% increase; elimination half-life of 5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively). The elimination half-life of bicalutamide is unchanged in renal impairment. == Side effects == The side effect profile of bicalutamide is highly dependent on sex; that is, on whether the person is male or female. In men, due to androgen deprivation, a variety of side effects of varying severity may occur during bicalutamide treatment, with breast pain/tenderness and gynecomastia (breast development/enlargement) being the most common. Gynecomastia occurs in up to 80% of men treated with bicalutamide monotherapy, and is of mild-to-moderate severity in more than 90% of affected men. In addition to breast changes, physical feminization and demasculinization in general, including reduced body hair growth, decreased muscle mass and strength, feminine changes in fat mass and distribution, reduced penile length, and decreased semen/ejaculate volume, may occur in men. Other side effects that have been observed in men and that are similarly related to androgen deprivation include hot flashes, sexual dysfunction (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction), depression, fatigue, weakness, and anemia. However, most men have preserved sexual function with bicalutamide monotherapy. In females, due to the minimal biological importance of androgens in this sex, the side effects of pure antiandrogens or NSAAs are few, and bicalutamide has been found to be very well tolerated. However, bicalutamide has been found to increase levels of total and LDL cholesterol in women. The non-pharmacological side-effect profile of bicalutamide (i.e., side effects not related to its antiandrogenic activity) is said to be similar to that with placebo. In any case, general side effects of bicalutamide that might occur in either sex include diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, dry skin, itching, and rash. The drug is well-tolerated at higher dosages than 50 mg/day, up to 600 mg/day, with rare additional side effects. Bicalutamide has been associated with abnormal liver function tests such as elevated liver enzymes. In the Early Prostate Cancer (EPC) clinical programme of bicalutamide for LPC and LAPC, the rate of abnormal liver function tests with bicalutamide monotherapy was 3.4% relative to 1.9% for placebo. However, higher rates, up to 11%, have been seen in other studies. Hepatic changes that have necessitated discontinuation of bicalutamide, such as marked increases in liver enzymes or hepatitis, have occurred in 0.3 to 1.5% of men in clinical trials, or approximately 1% overall. Elevated liver enzymes with bicalutamide usually occur within the first 3 to 6 months of treatment. Monitoring of liver function during treatment is recommended, particularly in the first few months. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase non-prostate cancer mortality. The reasons for the increase in mortality with bicalutamide in these men are unknown, but possible factors could include androgen deprivation or drug-related toxicity of bicalutamide. There are 10 published case reports of liver toxicity associated with bicalutamide as of 2022. Death occurred in 2 of these cases. Hundreds of additional cases of liver complications in people taking bicalutamide exist in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. In all of the published case reports of liver toxicity with bicalutamide, the onset of symptoms was within the first 6 months of treatment. Symptoms that may indicate liver dysfunction include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, ""flu-like"" symptoms, dark urine, and jaundice. There are also published case reports of interstitial pneumonitis and eosinophilic lung disease associated with bicalutamide. along with hundreds of additional instances in the FAERS database as well. Interstitial pneumonitis can potentially progress to pulmonary fibrosis and may be fatal. Symptoms that may indicate lung dysfunction include dyspnea (difficult breathing or shortness of breath), cough, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in sore throat). The exact incidence of liver toxicity and interstitial pneumonitis with bicalutamide are unknown, but both are said to be very rare events. A few cases of photosensitivity have been reported with bicalutamide. Hypersensitivity reactions (drug allergy) like angioedema and hives have also uncommonly been reported in association with bicalutamide. Because it is an antiandrogen, bicalutamide has a theoretical risk of birth defects like ambiguous genitalia in male fetuses. Due to its teratogenic capacity, contraception should be used in women taking bicalutamide who are fertile and sexually active. === Comparison === The side effect profile of bicalutamide in men and women differs from that of other antiandrogens and is considered favorable in comparison. Relative to GnRH analogues and the steroidal antiandrogen (SAA) cyproterone acetate (CPA), bicalutamide monotherapy has a much lower incidence and severity of hot flashes and sexual dysfunction. In addition, unlike GnRH analogues and CPA, bicalutamide monotherapy is not associated with decreased bone mineral density or osteoporosis. Conversely, bicalutamide monotherapy is associated with much higher rates of breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and feminization in men than GnRH analogues and CPA. However, gynecomastia with bicalutamide is rarely severe and discontinuation rates due to this side effect are fairly low. These differences in side effects between bicalutamide monotherapy, GnRH analogues, and CPA are attributed to the fact that whereas GnRH analogues and CPA suppress estrogen production, bicalutamide monotherapy does not lower estrogen levels and in fact actually increases them. Bicalutamide does not share the risk of neuropsychiatric side effects like fatigue as well as cardiovascular side effects like coagulation changes, blood clots, fluid retention, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and adverse serum lipid changes that CPA has been associated with. It has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity than flutamide and CPA and of interstitial pneumonitis than nilutamide. The drug also does not share the unique risks of diarrhea with flutamide and nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and alcohol intolerance with nilutamide. Unlike enzalutamide, bicalutamide is not associated with seizures or related central side effects like anxiety and insomnia. However, although the risk of adverse liver changes with bicalutamide is low, enzalutamide differs from bicalutamide in having no known risk of elevated liver enzymes or hepatotoxicity. In contrast to the SAA spironolactone, bicalutamide does not have antimineralocorticoid effects, and hence is not associated with hyperkalemia, urinary frequency, dehydration, hypotension, or other related side effects. In women, unlike CPA and spironolactone, bicalutamide does not produce menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea and does not interfere with ovulation or fertility. == Overdose == A single oral dose of bicalutamide in humans that results in symptoms of overdose or that is considered to be life-threatening has not been established. Dosages of up to 600 mg/day have been well tolerated in clinical trials, and it is notable that there is a saturation of absorption with bicalutamide such that circulating levels of its active (R)-enantiomer do not further increase above a dosage of 300 mg/day. Overdose is considered unlikely to be life-threatening with bicalutamide or other first-generation NSAAs (i.e., flutamide and nilutamide). A massive overdose of nilutamide (13 grams, or 43 times the normal maximum 300 mg/day clinical dosage) in a 79-year-old man was uneventful, producing no clinical signs, symptoms, or toxicity. There is no specific antidote for bicalutamide or NSAA overdose, and treatment should be based on symptoms, if any are present. == Interactions == Bicalutamide is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4. As such, its levels in the body may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4. (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see here.) However, in spite of the fact bicalutamide is metabolized by CYP3A4, there is no evidence of clinically significant drug interactions when bicalutamide at a dosage of 150 mg/day or less is co-administered with drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. In-vitro studies suggest that bicalutamide may be able to inhibit CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Conversely, animal studies suggest that bicalutamide may induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In a clinical study, bicalutamide co-administered with the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam caused only a small and statistically non-significant increase in midazolam levels (+27%) presumably due to CYP3A4 inhibition. However, this was well below increases in midazolam exposure with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole (+1500%), itraconazole (+1000%), and erythromycin (+350%), and is considered to not be clinically important. There is no indication of clinically significant enzyme inhibition or induction with bicalutamide at doses of 150 mg/day or below. Because bicalutamide circulates at relatively high concentrations and is highly protein-bound, it has the potential to displace other highly protein-bound drugs like warfarin, phenytoin, theophylline, and aspirin from plasma binding proteins. This could, in turn, result in increased free concentrations of such drugs and increased effects and/or side effects, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments. Bicalutamide has specifically been found to displace coumarin anticoagulants like warfarin from their plasma binding proteins (namely albumin) in vitro, potentially resulting in an increased anticoagulant effect. This is supported by reports of prolonged prothrombin time and internal bleeding after the introduction of bicalutamide in patients previously stable on coumarin anticoagulants. Close monitoring of prothrombin time and dosage adjustment as necessary is recommended when bicalutamide is used in combination with these drugs. However, in spite of this, no conclusive evidence of an interaction between bicalutamide and other drugs was found in clinical trials of nearly 3,000 patients. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Bicalutamide acts as a highly selective competitive silent antagonist of the AR (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 159–243 nM), the major biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and DHTTooltip dihydrotestosterone, and hence is an antiandrogen. The activity of bicalutamide lies in the (R)-isomer. Due to its selectivity for the AR, bicalutamide does not interact importantly with other steroid hormone receptors and hence has no clinically relevant off-target hormonal activity (e.g., progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, antimineralocorticoid). However, it has been reported that bicalutamide has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), where it is an antagonist, and hence it could have some antiprogestogenic activity. Bicalutamide does not inhibit 5α-reductase nor is known to inhibit other enzymes involved in androgen steroidogenesis (e.g., CYP17A1). Although it does not bind to the estrogen receptors (ERs), bicalutamide can increase estrogen levels secondarily to AR blockade when used as a monotherapy in males, and hence can have some indirect estrogenic effects in males. Bicalutamide neither suppresses nor inhibits androgen production in the body (i.e., it does not act as an antigonadotropin or androgen steroidogenesis inhibitor or lower androgen levels) and hence exclusively mediates its antiandrogenic effects by antagonizing the AR. In addition to the classical nuclear AR, bicalutamide has been assessed at the membrane androgen receptors (mARs) and found to act as a potent antagonist of ZIP9 (IC50 = 66.3 nM), whereas it does not appear to interact with GPRC6A. The affinity of bicalutamide for the AR is relatively low as it is approximately 30 to 100 times lower than that of DHT, which is 2.5- to 10-fold as potent as an AR agonist as testosterone in bioassays and is the main endogenous ligand of the receptor in the prostate gland. However, typical clinical dosages of bicalutamide result in circulating levels of the drug that are thousands of times higher than those of testosterone and DHT, allowing it to powerfully prevent them from binding to and activating the receptor. This is especially true in the case of surgical or medical castration, in which testosterone levels in the circulation are approximately 95% reduced and DHT levels in the prostate gland are about 50 to 60% reduced. In women, levels of testosterone are substantially lower (20- to 40-fold) than in men, so much smaller doses of bicalutamide (e.g., 25 mg/day in the hirsutism studies) are necessary. Blockade of the AR by bicalutamide in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus results in prevention of the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) in males and consequent disinhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This, in turn, results in an increase in circulating LH levels and activation of the gonadal production of testosterone and by extension production of estradiol. Levels of testosterone have been found to increase 1.5- to 2-fold (59–97% increase) and levels of estradiol about 1.5- to 2.5-fold (65–146% increase) in men treated with 150 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy. In addition to testosterone and estradiol, there are smaller increases in concentrations of DHT, sex hormone-binding globulin, and prolactin. Estradiol levels with bicalutamide monotherapy are similar to those in the low-normal premenopausal female range while testosterone levels generally remain in the high end of the normal male range. Testosterone concentrations do not typically exceed the normal male range due to negative feedback on the HPG axis by the increased concentrations of estradiol. Bicalutamide influences the HPG axis and increases hormone levels only in men and not also in women. This is due to the much lower levels of androgens in women and their lack of basal suppression of the HPG axis in this sex. As evidenced by its effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent conditions, the antiandrogenic actions of bicalutamide considerably exceed any impact of the increased levels of testosterone it results in. However, the elevated levels of estradiol remain unopposed by bicalutamide and are responsible for the gynecomastia and feminizing side effects it causes in men. Although bicalutamide monotherapy increases gonadotropin and sex hormone levels in men, this will not occur if bicalutamide is combined with an antigonadotropin such as a GnRH analogue, estrogen, or progestogen, as these medications maintain negative feedback on the HPG axis. NSAA monotherapy, including with bicalutamide, shows a number of tolerability differences from methods of androgen deprivation therapy that incorporate surgical or medical castration. For example, the rates of hot flashes, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction are all much higher with GnRH analogues than with NSAA monotherapy. It is thought that this is because GnRH analogues suppress estrogen production in addition to androgen production, resulting in estrogen deficiency. In contrast, NSAA monotherapy does not decrease estrogen levels and in fact increases them, resulting in an excess of estrogens that compensates for androgen deficiency and allows for a preservation of mood, energy, and sexual function. Neurosteroids that are produced from testosterone like 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are ERβTooltip estrogen receptor beta agonists and the former a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, may also be involved. In the specific case of sexual dysfunction, an additional possibility for the difference is that without concomitant suppression of androgen production, blockade of the AR by the bicalutamide in the brain is incomplete and insufficient to markedly influence sexual function. Under normal circumstances, bicalutamide has no capacity to activate the AR. However, in prostate cancer, mutations and overexpression of the AR can accumulate in prostate gland cells which can convert bicalutamide from an antagonist of the AR into an agonist. This can result in paradoxical stimulation of prostate cancer growth with bicalutamide and is responsible for the phenomenon of the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome, where antiandrogen discontinuation paradoxically slows the rate of prostate cancer growth. In transgender women, breast development is a desired effect of antiandrogen or estrogen treatment. Breast development and gynecomastia induced by bicalutamide is thought to be mediated by increased activation of the ER secondary to blockade of the AR (resulting in disinhibition of the ER in breast tissue) and increased levels of estradiol. In addition to fat deposition, connective tissue growth, and ductal development, bicalutamide has been found to produce moderate lobuloalveolar development of the breasts. However, full lobuloalveolar maturation necessary for lactation and breastfeeding will not occur without progestogen treatment. Bicalutamide monotherapy seems to have minimal effect on testicular spermatogenesis, testicular ultrastructure, and certain aspects of male fertility. This seems to be because testosterone levels in the testes (where ~95% of testosterone in males is produced) are extremely high (up to 200-fold higher than circulating levels) and only a small fraction (less than 10%) of the normal levels of testosterone in the testes are actually necessary to maintain spermatogenesis. As a result, bicalutamide appears to not be able to compete with testosterone in this sole part of the body to an extent sufficient to considerably interfere with androgen signaling and function. However, while bicalutamide does not seem to be able to adversely influence testicular spermatogenesis, it may interfere with AR-dependent sperm maturation and transport outside of the testes in the epididymides and vas deferens where androgen levels are far lower, and hence may still be able to impair male fertility. In addition, the combination of bicalutamide with other medications, such as estrogens, progestogens, and GnRH analogues, can compromise spermatogenesis due to their own adverse effects on male fertility. These medications are able to strongly suppress gonadal androgen production, which can severely impair or abolish testicular spermatogenesis, and estrogens also appear to have direct and potentially long-lasting cytotoxic effects in the testes at sufficiently high concentrations. ==== Other activities ==== Bicalutamide has been found to act as an inhibitor or inducer of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 in preclinical research, but no evidence of this has been found in humans treated with up to 150 mg/day. It has also been identified in vitro as a strong inhibitor of CYP27A1 (cholesterol 27-hydroxylase) and as an inhibitor of CYP46A1 (cholesterol 24-hydroxylase), but this has yet to be assessed or confirmed in vivo or in humans and the clinical significance remains unknown. Bicalutamide has been found to be a P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) inhibitor. Like other first-generation NSAAs and enzalutamide, it has been found to act as a weak non-competitive inhibitor of GABAA receptor-mediated currents in vitro (IC50 = 5.2 μM). However, unlike enzalutamide, bicalutamide has not been found to be associated with seizures or other related adverse central effects, so the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. === Pharmacokinetics === Though its absolute bioavailability in humans is unknown, bicalutamide is known to be extensively and well-absorbed. Its absorption is not affected by food. The absorption of bicalutamide is linear at doses up to 150 mg/day and is saturable at doses above this, with no further increases in steady-state levels of bicalutamide occurring at doses above 300 mg/day. Whereas absorption of (R)-bicalutamide is slow, with levels peaking at 31 to 39 hours after a dose, (S)-bicalutamide is much more rapidly absorbed. Steady-state concentrations of the drug are reached after 4 to 12 weeks of treatment independently of dosage, with a 10- to 20-fold progressive accumulation in levels of (R)-bicalutamide. The long time to steady-state levels is the result of bicalutamide's very long elimination half-life. There is wide interindividual variability in (R)-bicalutamide levels (up to 16-fold) with bicalutamide regardless of dosage. The tissue distribution of bicalutamide is not well-characterized. The amount of bicalutamide in semen that could potentially be transferred to a female partner during sexual intercourse is low and is not thought to be important. Based on animal studies with rats and dogs it was thought that bicalutamide could not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence could not enter the brain. As such, it was initially thought to be a peripherally selective antiandrogen. However, subsequent clinical studies found that this was not also the case for humans, indicating species differences; bicalutamide crosses into the human brain and, in accordance, produces effects and side effects consistent with central antiandrogenic action. In any case, there is indication that bicalutamide might have at least some peripheral selectivity in humans. Bicalutamide is highly plasma protein bound (96.1% for racemic bicalutamide, 99.6% for (R)-bicalutamide) and is bound mainly to albumin, with negligible binding to SHBG and corticosteroid-binding globulin. Bicalutamide is metabolized in the liver. (R)-Bicalutamide is metabolized slowly and almost exclusively via hydroxylation by CYP3A4 into (R)-hydroxybicalutamide. This metabolite is then glucuronidated by UGT1A9. In contrast to (R)-bicalutamide, (S)-bicalutamide is metabolized rapidly and mainly by glucuronidation (without hydroxylation). None of the metabolites of bicalutamide are known to be active and levels of the metabolites are low in plasma, where unchanged biclautamide predominates. Due to the stereoselective metabolism of bicalutamide, (R)-bicalutamide has a far longer terminal half-life than (S)-bicalutamide and its levels are about 10- to 20-fold higher in comparison following a single dose and 100-fold higher at steady-state. (R)-Bicalutamide has a relatively long elimination half-life of 5.8 days with a single dose and 7 to 10 days following repeated administration. Bicalutamide is eliminated in similar proportions in feces (43%) and urine (34%), while its metabolites are eliminated roughly equally in urine and bile. The drug is excreted to a substantial extent in unmetabolized form, and both bicalutamide and its metabolites are eliminated mainly as glucuronide conjugates. The glucuronide conjugates of bicalutamide and its metabolites are eliminated from the circulation rapidly, unlike unconjugated bicalutamide. The pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide are not affected by consumption of food, a person's age or body weight, renal impairment, or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, steady-state levels of bicalutamide are higher in Japanese individuals than in white people. == Chemistry == Bicalutamide is a racemic mixture consisting of equal proportions of enantiomers (R)-bicalutamide (dextrorotatory) and (S)-bicalutamide (levorotatory). Its systematic name (IUPAC) is (RS)-N-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide. The compound has a chemical formula of C18H14F4N2O4S, a molecular weight of 430.373 g/mol, and is a fine white to off-white powder. The acid dissociation constant (pKa') of bicalutamide is approximately 12. It is a highly lipophilic compound (log P = 2.92). At 37 °C (98.6 °F), or normal human body temperature, bicalutamide is practically insoluble in water (4.6 mg/L), acid (4.6 mg/L at pH 1), and alkali (3.7 mg/L at pH 8). In organic solvents, it is slightly soluble in chloroform and absolute ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, and freely soluble in acetone and tetrahydrofuran. Bicalutamide is a synthetic and nonsteroidal compound which was derived from flutamide. It is a bicyclic compound (has two rings) and can be classified as and has variously been referred to as an anilide (N-phenylamide) or aniline, a diarylpropionamide, and a toluidide. === Analogues === First-generation NSAAs including bicalutamide, flutamide, and nilutamide are all synthetic, nonsteroidal anilide derivatives and structural analogues of each other. Bicalutamide is a diarylpropionamide while flutamide is a monoarylpropionamide and nilutamide is a hydantoin. Bicalutamide and flutamide, though not nilutamide, can also be classified as toluidides. All three of the compounds share a common 3-trifluoromethylaniline moiety. Bicalutamide is a modification of flutamide in which a 4-fluorophenylsulfonyl moiety has been added and the nitro group on the original phenyl ring has been replaced with a cyano group. Topilutamide, also known as fluridil, is another NSAA that is closely related structurally to the first-generation NSAAs, but, in contrast to them, is not used in the treatment of prostate cancer and is instead used exclusively as a topical antiandrogen in the treatment of pattern hair loss. The second-generation NSAAs enzalutamide and apalutamide were derived from and are analogues of the first-generation NSAAs, while another second-generation NSAA, darolutamide, is said to be structurally distinct and chemically unrelated to the other NSAAs. Enzalutamide is a modification of bicalutamide in which the inter-ring linking chain has been altered and cyclized into a 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxo imidazolidine moiety. In apalutamide, the 5,5-dimethyl groups of the imidazolidine ring of enzalutamide are cyclized to form an accessory cyclobutane ring and one of its phenyl rings is replaced with a pyridine ring. The first nonsteroidal androgens, the arylpropionamides, were discovered via structural modification of bicalutamide. Unlike bicalutamide (which is purely antiandrogenic), these compounds show tissue-selective androgenic effects and were classified as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Lead SARMs of this series included acetothiolutamide, enobosarm (ostarine; S-22), and andarine (acetamidoxolutamide or androxolutamide; S-4). They are very close to bicalutamide structurally, with the key differences being that the linker sulfone of bicalutamide has been replaced with an ether or thioether group to confer agonism of the AR and the 4-fluoro atom of the pertinent phenyl ring has been substituted with an acetamido or cyano group to eliminate reactivity at the position. A few radiolabeled derivatives of bicalutamide have been developed for potential use as radiotracers in medical imaging. They include [18F]bicalutamide, 4-[76Br]bromobicalutamide, and [76Br]bromo-thiobicalutamide. The latter two were found to have substantially increased affinity for the AR relative to that of bicautamide. However, none of these agents have been evaluated in humans. 5N-Bicalutamide, or 5-azabicalutamide, is a minor structural modification of bicalutamide which acts as a reversible covalent antagonist of the AR and has approximately 150-fold higher affinity for the AR and about 20-fold greater functional inhibition of the AR relative to bicalutamide. It is among the most potent AR antagonists to have been developed and is being researched for potential use in the treatment of antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer. === Synthesis === A number of chemical syntheses of bicalutamide have been published in the literature. The procedure of the first published synthesis of bicalutamide can be seen below. == History == Bicalutamide as well as all of the other currently marketed NSAAs were derived from structural modification of flutamide, which itself was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent in 1967 at Schering Plough Corporation and was subsequently and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogenic activity. Bicalutamide was discovered by Tucker and colleagues at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in the 1980s and was selected for development from a group of over 2,000 synthesized compounds. It was first patented in 1982 and was first reported in the scientific literature in June 1987. Bicalutamide was first studied in a phase I clinical trial in 1987 and the results of the first phase II clinical trial in prostate cancer were published in 1990. The pharmaceutical division of ICI was split out into an independent company called Zeneca in 1993, and in April and May 1995, Zeneca (now AstraZeneca, after merging with Astra AB in 1999) began pre-approval marketing of bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer in the U.S.. It was first launched in the U.K.Tooltip United Kingdom in May 1995, and was subsequently approved by the U.S. FDA on 4 October 1995, for the treatment of prostate cancer at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with a GnRH analogue. Following its introduction for use in combination with a GnRH analogue, bicalutamide was developed as a monotherapy at a dosage of 150 mg/day for the treatment of prostate cancer, and was approved for this indication in Europe, Canada, and a number of other countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This application of bicalutamide was also under review by the FDA in the U.S. in 2002, but ultimately was not approved in this country. In Japan, bicalutamide is licensed at a dosage of 80 mg/day alone or in combination with a GnRH analogue for prostate cancer. The unique 80 mg dosage of bicalutamide used in Japan was selected for development in this country on the basis of observed pharmacokinetic differences with bicalutamide in Japanese men. Subsequent to negative findings of bicalutamide monotherapy for LPC in the EPC clinical programme, approval of bicalutamide for use specifically in the treatment of LPC was withdrawn in a number of countries including the U.K. (in October or November 2003) and several other European countries and Canada (in August 2003). In addition, the U.S. and Canada explicitly recommended against the use of 150 mg/day bicalutamide for this indication. The drug is effective for, remains approved for, and continues to be used in the treatment of LAPC and mPC, on the other hand. The patent protection of bicalutamide expired in the U.S. in March 2009 and the drug has subsequently been available as a generic, at greatly reduced cost. Bicalutamide was the fourth antiandrogen (and the third NSAA) to be introduced for the treatment of prostate cancer, following the SAA CPA in 1973 and the NSAAs flutamide in 1983 (1989 in the U.S.) and nilutamide in 1989 (1996 in the U.S.). It has been followed by abiraterone acetate in 2011, enzalutamide in 2012, apalutamide in 2018, and darolutamide in 2019, and may also be followed by in-development drugs such as proxalutamide and seviteronel. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Bicalutamide is the generic name of the drug in English and French and its INNTooltip INN, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, AANTooltip Australian Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is also referred to as bicalutamidum in Latin, bicalutamida in Spanish and Portuguese, bicalutamid in German, and bikalutamid in Russian and other Slavic languages. The ""bica-"" prefix corresponds to the fact that bicalutamide is a bicyclic compound, while the ""-lutamide"" suffix is the standard suffix for NSAAs. Bicalutamide is also known by its former developmental code name ICI-176,334. === Brand names === Bicalutamide is marketed by AstraZeneca in oral tablet form under the brand names Casodex, Cosudex, Calutide, Calumid, and Kalumid in many countries. It is also marketed under the brand names Bicadex, Bical, Bicalox, Bicamide, Bicatlon, Bicusan, Binabic, Bypro, Calutol, and Ormandyl among others in various countries. The drug is sold under a large number of generic trade names such as Apo-Bicalutamide, Bicalutamide Accord, Bicalutamide Actavis, Bicalutamide Bluefish, Bicalutamide Kabi, Bicalutamide Sandoz, and Bicalutamide Teva as well. A combination formulation of bicalutamide and goserelin is marketed by AstraZeneca in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos-CP. === Cost and generics === Bicalutamide is off-patent and available as a generic. Unlike bicalutamide, the newer NSAA enzalutamide is still on-patent, and for this reason, is considerably more expensive in comparison. The patent protection of all three of the first-generation NSAAs has expired and flutamide and bicalutamide are both available as low-cost generics. Nilutamide, on the other hand, has always been a poor third competitor to flutamide and bicalutamide and, in relation to this fact, has not been developed as a generic and is only available as brand name Nilandron, at least in the U.S. Bicalutamide is considerably less costly than GnRH analogues, which, in spite of some having been off-patent many years, have been reported (in 2013) to typically cost US$10,000–$15,000 per year (or about US$1,000 per month) of treatment. === Sales and usage === Sales of bicalutamide (as Casodex) worldwide peaked at US$1.3 billion in 2007, and it has been described as a ""billion-dollar-a-year"" drug prior to losing its patent protection starting in 2007. In 2014, despite the introduction of abiraterone acetate in 2011 and enzalutamide in 2012, bicalutamide was still the most commonly prescribed drug in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Moreover, in spite of being off-patent, bicalutamide was said to still generate a few hundred million dollars in sales per year for AstraZeneca. Total worldwide sales of brand name Casodex were approximately US$13.4 billion as of the end of 2018. Between January 2007 and December 2009 (a period of three years), 1,232,143 prescriptions of bicalutamide were dispensed in the U.S., or about 400,000 prescriptions per year. During that time, bicalutamide accounted for about 87.2% of the NSAA market, while flutamide accounted for 10.5% of it and nilutamide for 2.3% of it. Approximately 96% of bicalutamide prescriptions were written for diagnosis codes that clearly indicated neoplasm. About 1,200, or 0.1% of bicalutamide prescriptions were dispensed to pediatric patients (age 0–16). === Regulation === Bicalutamide is a prescription drug. It is not specifically a controlled substance in any country and therefore is not an illegal drug. However, the manufacture, sale, distribution, and possession of prescription drugs are all still subject to legal regulation throughout the world. == Research == Bicalutamide has been studied in combination with the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride in prostate cancer. It has also been studied in combination with raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), for the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide has been tested for the treatment of AR-positive ER/PR-negative locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer in women in a phase II study for this indication. Enzalutamide is also being investigated for this type of cancer. Bicalutamide has also been studied in a phase II clinical trial for ovarian cancer in women. Bicalutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a 24-week trial of 15 patients at a dosage of 50 mg/day. Prostate volume decreased by 26% in patients taking bicalutamide and urinary irritative symptom scores significantly decreased. Conversely, peak urine flow rates and urine pressure flow examinations were not significantly different between bicalutamide and placebo. The decrease in prostate volume achieved with bicalutamide was comparable to that observed with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride, which is approved for the treatment of BPH. Breast tenderness (93%), gynecomastia (54%), and sexual dysfunction (60%) were all reported as side effects of bicalutamide at the dosage used in the study, although no treatment discontinuations due to adverse effects occurred and sexual functioning was maintained in 75% of patients. A phase III clinical trial of bicalutamide in combination with an ethinylestradiol-containing combined oral contraceptive for the treatment of severe hirsutism in women with PCOS was completed in Italy in 2017 under supervision of the Italian Agency for Drugs (AIFA). Antiandrogens have been suggested for treating COVID-19 in men and as of May 2020 high-dose bicalutamide is in a phase II clinical trial for this purpose. == Veterinary use == Bicalutamide may be used to treat hyperandrogenism and associated benign prostatic hyperplasia secondary to hyperadrenocorticism (caused by excessive adrenal androgens) in male ferrets. However, it has not been formally assessed in controlled studies for this purpose. == See also == Comparison of bicalutamide with other antiandrogens == References == == Further reading ==",R-bicalutamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.539125671319198e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00408101687207818)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009114635176956654), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicalutamide,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01128 ', [])"

It is typically used together with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical removal of the testicles to treat metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). To a lesser extent, it is used at high doses for locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) as a monotherapy without castration. Bicalutamide was also previously used as monotherapy to treat localized prostate cancer (LPC), but authorization for this use was withdrawn following unfavorable trial findings. Besides prostate cancer, bicalutamide is limitedly used in the treatment of excessive hair growth and scalp hair loss in women, as a puberty blocker and component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender girls and women, to treat gonadotropin-independent early puberty in boys, and to prevent overly long-lasting erections in men. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of bicalutamide in men include breast growth, breast tenderness, and hot flashes. Other side effects in men include feminization and sexual dysfunction. Some side effects like breast changes and feminization are minimal when combined with castration. While the medication appears to produce few side effects in women, its use in women is not explicitly approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at this time. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase the likelihood of death from causes other than prostate cancer. Bicalutamide produces abnormal liver changes necessitating discontinuation in around 1% of people. Rarely, it has been associated with cases of serious liver damage, serious lung toxicity, and sensitivity to light. Although the risk of adverse liver changes is small, monitoring of liver function is recommended during treatment. Bicalutamide is a member of the nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) group of medications. It works by selectively blocking the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It does not lower androgen levels. The medication can have some estrogen-like effects in men when used as a monotherapy due to increased estradiol levels. Bicalutamide is well-absorbed, and its absorption is not affected by food. The elimination half-life of the medication is around one week. It shows peripheral selectivity in animals, but crosses the blood–brain barrier and affects both the body and brain in humans. Bicalutamide was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bicalutamide is available as a generic medication. The drug is sold in more than 80 countries, including most developed countries. It was at one time the most widely used antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer, with millions of men with the disease having been prescribed it. Although bicalutamide is also used for other indications besides prostate cancer, the vast majority of prescriptions appear to be for treatment of prostate cancer. == Medical uses == Bicalutamide is approved for and mainly used in the following indications: Metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) in men in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical castration at 50 mg/day Locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) in men as a monotherapy at 150 mg/day (not approved for this use in the United States) In Japan, bicalutamide is uniquely used at a dosage of 80 mg/day both in combination with castration and as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide is also employed for the following off-label (non-approved) indications: To reduce the effects of the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men Androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions such as acne, seborrhea, excessive hair growth, and scalp hair loss in women as well as high testosterone levels due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women, at 25 to 50 mg/day generally in combination with a birth control pill Feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women in combination with an estrogen usually at 50 mg/day Peripheral precocious puberty in boys at 12.5 to 100 mg/day in combination with an aromatase inhibitor like anastrozole, especially for familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis) Overly long-lasting erections in men at 50 mg per week to 50 mg every other day The medication has been suggested for but has uncertain effectiveness in the following indication: Hypersexuality and paraphilias, particularly in combination with chemical castration For more information on these uses, see the medical uses of bicalutamide article. === Available forms === Bicalutamide is available for the treatment of prostate cancer in most developed countries, including over 80 countries worldwide. It is available in 50 mg, 80 mg (in Japan), and 150 mg tablets for oral administration. The drug is registered for use as a 150 mg/day monotherapy for the treatment of LAPC in at least 55 countries, with the U.S. being a notable exception where it is registered only for use at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with castration. No other formulations or routes of administration are available or used. All formulations of bicalutamide are specifically indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer alone or in combination with surgical or medication castration. Due to the low water solubility of bicalutamide, bicalutamide in oral bicalutamide tablets is micronized to ensure small and consistent particle sizes and optimize oral bioavailability. A combined formulation of bicalutamide and the GnRH agonist goserelin in which goserelin is provided as a subcutaneous implant for injection and bicalutamide is included as 50 mg tablets for oral ingestion is marketed in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos CP (Zoladex–Cosudex Combination Pack). == Contraindications == Bicalutamide is pregnancy category X, or ""contraindicated in pregnancy"", in the U.S., and pregnancy category D, the second most restricted rating, in Australia. As such, it is contraindicated in women during pregnancy, and women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant are strongly recommended to take bicalutamide only in combination with adequate contraception. It is unknown whether bicalutamide is excreted in breast milk, but many drugs are excreted in breast milk, and for this reason, bicalutamide treatment is similarly not recommended while breastfeeding. In individuals with severe, though not mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, there is evidence that the elimination of bicalutamide is slowed, and hence, caution may be warranted in these patients as circulating levels of bicalutamide may be increased. In severe hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of the active (R)-enantiomer of bicalutamide is increased by about 1.75-fold (76% increase; elimination half-life of 5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively). The elimination half-life of bicalutamide is unchanged in renal impairment. == Side effects == The side effect profile of bicalutamide is highly dependent on sex; that is, on whether the person is male or female. In men, due to androgen deprivation, a variety of side effects of varying severity may occur during bicalutamide treatment, with breast pain/tenderness and gynecomastia (breast development/enlargement) being the most common. Gynecomastia occurs in up to 80% of men treated with bicalutamide monotherapy, and is of mild-to-moderate severity in more than 90% of affected men. In addition to breast changes, physical feminization and demasculinization in general, including reduced body hair growth, decreased muscle mass and strength, feminine changes in fat mass and distribution, reduced penile length, and decreased semen/ejaculate volume, may occur in men. Other side effects that have been observed in men and that are similarly related to androgen deprivation include hot flashes, sexual dysfunction (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction), depression, fatigue, weakness, and anemia. However, most men have preserved sexual function with bicalutamide monotherapy. In females, due to the minimal biological importance of androgens in this sex, the side effects of pure antiandrogens or NSAAs are few, and bicalutamide has been found to be very well tolerated. However, bicalutamide has been found to increase levels of total and LDL cholesterol in women. The non-pharmacological side-effect profile of bicalutamide (i.e., side effects not related to its antiandrogenic activity) is said to be similar to that with placebo. In any case, general side effects of bicalutamide that might occur in either sex include diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, dry skin, itching, and rash. The drug is well-tolerated at higher dosages than 50 mg/day, up to 600 mg/day, with rare additional side effects. Bicalutamide has been associated with abnormal liver function tests such as elevated liver enzymes. In the Early Prostate Cancer (EPC) clinical programme of bicalutamide for LPC and LAPC, the rate of abnormal liver function tests with bicalutamide monotherapy was 3.4% relative to 1.9% for placebo. However, higher rates, up to 11%, have been seen in other studies. Hepatic changes that have necessitated discontinuation of bicalutamide, such as marked increases in liver enzymes or hepatitis, have occurred in 0.3 to 1.5% of men in clinical trials, or approximately 1% overall. Elevated liver enzymes with bicalutamide usually occur within the first 3 to 6 months of treatment. Monitoring of liver function during treatment is recommended, particularly in the first few months. In men with early prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been found to increase non-prostate cancer mortality. The reasons for the increase in mortality with bicalutamide in these men are unknown, but possible factors could include androgen deprivation or drug-related toxicity of bicalutamide. There are 10 published case reports of liver toxicity associated with bicalutamide as of 2022. Death occurred in 2 of these cases. Hundreds of additional cases of liver complications in people taking bicalutamide exist in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. In all of the published case reports of liver toxicity with bicalutamide, the onset of symptoms was within the first 6 months of treatment. Symptoms that may indicate liver dysfunction include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, ""flu-like"" symptoms, dark urine, and jaundice. There are also published case reports of interstitial pneumonitis and eosinophilic lung disease associated with bicalutamide. along with hundreds of additional instances in the FAERS database as well. Interstitial pneumonitis can potentially progress to pulmonary fibrosis and may be fatal. Symptoms that may indicate lung dysfunction include dyspnea (difficult breathing or shortness of breath), cough, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in sore throat). The exact incidence of liver toxicity and interstitial pneumonitis with bicalutamide are unknown, but both are said to be very rare events. A few cases of photosensitivity have been reported with bicalutamide. Hypersensitivity reactions (drug allergy) like angioedema and hives have also uncommonly been reported in association with bicalutamide. Because it is an antiandrogen, bicalutamide has a theoretical risk of birth defects like ambiguous genitalia in male fetuses. Due to its teratogenic capacity, contraception should be used in women taking bicalutamide who are fertile and sexually active. === Comparison === The side effect profile of bicalutamide in men and women differs from that of other antiandrogens and is considered favorable in comparison. Relative to GnRH analogues and the steroidal antiandrogen (SAA) cyproterone acetate (CPA), bicalutamide monotherapy has a much lower incidence and severity of hot flashes and sexual dysfunction. In addition, unlike GnRH analogues and CPA, bicalutamide monotherapy is not associated with decreased bone mineral density or osteoporosis. Conversely, bicalutamide monotherapy is associated with much higher rates of breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and feminization in men than GnRH analogues and CPA. However, gynecomastia with bicalutamide is rarely severe and discontinuation rates due to this side effect are fairly low. These differences in side effects between bicalutamide monotherapy, GnRH analogues, and CPA are attributed to the fact that whereas GnRH analogues and CPA suppress estrogen production, bicalutamide monotherapy does not lower estrogen levels and in fact actually increases them. Bicalutamide does not share the risk of neuropsychiatric side effects like fatigue as well as cardiovascular side effects like coagulation changes, blood clots, fluid retention, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and adverse serum lipid changes that CPA has been associated with. It has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity than flutamide and CPA and of interstitial pneumonitis than nilutamide. The drug also does not share the unique risks of diarrhea with flutamide and nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and alcohol intolerance with nilutamide. Unlike enzalutamide, bicalutamide is not associated with seizures or related central side effects like anxiety and insomnia. However, although the risk of adverse liver changes with bicalutamide is low, enzalutamide differs from bicalutamide in having no known risk of elevated liver enzymes or hepatotoxicity. In contrast to the SAA spironolactone, bicalutamide does not have antimineralocorticoid effects, and hence is not associated with hyperkalemia, urinary frequency, dehydration, hypotension, or other related side effects. In women, unlike CPA and spironolactone, bicalutamide does not produce menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea and does not interfere with ovulation or fertility. == Overdose == A single oral dose of bicalutamide in humans that results in symptoms of overdose or that is considered to be life-threatening has not been established. Dosages of up to 600 mg/day have been well tolerated in clinical trials, and it is notable that there is a saturation of absorption with bicalutamide such that circulating levels of its active (R)-enantiomer do not further increase above a dosage of 300 mg/day. Overdose is considered unlikely to be life-threatening with bicalutamide or other first-generation NSAAs (i.e., flutamide and nilutamide). A massive overdose of nilutamide (13 grams, or 43 times the normal maximum 300 mg/day clinical dosage) in a 79-year-old man was uneventful, producing no clinical signs, symptoms, or toxicity. There is no specific antidote for bicalutamide or NSAA overdose, and treatment should be based on symptoms, if any are present. == Interactions == Bicalutamide is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4. As such, its levels in the body may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4. (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see here.) However, in spite of the fact bicalutamide is metabolized by CYP3A4, there is no evidence of clinically significant drug interactions when bicalutamide at a dosage of 150 mg/day or less is co-administered with drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. In-vitro studies suggest that bicalutamide may be able to inhibit CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Conversely, animal studies suggest that bicalutamide may induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. In a clinical study, bicalutamide co-administered with the CYP3A4 substrate midazolam caused only a small and statistically non-significant increase in midazolam levels (+27%) presumably due to CYP3A4 inhibition. However, this was well below increases in midazolam exposure with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors like ketoconazole (+1500%), itraconazole (+1000%), and erythromycin (+350%), and is considered to not be clinically important. There is no indication of clinically significant enzyme inhibition or induction with bicalutamide at doses of 150 mg/day or below. Because bicalutamide circulates at relatively high concentrations and is highly protein-bound, it has the potential to displace other highly protein-bound drugs like warfarin, phenytoin, theophylline, and aspirin from plasma binding proteins. This could, in turn, result in increased free concentrations of such drugs and increased effects and/or side effects, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments. Bicalutamide has specifically been found to displace coumarin anticoagulants like warfarin from their plasma binding proteins (namely albumin) in vitro, potentially resulting in an increased anticoagulant effect. This is supported by reports of prolonged prothrombin time and internal bleeding after the introduction of bicalutamide in patients previously stable on coumarin anticoagulants. Close monitoring of prothrombin time and dosage adjustment as necessary is recommended when bicalutamide is used in combination with these drugs. However, in spite of this, no conclusive evidence of an interaction between bicalutamide and other drugs was found in clinical trials of nearly 3,000 patients. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Bicalutamide acts as a highly selective competitive silent antagonist of the AR (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 159–243 nM), the major biological target of the androgen sex hormones testosterone and DHTTooltip dihydrotestosterone, and hence is an antiandrogen. The activity of bicalutamide lies in the (R)-isomer. Due to its selectivity for the AR, bicalutamide does not interact importantly with other steroid hormone receptors and hence has no clinically relevant off-target hormonal activity (e.g., progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, antimineralocorticoid). However, it has been reported that bicalutamide has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), where it is an antagonist, and hence it could have some antiprogestogenic activity. Bicalutamide does not inhibit 5α-reductase nor is known to inhibit other enzymes involved in androgen steroidogenesis (e.g., CYP17A1). Although it does not bind to the estrogen receptors (ERs), bicalutamide can increase estrogen levels secondarily to AR blockade when used as a monotherapy in males, and hence can have some indirect estrogenic effects in males. Bicalutamide neither suppresses nor inhibits androgen production in the body (i.e., it does not act as an antigonadotropin or androgen steroidogenesis inhibitor or lower androgen levels) and hence exclusively mediates its antiandrogenic effects by antagonizing the AR. In addition to the classical nuclear AR, bicalutamide has been assessed at the membrane androgen receptors (mARs) and found to act as a potent antagonist of ZIP9 (IC50 = 66.3 nM), whereas it does not appear to interact with GPRC6A. The affinity of bicalutamide for the AR is relatively low as it is approximately 30 to 100 times lower than that of DHT, which is 2.5- to 10-fold as potent as an AR agonist as testosterone in bioassays and is the main endogenous ligand of the receptor in the prostate gland. However, typical clinical dosages of bicalutamide result in circulating levels of the drug that are thousands of times higher than those of testosterone and DHT, allowing it to powerfully prevent them from binding to and activating the receptor. This is especially true in the case of surgical or medical castration, in which testosterone levels in the circulation are approximately 95% reduced and DHT levels in the prostate gland are about 50 to 60% reduced. In women, levels of testosterone are substantially lower (20- to 40-fold) than in men, so much smaller doses of bicalutamide (e.g., 25 mg/day in the hirsutism studies) are necessary. Blockade of the AR by bicalutamide in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus results in prevention of the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) in males and consequent disinhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This, in turn, results in an increase in circulating LH levels and activation of the gonadal production of testosterone and by extension production of estradiol. Levels of testosterone have been found to increase 1.5- to 2-fold (59–97% increase) and levels of estradiol about 1.5- to 2.5-fold (65–146% increase) in men treated with 150 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy. In addition to testosterone and estradiol, there are smaller increases in concentrations of DHT, sex hormone-binding globulin, and prolactin. Estradiol levels with bicalutamide monotherapy are similar to those in the low-normal premenopausal female range while testosterone levels generally remain in the high end of the normal male range. Testosterone concentrations do not typically exceed the normal male range due to negative feedback on the HPG axis by the increased concentrations of estradiol. Bicalutamide influences the HPG axis and increases hormone levels only in men and not also in women. This is due to the much lower levels of androgens in women and their lack of basal suppression of the HPG axis in this sex. As evidenced by its effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer and other androgen-dependent conditions, the antiandrogenic actions of bicalutamide considerably exceed any impact of the increased levels of testosterone it results in. However, the elevated levels of estradiol remain unopposed by bicalutamide and are responsible for the gynecomastia and feminizing side effects it causes in men. Although bicalutamide monotherapy increases gonadotropin and sex hormone levels in men, this will not occur if bicalutamide is combined with an antigonadotropin such as a GnRH analogue, estrogen, or progestogen, as these medications maintain negative feedback on the HPG axis. NSAA monotherapy, including with bicalutamide, shows a number of tolerability differences from methods of androgen deprivation therapy that incorporate surgical or medical castration. For example, the rates of hot flashes, depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction are all much higher with GnRH analogues than with NSAA monotherapy. It is thought that this is because GnRH analogues suppress estrogen production in addition to androgen production, resulting in estrogen deficiency. In contrast, NSAA monotherapy does not decrease estrogen levels and in fact increases them, resulting in an excess of estrogens that compensates for androgen deficiency and allows for a preservation of mood, energy, and sexual function. Neurosteroids that are produced from testosterone like 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are ERβTooltip estrogen receptor beta agonists and the former a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, may also be involved. In the specific case of sexual dysfunction, an additional possibility for the difference is that without concomitant suppression of androgen production, blockade of the AR by the bicalutamide in the brain is incomplete and insufficient to markedly influence sexual function. Under normal circumstances, bicalutamide has no capacity to activate the AR. However, in prostate cancer, mutations and overexpression of the AR can accumulate in prostate gland cells which can convert bicalutamide from an antagonist of the AR into an agonist. This can result in paradoxical stimulation of prostate cancer growth with bicalutamide and is responsible for the phenomenon of the antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome, where antiandrogen discontinuation paradoxically slows the rate of prostate cancer growth. In transgender women, breast development is a desired effect of antiandrogen or estrogen treatment. Breast development and gynecomastia induced by bicalutamide is thought to be mediated by increased activation of the ER secondary to blockade of the AR (resulting in disinhibition of the ER in breast tissue) and increased levels of estradiol. In addition to fat deposition, connective tissue growth, and ductal development, bicalutamide has been found to produce moderate lobuloalveolar development of the breasts. However, full lobuloalveolar maturation necessary for lactation and breastfeeding will not occur without progestogen treatment. Bicalutamide monotherapy seems to have minimal effect on testicular spermatogenesis, testicular ultrastructure, and certain aspects of male fertility. This seems to be because testosterone levels in the testes (where ~95% of testosterone in males is produced) are extremely high (up to 200-fold higher than circulating levels) and only a small fraction (less than 10%) of the normal levels of testosterone in the testes are actually necessary to maintain spermatogenesis. As a result, bicalutamide appears to not be able to compete with testosterone in this sole part of the body to an extent sufficient to considerably interfere with androgen signaling and function. However, while bicalutamide does not seem to be able to adversely influence testicular spermatogenesis, it may interfere with AR-dependent sperm maturation and transport outside of the testes in the epididymides and vas deferens where androgen levels are far lower, and hence may still be able to impair male fertility. In addition, the combination of bicalutamide with other medications, such as estrogens, progestogens, and GnRH analogues, can compromise spermatogenesis due to their own adverse effects on male fertility. These medications are able to strongly suppress gonadal androgen production, which can severely impair or abolish testicular spermatogenesis, and estrogens also appear to have direct and potentially long-lasting cytotoxic effects in the testes at sufficiently high concentrations. ==== Other activities ==== Bicalutamide has been found to act as an inhibitor or inducer of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 in preclinical research, but no evidence of this has been found in humans treated with up to 150 mg/day. It has also been identified in vitro as a strong inhibitor of CYP27A1 (cholesterol 27-hydroxylase) and as an inhibitor of CYP46A1 (cholesterol 24-hydroxylase), but this has yet to be assessed or confirmed in vivo or in humans and the clinical significance remains unknown. Bicalutamide has been found to be a P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) inhibitor. Like other first-generation NSAAs and enzalutamide, it has been found to act as a weak non-competitive inhibitor of GABAA receptor-mediated currents in vitro (IC50 = 5.2 μM). However, unlike enzalutamide, bicalutamide has not been found to be associated with seizures or other related adverse central effects, so the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. === Pharmacokinetics === Though its absolute bioavailability in humans is unknown, bicalutamide is known to be extensively and well-absorbed. Its absorption is not affected by food. The absorption of bicalutamide is linear at doses up to 150 mg/day and is saturable at doses above this, with no further increases in steady-state levels of bicalutamide occurring at doses above 300 mg/day. Whereas absorption of (R)-bicalutamide is slow, with levels peaking at 31 to 39 hours after a dose, (S)-bicalutamide is much more rapidly absorbed. Steady-state concentrations of the drug are reached after 4 to 12 weeks of treatment independently of dosage, with a 10- to 20-fold progressive accumulation in levels of (R)-bicalutamide. The long time to steady-state levels is the result of bicalutamide's very long elimination half-life. There is wide interindividual variability in (R)-bicalutamide levels (up to 16-fold) with bicalutamide regardless of dosage. The tissue distribution of bicalutamide is not well-characterized. The amount of bicalutamide in semen that could potentially be transferred to a female partner during sexual intercourse is low and is not thought to be important. Based on animal studies with rats and dogs it was thought that bicalutamide could not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence could not enter the brain. As such, it was initially thought to be a peripherally selective antiandrogen. However, subsequent clinical studies found that this was not also the case for humans, indicating species differences; bicalutamide crosses into the human brain and, in accordance, produces effects and side effects consistent with central antiandrogenic action. In any case, there is indication that bicalutamide might have at least some peripheral selectivity in humans. Bicalutamide is highly plasma protein bound (96.1% for racemic bicalutamide, 99.6% for (R)-bicalutamide) and is bound mainly to albumin, with negligible binding to SHBG and corticosteroid-binding globulin. Bicalutamide is metabolized in the liver. (R)-Bicalutamide is metabolized slowly and almost exclusively via hydroxylation by CYP3A4 into (R)-hydroxybicalutamide. This metabolite is then glucuronidated by UGT1A9. In contrast to (R)-bicalutamide, (S)-bicalutamide is metabolized rapidly and mainly by glucuronidation (without hydroxylation). None of the metabolites of bicalutamide are known to be active and levels of the metabolites are low in plasma, where unchanged biclautamide predominates. Due to the stereoselective metabolism of bicalutamide, (R)-bicalutamide has a far longer terminal half-life than (S)-bicalutamide and its levels are about 10- to 20-fold higher in comparison following a single dose and 100-fold higher at steady-state. (R)-Bicalutamide has a relatively long elimination half-life of 5.8 days with a single dose and 7 to 10 days following repeated administration. Bicalutamide is eliminated in similar proportions in feces (43%) and urine (34%), while its metabolites are eliminated roughly equally in urine and bile. The drug is excreted to a substantial extent in unmetabolized form, and both bicalutamide and its metabolites are eliminated mainly as glucuronide conjugates. The glucuronide conjugates of bicalutamide and its metabolites are eliminated from the circulation rapidly, unlike unconjugated bicalutamide. The pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide are not affected by consumption of food, a person's age or body weight, renal impairment, or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, steady-state levels of bicalutamide are higher in Japanese individuals than in white people. == Chemistry == Bicalutamide is a racemic mixture consisting of equal proportions of enantiomers (R)-bicalutamide (dextrorotatory) and (S)-bicalutamide (levorotatory). Its systematic name (IUPAC) is (RS)-N-[4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide. The compound has a chemical formula of C18H14F4N2O4S, a molecular weight of 430.373 g/mol, and is a fine white to off-white powder. The acid dissociation constant (pKa') of bicalutamide is approximately 12. It is a highly lipophilic compound (log P = 2.92). At 37 °C (98.6 °F), or normal human body temperature, bicalutamide is practically insoluble in water (4.6 mg/L), acid (4.6 mg/L at pH 1), and alkali (3.7 mg/L at pH 8). In organic solvents, it is slightly soluble in chloroform and absolute ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, and freely soluble in acetone and tetrahydrofuran. Bicalutamide is a synthetic and nonsteroidal compound which was derived from flutamide. It is a bicyclic compound (has two rings) and can be classified as and has variously been referred to as an anilide (N-phenylamide) or aniline, a diarylpropionamide, and a toluidide. === Analogues === First-generation NSAAs including bicalutamide, flutamide, and nilutamide are all synthetic, nonsteroidal anilide derivatives and structural analogues of each other. Bicalutamide is a diarylpropionamide while flutamide is a monoarylpropionamide and nilutamide is a hydantoin. Bicalutamide and flutamide, though not nilutamide, can also be classified as toluidides. All three of the compounds share a common 3-trifluoromethylaniline moiety. Bicalutamide is a modification of flutamide in which a 4-fluorophenylsulfonyl moiety has been added and the nitro group on the original phenyl ring has been replaced with a cyano group. Topilutamide, also known as fluridil, is another NSAA that is closely related structurally to the first-generation NSAAs, but, in contrast to them, is not used in the treatment of prostate cancer and is instead used exclusively as a topical antiandrogen in the treatment of pattern hair loss. The second-generation NSAAs enzalutamide and apalutamide were derived from and are analogues of the first-generation NSAAs, while another second-generation NSAA, darolutamide, is said to be structurally distinct and chemically unrelated to the other NSAAs. Enzalutamide is a modification of bicalutamide in which the inter-ring linking chain has been altered and cyclized into a 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxo imidazolidine moiety. In apalutamide, the 5,5-dimethyl groups of the imidazolidine ring of enzalutamide are cyclized to form an accessory cyclobutane ring and one of its phenyl rings is replaced with a pyridine ring. The first nonsteroidal androgens, the arylpropionamides, were discovered via structural modification of bicalutamide. Unlike bicalutamide (which is purely antiandrogenic), these compounds show tissue-selective androgenic effects and were classified as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Lead SARMs of this series included acetothiolutamide, enobosarm (ostarine; S-22), and andarine (acetamidoxolutamide or androxolutamide; S-4). They are very close to bicalutamide structurally, with the key differences being that the linker sulfone of bicalutamide has been replaced with an ether or thioether group to confer agonism of the AR and the 4-fluoro atom of the pertinent phenyl ring has been substituted with an acetamido or cyano group to eliminate reactivity at the position. A few radiolabeled derivatives of bicalutamide have been developed for potential use as radiotracers in medical imaging. They include [18F]bicalutamide, 4-[76Br]bromobicalutamide, and [76Br]bromo-thiobicalutamide. The latter two were found to have substantially increased affinity for the AR relative to that of bicautamide. However, none of these agents have been evaluated in humans. 5N-Bicalutamide, or 5-azabicalutamide, is a minor structural modification of bicalutamide which acts as a reversible covalent antagonist of the AR and has approximately 150-fold higher affinity for the AR and about 20-fold greater functional inhibition of the AR relative to bicalutamide. It is among the most potent AR antagonists to have been developed and is being researched for potential use in the treatment of antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer. === Synthesis === A number of chemical syntheses of bicalutamide have been published in the literature. The procedure of the first published synthesis of bicalutamide can be seen below. == History == Bicalutamide as well as all of the other currently marketed NSAAs were derived from structural modification of flutamide, which itself was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent in 1967 at Schering Plough Corporation and was subsequently and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogenic activity. Bicalutamide was discovered by Tucker and colleagues at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in the 1980s and was selected for development from a group of over 2,000 synthesized compounds. It was first patented in 1982 and was first reported in the scientific literature in June 1987. Bicalutamide was first studied in a phase I clinical trial in 1987 and the results of the first phase II clinical trial in prostate cancer were published in 1990. The pharmaceutical division of ICI was split out into an independent company called Zeneca in 1993, and in April and May 1995, Zeneca (now AstraZeneca, after merging with Astra AB in 1999) began pre-approval marketing of bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer in the U.S.. It was first launched in the U.K.Tooltip United Kingdom in May 1995, and was subsequently approved by the U.S. FDA on 4 October 1995, for the treatment of prostate cancer at a dosage of 50 mg/day in combination with a GnRH analogue. Following its introduction for use in combination with a GnRH analogue, bicalutamide was developed as a monotherapy at a dosage of 150 mg/day for the treatment of prostate cancer, and was approved for this indication in Europe, Canada, and a number of other countries in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This application of bicalutamide was also under review by the FDA in the U.S. in 2002, but ultimately was not approved in this country. In Japan, bicalutamide is licensed at a dosage of 80 mg/day alone or in combination with a GnRH analogue for prostate cancer. The unique 80 mg dosage of bicalutamide used in Japan was selected for development in this country on the basis of observed pharmacokinetic differences with bicalutamide in Japanese men. Subsequent to negative findings of bicalutamide monotherapy for LPC in the EPC clinical programme, approval of bicalutamide for use specifically in the treatment of LPC was withdrawn in a number of countries including the U.K. (in October or November 2003) and several other European countries and Canada (in August 2003). In addition, the U.S. and Canada explicitly recommended against the use of 150 mg/day bicalutamide for this indication. The drug is effective for, remains approved for, and continues to be used in the treatment of LAPC and mPC, on the other hand. The patent protection of bicalutamide expired in the U.S. in March 2009 and the drug has subsequently been available as a generic, at greatly reduced cost. Bicalutamide was the fourth antiandrogen (and the third NSAA) to be introduced for the treatment of prostate cancer, following the SAA CPA in 1973 and the NSAAs flutamide in 1983 (1989 in the U.S.) and nilutamide in 1989 (1996 in the U.S.). It has been followed by abiraterone acetate in 2011, enzalutamide in 2012, apalutamide in 2018, and darolutamide in 2019, and may also be followed by in-development drugs such as proxalutamide and seviteronel. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Bicalutamide is the generic name of the drug in English and French and its INNTooltip INN, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, AANTooltip Australian Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is also referred to as bicalutamidum in Latin, bicalutamida in Spanish and Portuguese, bicalutamid in German, and bikalutamid in Russian and other Slavic languages. The ""bica-"" prefix corresponds to the fact that bicalutamide is a bicyclic compound, while the ""-lutamide"" suffix is the standard suffix for NSAAs. Bicalutamide is also known by its former developmental code name ICI-176,334. === Brand names === Bicalutamide is marketed by AstraZeneca in oral tablet form under the brand names Casodex, Cosudex, Calutide, Calumid, and Kalumid in many countries. It is also marketed under the brand names Bicadex, Bical, Bicalox, Bicamide, Bicatlon, Bicusan, Binabic, Bypro, Calutol, and Ormandyl among others in various countries. The drug is sold under a large number of generic trade names such as Apo-Bicalutamide, Bicalutamide Accord, Bicalutamide Actavis, Bicalutamide Bluefish, Bicalutamide Kabi, Bicalutamide Sandoz, and Bicalutamide Teva as well. A combination formulation of bicalutamide and goserelin is marketed by AstraZeneca in Australia and New Zealand under the brand name ZolaCos-CP. === Cost and generics === Bicalutamide is off-patent and available as a generic. Unlike bicalutamide, the newer NSAA enzalutamide is still on-patent, and for this reason, is considerably more expensive in comparison. The patent protection of all three of the first-generation NSAAs has expired and flutamide and bicalutamide are both available as low-cost generics. Nilutamide, on the other hand, has always been a poor third competitor to flutamide and bicalutamide and, in relation to this fact, has not been developed as a generic and is only available as brand name Nilandron, at least in the U.S. Bicalutamide is considerably less costly than GnRH analogues, which, in spite of some having been off-patent many years, have been reported (in 2013) to typically cost US$10,000–$15,000 per year (or about US$1,000 per month) of treatment. === Sales and usage === Sales of bicalutamide (as Casodex) worldwide peaked at US$1.3 billion in 2007, and it has been described as a ""billion-dollar-a-year"" drug prior to losing its patent protection starting in 2007. In 2014, despite the introduction of abiraterone acetate in 2011 and enzalutamide in 2012, bicalutamide was still the most commonly prescribed drug in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Moreover, in spite of being off-patent, bicalutamide was said to still generate a few hundred million dollars in sales per year for AstraZeneca. Total worldwide sales of brand name Casodex were approximately US$13.4 billion as of the end of 2018. Between January 2007 and December 2009 (a period of three years), 1,232,143 prescriptions of bicalutamide were dispensed in the U.S., or about 400,000 prescriptions per year. During that time, bicalutamide accounted for about 87.2% of the NSAA market, while flutamide accounted for 10.5% of it and nilutamide for 2.3% of it. Approximately 96% of bicalutamide prescriptions were written for diagnosis codes that clearly indicated neoplasm. About 1,200, or 0.1% of bicalutamide prescriptions were dispensed to pediatric patients (age 0–16). === Regulation === Bicalutamide is a prescription drug. It is not specifically a controlled substance in any country and therefore is not an illegal drug. However, the manufacture, sale, distribution, and possession of prescription drugs are all still subject to legal regulation throughout the world. == Research == Bicalutamide has been studied in combination with the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride in prostate cancer. It has also been studied in combination with raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), for the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide has been tested for the treatment of AR-positive ER/PR-negative locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer in women in a phase II study for this indication. Enzalutamide is also being investigated for this type of cancer. Bicalutamide has also been studied in a phase II clinical trial for ovarian cancer in women. Bicalutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a 24-week trial of 15 patients at a dosage of 50 mg/day. Prostate volume decreased by 26% in patients taking bicalutamide and urinary irritative symptom scores significantly decreased. Conversely, peak urine flow rates and urine pressure flow examinations were not significantly different between bicalutamide and placebo. The decrease in prostate volume achieved with bicalutamide was comparable to that observed with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride, which is approved for the treatment of BPH. Breast tenderness (93%), gynecomastia (54%), and sexual dysfunction (60%) were all reported as side effects of bicalutamide at the dosage used in the study, although no treatment discontinuations due to adverse effects occurred and sexual functioning was maintained in 75% of patients. A phase III clinical trial of bicalutamide in combination with an ethinylestradiol-containing combined oral contraceptive for the treatment of severe hirsutism in women with PCOS was completed in Italy in 2017 under supervision of the Italian Agency for Drugs (AIFA). Antiandrogens have been suggested for treating COVID-19 in men and as of May 2020 high-dose bicalutamide is in a phase II clinical trial for this purpose. == Veterinary use == Bicalutamide may be used to treat hyperandrogenism and associated benign prostatic hyperplasia secondary to hyperadrenocorticism (caused by excessive adrenal androgens) in male ferrets. However, it has not been formally assessed in controlled studies for this purpose. == See also == Comparison of bicalutamide with other antiandrogens == References == == Further reading ==",Calutide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003583677811548114), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02326536364853382)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019286326132714748), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([practo.com](https://www.practo.com/medicine-info/calutide-50-mg-tablet-37265?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=107, start_index=9, title='Calutide 50 mg Tablet - Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Price, Composition | Practo', type='url_citation', url='https://www.practo.com/medicine-info/calutide-50-mg-tablet-37265?utm_source=openai')])"

It is being developed for the treatment of overactive bladder and irritable bowel syndrome. It has been shown to produce visceral analgesia by releasing somatostatin from adipocytes. Solabegron was discovered by GlaxoSmithKline and acquired by AltheRx in March 2011. Solabegron relaxes the bladder smooth muscle by stimulating β3 adrenoceptors, a novel mechanism compared with older established drug treatments for overactive bladder syndrome such as the anticholinergic agents. Astellas Pharma has developed the first commercially available β3 adrenergic receptor, mirabegron, which is now licensed in Japan and the U.S. exclusively for treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. A Phase II study of solabegron for overactive bladder (OAB) looked at 258 patients with moderate-to-severe incontinence experiencing an average of 4.5 wet episodes per day. Results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with solabegron as compared with placebo, as measured by the percentage reduction of the number of wet episodes and the absolute number of daily voids. A Phase II study for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) evaluated 102 patients with IBS. Solabegron demonstrated significant reduction in pain associated with the disorder and a trend for greater improvement in the quality of life, when compared with a placebo. Both Phase II studies indicated a tolerability profile for solabegron that was similar to placebo. This drug does not bind to acetylcholine receptors so side effects are expected to be minor.

This first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluated dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determined a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for filanesib administered as a 1-h intravenous infusion on 2 treatment schedules in patients with advanced solid tumors. The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of filanesib were also evaluated. Methods Filanesib was administered on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle (Initial Schedule) or Days 1 and 2 of each 2-week cycle (Alternate Schedule). A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was employed. An expansion cohort was conducted at the MTD of the Initial Schedule. Filanesib PK was evaluated in plasma (both schedules) and urine (Initial Schedule only). Monopolar spindle formation was evaluated in biopsies taken from patients in the expansion cohort. Results Forty-one patients received filanesib. The MTD was equivalent for both the Initial and Alternate Schedules (2.50 mg/m(2)/cycle). The prevalence of neutropenia as a DLT for both schedules necessitated adding prophylactic filgrastim to another dose escalation on the Alternate Schedule (highest tolerated dose 3.20 mg/m(2)/cycle). Neurotoxicity related to filanesib was not observed. Dose-proportional increases in filanesib exposure were observed. The half-life for filanesib was ~70 h. Monopolar spindles in patient biopsy samples indicated KSP inhibition. Stable disease was the best tumor response observed in 18 % (7/39) of evaluable patients.

The former reported that filanesib ""...has similar anti-tumor activity in EOC [epithelial ovarian cancer] cells as that of paclitaxel. However, unlike paclitaxel, it does not induce these pro-tumor effects in Type I cells."" The detrimental effects attributed to paclitaxel were alleged to be ""...due to paclitaxel-induced enhancement of NF-κB and ERK activities, and cytokine production (e.g. IL-6), which promote chemoresistance and tumor progression."" The latter study also reported promising results, concluding that filanesib ""...potently induces cell cycle block and subsequent death in leukemic cells via the mitochondrial pathway and has the potential to eradicate AML [acute myeloid leukemia] progenitor cells."" However, a clinical trial published in 2012 on patients with advanced myeloid leukemias found that the drug exhibited a ""relative lack of clinical activity""; the trial was therefore halted before it was scheduled to end. In June 2013, preliminary results from a trial of the drug were presented at a conference of the European Hematology Association in Stockholm. On October 31, 2013, it was reported that the company which developed the drug, Array BioPharma (based in Boulder, Colorado), was planning on launching a phase III clinical trial of the drug to treat multiple myeloma. The study began in mid-2014, and paired filanesib with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in several hundred patients. The study's primary endpoint was progression-free survival (i.e. the time until the cancer recurs). A previous trial had reported that 37% of patients receiving filanesib in conjunction with carfilzomib showed lower levels of paraprotein, also known as ""M protein"", whereas only 16% of controls (i.e. those receiving only carfilzomib) showed such a reduction. In addition, a report by the International Myeloma Working Group concluded that filanesib was ""effective in monotherapy as well as in combination with dexamethasone in heavily pretreated patients."" According to Jatin Shah, an assistant professor at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the primary adverse effect of treatment with filanesib observed in trials conducted thus far is reversible neutropenia, though it is possible that it may cause low blood cell counts as well. Shah et al. have conducted a phase II study of filanesib both by itself, and in combination with dexamethasone, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology. In December 2013, further clinical trial results were presented, also at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology; the results concluded that 16 percent of patients who had received a median of six prior therapies responded to single-agent filanesib. In the week after this presentation, Array BioPharma's stock fell by 16%. In February 2014, a review was published by researchers from the University of Salamanca in Spain, which concluded that ""...some of these novel agents [to treat multiple myeloma] seem promising, such as monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD38 — daratumumab or anti-CS1 — elotuzumab) or the kinesin protein inhibitor Arry-520."" A 2016 phase 1 dose-escalation study found that the studied dosing regimen of filanesib combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone had a favorable safety profile.

Compound 13 showed profound pharmacodynamic modulation of p-Akt in PTEN-deficient PC3 prostate tumor bearing mice after oral administration and showed complete inhibition of tumor growth in the mouse PTEN-deficient PC3 prostate tumor xenograft model. 13 was selected as a clinical candidate for treatment of PTEN-deficient cancers and has recently entered phase I clinical trials.","(r)-8-(1-(3,5-difluorophenylamino)ethyl)-n,n-dimethyl-2-morpholino-4-oxo-4h-chromene-6-carboxamide",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019537187181413174), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0142021169885993)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -5.512236498361744e-07)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25514658/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='Discovery of (R)-8-(1-(3,5-difluorophenylamino)ethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-chromene-6-carboxamide (AZD8186): a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ for the treatment of PTEN-deficient cancers', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25514658/?utm_source=openai')])"
489,"('Trichlormethiazide', 'Trichloromethiazide', 'Naqua', 'Metahydrin', 'Trichlormetazid')",Medical,"Trichlormethiazide (INN, currently being sold under the brand names of Achletin, Diu-Hydrin and Triflumen) is a diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. It is usually administered for the treatment of oedema (including that which is associated with heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and corticosteroid therapy) and hypertension. In veterinary medicine, trichlormethiazide can be combined with dexamethasone to be used on horses with mild swelling of distal limbs and general bruising. As a diuretic (in particular a thiazide), trichlormethiazide encourages water loss from the body. Trichlormethiazide works by inhibiting Na+/Cl− ion reabsorption from the distal tubules of the kidneys. In addition, trichlormethiazide increases the excretion of potassium. == Mechanism == Trichlormethiazide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride and water, and thus acts as a diuretic. Although trichlormethiazide is used to treat hypertension, its hypotensive effects may not necessarily be due to its role as a diuretic. Thiazides in general cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. == Synthesis == == References ==",Trichlormetazid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005233110277913511), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01820111833512783)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.001170225441455841)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichlormethiazide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Trichlormethiazide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichlormethiazide?utm_source=openai')])"

491,"('Haloperidol', 'Haldol', 'Serenace', 'Aloperidin', 'Aloperidol')",Medical,"Haloperidol, sold under the brand name Haldol among others, is a typical antipsychotic medication. Haloperidol is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, tics in Tourette syndrome, mania in bipolar disorder, delirium, agitation, acute psychosis, and hallucinations from alcohol withdrawal. It may be used by mouth or injection into a muscle or a vein. Haloperidol typically works within 30 to 60 minutes. A long-acting formulation may be used as an injection every four weeks for people with schizophrenia or related illnesses, who either forget or refuse to take the medication by mouth. Haloperidol may result in movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia both of which may be permanent. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur, the latter particularly with IV administration. In older people with psychosis due to dementia it results in an increased risk of death. When taken during pregnancy it may result in problems in the infant. It should not be used by people with Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol was discovered in 1958 by the team of Paul Janssen, prepared as part of a structure-activity relationship investigation into analogs of pethidine (meperidine). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is the most commonly used typical antipsychotic. In 2020, it was the 303rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Haloperidol is used in the control of the symptoms of: Acute psychosis, such as drug-induced psychosis caused by ketamine, and phencyclidine, and psychosis associated with high fever or metabolic disease. Some evidence has found haloperidol to worsen psychosis due to psilocybin. Adjunctive treatment of alcohol and opioid withdrawal Agitation and confusion associated with cerebral sclerosis Alcohol-induced psychosis Hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal Hyperactive delirium (to control the agitation component of delirium) Hyperactivity, aggression Otherwise uncontrollable, severe behavioral disorders in children and adolescents Schizophrenia Therapeutic trial in personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder Treatment of intractable hiccups Treatment of neurological disorders, including tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome, and chorea Treatment of severe nausea and emesis in postoperative and palliative care, especially for palliating adverse effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in oncology. Also used as a first line antiemetic for acute cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. As chemical restraint in acute care psychiatry, mainly for violent and self-harming patients (controversial use but very commonly found in movies). Haloperidol was considered indispensable for treating psychiatric emergency situations. However, the newer atypical drugs have gained a greater role in a number of situations, as outlined in a series of consensus reviews published between 2001 and 2005. In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, haloperidol demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine, approximately as effective as quetiapine and aripiprazole, and 10% less effective than paliperidone. A 2013 systematic review compared haloperidol to placebo in schizophrenia: In contrast to certain other antipsychotics like risperidone, haloperidol is ineffective as a hallucinogen antidote or ""trip killer"" in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). === Pregnancy and lactation === Data from animal experiments indicate haloperidol is not teratogenic, but is embryotoxic in high doses. In humans, no controlled studies exist. Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus, although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition, reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk. Haloperidol is excreted in breast milk. A few studies have examined the impact of haloperidol exposure on breastfed infants and in most cases, there were no adverse effects on infant growth and development. === Other considerations === During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission. Sometimes, it may be indicated to terminate haloperidol treatment gradually. In addition, during long-term use, routine monitoring including measurement of BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and lipids, is recommended due to the risk of side effects. Other forms of therapy (psychotherapy, occupational therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly. PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5 mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy. Patients responded with doses under even 2 mg in first-episode psychosis. For maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, an international consensus conference recommended a reduction dosage by about 20% every 6 months until a minimal maintenance dose is established. Depot forms are also available; these are injected deeply intramuscularly at regular intervals. The depot forms are not suitable for initial treatment, but are suitable for patients who have demonstrated inconsistency with oral dosages. The decanoate ester of haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate, trade names Haldol decanoate, Halomonth, Neoperidole) has a much longer duration of action, so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication. A dose is given by intramuscular injection once every two to four weeks. The IUPAC name of haloperidol decanoate is [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl]piperidin-4-yl] decanoate. Topical formulations of haloperidol should not be used as treatment for nausea because research does not indicate this therapy is more effective than alternatives. == Adverse effects == Sources for the following lists of adverse effects: As haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, it tends to produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was the most prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects. With more than 6 months of use 14 percent of users gain weight. Haloperidol may be neurotoxic. Prolonged use of the drug can lead to mental dependence. Common (>1% incidence) Extrapyramidal side effects including: Akathisia (motor restlessness) Dystonia (continuous spasms and muscle contractions) Muscle rigidity Parkinsonism (characteristic symptoms such as rigidity) Hypotension Anticholinergic side effects such as: (These adverse effects are less common than with lower-potency typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine.) Blurred vision Constipation Dry mouth Somnolence (which is not a particularly prominent side effect, as is supported by the results of the aforementioned meta-analysis.) Unknown frequency Anemia Headache Increased respiratory rate Orthostatic hypotension Prolonged QT interval Visual disturbances Rare (<1% incidence) === Contraindications === Pre-existing coma, acute stroke Severe intoxication with alcohol or other central depressant drugs Known allergy against haloperidol or other butyrophenones or other drug ingredients Known heart disease, when combined will tend towards cardiac arrest === Special cautions === A multiple-year study suggested this drug and other neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs commonly given to people with Alzheimer's with mild behavioral problems often make their condition worse and its withdrawal was even beneficial for some cognitive and functional measures. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: analysis of 17 trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients. Most of the causes of death were either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. It is not clear to what extent this observation is attributed to antipsychotic drugs rather than the characteristics of the patients. The drug bears a boxed warning about this risk. Impaired liver function, as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver In patients with hyperthyroidism, the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely. IV injections: risk of hypotension or orthostatic collapse Patients at special risk for the development of QT prolongation (hypokalemia, concomitant use of other drugs causing QT prolongation) Patients with a history of leukopenia: a complete blood count should be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells. Pre-existing Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies === Interactions === Amiodarone: Q-Tc interval prolongation (potentially dangerous change in heart rhythm). Amphetamine and methylphenidate: counteracts increased action of norepinephrine and dopamine in patients with narcolepsy or ADD/ADHD Epinephrine: action antagonized, paradoxical decrease in blood pressure may result Guanethidine: antihypertensive action antagonized Levodopa: decreased action of levodopa Lithium: rare cases of the following symptoms have been noted: encephalopathy, early and late extrapyramidal side effects, other neurologic symptoms, and coma. Methyldopa: increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects and other unwanted central effects Other central depressants (alcohol, tranquilizers, narcotics): actions and side effects of these drugs (sedation, respiratory depression) are increased. In particular, the doses of concomitantly used opioids for chronic pain can be reduced by 50%. Other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system: inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and rifampicin decrease plasma levels and inhibitors such as quinidine, buspirone, and fluoxetine increase plasma levels Tricyclic antidepressants: metabolism and elimination of tricyclics significantly decreased, increased toxicity noted (anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, lowering of seizure threshold) === Potential neurotoxicity === Several lines of evidence suggest that haloperidol exhibits neurotoxicity. Some studies report an association between antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation agents, and a decline in gray matter volume. Haloperidol irreversibly blocks the sigma σ1 receptor. It may exert deleterious effects on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by attenuating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcription and expression, associated with an increase in the long non-coding RNA BDNF-AS in the DLPFC. Besides the preceding mechanisms, haloperidol metabolizes into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP. This might be involved in the extrapyramidal symptoms that develop with long-term haloperidol therapy. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Overdose == === Symptoms === Symptoms are usually due to side effects. Most often encountered are: Anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, paralytic ileus, difficulties in urinating, decreased perspiration) Coma in severe cases, accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension, shock Hypotension or hypertension Rarely, serious ventricular arrhythmia (torsades de pointes), with or without prolonged QT-time Sedation Severe extrapyramidal side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors, akathisia, etc. === Treatment === Treatment is mostly symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of emesis, gastric lavage, and the use of activated charcoal can be tried. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as bromocriptine or ropinirole may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures. === Prognosis === An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal, but in general the prognosis after overdose is good, provided the person has survived the initial phase. == Pharmacology == Haloperidol is a typical butyrophenone-type antipsychotic that exhibits high-affinity dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and slow receptor dissociation kinetics. It has effects similar to the phenothiazines. The drug binds preferentially to D2 and α1 receptors at low dose (ED50 = 0.13 and 0.42 mg/kg, respectively), and 5-HT2 receptors at a higher dose (ED50 = 2.6 mg/kg). Given that antagonism of D2 receptors is more beneficial on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors on the negative symptoms, this characteristic underlies haloperidol's greater effect on delusions, hallucinations and other manifestations of psychosis. Haloperidol's negligible affinity for histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors yields an antipsychotic with a lower incidence of sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension though having higher rates of treatment emergent extrapyramidal symptoms. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== By mouth ==== The bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from 60 to 70%. However, there is a wide variance in reported mean Tmax and T1/2 in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively. ==== Intramuscular injections ==== The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly. The Tmax is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T1/2 is 20.7 hours. The decanoate injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks. ==== Intravenous injections ==== The bioavailability is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg. The duration of action is four to six hours. ==== Therapeutic concentrations ==== Plasma levels of five to 15 micrograms per liter are typically seen for therapeutic response (Ulrich S, et al. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1998). The determination of plasma levels is rarely used to calculate dose adjustments but can be useful to check compliance. The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about 20-fold higher compared to blood levels. It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue, which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped. ==== Distribution and metabolism ==== Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma, with a free fraction of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by CYP3A4. Haloperidol is metabolized into HPP+, a monoaminergic neurotoxin related to MPTP, by CYP3A enzymes. == Chemistry == Haloperidol is a crystalline material with a melting temperature of 150 °C. This drug has very low solubility in water (1.4 mg/100 mL), but it is soluble in chloroform, benzene, methanol, and acetone. It is also soluble in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (3 mg/mL) with heating. == History == Haloperidol was discovered by Paul Janssen. It was developed in 1958 at the Belgian company Janssen Pharmaceutica and submitted to the first of clinical trials in Belgium later that year. Haloperidol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 12 April 1967; it was later marketed in the U.S. and other countries under the brand name Haldol by McNeil Laboratories. == Society and culture == === Cost === Haloperidol is relatively inexpensive, being up to 100 fold less expensive than newer antipsychotics. === Names === Haloperidol is the INN, BAN, USAN, AAN approved name. It is sold under the tradenames Aloperidin, Bioperidolo, Brotopon, Dozic, Duraperidol (Germany), Einalon S, Eukystol, Haldol (common tradename in the US and UK), Halol, Halosten, Keselan, Linton, Peluces, Serenace Norodol (Turkey) and Sigaperidol. == Research == Haloperidol was under investigation for the treatment of depression. It was employed as a short-term low-dose dopamine receptor antagonist to upregulate dopamine receptors and produce receptor supersensitivity followed by drug withdrawal as a means of treating depression. == Veterinary use == Haloperidol is also used on many different kinds of animals for nonselective tranquilization and diminishing behavioral arousal, in veterinary and other settings including captivity management. == References ==",Aloperidol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003013156820088625), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015378089156001806)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/haloperidol-oral-route/description/drg-20064173,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560892/,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682180.html ', [])"

In the phase 1b study (European Clinical Trials Database 2015-002900-10) patients with genetic and clinical confirmation of APDS1 or APDS2 received 15-25 mg/d seletalisib for 12 wk.

However, the specific role of PI3K p110δ isoform in human DCs has not been thoroughly addressed. In this study, we analyze the effects of seletalisib, a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3K p110δ, on phenotype and antigen-presenting functions of monocyte-derived DCs undergone maturation via LPS. Seletalisib treatment reduced membrane HLA-DR as well as CD83 and CD40 costimulatory molecules, whereas CD80 and CD86 expression was only partially affected. Additionally, DCs cultures showed reduced TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-12 and increased IL-23 secretion levels. This resulted in a reduced capacity of DCs to prime allogeneic T cells, with a strong decrease of Th1 differentiation. On the other hand, PI3K p110δ inhibitor seletalisib increased CXCR4 and CCR7 expression and augmented the DCs migration toward CCL19 and CXCL12 ligands. At molecular level, inhibition of PI3K p110δ isoform by seletalisib significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation of AKT and other downstream signaling molecules, such as ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and NF-κB p65. In contrast, seletalisib did not affect p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation or TLR-associated adapter molecule TIRAP in DCs.

Pexmetinib, a novel p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) inhibitor that has been evaluated in phase I clinical trials for myelodysplastic syndrome, but the effects of Pexmetinib on breast cancer induced osteolysis haven't been explored. Here, we found that Pexmetinib inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption  Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) suppress normal hematopoietic activity in part by enabling a pathogenic inflammatory milieu in the bone marrow. In this report, we show that elevation of angiopoietin-1 in myelodysplastic CD34(+) stem-like cells is associated with higher risk disease and reduced overall survival in MDS and AML patients. Increased angiopoietin-1 expression was associated with a transcriptomic signature similar to known MDS/AML stem-like cell profiles. In seeking a small-molecule inhibitor of this pathway, we discovered and validated pexmetinib (ARRY-614), an inhibitor of the angiopoietin-1 receptor Tie-2, which was also found to inhibit the proinflammatory kinase p38 MAPK (which is overactivated in MDS). Pexmetinib inhibited leukemic proliferation, prevented activation of downstream effector kinases, and abrogated the effects of TNFα on healthy hematopoietic stem cells.

Ponesimod was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2021, and in the European Union in June 2021. == Medical uses == Ponesimod is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. == Adverse effects == Common adverse effects in studies were temporary bradycardia (slow heartbeat), usually at the beginning of the treatment, dyspnoea (breathing difficulties), and increased liver enzymes (without symptoms). No significant increase of infections was observed under ponesimod therapy. QT prolongation is detectable but was considered to be too low to be of clinical importance in a study. == Mechanism of action == Like fingolimod, which is already approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, ponesimod blocks the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor. This mechanism prevents lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) from leaving lymph nodes. Ponesimod is selective for subtype 1 of this receptor, S1P1. == History == === Clinical trials === In a 2009–2011 Phase II clinical trial including 464 multiple sclerosis patients, ponesimod treatment resulted in fewer new active brain lesions than placebo, measured during the course of 24 weeks. In a 2010–2012 Phase II clinical trial including 326 patients with psoriasis, 46 or 48% of patients (depending on dosage) had a reduction of at least 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score compared to placebo in 16 weeks. The approval is already applied for in 2020. In a 2015–2019 Phase III randomised, double-blind clinical trial of 1133 adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, those under ponesimod treatment showed a 30% reduction in annual relapse rate and a significantly reduced number of new inflammatory lesions on brain MRI by 56% compared to those taking teriflunomide. In October 2020, Janseen-Cilag International NV submitted an application for the modification of agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP) to European Medicines Agency (including deferral and waiver criteria). This application was launched for the amendments of proposed changes against the European Medicines Agency’s decisions issued in November 2012 and April 2018. The approved procedure has already started in December 2022. To evaluate pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics efficacy of ponesimod in pediatric patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS); a multicenter, randomized, double blind clinical study of duration of 108 weeks treatment for age group 10 to less than 18 years, is in progress. The clinical trial will end in November 2027. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In March 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Ponvory, intended for the treatment of active relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International N.V. Ponesimod was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2021. == References ==",Ponvory,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013314791431184858), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002754547167569399)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;https://ponvoryus.com/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponesimod,https://www.va.gov/MS/TREATING_MS/DMTs/Ponesimod_Ponvory.asp ', [])"
495,"('Flufenamic acid', 'Arlef', 'Fluphenamic acid', 'Nichisedan', 'Achless')",Medical,"Flufenamic acid (FFA) is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).: 718 Like other members of the class, it is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, preventing the formation of prostaglandins. FFA is known to bind to and reduce the activity of prostaglandin F synthase and activate TRPC6. Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented FFA in 1963, along with fellow members of the class, mefenamic acid in 1961 and meclofenamic acid in 1964.: 718 Although flufenamic acid was at one time informally referred to as ""Fluffy"" (see history cache), this pet name could also refer to flufenoxine. == Structure == Flufenamic acid is a highly polymorphic drug molecule with multiple structurally characterized polymorphic modifications. It has a unique chemical structure and stands out among fenamates. Nowadays, eight polymorphic forms are known that are determined by different conformers, which makes flufenamic acid unique among other low-molecular medicinal compounds. A fundamental feature of the structure of flufenamic acid, which has generated significant interest in the design and development of drugs, is the presence of a trifluoromethyl group. Compounds with fluorine-containing substituents are known to have promising chemical and biological properties, since such groups often improve the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of drugs. Studies have shown the promise of repositioning flufenamic acid and the use of drugs based on it in the treatment of Bartter syndrome. == Medical uses == Until recently, FFA was actively used in medical practice as an analgesic with anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. FFA has been proven effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and other inflammation-related diseases. However, despite this, the use of FFA in the United States and other countries is limited since the compound causes frequent side effects. The rate of gastrointestinal side effects can be as high as 60%, manifested as at least one of the following: dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain and discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence, indigestion, epigastric distress, stomatitits and anorexia. Besides gastrointestinal side effects, the drug can cause headache, dizziness and peripheral oedema. == Side effects == It is not widely used in humans as it has a high rate (30–60%) of gastrointestinal side effects. It is generally not available in the US. It is available in some Asian and European countries as a generic drug. == References ==",Flufenamic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.992108420585282e-05), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00409882515668869)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flufenamic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Flufenamic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flufenamic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"

497,"('Venetoclax', 'Venclexta', 'Venetoclax (abt199)', 'Venetoclax; abt-199', 'Venetoclax (abt-199)')",Medical,"Venetoclax, sold under the brand names Venclexta and Venclyxto, is a medication used to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The most common side effects are low levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), diarrhea, nausea, anemia (low red blood cell counts), nose and throat infection and tiredness. Venetoclax attaches to a protein called Bcl-2. This protein is present in high amounts in CLL cancer cells, where it helps the cells survive for longer in the body and makes them resistant to cancer medicines. By attaching to Bcl-2 and blocking its actions, venetoclax causes the death of cancer cells and thereby slows down progression of the disease. == Medical uses == === CLL/SLL === In the US, venetoclax is indicated for adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Indication does not depend on mutation status (e. g. 17p deletion, IGHV mutation, 12+). In the EU, venetoclax monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adults who are unsuitable for or have failed a B cell receptor pathway inhibitor and for the treatment of CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adults who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B cell receptor pathway inhibitor. === Other types of leukemia === ==== Acute myeloid leukemia ==== Venetoclax is also indicated as part of a combination therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this purpose it is used with azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine for newly diagnosed adults who are age 75 years or older, or those with other health problems where intensive chemotherapy cannot be used. A retrospective study examined the characteristics and outcomes of 83 AML patients, aged ≥75 years old, by comparing two periods: 2016-2018 (36 patients , before Venetoclax approval) and 2019-2021 (47 patients, following Venetoclax approval): It was found that during 2019-2021 more ≥75 patients received anti-AML treatment than in 2016-2018 (87.2% vs. 55.6%, respectively), and different outcomes were significantly improved in 2019-2021 comparing 2016-2018, for example: complete remission (44.7% vs. 19.4%, respectively), 30 day mortality rate (12.8% vs. 38.9%), 1-year overall survival (29.8% vs. 11.1%), 1-year relapse free survival (57.1% vs. 14.3%) and 1-year event free survival (25.5% vs. 2.8%). == Side effects == Common side effects of venetoclax include neutropenia (low white blood cell count), nausea, anemia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Major side effects include tumor lysis syndrome and severe neutropenia. Additionally, this drug may cause fertility problems in males. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Venetoclax is a BH3-mimetic. Venetoclax blocks the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein, leading to programmed cell death of CLL cells. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in some lymphoid malignancies has been linked to increased resistance to chemotherapy. === Pharmacokinetics === The maximum plasma concentration achieved after oral administration occurred 5–8 hours after dose. Steady state maximum concentration with low-fat meal conditions at the 400 mg once daily dose was found to be 2.1 ± 1.1 μg/mL. It is recommended that venetoclax be administered with a meal. The apparent volume of distribution for venetoclax is approximately 256–321 L. It is highly bound to human plasma protein. Within a concentration range of 1-30 μM (0.87-26 μg/mL), the fraction unbound in plasma was less than 0.01. Venetoclax is metabolized by CYP3A4/5 as proven by in-vitro studies. Those using the drug should not consume grapefruit products because they contain CYP3A inhibitors. Additionally, while using venetoclax it is not recommended to use other drugs which contain CYP3A inhibitors (i.e.: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, dronedarone, fluconazole, verapamil). Venetoclax is excreted from the body via the fecal route. == History == In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the breakthrough therapy designation to venetoclax for people with CLL or SLL who have relapsed, become intolerant to, or refractory to previous treatment. In April 2016, the FDA approved venetoclax for use in those with CLL who have 17p deletion (deletion located on the chromosome 17 short arm) and who have been treated with at least one prior therapy. Based on overall response rate, the indication was approved under accelerated FDA approval. The efficacy of venetoclax was tested in a single-arm clinical trial of 106 participants with CLL who have a 17p deletion and who had received at least one prior therapy. Trial participants took venetoclax orally every day, beginning with 20 mg and increasing over a five-week period to 400 mg. Results showed that 80 percent of trial participants experienced a complete or partial remission of their cancer. The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The application for venetoclax was granted priority review and accelerated approval along with breakthrough therapy designation and orphan drug designation. Venetoclax was approved for use in the European Union in December 2016. In June 2018, the FDA granted regular approval to venetoclax for people with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy. Approval was based on MURANO (NCT02005471), a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open-label trial of venetoclax with rituximab (VEN+R) versus bendamustine with rituximab (B+R) in 389 participants with CLL who had received at least one prior line of therapy. Participants in the VEN+R arm completed a 5-week ramp-up venetoclax schedule and then received venetoclax 400 mg once daily for 24 months measured from the rituximab start date. Rituximab was initiated after venetoclax ramp-up and given for 6 cycles (375 mg/m2 intravenously on cycle 1 day 1 and 500 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 of cycles 2–6, with a 28-day cycle length). The comparator arm received 6 cycles of B+R (bendamustine 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle and rituximab at the above described dose and schedule). The application for venetoclax in combination with rituximab was granted priority review along with a breakthrough therapy designation. In November 2018, in the United States, venetoclax was approved in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Accelerated approval was based on two open-label non-randomized trials in participants with newly diagnosed AML who were >= 75 years of age or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Efficacy was established based on the rate of complete remission (CR) and CR duration. Study M14-358 (NCT02203773) was a non-randomized, open-label clinical trial of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (n=67) or decitabine (n=13) in newly diagnosed participants with AML. In combination with azacitidine, 25 participants achieved a CR (37%, 95% CI: 26, 50) with a median observed time in remission of 5.5 months (range: 0.4–30 months). In combination with decitabine, 7 participants achieved a CR (54%, 95% CI: 25, 81) with a median observed time in remission of 4.7 months (range: 1.0–18 months). The observed time in remission is the time from start of CR to data cut-off date or relapse from CR. In a phase 3 study of azacitidine and venetoclax in untreated acute myeloid leukemia not eligible for standard induction chemotherapy, the addition of venetoclax to azacitidine resulted in an improvement in median overall survival (14.7 months versus 9.6 months) and improved complete remission rates. Study M14-387 (NCT02287233) was a non-randomized, open-label trial of venetoclax in combination with low-dose cytarabine (n=61) in newly diagnosed participants with AML, including participants with previous exposure to a hypomethylating agent for an antecedent hematologic disorder. In combination with low-dose cytarabine, 13 participants achieved a CR (21%, 95% CI: 12, 34) with a median observed time in remission of 6 months (range: 0.03–25 months). In May 2019, the label was extended by accelerated approval to include all adults with CLL/SLL disregarding prior treatment or mutation status. Approval was based on CLL14 (NCT02242942), a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open label, actively controlled trial of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) in 432 participants with previously untreated CLL with coexisting medical conditions. The major efficacy outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for participants who received VEN+G compared with those who received GClb (HR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.51; p<0.0001). Median PFS was not reached in either arm after a median follow-up duration of 28 months. The overall response rate was 85% in VEN+G arm compared to 71% in GClb arm, p=0.0007. The trial also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in rates of minimal residual disease negativity (less than one CLL cell per 104 leukocytes) in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Overall survival data were not mature at this analysis. The FDA used the Real-Time Oncology Review and Assessment Aid Pilot Program for this application and granted priority review as well as orphan drug and breakthrough therapy designations. Approval was granted 3.7 months ahead of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date. == Society and culture == AbbVie Inc. manufactures Venclexta. It is marketed by both Abbvie and Genentech USA, which is a member of the Roche Group. AbbVie and Genentech are both commercializing the drug within the United States, but only AbbVie has rights to do so outside of the U.S. According to Reuters 2016 Drugs to Watch, the 2020 forecast sales for venetoclax are US$1.48 billion.: 3, 7–8 Competition as well as potential for combination is expected from other drugs such as ibrutinib and idelalisib, both of which were also approved in 2014 to treat CLL.: 7–8 Venetoclax is patented by AbbVie Inc. == Research == As of 2016, venetoclax had been tested to treat other hematological cancers, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.: 7–8 On 13 June 2020 at the European Hematology Association (EHA) annual congress, AbbVie and Roche announced the results of a Phase III trial that showed a 34 percent reduction in the risk of death in AML patients who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy treated with venetoclax plus azacitidine compared to azacitidine plus placebo. Several trials have assessed the combination of venetoclax with intensive chemotherapy in younger AML patients. The Safety and Efficacy of Venetoclax in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Phase I trial (NCT05976217) has been completed. The good news is that it is safe and well-tolerated in patients with IPF. A larger study to determine if it halts or reverses the fibrosis is in the planning stage.
