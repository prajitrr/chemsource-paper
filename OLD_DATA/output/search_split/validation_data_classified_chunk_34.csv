3369,"('Etoposide', 'Vepesid', 'Toposar', 'Trans-etoposide', 'Lastet')",Medical,"Etoposide, sold under the brand name Vepesid among others, is a chemotherapy medication used for the treatments of a number of types of cancer including testicular cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and ovarian cancer. It is also used for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. It is used by mouth or injection into a vein. Side effects are very common. They can include low blood cell counts, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, hair loss, and fever. Other severe side effects include allergic reactions and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy will likely harm the fetus. Etoposide is in the topoisomerase inhibitor family of medication. It is believed to work by damaging DNA. Etoposide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1983. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Etoposide is used as a form of chemotherapy for cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lung cancer, testicular cancer, lymphoma, nonlymphocytic leukemia, and glioblastoma multiforme. It is often given in combination with other drugs (such as bleomycin in treating testicular cancer). It is also sometimes used in a conditioning regimen prior to a bone marrow or blood stem cell transplant. === Administration === It is given intravenously (IV) or orally in capsule or tablet form. If the drug is given IV, it must be done slowly over a 30- to 60-minute period because it can lower blood pressure as it is being administered. Blood pressure is checked often during infusing, with the speed of administration adjusted accordingly. == Side effects == Common are: infusion site reactions low blood pressure hair loss pain and or burning at the IV site constipation or diarrhea metallic food taste bone marrow suppression, leading to: decreased white blood cell counts (leading to increased susceptibility to infections) low red blood cell counts (anemia) low platelet counts (leading to easy bruising and bleeding) Less common are: nausea and vomiting allergic-type reactions rash fever, often occurring shortly after IV administration and not due to infection mouth sores acute myeloid leukemia (which can be treated with etoposide itself) When given with warfarin, it may cause bleeding. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Etoposide forms a ternary complex with DNA and the topoisomerase II enzyme, which is an enzyme that aids in relaxing negative or positive supercoils in DNA. Topoisomerase II normally will form a double-stranded break in one DNA double-strand, allow another to pass through, and re-ligate the broken strands. Etoposide's binding prevents topoisomerase II from re-ligating the broken DNA strands, which causes the DNA breaks made by topoisomerase II to stay broken, and also prevents the topoisomerase II molecule from leaving the site and relieving tension elsewhere. This results in a double-strand break in the DNA that can have various deleterious effects on the cell, and depletion of topoisomerase II available to relieve further tension. Cancer cells rely on this enzyme more than healthy cells, since they divide more rapidly. Therefore, this causes errors in DNA synthesis and promotes apoptosis of the cancer cell. == Chemistry == Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin from the rhizome of the mayapple (or ""American mandrake"", Podophyllum peltatum). More specifically, it is a glycoside of podophyllotoxin with a D-glucose derivative. It is chemically similar to the anti-cancer drug teniposide, being distinguished only by a methyl group where teniposide has a thienyl. Both these compounds have been developed with the aim of creating less toxic derivatives of podophyllotoxin. The substance is a white to yellow-brown, crystalline powder. It is soluble in organic solvents. It is used in form of its salt etoposide phosphate. == History == Etoposide was first synthesized in 1966 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval was granted in 1983. The nickname VP-16 likely comes from a compounding of the last name of one of the chemists who performed early work on the drug (von Wartburg) and podophyllotoxin. Another scientist who was integral in the development of podophyllotoxin-based chemotherapeutics was the medical pharmacologist Hartmann F. Stähelin. == References == == External links == ""Etoposide"". Drug Information Portal. U.S. National Library of Medicine. ""Etoposide phosphate"". Drug Information Portal.

3370,"('Omadacycline (hydrochloride)', 'Amadacycline hydrochloride', 'Omadacycline', 'Amadacycline', 'Nuzyra')",Medical,"Omadacycline, sold under the brand name Nuzyra, is a broad spectrum antibiotic medication belonging to the aminomethylcycline subclass of tetracycline antibiotics. In the United States, it was approved in October 2018, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute skin and skin structure infections. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of omadacycline is similar to that of other tetracyclines – inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. Omadacycline has activity against bacterial strains expressing the two main forms of tetracycline resistance (efflux and ribosomal protection). == History == Omadacycline was invented at Tufts University School of Medicine by a research team led by Mark L. Nelson with Mohamed Ismail while at Tufts and Kwasi Ohemeng and Laura Honeyman at Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Boston. The team applying their chemistry methods to the tetracycline scaffolds created over 3000 new derivatives, leading to the novel third-generation compounds omadacycline and sarecycline. === In vitro studies === In vitro studies have shown that omadacycline has activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and select Gram-negative pathogens. Omadacycline has potent in vitro activity against Gram-positive aerobic bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant and multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Omadacycline also has antimicrobial activity against common Gram-negative aerobes, some anaerobes, and atypical bacteria such as Legionella and Chlamydia. This activity translated to potent efficacy for omadacycline in an in vivo systemic infection model in mice. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies of omadacycline metabolism, disposition, and drug interactions show that omadacycline is metabolically stable (i.e., it does not undergo significant biotransformation) and neither inhibits nor interacts with metabolizing enzymes or transporters. === Clinical trials === A phase II study was conducted comparing the safety and efficacy of omadacycline to linezolid for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. Patients were randomized at 11 sites in the US to receive either omadacycline 100 mg intravenously once daily with an option to transition to 200 mg orally once daily or linezolid 600 mg intravenously twice daily with an option to transition to 600 mg orally twice daily. The results indicated that omadacycline is well tolerated and has the potential to be an effective treatment in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. In June 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated the intravenous and oral formulations of omadacycline as a qualified infectious disease product in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. A 650-patient phase III registration study comparing omadacycline to linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections began in June 2015. Omadacycline met the primary efficacy endpoint of early clinical response with statistical non-inferiority (10% margin) compared to linezolid, and was generally safe and well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal side effects (18.0% for omadacycline vs. 15.8% for linezolid). A 750-patient phase III study comparing omadacycline to moxifloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia began in November 2015. Omadacycline was statistically non-inferior to moxifloxacin at the early clinical response, 72 to 120 hours after therapy was initiated. In May 2016, a phase Ib study of omadacycline in urinary tract infection was initiated. In August 2016, a second phase III study of omadacycline was initiated in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, comparing the efficacy and safety of once-daily, oral omadacycline to that of twice-daily, oral linezolid. In July 2017, analysis of the data showed that all of the primary and secondary endpoints required for submission to the FDA and EMA were met. This was the third phase 3 registration study of omadacycline with favorable results. == References == == External links == ""Omadacycline Injection"".

3371,"('Mifepristone', 'Ru 38486', 'Mifegyne', 'Mifeprex', 'Mifepriston')",Medical,"Mifepristone, and also known by its developmental code name RU-486, is a drug typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about a medical abortion during pregnancy. This combination is 97% effective during the first 63 days (9 weeks) of pregnancy, yet effective in the second trimester as well. It is also used on its own to treat Cushing's Syndrome or for use as a low-dose emergency contraceptive. The most common adverse effects include abdominal pain, feeling tired, and vaginal bleeding. Serious side effects may include heavy vaginal bleeding, bacterial infection, and, if pregnant, birth defects. When used, appropriate follow-up care needs to be available. Mifepristone is primarily an antiprogestogen. It works by blocking the effects of progesterone, making both the cervix and uterine vessels dilate and causing uterine contraction. Mifepristone also works, to a less extent, as an antiglucocorticoid and diminishes the effects of hypercortisolism. Mifepristone was developed in 1980 and came into use in France in 1987. It became available in the United States in 2000, for medication abortion, and in 2010, for Cushing's syndrome. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Mifepristone was approved in Canada in January 2017. == Medical uses == === Abortion === Mifepristone followed by a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) is used for medical abortion. Medical organizations have found this combination to be safe and effective. Guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists describe medication abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol as effective and appropriate at any gestational age. The World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend mifepristone followed by misoprostol for first- and second-trimester medical abortion. Mifepristone alone is less effective, resulting in abortion within 1–2 weeks in anywhere from 54% to 92% of pregnancies, according to review of 13 studies. === Cushing's syndrome === Mifepristone is used for the medical treatment of high blood sugar caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in adults with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who also have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or cannot have surgery. In a Phase III trial, it improved glycemic control, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced body weight regardless of the cause of CS. === Medical management of early pregnancy loss === Mifepristone combined with misoprostol is the preferred medication regimen for management of early pregnancy loss. While misoprostol alone can be used, the addition of a dose of mifepristone twenty-four hours before misoprostol administration improves treatment efficacy. === Other uses === Mifepristone at low doses has been used for emergency contraception. Mifepristone has also been used to treat symptomatic leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) and endometriosis. As elevated cortisol levels have been implicated in psychotic depression, mifepristone has been used as a treatment. == Side effects == Serious complications with mifepristone are rare with about 0.04%–0.09% requiring hospitalization and 0.05% requiring blood transfusion. Nearly all women using the mifepristone/misoprostol regimen experienced abdominal pain, uterine cramping, and vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9–16 days. For most women, the most severe cramps after use of misoprostol last for less than 6 hours and can generally be managed with ibuprofen. Up to 8% of women experienced some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. Other less common side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and fever. Pelvic inflammatory disease is a very rare but serious complication. Excessive bleeding and incomplete termination of a pregnancy require further intervention by a doctor (such as a repeat dose of misoprostol or a vacuum aspiration). Mifepristone is contraindicated in the presence of adrenal failure, long-term oral corticosteroid therapy (although inhaled and topical steroids are not contraindications), hemorrhagic disorders, inherited porphyria, and hemophilia or anticoagulant use. Women with an intrauterine device in their uterus should remove the IUD prior to medication abortion to avoid unnecessary cramping. Mifepristone is not effective in treating ectopic pregnancy. A postmarketing summary found, of about 1.52 million women who had received mifepristone until April 2011 in the United States, 14 were reported to have died after application. Eight of these cases were associated with sepsis; the other six had various causes such as drug abuse and suspected murder. Other incidents reported to the FDA included 612 nonlethal hospitalizations, 339 blood transfusions, 48 severe infections, and 2,207 (0.15%) adverse events altogether. No long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mifepristone have been performed. This is in accord with ICH guidelines, which do not require carcinogenicity testing in nongenotoxic drugs intended for administration for less than six months. === Pregnancy === Mifepristone alone results in abortion within 1–2 weeks in 54% to 92% of pregnancies. The effectiveness increases to greater than 90% if misoprostol is given after the mifepristone. There is no evidence that the effects of mifepristone can be reversed, although some anti-abortion groups claim that it can be reversed by giving progesterone. Researchers in the United States initiated a trial of the so-called ""reversal"" regimen in 2019, but stopped prematurely due to serious safety concerns about using mifepristone without follow-up misoprostol. Giving progesterone has not been shown to halt medication abortion, and not completing the combination regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol may cause serious bleeding. In those who continue pregnancy after use of mifepristone together with misoprostol for termination, birth defects may occur. Exposure to a single large dose of mifepristone in newborn rats was not associated with any reproductive problems, although chronic low-dose exposure of newborn rats to mifepristone was associated with structural and functional reproductive abnormalities. Studies in mice, rats, and rabbits revealed developmental abnormalities for rabbits, but not rats or mice. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mifepristone is a steroidal antiprogestogen (IC50 = 0.025 nM for the PR), as well as an antiglucocorticoid (IC50 = 2.2 nM for the GR) and antiandrogen (IC50 = 10 nM for the AR) to a much lesser extent. It antagonizes cortisol action competitively at the receptor level. In the presence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a partial agonist). Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid with a bulky p-(dimethylamino) phenyl substituent above the plane of the molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl substituent below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone receptor binding affinity. In addition to being an antiprogestogen, mifepristone is also an antiglucocorticoid and a weak antiandrogen. Mifepristone's relative binding affinity at the progesterone receptor is more than twice that of progesterone, its relative binding affinity at the glucocorticoid receptor is more than three times that of dexamethasone and more than ten times that of cortisol. Its relative binding affinity at the androgen receptor is less than one-third that of testosterone, and it does not bind to the estrogen receptor or the mineralocorticoid receptor. Mifepristone as a regular contraceptive at 2 mg daily prevents ovulation (1 mg daily does not). A single preovulatory 10-mg dose of mifepristone delays ovulation by three to four days and is as effective an emergency contraceptive as a single 1.5-mg dose of the progestin levonorgestrel. In women, mifepristone at doses greater or equal to 1 mg/kg antagonizes the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone. In humans, an antiglucocorticoid effect of mifepristone is manifested at doses greater or equal to 4.5 mg/kg by a compensatory increase in ACTH and cortisol. In animals, a weak antiandrogenic effect is seen with prolonged administration of very high doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg. In medication abortion regimens, mifepristone blockade of progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins, and an increase in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the contractile effects of prostaglandins. Mifepristone-induced decidual breakdown indirectly leads to trophoblast detachment, resulting in decreased syncytiotrophoblast production of hCG, which in turn causes decreased production of progesterone by the corpus luteum (pregnancy is dependent on progesterone production by the corpus luteum through the first nine weeks of gestation—until placental progesterone production has increased enough to take the place of corpus luteum progesterone production). When followed sequentially by a prostaglandin, mifepristone 200 mg is (100 mg may be, but 50 mg is not) as effective as 600 mg in producing a medical abortion. 'Contragestion' is a term promoted by Étienne-Émile Baulieu in the context of his advocacy of mifepristone, defining it as inclusive of some hypothesized mechanisms of action of some contraceptives and those of mifepristone to induce abortion. Baulieu's definition of a 'contragestive' included any birth control method that could possibly act after fertilization and before nine-weeks gestational age. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life is complex; according to the label: ""After a distribution phase, elimination is at first slow, the concentration decreasing by a half between about 12 and 72 hours, and then more rapid, giving an elimination half-life of 18 hours. With radio receptor assay techniques, the terminal half-life is of up to 90 hours, including all metabolites of mifepristone able to bind to progesterone receptors."" Metapristone is the major metabolite of mifepristone. == Chemistry == Mifepristone, also known as 11β-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-17α-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of steroid hormones like progesterone, cortisol, and testosterone. It has substitutions at the C11β and C17α positions and double bonds at the C4(5) and C9(10) positions. == History == === 1980–1987 === In April 1980, as part of a formal research project at the French pharmaceutical company Roussel-Uclaf for the development of glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, endocrinologist Étienne-Émile Baulieu and chemist Georges Teutsch synthesized mifepristone (RU-38486, the 38,486th compound synthesized by Roussel-Uclaf from 1949 to 1980; shortened to RU-486), which was discovered to also be a progesterone receptor antagonist. In October 1981, Étienne-Émile Baulieu, a consultant to Roussel-Uclaf, arranged tests of its use for medical abortion in 11 women in Switzerland by gynecologist Walter Herrmann at the University of Geneva's Cantonal Hospital, with successful results announced on 19 April 1982. On 9 October 1987, following worldwide clinical trials in 20,000 women of mifepristone with a prostaglandin analogue (initially sulprostone or gemeprost, later misoprostol) for medical abortion, Roussel-Uclaf sought approval in France for their use for medical abortion, with approval announced on 23 September 1988. === 1988–1990 === On 21 October 1988, in response to antiabortion protests and concerns of majority (54.5%) owner Hoechst AG of Germany, Roussel-Uclaf's executives and board of directors voted 16 to 4 to stop distribution of mifepristone, which they announced on 26 October 1988. Two days later, the French government ordered Roussel-Uclaf to distribute mifepristone in the interests of public health. French Health Minister Claude Évin explained: ""I could not permit the abortion debate to deprive women of a product that represents medical progress. From the moment Government approval for the drug was granted, RU-486 became the moral property of women, not just the property of a drug company."" Following use by 34,000 women in France from April 1988 to February 1990 of mifepristone distributed free of charge, Roussel-Uclaf began selling Mifegyne (mifepristone) to hospitals in France in February 1990 at a price (negotiated with the French government) of US$48 (equivalent to $115.53 in 2024) per 600-mg dose. === 1991–1996 === Mifegyne was subsequently approved in Great Britain in July 1991, and in Sweden in September 1992, but until his retirement in April 1994, Hoechst AG chairman Wolfgang Hilger, a devout Roman Catholic, blocked any further expansion in availability. Soon after becoming U.S. President in 1993, Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to investigate mifepristone's potential as an abortion medication, and also pressured Hoeschst to make the RU-486 medication available in the United States. On 16 May 1994, Roussel-Uclaf announced it was donating without remuneration all rights for medical uses of mifepristone in the United States to the Population Council, which would then sponsor clinical trials for mifepristone between September 1994 and September 1995. In September 1995, The Population Council licensed mifpristone to Danco Laboratories, which was a new, single-product company that was intended to be resistant to antiabortion boycotts. Danco entered into a manufacturing agreement with Hungarian drug manufacturer Gedeon Richter. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conditionally licensed RU-486 for early trimester abortion, pending a resolution on some remaining technical and manufacturing issues. === 1997–1999 === On 8 April 1997, after buying the remaining 43.5% of Roussel-Uclaf stock in early 1997, Hoechst AG (US$30 (equivalent to $60.15 in 2024) billion annual revenue) announced the end of its manufacture and sale of Mifegyne (US$3.44 (equivalent to $6.9 in 2024) million annual revenue) and the transfer of all rights for medical uses of mifepristone outside of the United States to Exelgyn, a new single-product company immune to antiabortion boycotts, whose CEO was former Roussel-Uclaf CEO Édouard Sakiz. In 1997, Gideon Richter would withdraw from efforts to manufacture mifepristone in the United States following opposition from pro-life groups, which led to Danco filing a breach of contract lawsuit. In 1999, Exelgyn won approval of Mifegyne in 11 additional countries, and in 28 more countries over the following decade. === 2000–present === In September 2000 Danco Laboratories, a sub-licensee of the Population Council, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell mifepristone under the brand name Mifeprex. In 2019, the first generic form of mifepristone in the United States became available, manufactured by GenBioPro. In the early 2000's, several pharmaceutical companies in China were producing mifepristone. == Society and culture == Mifepristone is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Since 2005, it has been included on the core list, with misoprostol, with a special note ""where permitted under national law and where culturally acceptable"". === Economics === Cost and availability limit access in many parts of the world. === Frequency of use === ==== United States ==== Medication abortions voluntarily reported by 33 US states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have increased as a percentage of total abortions every year since the approval of mifepristone: 1.0% in 2000, 2.9% in 2001, 5.2% in 2002, 7.9% in 2003, 9.3% in 2004, 9.9% in 2005, 10.6% in 2006, and 13.1% in 2007 (20.3% of those at less than 9 weeks gestation). A Guttmacher Institute survey of abortion providers estimated that medication abortions accounted for 17% of all abortions and slightly over 25% of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in the United States in 2008 (94% of nonhospital medication abortions used mifepristone and misoprostol, 6% used methotrexate and misoprostol). Medication abortions accounted for 32% of first trimester abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States in 2008. Considering abortions performed in non-hospital facilities, medication abortions accounted for 24% in 2011 and 31% in 2014. In 2014, facilities that provided a relatively small number of abortions (fewer than 400 procedures per year) were more likely to perform them with medication. Medication abortions accounted for 39% of all US abortions in 2017, and 54% in 2020. ==== Europe ==== In France, the percentage of medication abortions of all abortions continues to increase: 38% in 2003, 42% in 2004, 44% in 2005, 46% in 2006, 49% in 2007 (vs. 18% in 1996). In England and Wales, 52% of early abortions (less than 9 weeks gestation) in 2009 were medication-based; the percentage of all abortions that are medication-based has increased every year for the past 14 years (from 5% in 1995 to 40% in 2009) and has more than doubled in the last five years. In Scotland, 81.2% of early abortions in 2009 were medication-based (up from 55.8% in 1992 when medication abortion was introduced); the percentage of all abortions that are medication-based has increased every year for the past 17 years (from 16.4% in 1992 to 69.9% in 2009). In Sweden, 85.6% of early abortions and 73.2% of abortions before the end of the 12th week of gestation in 2009 were medication-based; 68.2% of all abortions in 2009 were medication-based. In Great Britain and Sweden, mifepristone is licensed for use with vaginal gemeprost or oral misoprostol. As of 2000, more than 620,000 women in Europe had had medication abortions using a mifepristone regimen. In Denmark, mifepristone was used in between 3,000 and 4,000 of just over 15,000 abortions in 2005. === Legal status === ==== In the United States ==== Mifepristone was approved for abortion in the United States by the FDA in September 2000. As of 2007, it was legal and available in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico. It is a prescription drug, but was not initially available to the public through pharmacies; its distribution is primarily restricted to specially qualified licensed physicians, sold by Danco Laboratories under the brand name Mifeprex. As of September 2021, in 32 states, the drug could only be provided by a licensed physician, and in 19 states, the prescribing clinician was required to be physically in the room with the patient while they are taking the drug. Roussel Uclaf did not seek US approval, so in the United States legal availability was not initially possible. The United States banned importation of mifepristone for personal use in 1989, a decision supported by Roussel Uclaf. In 1994, Roussel Uclaf gave the U.S. drug rights to the Population Council in exchange for immunity from any product liability claims. The Population Council sponsored clinical trials in the United States. The drug went on approvable status from 1996. Production was intended to begin through the Danco Group in 1996, but they withdrew briefly in 1997 due to a corrupt business partner, delaying availability again. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mifepristone, to end a pregnancy through 70 days gestation (70 days or less since the first day of a woman's last menstrual period). The approved dosing regimen is 200 mg of mifepristone taken by mouth (swallowed). 24 to 48 hours after taking mifepristone, 800 mcg (micrograms) of misoprostol is taken buccally (in the cheek pouch), at a location appropriate for the patient. Mifepristone tablets have a marketing authorization in the United States for the treatment of high blood sugar caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in adults with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or cannot have surgery. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, safe access to mifepristone was a concern, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists among other groups filed a lawsuit to relax the FDA's rule as to allow mifepristone to be acquired from mail-order and retail pharmacies. While the Fourth Circuit had granted a preliminary injunction to allow this distribution, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a stay order in January 2021 to retain the FDA's rule pending the results of the ongoing litigation. On 16 December 2021, the FDA voluntarily adopted a new rule permanently relaxing the requirement that the pill be obtained in person, allowing it to be sent through the mail. A prescription is still required, so that a doctor can screen for risk factors that would make taking the pill unsafe for the mother. In January 2023, the FDA further relaxed rules, allowing any retail pharmacy to become certified to fill mifepristone prescriptions. After regulations on abortion early in pregnancy were ruled constitutional by the 2022 decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, some states enacted restrictions on abortions and abortion pills. In January 2023, the United States Department of Justice issued an interpretation of the Comstock Act that it was legal for United States Postal Service employees to deliver the pills in any state, because they could not know whether the pills would be used for an abortion or other purposes. In January 2023, GenBioPro filed suit to overturn state laws that prohibit sale of mifepristone, claiming that such laws are invalid because it is a federally approved drug. The argument that state laws seeking to ban or restrict the use of mifepristone are preempted by the FDA's decision to make the drug available is supported by a number of Supreme Court decisions, including opinions by the traditionally more conservative Justices. In March 2023, Wyoming became the first US state to ban the pill. In April 2023, in a lawsuit brought by 17 US states and the District of Columbia, federal district judge Thomas O. Rice issued a temporary injunction that the FDA should not reduce access to mifepristone in these states and the district. In May 2024, the state of Louisiana classified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances, with penalties for possession without a prescription. The move follows concerns over coerced abortion and has drawn criticism from over 240 doctors in the state. ==== FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine ==== In April 2023, in the FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lawsuit, federal district judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk issued a preliminary injunction suspending the 2000 approval of mifepristone, which would take effect a week later. The Fifth Circuit reversed parts of Kacsmaryk's injunction, but placed a temporary injunction on the 2016 REMS change to mifepristone. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court stayed both injunctions on 21 April 2023, with only Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas stating their dissent. The stay allowed mifepristone to remain legally available while the lower courts consider the merits of the case. In June 2024, the US Supreme Court unanimously overturned judge Kacsmaryk's Fifth Circuit decision on the grounds that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine had no standing to challenge the FDA's regulations of mifepristone. The Supreme Court ruled that Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine did not demonstrate that they would suffer harm to warrant standing. The Court did not rule on the substance of mifepristone, abortion, or the FDA's procedures. ==== Subsection H ==== Some drugs are approved by the FDA under subsection H, which has two subparts. The first sets forth ways to rush experimental drugs, such as aggressive HIV and cancer treatments, to market when speedy approval is deemed vital to the health of potential patients. The second part of subsection H applies to drugs that not only must meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet postmarketing surveillance to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Until December 2021, Mifepristone was approved under the second part of subsection H. The result is that women could not pick the drug up at a pharmacy, but were required to receive it directly from a doctor. Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion, and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug was only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies. The approval of mifepristone under subsection H included a black box warning. ==== European Union ==== Outside the United States, mifepristone is marketed and distributed by Exelgyn Laboratories under the brand name Mifegyne. It was approved for use in France in 1988 (initial marketing in 1989), the United Kingdom in 1991, Sweden in 1992, then Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland in 1999. In 2000, it was approved in Norway, Russia and Ukraine. Serbia and Montenegro approved it in 2001, Belarus and Latvia in 2002, Estonia in 2003, Moldova in 2004, Albania and Hungary in 2005, Portugal in 2007, Romania in 2008, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovenia in 2013. In Italy, clinical trials have been constrained by protocols requiring women be hospitalized for three days, but the drug was finally approved on 30 July 2009 (officialized later in the year), despite strong opposition from the Vatican. In Italy, the pill must be prescribed and used in a clinical structure and is not sold at chemists. It was approved in Hungary in 2005, but as of 2005 had not been released on the market yet, and was the target of protests. Mifepristone is licensed in Ireland for use of abortions up to 12 weeks since it was legalised in 2018. Mifepristone is not available in Poland, where abortion is highly restricted. Mifepristone 200 mg tablets (Mifegyne, Mifepristone Linepharma, Medabon) have marketing authorizations in the European Economic Area from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for: Early first trimester medication abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) through 63 days gestational age Second trimester medication abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog Cervical softening and dilation prior to first trimester surgical abortion Induction of labor after fetal death in utero when prostaglandin analogs and oxytocin are contraindicated ==== Other countries ==== Mifepristone was banned in Australia in 1996. In 2005, a private member's bill was introduced to the Australian Senate to lift the ban and transfer the power of approval to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The move caused much debate in the Australian media and among politicians. The bill passed the Senate in February 2006, and mifepristone is legal in Australia. It is provided regularly at several specialized abortion clinics per state. Mifepristone 200 mg tablets have marketing authorizations in Australia from the TGA for early first trimester medication abortion when followed by the prostaglandin analog misoprostol through 63 days gestational age and second trimester medication abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog. In New Zealand, pro-abortion rights doctors established an import company, Istar, and submitted a request for approval to Medsafe, the New Zealand pharmaceutical regulatory agency. After a court case brought by Right to Life New Zealand failed, use of mifepristone was permitted. Mifepristone was approved in Israel in 1999. Clinical trials of mifepristone in China began in 1985. In October 1988, China became the first country in the world to approve mifepristone. Chinese organizations tried to purchase mifepristone from Roussel Uclaf, which refused to sell it to them, so in 1992 China began its own domestic production of mifepristone. In 2000, the cost of medication abortion with mifepristone was higher than surgical abortion and the percentage of medication abortions varied greatly, ranging from 30% to 70% in cities to being almost nonexistent in rural areas. A report from the United States Embassy in Beijing in 2000 said mifepristone had been widely used in Chinese cities for about two years, and that according to press reports, a black market had developed with many women starting to buy it illegally (without a prescription) from private clinics and drugstores for about US$15 (equivalent to $27.39 in 2024), causing Chinese authorities to worry about medical complications from use without physician supervision. In 2001, mifepristone was approved in Taiwan. Vietnam included mifepristone in the National Reproductive Health program in 2002. Mifepristone is approved in only one sub-Saharan African country—South Africa, where it was approved in 2001. It is also approved in one north African country—Tunisia, also in 2001. Mifepristone was approved for use in India in 2002, where medication abortion is referred to as ""medical termination of pregnancy"". It is only available under medical supervision, not by prescription, due to adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, and criminal penalties are given for buying or selling it on the black market or over-the-counter at pharmacies. Medication induced abortion used to be available in Canada but on a limited basis using methotrexate and misoprostol. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, mifepristone was found to act faster. Health Canada gave approval to mifepristone in July 2015. Initially, its use was limited to seven weeks into a pregnancy, but this was changed to nine weeks in 2017. The previous requirement of written consent from the woman was also ended at the same time. It can be dispensed directly to a patient by a pharmacist or a prescribing health professional. Women are required to have an ultrasound to ensure the pregnancy is not ectopic. Mifepristone was registered for use in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan in 2002, in Guyana and Moldova in 2004, in Mongolia in 2005, and in Armenia in 2007. Low dose mifepristone tablets for emergency contraception are available directly from a pharmacist without a prescription and with a prescription in China. Low dose mifepristone tablets for emergency contraception are available by prescription in Armenia (Gynepriston), Russia (Agesta, Gynepriston, Mifepristone 72, Negele), Ukraine (Gynepriston), and Vietnam (Mifestad 10, Ciel EC). === Controversy === Many anti-abortion groups in the United States actively campaigned against the approval of mifepristone and continue to actively campaign for its withdrawal. They cite either ethical issues with abortion or safety concerns regarding the drug and the adverse reactions associated with it. Religious and anti-abortion groups outside the United States have also protested mifepristone, especially in Germany and Australia. A court case that originated in Texas in 2023 argued that mifepristone was unsafe and women should no longer be able to order it by mail. This case was won in Texas but was appealed, and in June 2024, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously on that case to keep mifepristone available on grounds that those who originally filed the lawsuit did not have standing to file. == Research == The original target for the research group was the discovery and development of compounds with antiglucocorticoid properties. Use of mifepristone as a cervical ripening agent has been described. The medication has been studied as an antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer. Mifepristone showed no detectable anti-HIV activity in clinical trials. Mifepristone showed initial promise in psychotic major depression, a difficult-to-treat form of depression, but a phase-III clinical trial was terminated early due to lack of efficacy. It has been studied in bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and anorexia nervosa. == References == == External links == Map and list of mifepristone approvals by year Archived 29 May 2023 at the Wayback Machine",Mifepriston,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.3364747903542593e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000442407006630674)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Mifepristone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone?utm_source=openai')])"

Verucerfont blocks the CRH-1 receptor, and so reduces ACTH release following chronic stress. It is under investigation as a potential treatment for alcoholism, as chronic stress is often a factor in both development of alcoholism and relapse in recovering alcoholics.

3377,"('Tricaprilin', 'Trioctanoin', 'Glyceryl trioctanoate', 'Tricaprylin', 'Glycerol trioctanoate')","Food, Medical","Axona was previously marketed as a medical food for the clinical dietary management of the impairment of metabolic processes associated with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is a proprietary formulation of fractionated palm kernel oil (caprylic triglyceride), a medium-chain triglyceride. Cericin, the company that makes Axona, states that during digestion, caprylic triglyceride is broken down into ketones, which provide an alternative energy source for the brain. Its use is based on the idea that the brain's ability to use its normal energy source, glucose, is impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Axona was first sold in March 2009. In 2013, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined Axona was misbranded because the product was labeled and marketed as a medical food but does not meet the statutory definition of a medical food. Axona has not been approved by the FDA as a drug to treat Alzheimer's and the efficacy of managing the health of Alzheimer's patients by use of this medical food has been questioned by experts in the field, including the Alzheimer's Association. == Description == Axona is a medical food marketed to assist with dietary management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Axona is formulated for oral administration and is sold by prescription. The largest ingredient in Axona is caprylic triglyceride, also known as fractionated coconut oil, a medium-chain triglyceride. caprylic triglyceride is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. A medical food in the US is an official FDA product classification, and was originally defined by Congress as part of the Orphan Drug Amendments of 1988 as ""a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered through a feeding tube under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."" Medical foods are not drugs and cannot be marketed as treating or preventing a disease or condition; the FDA does not evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical foods. == Proposed mechanism of action of Axona == Alzheimer's disease is clinically characterized by a progressive decline in memory and language, and pathologically by accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Because Alzheimer's disease is also characterized by a reduced ability of some areas of the brain to use glucose, some scientists have proposed that treatments targeting metabolic deficits in the brain of Alzheimer's patients may have efficacy. The makers of Axona claim that after oral administration of Axona, the caprylic triglyceride in Axona are processed by enzymes in the gut, and the resulting medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are absorbed into the blood supply leading to the liver. The MCFAs rapidly pass directly to the liver, where they undergo oxidation to form ketones. Since the liver does not use ketones, they are released into the circulation to be used by nonliver tissues. These ketones can cross the blood-brain barrier and are then taken up by brain cells. While glucose is the brain's chief energy source, ketones normally serve as the ""backup"" energy source. Ketones act as an alternative energy source for brain cells that have an impaired ability to use glucose (sugar) as a result of Alzheimer's disease, and the makers of Axona claim that this may have medical benefits. == Clinical trials == Axona has been evaluated in Phase II clinical trials, paid for and conducted by Cerecin, only one of which was published in an open-access journal in 2009. == Sales and marketing == The product launched in 2009. By 2012 it was being administered to about 30,000 patients in the US. == Criticism == A 2011 story by ABC News noted widespread concern about Axona in the medical community, with some calling it ""snake oil."" The theory that the brain in Alzheimer's disease patients is better able to use ketones than glucose is not widely accepted among AD clinicians and researchers. The Alzheimer's Association has classified Axona an ""alternative treatment"", has ""expressed concern that there is not enough evidence to assess the potential benefit of medical foods for Alzheimer’s disease"", and notes that the safety of Axona is not regulated in the way that drugs are. Glenn Smith, Ph.D, a clinical neuropsychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, also noted that Axona's safety and efficacy are not known, and noted that ""the Alzheimer's Association doesn't recommend the use of medical foods, including Axona, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."" In 2013, FDA determined that Axona is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] because the labeling is false and misleading in that the product is labeled and marketed as a medical food but does not meet the statutory definition of a medical food. == See also == Ketogenic diet == References ==",Tricaprylin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.003245800966396928), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.9623521566390991), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.014471219852566719), ('ĠMED', -0.08042384684085846), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062364403158426285)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -3.583550642360933e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0001584850688232109), (' INDUSTR', -0.3133162558078766), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.16022422909736633), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci-ingredients/tricaprylin,https://inci.guide/organic-compounds/tricaprylin,https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/c2113719b7eb4b84a57661a47c1dad58 ', [])"

Common side effects include abdominal pain, chest discomfort, drowsiness, headache, and nausea. It works as a non-selective voltage-gated sodium channel blocker and belongs to the Class IB group of anti-arrhythmic medications. == Medical uses == Mexiletine has several uses including the treatment of abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias, chronic pain, and myotonia. In general when treating arrhythmias, mexiletine is reserved for use in dangerous heart rhythm disturbances such as ventricular tachycardia. It is of particular use when treating arrhythmias caused by long QT syndrome. The LQT3 form of long QT syndrome is amenable to treatment with mexiletine as this form is caused by defective sodium channels that continue to release a sustained current rather than fully inactivating, however other forms of long QT syndrome can also be treated with this medication. Mexiletine has been used to treat chronic pain and may also be used to treat muscle stiffness resulting from myotonic dystrophy (Steinert's disease) or nondystrophic myotonias such as myotonia congenita (Thomsen syndrome or Becker syndrome). == Adverse effects == Common side effects of mexiletine include abdominal pain, chest discomfort, drowsiness, headache, nausea and skin reactions. Uncommon or rare side effects include seizures and liver dysfunction. == Pharmacology == Mexiletine is an oral analogue of lidocaine. It is a class IB antiarrhythmic which shorten the refractory period and action potential duration (APD). Decrease in APD more than that of ERP so there is increase ERP/APD ratio. The drug has a bioavailability of 90%, and peak plasma concentrations are seen after 2–4 hours. The mean drug half-life is approximately 11 hours. Mexiletine is predominantly metabolised by the liver. The pharmacokinetics of mexiletine are preserved with even moderate to severe renal impairment, but dose adjustment may be required when creatinine clearance falls below 10 mL/minute. == Synthesis == == Society and culture == Mexiletine is available for human use in the US, and has been reintroduced in the UK as a licensed product, having previously only been available as a 'named patient' import. The drug is sold under the trade name Mexitil for use in arrhythmias and NaMuscla for use in myotonia. == Veterinary uses == Mexiletine is available to veterinarians in the US for the treatment of heart disease in dogs. It is commonly used for the treatment of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in Boxer dogs in combination with sotalol. == References == == Further reading == Peck T, Hill S, Williams M, eds.

The first publication about fexaramine in 2003 showed it has 100-fold greater affinity for FXR than natural compounds and described the genomic targets and binding site on FXR. When administered orally to mice, fexaramine produced selective actions through FXR receptors in the intestines. Consistent with the effects of other FXR agonist drugs, in a study in mice, oral fexaramine stimulated intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15) production and resulted in metabolic improvements. Intestinal tissue-specific actions of fexaramine were suggested to be a possible new approach for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. However it cannot be determined from these preliminary results in mice whether FXR agonism with fexaramine will produce weight loss in humans.

3380,"('Active isomer 2', 'Ex-a669', 'S7963')",Medical," 2-Amino-1,7-dimethylimidazo[4,5-g]quinoxaline (MeIgQx) is a recently discovered heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA) that is formed during the cooking of meats. MeIgQx is an isomer of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylmidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), a rodent carcinogen and possible human carcinogen that also occurs in cooked meats. MeIgQx is a bacterial mutagen, but knowledge about its metabolism and carcinogenic potential is lacking. Metabolism studies on MeIgQx and MeIQx were conducted with human and mouse liver microsomes, and recombinant human P450s. DNA binding studies were also investigated in mice to ascertain the genotoxic potential of MeIgQx in comparison to MeIQx. Both HAAs underwent comparable rates of N-oxidation to form genotoxic N-hydroxylated metabolites with mouse liver microsomes (0.2-0.3 nmol/min/mg protein). The rate of N-oxidation of MeIQx was 4-fold greater than the rate of N-oxidation of MeIgQx with human liver microsomes (1.7 vs 0.4 nmol/min/mg protein). The rate of N-oxidation, by recombinant human P450 1A2, was comparable for both substrates (6 pmol/min/pmol P450 1A2). MeIgQx also underwent N-oxidation by human P450s 1A1 and 1B1 at appreciable rates, whereas MeIQx was poorly metabolized by these P450s. The potential of MeIgQx and MeIQx to form DNA adducts was assessed in female C57BL/6 mice given [(14)C]-MeIgQx (10 μCi, 9.68 mg/kg body wt) or [(14)C]-MeIQx (10 μCi, 2.13 mg/kg body wt). DNA adduct formation in the liver, pancreas, and colorectum was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry at 4, 24, or 48 h post-treatment. Variable levels of adducts were detected in all organs. The adduct levels were similar for both HAAs, when adjusted for dose, and ranged from 1 to 600 adducts per 10(7) nucleotides per mg/kg dose. Thus, MeIgQx undergoes metabolic activation and binds to DNA at levels that are comparable to MeIQx. Given the high amounts of MeIgQx formed in cooked meats, further investigations are warranted to assess the carcinogenic potential of this HAA. The present in vitro investigations on amantadine (AmTd) and its isomer 2-aminoadamantane (2-NH2-Adam), and the corresponding analogs, 1-nitroadamantane (1-NO2-Adam) and 2-nitroadamantane (2-NO2-Adam), were undertaken to gain information about molecular features that might have a dominant role in inhibiting T lymphocyte proliferation and to determine whether all, or a subpopulation of thymic-dependent (T) lymphocytes might be impacted by these drugs. Studies were done using lymphocytes from untreated normal mice as well as cloned murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTLL cells. T lymphocytes were defined by their proliferative response to concanavalin A (Con A), and thymic-independent (B) lymphocytes by their proliferative response lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Proliferation of CTLL cells was induced by supplementing the culture medium with lymphokine-containing medium or by adding recombinant interleukin (IL)-2. Proliferation was assessed by quantifying cellular incorporation of tritiated thymidine. The data show that the aminoadamantanes, AmTd and 2-NH2-Adam, impacted on Lyt-2+ T lymphocytes while sparing L3T4+ T lymphocytes. In addition, the data show that the location of the substituent group on the adamantane ring altered the molecule's capacity to modulate lymphocyte activity. And finally, results of studies comparing the inhibitory activity of AmTd and 1-NO2-Adam suggest a non-lysosomal mechanism of action.

3382,"('Mk 8033', 'Ex-a2612')",Medical," Background C-Met, which is frequently activated in multiple cancers, has been implicated in tumor formation, progression, metastasis, angiogenesis, and resistance to multiple therapies. MK-8033 is a small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met that binds preferentially to the activated conformation, and has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. This first-in-human trial was performed to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity. Methods Forty-seven patients were enrolled in three parts. The primary objective of Parts A and B was safety, whereas Part C evaluated the effect of proton-pump inhibitors on MK-8033 absorption. Dose escalation used an accelerated continual reassessment method, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were any treatment-related, first course non-hematologic grade ≥ 3 toxicity (except alopecia or inadequately treated nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), grade 4 hematologic toxicity (except grade 3 neutropenic fever and thrombocytopenia), or toxicity where treatment is held >3 weeks. Results Forty-six patients were treated across nine dose levels, and the MTD was 750 mg twice daily. DLTs were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, transaminitis, and hypokalemia. Most frequent toxicities were fatigue (28.3%), nausea (21.7%), and alopecia (19.6%), predominately grade ≤ 2. One patient with endometriod adenocarcinoma achieved a partial response and eight had stable disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 57 days. Strikingly, the PFS for the one responder was 846 days. PK results showed that proton-pump inhibitors have no effect on MK-8033 absorption. Conclusion MK-8033 was well tolerated with no significant toxicity issues, albeit with limited clinical activity. Unfortunately, the company decided to discontinue further clinical development of MK-8033. This report documents the first example of a specific inhibitor of protein kinases with preferential binding to the activated kinase conformation: 5H-benzo[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2-b]pyridin-5-one 11r (MK-8033), a dual c-Met/Ron inhibitor under investigation as a treatment for cancer. The design of 11r was based on the desire to reduce time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 (TDI) by members of this structural class. A novel two-step protocol for the synthesis of benzylic sulfonamides was developed to access 11r and analogues. We provide a rationale for the observed selectivity based on X-ray crystallographic evidence and discuss selectivity trends with additional examples. Importantly, 11r provides full inhibition of tumor growth in a c-Met amplified (GTL-16) subcutaneous tumor xenograft model and may have an advantage over inactive form kinase inhibitors due to equal potency against a panel of oncogenic activating mutations of c-Met in contrast to c-Met inhibitors without preferential binding to the active kinase conformation.",Mk 8033,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6931519508361816)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005500538740307093), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133496642112732)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29376210/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='First-in-human phase I dose escalation study of MK-8033 in patients with advanced solid tumors - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29376210/?utm_source=openai')])"

3384,"('Ranitidine (hydrochloride)', 'Ranitidine', 'Ranitidine base', 'Raticina', 'Ranitidina')",Medical,"Ranitidine, previously sold under the brand name Zantac among others, is a medication used to decrease stomach acid production. It was commonly used in treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It can be given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. In September 2019, the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls. In April 2020, ranitidine was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in the European Union and Australia due to these concerns. In 2022, these concerns were confirmed in a Taiwanese nationwide population study finding ""significant trends of increased liver cancer risk with an increasing dose of ranitidine"" (up to 22% higher than control) and increased gastric, pancreatic, lung and overall cancer risk. Common side effects include headaches, and pain or burning sensation if given by injection. Serious side effects may include cancer, liver problems, a slow heart rate, pneumonia, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. It is also linked to an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis. Ranitidine is an H2 histamine receptor antagonist that works by blocking histamine, thus decreasing the amount of acid released by cells of the stomach. Ranitidine was discovered in England in 1976 and came into commercial use in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It has been withdrawn at regulator request from most markets, including the United States; according to the UK NHS, it has been discontinued globally. == Former medical uses == Relief of heartburn Short-term and maintenance therapy of gastric and duodenal ulcers With nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce the risk of ulceration Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more effective for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers. Pathologic gastrointestinal (GI) hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD or GERD) Erosive esophagitis Part of a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication to minimise the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence Recurrent postoperative ulcer Upper GI bleeding For prevention of acid-aspiration pneumonitis during surgery, it can be administered preoperatively. The drug increases gastric pH, but generally has no effect on gastric volume. In a 2009 meta-analysis comparing the net benefit of PPIs and ranitidine to reduce the risk of aspiration before anaesthesia, ranitidine was found to be more effective than PPIs in reducing the volume of gastric secretions. Ranitidine may have an anti-emetic effect when administered preoperatively. Prevention of stress-induced ulcers in critically ill patients Used together with diphenhydramine as secondary treatment for anaphylaxis; after first-line epinephrine. == Contraindication == Ranitidine has been discontinued globally, according to the NHS, and is contraindicated due to excess cancer risk and the ready availability of H2 antagonist and PPI alternatives. == Adverse effects == These adverse effects for ranitidine have been reported as events in clinical trials: === Central nervous system === Rare reports have been made of ranitidine causing malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and vertigo. In severely ill, elderly patients, cases of reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression, and hallucinations have been reported. === Cardiovascular === Arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats have also been reported. === Gastrointestinal === All drugs in the H2 receptor blocker class of medicines have the potential to cause vitamin B12 deficiency, secondary to a reduction in food-bound vitamin B12 absorption. Elderly patients taking H2 receptor antagonists are more likely to require B12 supplementation than those not taking such drugs. H2 blockers may also reduce the absorption of drugs (azole antifungals, calcium carbonate) that require an acidic stomach. In addition, multiple studies suggest the use of H2 receptor antagonists such as ranitidine may increase the risk of infectious diarrhoea, including traveller's diarrhoea and salmonellosis. A 2005 study found that by suppressing acid-mediated breakdown of proteins, ranitidine may lead to an elevated risk of developing food or drug allergies, due to undigested proteins then passing into the GI tract, where sensitisation occurs. Patients who take these agents develop higher levels of immunoglobulin E against food, whether they had prior antibodies or not. Even months after discontinuation, an elevated level of IgE in 6% of patients was still found in the study. === Liver === Cholestatic hepatitis, liver failure, hepatitis, and jaundice have been noted, and require immediate discontinuation of the drug. Blood tests can reveal an increase in liver enzymes or eosinophilia, although in rare instances, severe cases of hepatotoxicity may require a liver biopsy. === Lungs === Ranitidine and other histamine H2 receptor antagonists may increase the risk of pneumonia in hospitalised patients. Ranitidine increases the risk of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and children. === Blood === Thrombocytopenia is a rare but known side effect. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia usually takes weeks or months to appear, but may appear within 12 hours of drug intake in a sensitised individual. Typically, the platelet count falls to 80% of normal, and thrombocytopenia may be associated with neutropenia and anemia. === Skin === Rash, including rare cases of erythema multiforme, and rare cases of hair loss and vasculitis have been seen. == Precautions == === Disease-related concerns === Relief of symptoms due to the use of ranitidine does not exclude the presence of a gastric malignancy. In addition, with kidney or liver impairment, ranitidine must be used with caution. It should be avoided in patients with porphyria, as it may precipitate an attack. === Children === In children, the use of gastric acid inhibitors has been associated with an increased risk for development of acute gastroenteritis and community-acquired pneumonia. A cohort analysis including over 11,000 neonates reported an association of H2 blocker use, and an increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates. In addition, about a six-fold increase in mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, and infection such as sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection was reported in patients receiving ranitidine in a cohort analysis of 274 VLBW neonates. === Drug tests === Ranitidine may return a false positive result with some commercial urine drug screening kits for testing for drugs of abuse. === Cancer-causing due to inherent instability === In June 2019, Valisure informed the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that Zantac-branded and generic ranitidine resulted in very high levels of NDMA in the human body ""due to an inherent instability of the ranitidine molecule"". In September 2019, the FDA acknowledged that ranitidine medicines, including some products sold under the brand name Zantac, contained a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at unacceptable levels. Health Canada announced that it was assessing NDMA in ranitidine and requested that manufacturers stop the distribution of ranitidine products in Canada until the NDMA levels in the products are found to be safe. Health Canada announced that ranitidine drugs were being recalled by Sandoz Canada, Apotex Inc., Pro Doc Limitée, Sanis Health Inc., and Sivem Pharmaceuticals ULC. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) started a European Union-wide review of ranitidine medicines at the request of the European Commission. In October 2019, the US. FDA observed that the third-party laboratory that found very high levels of NDMA was using higher temperatures in its tests to detect nitrosamine impurities. The NDMA was mostly generated by the added heat, but the higher temperatures are recommended for using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method to test for NDMA in valsartan and angiotensin II receptor blockers. The FDA stated that it recommends using a Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) testing protocol to test samples of ranitidine. Its LC-HRMS testing method does not use elevated temperatures, and has shown the presence of much lower levels of NDMA in ranitidine medicines than were reported by the third-party laboratory. International regulators using similar LC-MS testing methods have also shown the presence of lower but still unacceptable levels of NDMA in ranitidine samples. The FDA provided additional guidance about using another LC-MS method based on a triple-quadrupole MS platform. In September 2019, Sandoz issued a ""precautionary distribution stop"" of all medicines containing ranitidine, followed a few days later by a recall of ranitidine hydrochloride capsules in the United States. The Italian Medicines Agency recalled all ranitidine that uses an active pharmaceutical ingredient from Saraca Laboratories. The Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (Arzneimittelkommission der Deutschen Apotheker) published a list of recalled products, as did the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. In November 2019, the FDA stated that its tests found levels of NDMA in ranitidine and nizatidine that are similar to those that one may typically ingest with common foods such as grilled or smoked meats. The FDA also stated that its simulated gastric fluid model tests and simulated intestinal fluid model tests indicated that NDMA is not formed when exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. The FDA advised companies to recall their ranitidine if testing shows levels of NDMA above the acceptable daily intake (96 nanograms per day or 0.32 parts per million for ranitidine). At the same time, it indicated that some levels of NDMA found in medicines still exceeded the agency's acceptable levels. In December 2019, the FDA asked manufacturers of ranitidine and nizatidine products to expand their NDMA testing to include all lots of the medication before making them available to consumers. By the end of 2019, ranitidine had already fallen from the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States in 2018, to 53rd place for 2019, with about 13.6 million prescriptions for the year, versus nearly 19 million the previous year. This reflects total prescriptions for all of 2019, while safety concerns affected sales in only the final 4 months of the year. In April 2020, new FDA testing and evaluation prompted by information from third-party laboratories confirmed that NDMA levels increase in ranitidine even under normal storage conditions, and NDMA has been found to increase significantly in samples stored at higher temperatures, including those at which the product may be exposed during distribution and handling by consumers. The testing also showed that the level of NDMA increases as ranitidine medication ages. These conditions may raise the NDMA level above the acceptable daily intake limit. The EMA completed and issued their EU-wide review at the end of the month and the European Commission suspended all ranitidine products in the EU. In August 2020, the EMA provided guidance to marketing authorization holders for avoiding the presence of nitrosamine impurities and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. In September 2020, the FDA issued guidance about the control of nitrosamine impurities in human drugs. An implementation plan was issued in February 2021. In 2022, these concerns were confirmed in a Taiwanese nationwide population study finding ""significant trends of increased liver cancer risk with an increasing dose of ranitidine"" (22% higher than control) and increased gastric, pancreatic, lung (26%, 35%, and 17% respectively), but ""only liver cancer displayed a significant association with long-term ranitidine use"" and ""there was no continuous dose–response relationship among the other individual cancers"". Overall cancer risk also increased by 10% (p < 0.001). The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. ==== List of recalls ==== In September 2019, Apotex recalled all over-the-counter ranitidine tablets sold in the United States at Walmart, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. These retailers, along with CVS, removed Zantac and some generics from their shelves. In October 2019, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom (UK) issued a drug alert for ranitidine ""... to proactively communicate the recall to hospitals, pharmacies, dispensing practices, retailers and wholesalers in the UK."" This included all Zantac-branded preparations, along with all generic preparations of ranitidine from Teva UK Limited, Rosemont Pharmaceuticals Limited, Omega Pharma Limited and Galpharm International Limited, Perrigo Company plc, Creo Pharma Limited and Tillomed Laboratories Limited, OTC Concepts Ltd, Relonchem Ltd, Noumed Life Sciences Ltd, and Medreich Plc., Accord Healthcare, Medley Pharma Limited, and Medreich Plc. In October 2019, the Department of Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom issued a supply distribution alert (SDA/2019/005) for all oral formulations of ranitidine. In October 2019, Sanofi recalled all over-the-counter Zantac in the United States and Canada, Perrigo issued a worldwide recall of ranitidine, Dr. Reddy's issued a recall of all ranitidine products in the United States, and Novitium Pharma recalled all ranitidine hydrochloride capsules in the US. In November 2019, Aurobindo Pharma, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, American Health Packaging, Golden State Medical Supply, and Precision Dose recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets, capsules, and syrup. In December 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceutical Inc., USA, recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets. In January 2020, Appco Pharma LLC and Northwind Pharmaceuticals recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets and capsules. In February 2020, American Health Packaging recalled some lots of ranitidine tablets manufactured by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. In April 2020, the FDA requested a manufacturer's market withdrawal of ranitidine, meaning that ranitidine products would not be available for prescription or over-the-counter sale in the US. In April 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency recommended the suspension of all ranitidine medicines in the European Union because of the presence of unacceptable levels of NDMA. A ranitidine manufacturer requested a re-examination of the decision, but in December 2020, the EMA confirmed its recommendation to suspend all ranitidine medicines in the European Union. The UK National Health Service (NHS) Web site as of December 2021 said ""Ranitidine is not currently available in the UK or globally... It's not yet known whether it will be available again in future."" A March 2024 review left the message up. In 2021, Solara Active Pharma Sciences, which supplies ranitidine active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), said that it had mitigated the risks of the formation of NDMA during the manufacturing of ranitidine API. The company was granted a revised certificate by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare, which proves that the API complies with certain European rules. GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, and Teva said they had no plans to reintroduce the drug in the EU, but Accord Healthcare considered the possible reintroduction of ranitidine. However a control strategy regarding NDMA formation through the end of the product’s shelf life, despite heat, time and digestion due to endogenous formation from the API, would be required. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ranitidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of the action of histamine at the histamine H2 receptors found in gastric parietal cells. This results in decreased gastric acid secretion and gastric volume, and reduced hydrogen ion concentration. Ranitidine's acid-lowering effect is more pronounced for basal and nocturnal acid secretion than it is for food-stimulated acid secretion. Additional indirect effects of ranitidine are decreased pepsin secretion and increased nitrate-reducing bacterial flora. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral absorption: 50% Protein binding: 15% Metabolism: The major metabolite in the urine is ranitidine N-oxide, which represents less than 4% of the dose. Other metabolites of ranitidine include ranitidine S-oxide (1%) and desmethyl ranitidine (1%). Half-life elimination: With normal renal function, ranitidine taken orally has a half-life of 2.5–3.0 hours. If taken intravenously, the half-life is generally 2.0–2.5 hours in a patient with normal kidney function and normal creatinine clearance. In patients with kidney dysfunction, the half-life may increase to 4 to 5 hours. Excretion: The primary route of excretion is the urine. In addition, about 30% of the orally administered dose is collected in the urine as unabsorbed drug in 24 hours. ==== Elderly ==== In the elderly population, the plasma half-life of ranitidine is prolonged to 3–4 hours secondary to decreased kidney function causing decreased clearance. ==== Children ==== In general, studies of pediatric patients (aged one month to 16 years) have shown no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values in comparison to healthy adults, when correction is made for body weight. == History == Ranitidine was first prepared in England as AH19065 by John Bradshaw in the summer of 1977 in the Ware research laboratories of Allen and Hanburys, part of the former Glaxo organisation. Its development was a response to the first in class histamine H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, developed by Sir James Black at Smith, Kline and French, and launched in the United Kingdom as Tagamet in November 1976. Both companies eventually merged as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), following a sequence of mergers and acquisitions, starting with the integration of Allen and Hanbury's Ltd and Glaxo to form Glaxo Group Research in 1979, and ultimately with the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham in 2000. Ranitidine was the result of a rational drug-design process using what was by then a fairly refined model of the histamine H2 receptor and quantitative structure-activity relationships. Glaxo refined the model further, by replacing the imidazole ring of cimetidine with a furan ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, and in doing so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine. Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to CYP450, so it causes fewer side effects, but other H2 blockers famotidine and nizatidine have no CYP450 significant interactions. Ranitidine was introduced in 1981, and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1987. Subsequently, it was largely superseded by the more effective proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) class of drugs, with omeprazole becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years. When omeprazole and ranitidine were compared in a study of 144 people with severe inflammation and erosions or ulcers of the oesophagus, 85% of those treated with omeprazole healed within eight weeks, compared with 50% of those given ranitidine. In addition, the omeprazole group reported earlier relief of heartburn symptoms. In September 2019, the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls; in April 2020, it was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in Europe and Australia. == Preparations == Preparations of ranitidine products include oral tablets (75, 150, and 300 mg), effervescent tablets, and syrups, and injectable solutions; with doses of specific ranitidine product preparations are available over-the-counter (OTC) in various countries. In the United Kingdom, only the lowest-strength, 75-mg tablet was available to purchase without a prescription. In Australia, packs containing seven or 14 doses of the 150-mg tablet were available in supermarkets, small packs of 150-mg and 300-mg tablets were schedule 2 pharmacy medicines. Larger doses and pack sizes required a prescription. In the United States, 75- and 150-mg tablets were available OTC. In India, it is sold under multiple brand names. == References == == Notes == == External links == ""Ranitidine Injection"".

Dioscin is a steroidal saponin with potent anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and hypolipidemic effects. This study examined the protective effect of Dioscin on UC in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms. Mice were induced colitis by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and concurrently treated with Dioscin oral administration. RAW264.7 cells were skewed to M1 macrophage polarization by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (INF-γ) in vitro, and received Dioscin treatment. The results showed that Dioscin ameliorated colitis in mice, reduced macrophage M1 polarization, but markedly promoted M2 polarization in mice colon. Dioscin inhibited mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling and restrained glycolysis in RAW264.7; however, it activated mammalian target rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) signal and facilitated fatty acid oxidation (FAO). The modulation of mTORs signaling may inhibit M1, but promote M2 polarization. Furthermore, the effect of Dioscin on M2 polarization was neutralized by the FAO inhibitor Etomoxir and the mTORC2 inhibitor JR-AB2-011. In parallel, the inhibitory effect of Dioscin on M1 polarization was mitigated by the mTORC1 agonist L-leucine. Both JR-AB2-011 and L-leucine blocked the therapeutic effect of Dioscin in mice with UC. Therefore, Dioscin ameliorated UC in mice, possibly by restraining M1, while skewing M2 polarization of macrophages. Regulation of mTORC1/HIF-1α and mTORC2/PPAR-γ signals is a possible mechanism by which Dioscin inhibited aerobic glycolysis and promoted FAO of macrophages. In summary, Dioscin protected mice against DSS-induced UC by regulating mTOR signaling, thereby adjusting macrophage metabolism and polarization. Occupational exposure to crystalline silica (CS) particles leads to silicosis, which is characterized by chronic inflammation and abnormal tissue repair. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a crucial role in the process of silicosis. Previously, we demonstrated positive effect of dioscin on silicosis through modulating macrophage-elicited innate immune response. However, the concrete molecular mechanism remains to be discovered.  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) as its characteristic pathological changes. Ameliorating oxidative stress and inflammation has become a new trend in the prevention and treatment of AD. Dioscin, a natural steroidal saponin which exists in Dioscoreae nipponicae rhizomes, displays various pharmacological activities, but its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unknown.

3386,"('Budesonide', 'Pulmicort', 'Rhinocort', 'Entocort', 'Preferid')",Medical,"Budesonide, sold under the brand name Pulmicort, among others, is a steroid medication. It is available as an inhaler, nebulization solution, pill, nasal spray, and rectal forms. The inhaled form is used in the long-term management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The nasal spray is used for allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps. Modified-release pills or capsules and rectal forms may be used for inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis. Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, cough, and headaches. Common side effects with the pills include feeling tired, vomiting, and joint pains. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, loss of bone strength, and cataracts. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. Stopping the pills suddenly following long-term use may therefore be dangerous. The inhaled form is generally safe in pregnancy. Budesonide chiefly acts as a glucocorticoid. Budesonide was initially patented in 1973. Commercial use as an asthma medication began in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Some forms are available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 177th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Asthma === Budesonide is given by metered-dose inhaler or nebulizer for maintenance and prophylactic treatment of asthma, including patients who require oral corticosteroids and those who may benefit from a systemic dose reduction. === Inflammatory bowel disease === Formulations of delayed-release budesonide are an effective treatment for mild-to-moderately active Crohn's disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon. A Cochrane review found evidence for up to three months (but not longer) of maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, concluding that budesonide is not effective for maintenance of remission in CD. Budesonide assists in the induction of remission in people with active ulcerative colitis. Budesonide is highly effective and recommended as the drug of choice in microscopic colitis, for induction and maintenance of remission, and for both the lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis forms. === Allergic rhinitis === Budesonide in the form of nasal sprays is a treatment for allergic rhinitis. === Eosinophilic esophagitis === Topical budesonide has considerable effects in eosinophilic esophagitis. For this use, it is formulated as a tablet that disperses in the mouth, and sold under the brand name Jorveza. === Berger's disease === Budesonide (Tarpeyo (US); Kinpeygo (EU, UK)) is indicated to reduce proteinuria (increased protein levels in the urine) in adults with primary immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (Berger's disease) at risk of rapid disease progression. == Side effects == Nasal budesonide inhalers have been associated with a number of side effects. These include nose irritation or burning, bleeding or sores in the nose, lightheadedness, upset stomach, cough, hoarseness, dry mouth, rash, sore throat, bad taste in mouth, change in mucus, and blurred vision. Other symptoms which should be reported immediately include difficulty in breathing, swelling of the face, white patches in the throat, mouth, or nose, irregular menstrual periods, severe acne, and on rare occasions, behavioral changes (mostly affecting children). === Overdose === Acute toxicity from an overdose of Budesonide is significantly more rare than an overdosing of budesonide over a prolonged period of therapy, however both can can cause systemic toxicity that manifests as hypercortisolism. Symptoms of an overdose include more specific symptoms such as darkening and thinning of the skin, changes in body fat around the face, neck, back, and waist, increased acne or facial hair, menstrual problems, impotence, or loss of interest in sex, as well as some less specific symptoms such as diarrhea, dizziness, loss of appetite, mental depression, nausea, skin rash, unusual tiredness or weakness, or vomiting. == Contraindications == Budesonide is contraindicated in people with: Known hypersensitivity to budesonide or any component of the formulation. Status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma which would require intensive, immediate measures. In Canada, there are additional contraindications labeled for Budesonide for people with: Systemic or local bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Active or quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis. == Interactions == Budesonide is mainly metabolized in the liver by the enzyme CYP3A4. Drugs that are CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, and nefazodone, among many others, may inhibit the metabolism of Budesonide, prolonging its elimination and leading to possible increased rates of corticosteroid adverse effects due to unwanted drug accumulation. Grapefruit is also a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and therefore its consumption is not recommended while on budesonide treatment. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Budesonide is an agonist of glucocorticoid receptors. Among its effects are: Controls the rate of protein synthesis. Depresses the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibroblasts. Reverses capillary permeability and lysosomal stabilization at the cellular level to prevent or control inflammation. Has a potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Different pharmacokinetic proprieties can be seen in the absorption of budesonide depending on how it is formulated. When taken as an extended-release oral capsule, budesonide has an oral bioavailability of 9–21% and reaches peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) within 2–8 hours. A high fat meal when taken with the capsule can lengthen the time it takes to reach Cmax by another 2.3 hours, but will not have any other affects on the pharmacokinetics properties of budesonide. When inhaled through an metered dose inhaler, 34% of budesonide is deposited in the lung with a bioavailability of 39% and reaches Cmax within 10 minutes. When nebulized, budesonide has an bioavailability of 6% and reaches Cmax within 1–3 hours. When formulated as a rectal foam, budesonide has an bioavailability of 3% to 27% and reaches Cmax around 1.5 hours. The plasma protein binding of budesonide is around 85-90%, with an apparent volume of distribution of 2.2-3.9L/kg. Budesonide is 80-90% metabolized at first pass in the liver by the hepatocytic cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) into two metabolites: 16 alpha-hydroxyprednisolone and 6 beta-hydroxybudesonide. Both of these metabolites have a negligible glucocorticoid activity of less than 1% compared to the parent compound budesonide. 60% of budesonide is excreted is through the urine as its metabolites, no unchanged budesonide is detectable in urine. The average elimination half-life in plasma is between 2-3.6 hours. == Chemistry == Budesonide, also known as 11β,21-dihydroxy-16α,17α-(butylidenebis(oxy))pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and non-halogenated cyclic ketal corticosteroid. It is the C16α hydroxyl, C16α,17α cyclic ketal with butyraldehyde derivative of prednisolone (11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione). === Stereoisomerism === == Society and culture == === Brand names === Budesonide is marketed under various brand and generic names internationally. Notable examples for each formulation include: Inhalation: Pulmicort, Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Nebuamp, Pulmicort Turbuhaler, TARO-Budesonide, TEVA-Budesonide, Novolizer budesonid meda, Budenova. Systemic (oral pills): Tarpeyo, Uceris, Eohilia, Cortiment, Entocort Jorveza. Nasal: MYLAN-Budesonide AQ, Rhinocort Aqua, Formancis. Topical: Entocort, Uceris, Budenofalk. == Economics == In 2019, 44 US states filed a lawsuit claiming that leading drug companies including Teva, Pfizer, Novartis and Mylan conspired to inflate the prices of over a hundred generic drugs, including budesonide, as much as tenfold. === Legal status === Kinpeygo, a hybrid medicine of Entocort (which has been authorised in the EU since 2 April 1992) that contains the same active substance as Entocort but has a different formulation and a different indication, was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2022. The FDA granted the application breakthrough therapy designation. == Research == === COVID-19 === Budesonide was recommended in April 2021 by the UK's NHS to treat COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis for those aged 50 years of age and older. After a University of Oxford research team found in a trial with 1,700 patients that budesonide could benefit many people over 50 with COVID-19 symptoms, it was recommended from 12 April 2021, by the National Health Service in the UK for general practitioners (GPs) to treat COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis. Results of a large-scale trial published in August 2021 suggest that inhaled budesonide improves the time of recovery and people's well-being during the recovery process. Inhalational budesonide was added to the recommended treatment for cases of COVID-19 in India in April 2021. The NIH recommendation was withdrawn in December 2021 citing the need for more research. == References == == External links == ""Budesonide Nasal Spray"". MedlinePlus. ""Budesonide Oral Inhalation"".

It was proved as an ideal antimicrobial compound with broad and effective antimicrobial activity against both bacteria and fungi. In addition, it could be used as feed additives to replace antibiotics in livestock feeds. This article presented a review of recent studies on the existing resource, antimicrobial activity, and measurement of PLA. In addition, microorganism strains and dehydrogenases producing PLA were reviewed in detail, the metabolic pathway and regulation of PLA synthesis in LAB strains were discussed, and high-level bioproduction of PLA by microorganism fermentation was also summarized. Phenyllactic acid (PLA) is capable of inhibiting the growth of many microorganisms, showing a broad-spectrum antimicrobial property, which allows it to hold vast applications in the: food, feed, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries, especially in the field of food safety. Recently, the production of PLA has garnered considerable attention due to the increasing awareness of food safety from the public. Accordingly, this review mainly updates the recent development for the production of PLA through microbial fermentation and whole-cell catalysis (expression single-, double-, and triple-enzyme) strategies. Firstly, the: physicochemical properties, existing sources, and measurement methods of PLA are systematically covered. Then, the inhibition spectrum of PLA is summarized, and synchronously, the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm mechanisms of PLA on commonly pathogenic microorganisms in foods are described in detail, thereby clarifying the reason for extending the shelf life of foods. Additionally, the factors affecting the production of PLA are summarized from the biosynthesis and catabolism pathway of PLA in microorganisms, as well as external environmental parameters insights. Finally, the downstream treatment process and applications of PLA are discussed and outlined. In the future, clinical data should be supplemented with the metabolic kinetics of PLA in humans and to evaluate animal toxicology, to enable regulatory use of PLA as a food additive. A food-grade host, such as  Phenyllactic acid (PLA), a natural antimicrobial substance, has many potential applications in the food, animal feed, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. However, its production is limited by the complex reaction steps involved in its chemical synthesis. Through advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies, enzymatic or whole-cell catalysis was developed as an alternative method for PLA production. Herein, we review recent developments in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies that promote the microbial production of high-value PLA. Specially, the advantages and disadvantages of the using of the three kinds of substrates, which includes phenylpyruvate, phenylalanine and glucose as starting materials by natural or engineered microbes is summarized. Notably, the bio-conversion of PLA often requires the consumption of expensive coenzyme NADH. To overcome the issues of NADH regeneration, efficiently internal cofactor regeneration systems constructed by co-expressing different enzyme combinations composed of lactate dehydrogenase with others for enhancing the PLA production, as well as their possible improvements, are discussed. In particular, the construction of fusion proteins with different linkers can achieve higher PLA yield and more efficient cofactor regeneration than that of multi-enzyme co-expression. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of PLA biosynthesis pathways and strategies for increasing PLA yield through biotechnology, providing future directions for the large-scale commercial production of PLA and the expansion of downstream applications.",​(+)​-​phenyllactic acid,PUBMED,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0025529502891004086), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0002615742268972099), (' PERSONAL', -0.196845144033432), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0031806828919798136), (' INDUSTR', -0.47413772344589233), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.009063057601451874), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.02330414578318596), ('ĠINDU', -0.06579796969890594), ('ST', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47413402795791626)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.1279553291387856e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/compounds/FDB022236?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9772785/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=204, start_index=33, title='FComEx: Showing Compound Phenyllactic acid (FDB022236)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/compounds/FDB022236?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=204, start_index=33, title='Investigation of phenyllactic acid as a potent tyrosinase inhibitor produced by probiotics - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9772785/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.",B-phenyllactic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.3306015716807451e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0031956578604876995), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04891670122742653)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.018156031146645546), ('OD', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000464?utm_source=openai), [foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/compounds/FDB022236?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9772785/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=291, start_index=33, title='FComEx: L-3-Phenyllactic acid (PC000464)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000464?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=291, start_index=33, title='FComEx: Showing Compound Phenyllactic acid (FDB022236)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/compounds/FDB022236?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=291, start_index=33, title='Investigation of phenyllactic acid as a potent tyrosinase inhibitor produced by probiotics - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9772785/?utm_source=openai')])"
3390,"('Alpha-estradiol', 'Alfatradiol', 'Epiestradiol', 'Epiestrol', 'Estradiol-17alpha')","Endogenous, Medical","17α-Estradiol (also known as 17α-E2, 17-epiestradiol, alfatradiol, or estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17α-diol) is a minor and weak endogenous steroidal estrogen that is related to 17β-estradiol (better known simply as estradiol). It is the C17 epimer of estradiol. It has approximately 100-fold lower estrogenic potency than 17β-estradiol. The compound shows preferential affinity for the ERα over the ERβ. Although 17α-estradiol is far weaker than 17β-estradiol as an agonist of the nuclear estrogen receptors, it has been found to bind to and activate the brain-expressed ER-X with a greater potency than that of 17β-estradiol, suggesting that it may be the predominant endogenous ligand for the receptor. == Biosynthesis == 17α-Estradiol is produced from epitestosterone by aromatase at locations not fully characterized (known to include the brain). Where and how epitestosterone is made is not fully understood. Conversion between 17α-estradiol and estrone seems to occur, but the enzymes remain unidentified. == Occurrence == 17α-E2 is found in mice brain, regardless of age and sex, at concentrations much higher than 17β-E2. Gonadectomized and/or adrenalectomized mice continue to have high brain levels of 17α-E2. 17α-E2 poorly binds α-fetoprotein, unlike 17β-E2. 17α-E2 is excreted in urine. It was initially discovered in pregnant mare urine (see conjugated estrogens). In a 2022 study, all six tested human urine samples contained detectable amounts of 17α-E2. == Function == As mentioned before, 17α-estradiol binds to ERα and ERβ with moderate affinity but very low activity. It binds to the brain-localized ER-X with significant activity and may play a neuroprotective role. In the uterus, 17α-estradiol causes smooth muscle relaxation via a nongenomic pathway, similarly to 17β-estradiol; the effect is weaker with no antagonization. It antagonizes the hypertrophic response of 17β-estradiol, probably by acting as an antiestrogen by virtue of its very low activity. == Aging == Supplementation of 17α-Estradiol increases the median lifespan of male mice by 19%, it has no effect on female lifespan. 17α-Estradiol alleviates age-related metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction and improves glucose tolerance in male mice, it does not lead to feminization of male mice. The exact reason for this sex-specific increase in lifespan is unknown, however, the effect on male lifespan is not visible in castrated mice. This suggests that the metabolic response to 17α-Estradiol requires the presence of male gonadal hormones. The effect of 17α-Estradiol on humans is currently unknown. == See also == List of estrogens == References ==",Estradiol-17alpha,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0007339857402257621), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0003360582049936056), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.03619196265935898), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.565611743601039e-05), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.38699179887771606), ('ĠMED', -0.042107559740543365), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006760936230421066)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.3144320547580719), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.011047814972698689), (' MED', -0.00043102685594931245), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL,PERSONAL CARE;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Estradiol,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C02537,https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/57-91-0_252359.html ', [])"
3391,"('Estradiol', 'Œ≤-estradiol', 'Beta-estradiol', 'Oestradiol', 'Dihydrofolliculin')","Endogenous, Medical","Estradiol (E2), also called oestrogen, oestradiol, is an estrogen steroid hormone and the major female sex hormone. It is involved in the regulation of female reproductive cycles such as estrous and menstrual cycles. Estradiol is responsible for the development of female secondary sexual characteristics such as the breasts, widening of the hips and a female pattern of fat distribution. It is also important in the development and maintenance of female reproductive tissues such as the mammary glands, uterus and vagina during puberty, adulthood and pregnancy. It also has important effects in many other tissues including bone, fat, skin, liver, and the brain. Though estradiol levels in males are much lower than in females, estradiol has important roles in males as well. Apart from humans and other mammals, estradiol is also found in most vertebrates and crustaceans, insects, fish, and other animal species. Estradiol is produced within the follicles of the ovaries and in other tissues including the testicles, the adrenal glands, fat, liver, the breasts, and the brain. Estradiol is produced in the body from cholesterol through a series of reactions and intermediates. The major pathway involves the formation of androstenedione, which is then converted by aromatase into estrone and is subsequently converted into estradiol. Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into testosterone, which can then be converted into estradiol. Upon menopause in females, production of estrogens by the ovaries stops and estradiol levels decrease to very low levels. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estradiol is used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy, and feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women and other genderqueer individuals; for information on estradiol as a medication, see the estradiol (medication) article. == Biological function == === Sexual development === The development of secondary sex characteristics in women is driven by estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated at the time of puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks), and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes. === Reproduction === ==== Female reproductive system ==== In the female, estradiol acts as a growth hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting the lining of the vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation. During pregnancy, estradiol increases due to placental production. The effect of estradiol, together with estrone and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase. ==== Male reproductive system ==== The effect of estradiol (and estrogens in general) upon male reproduction is complex. Estradiol is produced by action of aromatase mainly in the Leydig cells of the mammalian testis, but also by some germ cells and the Sertoli cells of immature mammals. It functions (in vitro) to prevent apoptosis of male sperm cells. While some studies in the early 1990s claimed a connection between globally declining sperm counts and estrogen exposure in the environment, later studies found no such connection, nor evidence of a general decline in sperm counts. Suppression of estradiol production in a subpopulation of subfertile men may improve the semen analysis. Males with certain sex chromosome genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, will have a higher level of estradiol. === Skeletal system === Estradiol has a profound effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as epiphyseal closure is delayed or may not take place. Bone density is also affected, resulting in early osteopenia and osteoporosis. Low levels of estradiol may also predict fractures, with post-menopausal women having the highest incidence of bone fracture. Women past menopause experience an accelerated loss of bone mass due to a relative estrogen deficiency. === Skin health === The estrogen receptor, as well as the progesterone receptor, have been detected in the skin, including in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. At menopause and thereafter, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning, and increased wrinkling of the skin and a reduction in skin elasticity, firmness, and strength. These skin changes constitute an acceleration in skin aging and are the result of decreased collagen content, irregularities in the morphology of epidermal skin cells, decreased ground substance between skin fibers, and reduced capillaries and blood flow. The skin also becomes more dry during menopause, which is due to reduced skin hydration and surface lipids (sebum production). Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging. Hormone replacement therapy consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal women. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen has been found to have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal women. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging. === Nervous system === Estrogens can be produced in the brain from steroid precursors. As antioxidants, they have been found to have neuroprotective function. The positive and negative feedback loops of the menstrual cycle involve ovarian estradiol as the link to the hypothalamic-pituitary system to regulate gonadotropins. Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women's mental health, with links suggested between the hormone level, mood and well-being. Sudden drops or fluctuations in, or long periods of sustained low levels of estrogen may be correlated with significant mood-lowering. Clinical recovery from depression postpartum, perimenopause, and postmenopause was shown to be effective after levels of estrogen were stabilized and/or restored. The volumes of sexually dimorphic brain structures in transgender women were found to change and approximate typical female brain structures when exposed to estrogen concomitantly with androgen deprivation over a period of months, suggesting that estrogen and/or androgens have a significant part to play in sex differentiation of the brain, both prenatally and later in life. There is also evidence the programming of adult male sexual behavior in many vertebrates is largely dependent on estradiol produced during prenatal life and early infancy. It is not yet known whether this process plays a significant role in human sexual behavior, although evidence from other mammals tends to indicate a connection. Estrogen has been found to increase the secretion of oxytocin and to increase the expression of its receptor, the oxytocin receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol has been found to be sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations. === Gynecological cancers === Estradiol has been tied to the development and progression of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Estradiol affects target tissues mainly by interacting with two nuclear receptors called estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ). One of the functions of these estrogen receptors is the modulation of gene expression. Once estradiol binds to the ERs, the receptor complexes then bind to specific DNA sequences, possibly causing damage to the DNA and an increase in cell division and DNA replication. Eukaryotic cells respond to damaged DNA by stimulating or impairing G1, S, or G2 phases of the cell cycle to initiate DNA repair. As a result, cellular transformation and cancer cell proliferation occurs. === Cardiovascular system === Estrogen affects certain blood vessels. Improvement in arterial blood flow has been demonstrated in coronary arteries. 17-beta-estradiol (E2) is considered the most potent estrogen found in humans. E2 influences vascular function, apoptosis, and damage during cardiac ischemia and reperfusion. E2 can protect the heart and individual cardiac myocytes from injuries related to ischemia. After a heart attack or long periods of hypertension, E2 inhibits the adverse effects of pathologic remodeling of the heart. During pregnancy, high levels of estrogens, namely estradiol, increase coagulation and the risk of venous thromboembolism. === Other functions === Estradiol has complex effects on the liver. It affects the production of multiple proteins, including lipoproteins, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for blood clotting. In high amounts, estradiol can lead to cholestasis, for instance cholestasis of pregnancy. Certain gynecological conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata uteri, and uterine bleeding. == Biological activity == Estradiol acts primarily as an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear steroid hormone receptor. There are two subtypes of the ER, ERα and ERβ, and estradiol potently binds to and activates both of these receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of gene transcription and expression in ER-expressing cells, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-genomic effects. Unlike the case of the ER, GPER appears to be selective for estradiol, and shows very low affinities for other endogenous estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Additional mERs besides GPER include ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER. ERα/ERβ are in inactive state trapped in multimolecular chaperone complexes organized around the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), containing p23 protein, and immunophilin, and located in majority in cytoplasm and partially in nucleus. In the E2 classical pathway or estrogen classical pathway, estradiol enters the cytoplasm, where it interacts with ERs. Once bound E2, ERs dissociate from the molecular chaperone complexes and become competent to dimerize, migrate to nucleus, and to bind to specific DNA sequences (estrogen response element, ERE), allowing for gene transcription which can take place over hours and days. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. As such, estradiol is the main estrogen in the body, although the roles of estrone and estriol as estrogens are said not to be negligible. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === Estradiol, like other steroid hormones, is derived from cholesterol. After side chain cleavage and using the Δ5 or the Δ4- pathway, androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by aromatase. In an alternative pathway, androstenedione is aromatized to estrone, which is subsequently converted to estradiol via 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). During the reproductive years, most estradiol in women is produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of androstenedione (produced in the theca folliculi cells) to estrone, followed by conversion of estrone to estradiol by 17β-HSD. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes. Estradiol is not produced in the gonads only; in particular, fat cells produce active precursors to estradiol, and will continue to do so even after menopause. Estradiol is also produced in the brain and in arterial walls. In men, approximately 15 to 25% of circulating estradiol is produced in the testicles. The rest is synthesized via peripheral aromatization of testosterone into estradiol and of androstenedione into estrone (which is then transformed into estradiol via peripheral 17β-HSD). This peripheral aromatization occurs predominantly in adipose tissue, but also occurs in other tissues such as bone, liver, and the brain. Approximately 40 to 50 μg of estradiol is produced per day in men. === Distribution === In plasma, estradiol is largely bound to SHBG and albumin. Only about 2.21% (± 0.04%) of estradiol is free and biologically active. The percentage remains constant throughout the menstrual cycle. === Metabolism === Inactivation of estradiol includes conversion to less-active estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Estriol is the major urinary metabolite. Estradiol is conjugated in the liver to form estrogen conjugates like estradiol sulfate, estradiol glucuronide and, as such, excreted via the kidneys. Some of the water-soluble conjugates are excreted via the bile duct, and partly reabsorbed after hydrolysis from the intestinal tract. This enterohepatic circulation contributes to maintaining estradiol levels. Estradiol is also metabolized via hydroxylation into catechol estrogens. In the liver, it is non-specifically metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 via 2-hydroxylation into 2-hydroxyestradiol, and by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 via 17β-hydroxy dehydrogenation into estrone, with various other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and metabolic transformations also being involved. Estradiol is additionally conjugated with an ester into lipoidal estradiol forms like estradiol palmitate and estradiol stearate to a certain extent; these esters are stored in adipose tissue and may act as a very long-lasting reservoir of estradiol. === Excretion === Estradiol is excreted in the form of glucuronide and sulfate estrogen conjugates in urine. Following an intravenous injection of labeled estradiol in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estradiol. === Levels === Levels of estradiol in premenopausal women are highly variable throughout the menstrual cycle and reference ranges widely vary from source to source. Estradiol levels are minimal and according to most laboratories range from 20 to 80 pg/mL during the early to mid follicular phase (or the first week of the menstrual cycle, also known as menses). Levels of estradiol gradually increase during this time and through the mid to late follicular phase (or the second week of the menstrual cycle) until the pre-ovulatory phase. At the time of pre-ovulation (a period of about 24 to 48 hours), estradiol levels briefly surge and reach their highest concentrations of any other time during the menstrual cycle. Circulating levels are typically between 130 and 200 pg/mL at this time, but in some women may be as high as 300 to 400 pg/mL, and the upper limit of the reference range of some laboratories are even greater (for instance, 750 pg/mL). Following ovulation (or mid-cycle) and during the latter half of the menstrual cycle or the luteal phase, estradiol levels plateau and fluctuate between around 100 and 150 pg/mL during the early and mid luteal phase, and at the time of the late luteal phase, or a few days before menstruation, reach a low of around 40 pg/mL. The mean integrated levels of estradiol during a full menstrual cycle have variously been reported by different sources as 80, 120, and 150 pg/mL. Although contradictory reports exist, one study found mean integrated estradiol levels of 150 pg/mL in younger women whereas mean integrated levels ranged from 50 to 120 pg/mL in older women. During the reproductive years of human females, levels of estradiol are somewhat higher than that of estrone, except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity. During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, estrone predominates (both based on serum levels). The estradiol produced by male humans, from testosterone, is present at serum levels roughly comparable to those of postmenopausal women (14–55 versus <35 pg/mL, respectively). It has also been reported that if concentrations of estradiol in a 70-year-old man are compared to those of a 70-year-old woman, levels are approximately 2- to 4-fold higher in the man. ==== Measurement ==== In women, serum estradiol is measured in a clinical laboratory and reflects primarily the activity of the ovaries. The Estradiol blood test measures the amount of estradiol in the blood. It is used to check the function of the ovaries, placenta, adrenal glands. This can detect baseline estrogen in women with amenorrhea or menstrual dysfunction, and to detect the state of hypoestrogenicity and menopause. Furthermore, estrogen monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Estrogen-producing tumors will demonstrate persistent high levels of estradiol and other estrogens. In precocious puberty, estradiol levels are inappropriately increased. ==== Ranges ==== Individual laboratory results should always be interpreted using the ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the test. In the normal menstrual cycle, estradiol levels measure typically <50 pg/mL at menstruation, rise with follicular development (peak: 200 pg/mL), drop briefly at ovulation, and rise again during the luteal phase for a second peak. At the end of the luteal phase, estradiol levels drop to their menstrual levels unless there is a pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogen levels, including estradiol, rise steadily toward term. The source of these estrogens is the placenta, which aromatizes prohormones produced in the fetal adrenal gland. == Medical use == Estradiol is used as a medication, primarily in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms as well as feminizing hormone therapy for trans individuals. == Chemistry == Estradiol is an estrane steroid. It is also known as 17β-estradiol (to distinguish it from 17α-estradiol) or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol. It has two hydroxyl groups, one at the C3 position and the other at the 17β position, as well as three double bonds in the A ring. Due to its two hydroxyl groups, estradiol is often abbreviated as E2. The structurally related estrogens, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4) have one, three, and four hydroxyl groups, respectively. == Neuropsychopharmacology == Product insert information, accompanying commercial perscription estradiol, indicates it causes depression. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, estradiol was shown to have gender-specific effects on fairness sensitivity. Overall, when the division of a given amount of money was framed as either fair or unfair in a modified version of the ultimatum game, estradiol increased the acceptance rate of fair-framed proposals among men and decreased it among women. However, among the placebo-group ""the mere belief of receiving estradiol treatment significantly increased the acceptance of unfair-framed offers in both sexes"", indicating that so-called ""environmental"" factors played a role in organising the responses towards these presentations of the ultimatum game. == History == The discovery of estrogen is usually credited to the American scientists Edgar Allen and Edward A. Doisy. In 1923, they observed that injection of fluid from porcine ovarian follicles produced pubertal- and estrus-type changes (including vaginal, uterine, and mammary gland changes and sexual receptivity) in sexually immature, ovariectomized mice and rats. These findings demonstrated the existence of a hormone which is produced by the ovaries and is involved in sexual maturation and reproduction. At the time of its discovery, Allen and Doisy did not name the hormone, and simply referred to it as an ""ovarian hormone"" or ""follicular hormone""; others referred to it variously as feminin, folliculin, menformon, thelykinin, and emmenin. In 1926, Parkes and Bellerby coined the term estrin to describe the hormone on the basis of it inducing estrus in animals. Estrone was isolated and purified independently by Allen and Doisy and German scientist Adolf Butenandt in 1929, and estriol was isolated and purified by Marrian in 1930; they were the first estrogens to be identified. Estradiol, the most potent of the three major estrogens, was the last of the three to be identified. It was discovered by Schwenk and Hildebrant in 1933, who synthesized it via reduction of estrone. Estradiol was subsequently isolated and purified from sow ovaries by Doisy in 1935, with its chemical structure determined simultaneously, and was referred to variously as dihydrotheelin, dihydrofolliculin, dihydrofollicular hormone, and dihydroxyestrin. In 1935, the name estradiol and the term estrogen were formally established by the Sex Hormone Committee of the Health Organization of the League of Nations; this followed the names estrone (which was initially called theelin, progynon, folliculin, and ketohydroxyestrin) and estriol (initially called theelol and trihydroxyestrin) having been established in 1932 at the first meeting of the International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in London. Following its discovery, a partial synthesis of estradiol from cholesterol was developed by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1940, and a total synthesis was developed by Anner and Miescher in 1948. == Society and culture == === Etymology === The name estradiol derives from estra-, Gk. οἶστρος (oistros, literally meaning ""verve or inspiration""), which refers to the estrane steroid ring system, and -diol, a chemical term and suffix indicating that the compound is a type of alcohol bearing two hydroxyl groups. == References ==",Dihydrofolliculin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.08337332308292389), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.014173968695104122), (' MED', -0.029933994635939598), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6941267251968384), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1281285136938095)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([chembk.com](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/%20dihydrofolliculin?utm_source=openai), [db.idrblab.net](https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/data/drug/details/d08qmx?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=194, start_index=20, title='dihydrofolliculin', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/%20dihydrofolliculin?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=194, start_index=20, title='Drug Information | Therapeutic Target Database', type='url_citation', url='https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/data/drug/details/d08qmx?utm_source=openai')])"

This double-blind, 3-period crossover study enrolled 86 subjects aged 22 - 63 years, who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Test Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia; 78 subjects completed the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to sequences of 3 treatment periods of single oral doses of pomaglumetad methionil 400 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, and placebo. Quadruplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) were extracted from 2 hours predose to 12 hours postdose and were overread by a blinded central reader. Time-matched pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were assessed. At all-time points, the upper bound of the 90% 2-sided confidence interval (CI) for the least squares (LS) mean difference in changes from baseline in Fridericia's corrected QT interval (ΔQTcF) between pomaglumetad methionil and placebo was < 10 milliseconds (msec). Sufficient assay sensitivity was not achieved, likely due to food effect; although the maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax) with moxifloxacin (1,410 ng/mL) was lower than expected, the slope of the regression line of moxifloxacin plasma concentrations versus placebo-subtracted ΔQTcF was similar to that reported in the literature. A single supratherapeutic dose of 400 mg pomaglumetad methionil did not prolong QTcF to a clinically significant degree and, importantly, did not result in any absolute QTcF > 450 msec or increase in QTcF from predose > 30 msec. We tested the hypothesis that long-term treatment with pomaglumetad methionil would demonstrate significantly less weight gain than aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia. In this 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study, 678 schizophrenia patients were randomized to either pomaglumetad methionil (n = 516) or aripiprazole (n = 162). Treatment groups were also compared on efficacy and various safety measures, including serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The pomaglumetad methionil group showed significantly greater weight loss at Week 24 (Visit 12) compared with the aripiprazole group (-2.8 ± 0.4 versus 0.4 ± 0.6; P < 0.001). However, change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores for aripiprazole was significantly greater than for pomaglumetad methionil (-15.58 ± 1.58 versus -12.03 ± 0.99; P = 0.045). The incidences of SAEs (8.2% versus 3.1%; P = 0.032) and discontinuation due to AEs (16.2% versus 8.7%; P = 0.020) were significantly higher for pomaglumetad methionil compared with aripiprazole. No statistically significant differences in the incidence of TEAEs, EPS, or suicidal ideation or behavior were noted between treatment groups. In conclusion, long-term treatment with pomaglumetad methionil resulted in significantly less weight gain than aripiprazole. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01328093. This study tested whether treatment with pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023 monohydrate), a metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 agonist compared with placebo (PBO), when added to a fixed-dose second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) demonstrated significantly greater reduction of negative symptoms, as assessed by the 16-item Negative Symptom Assessment scale (NSA-16), in patients with schizophrenia. This parallel-group, 16-week study enrolled adults with schizophrenia who were receiving standard of care (SOC) therapy, which included ≥3months treatment with one of four SGAs: aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine. Patients received either 20mg of twice daily LY2140023 monohydrate (LY2140023) or concurrent PBO SGA. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline to final visit in NSA-16 total score. Secondary measures included additional measures of efficacy, cognition, and assessments of safety. Of 352 patients screened, 167 were randomly assigned to treatment, and 110 patients completed the study. Patients treated with LY2140023 and SOC failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over patients treated with PBO and SOC on NSA-16 total score at endpoint or at any point during the study (all p>0.131). Changes in secondary efficacy measures were not significantly different between groups at endpoint. With the exception of vomiting which was greater in the LY2140023 group, there were no statistically significant differences in safety and tolerability measures. This study found no benefit of adjunctive LY2140023 versus PBO for negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia receiving treatment with SOC.

3396,"('Lactitol (monohydrate)', 'Lactitol', 'Importal', 'Lactitolum', 'Lacitol')","Food, Medical","Lactitol is a disaccharide sugar alcohol produced from lactose. It is used as a replacement bulk sweetener for low calorie foods with 30–40% of the sweetness of sucrose. It is also used medically as a laxative. == Production == Lactitol is produced by hydrogenation of lactose using Raney nickel catalyst. The product can be obtained as an anhydrous, monohydrate, or dihydrate. Two manufacturers, Danisco and Purac Biochem, produce about 10,000 tons/y. == Applications == Lactitol is used in a variety of low food energy or low fat foods. High stability makes it popular for baking. It is used in sugar-free candies, cookies (biscuits), chocolate, and ice cream, with a sweetness of 30–40% that of sucrose. Lactitol also promotes colon health as a prebiotic. Because of poor absorption, lactitol only has 2–2.5 kilocalories (8.4–10.5 kilojoules) per gram, compared to 4 kilocalories (17 kJ) per gram for typical saccharides. Hence, lactitol is about 60% as caloric as typical saccharides. === Medical === Lactitol is listed as an excipient in some prescription drugs. Lactitol is a laxative and is used to prevent or treat constipation, e.g., under the trade name Importal. In February 2020, Lactitol was approved for use in the United States as an osmotic laxative for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults. Lactitol in combination with Ispaghula husk is an approved combination for idiopathic constipation as a laxative and is used to prevent or treat constipation. == Safety and health == Lactitol, erythritol, sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, and maltitol are all classified sugar alcohols (lactitol and maltitol are in fact disaccharide alcohols, since they contain one intact sugar). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies sugar alcohols as ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS). They are approved as food additives, and are recognized as not contributing to tooth decay or causing increases in blood glucose. Lactitol is also approved for use in foods in most countries around the world. Like other sugar alcohols, lactitol causes cramping, flatulence, and diarrhea in some individuals who consume it. These effects arise because humans lack a suitable beta-galactosidase in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and a majority of ingested lactitol reaches the large intestine, where it then becomes fermentable to gut microbes (prebiotic) and can pull water into the gut by osmosis. For these reasons, medical advice is often sought before their use. == History == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pizensy based on evidence from a clinical trial (Trial 1/ NCT02819297) of 594 subjects with CIC conducted in the United States. The FDA also considered other supportive evidence including data from Trial 2 (NCT02481947) which compared Pizensy to previously approved drug (lubiprostone) for CIC, and Trial 3 (NCT02819310) in which subjects used Pizensy for one year as well as data from published literature. The benefit and side effects of Pizensy were evaluated in a clinical trial (Trial 1) of 594 subjects with CIC. In this trial, subjects received treatment with either Pizensy or placebo once daily for 6 months. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trials were completed. In the second trial (Trial 2) of three months duration, improvement in CSBMs was used to compare Pizensy to the drug lubiprostone which was previously approved for CIC. The third trial (Trial 3) was used to collect the side effects in subjects treated with Pizensy for one year. == References == == External links == Media related to Lactitol at Wikimedia Commons ""Lactitol"".

Anamorelin significantly increases plasma levels of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in humans, without affecting plasma levels of prolactin, cortisol, insulin, glucose, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). In addition, anamorelin significantly increases appetite, overall body weight, lean body mass, and muscle strength, with increases in body weight correlating directly with increases in plasma IGF-1 levels. As of February 2016, anamorelin has completed phase III clinical trials for the treatment of cancer cachexia and anorexia associated with non-small-cell lung carcinoma. On 18 May 2017, the European Medicines Agency recommended the refusal of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product, intended for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia or unintended weight loss in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Helsinn requested a re-examination of the initial opinion. After considering the grounds for this request, the European Medicines Agency re-examined the opinion, and confirmed the refusal of the marketing authorisation on 14 September 2017. The European Medicines Agency concluded that the studies show a marginal effect of anamorelin on lean body mass and no proven effect on hand grip strength or patients’ quality of life.

Brand names include Nozinan, Levoprome, Detenler, Hirnamin, Levotomin and Neurocil. It is a low-potency antipsychotic (approximately half as potent as chlorpromazine) with strong analgesic, hypnotic and antiemetic properties that are primarily used in palliative care. Serious side effects include tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, abnormalities in the electrical cycle of the heart, low blood pressure and the potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. As is typical of phenothiazine antipsychotics, levomepromazine is a ""dirty drug"", that is, it exerts its effects by blocking a variety of receptors, including adrenergic receptors, dopamine receptors, histamine receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin receptors. == Medical uses == It can be used as an analgesic for moderate to severe pain in non-ambulant patients (the latter being because of its strong sedative effects). Levomepromazine is also used at lower doses for the treatment of nausea and insomnia. Levomepromazine is frequently prescribed and valued worldwide in palliative care medicine for its multimodal action, to treat intractable nausea or vomiting, and for severe delirium/agitation in the last days of life. Palliative care physicians will commonly prescribe it orally or via subcutaneous syringe drivers in combination with opioid analgesics such as hydromorphone. Levomepromazine is used for the treatment of psychosis, particularly those of schizophrenia, and manic phases of bipolar disorder. It should only be used with caution in the treatment of agitated depressions, as it can cause akathisia as a side effect, which could worsen the agitation. A 2010 systematic review compared the efficacy of levomepromazine with atypical antipsychotic drugs: == Adverse effects == The most common side effect is akathisia. Levomepromazine has prominent sedative and anticholinergic/sympatholytic effects (dry mouth, hypotension, sinus tachycardia, night sweats) and may cause weight gain. These side effects normally preclude prescribing the drug in doses needed for full remission of schizophrenia, so it has to be combined with a more potent antipsychotic. In any case, blood pressure and EKG should be monitored regularly. A rare but life-threatening side effect is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

3402,"('Camptothecin', 'Campathecin', '(s)-camptothecin', 'Camptothecine', 'Camptothecine (s,+)')",Medical,"Camptothecin (CPT) is a topoisomerase inhibitor. It was discovered in 1966 by M. E. Wall and M. C. Wani in systematic screening of natural products for anticancer drugs. It was isolated from the bark of Camptotheca acuminata (喜树 ""Happy tree""), a tree native to China used in traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used clinically in China for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. CPT showed anticancer activity in preliminary clinical trials, especially against breast, ovarian, colon, lung, and stomach cancers. However, it has low solubility and adverse effects have been reported when used therapeutically, so synthetic and medicinal chemists have developed numerous syntheses of camptothecin and various derivatives to increase the benefits of the chemical, with good results. Four CPT analogues have been approved and are used in cancer chemotherapy today: topotecan, irinotecan, belotecan, and trastuzumab deruxtecan. Camptothecin has also been found in other plants including Chonemorpha fragrans. == Structures == CPT has a planar pentacyclic ring structure, that includes a pyrrolo[3,4-β]-quinoline moiety (rings A, B and C), conjugated pyridone moiety (ring D) and one chiral center at position 20 within the alpha-hydroxy lactone ring with (S) configuration (the E-ring). Its planar structure is thought to be one of the most important factors in topoisomerase inhibition. == Binding == CPT binds to the topoisomerase I and DNA complex (the covalent complex) resulting in a ternary complex, and thereby stabilizing it. This prevents DNA re-ligation and therefore causes DNA damage which results in apoptosis. CPT binds both to the enzyme and DNA with hydrogen bonds. The most important part of the structure is the E-ring which interacts from three different positions with the enzyme. The hydroxyl group in position 20 forms hydrogen bond to the side chain on aspartic acid number 533 (Asp533) in the enzyme. It is critical that the configuration of the chiral carbon is (S) because (R) is inactive. The lactone is bonded with two hydrogen bonds to the amino groups on arginine 364 (Arg364). The D-ring interacts with the +1 cytosine on non-cleaved strand and stabilizes the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complex by forming hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond is between carbonyl group in position 17 on the D-ring and amino group on the pyrimidine ring of +1 cytosine. CPT is selectively cytotoxic to the cells replicating DNA during S phase and its toxicity is primarily a result of conversion of single-strand breaks into double-strand breaks when the replication fork collides with the cleavage complexes formed by DNA and CPT. == Chemistry == The lactone ring in CPT is highly susceptible to hydrolysis. The open ring form is inactive and it must therefore be closed to inhibit topoisomerase I. The closed form is favored in acidic condition, as it is in many cancer cells microenvironment. CPT is transported into the cell by passive diffusion. Cellular uptake is favored by lipophilicity, which enhances intracellular accumulation. Lipophilicity makes compounds more stable because of improved lactone partitioning into red blood cells and consequently less hydrolysis of the lactone. CPT has affinity for human serum albumin (HSA), especially the carboxylate form of CPT. Because of that, the equilibrium between the lactone ring and the carboxylate form is driven toward the carboxylate. Reduced drug-HSA interactions could result in improved activity. == Structure-activity relationship == Studies have shown that substitution at position 7, 9, 10 and 11 can have positive effect on CPT activity and physical properties, e.g. potency and metabolic stability. Enlargement of the lactone ring by one CH2 unit also enhances its abilities, as in homocamptothecin. Substitution at position 12 and 14 leads to inactive derivative. === A- and B-ring modification === ==== Alkyl substitution ==== Alkyl substitution at position 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as ethyl (C2H5) or chloromethyl (CH2Cl). These groups are able to react with the DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I which leads to more tumor activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased lipophilicity and consequently greater potency and stability in human plasma. Other 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent inhibitors on topoisomerase I and both have alkylsilyl groups in position 7 which make them lipophilic and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the blood brain barrier. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and is among the most active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome drug resistance. Still another route to make CPT's lipophilic is to introduce lipophilic substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems. Basic nitrogen in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more hydrophilic and hence more water-soluble. For example, is a derivate called CKD-602, which is a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor and successfully overcomes the poor water solubility and toxicity seen with CPT. Considerably greater activity can be achieved by putting electron-withdrawing groups like amino, nitro, bromo or chloro at position 9 and 10 and hydroxyl group at position 10 or 11. But these compounds are relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions, which causes difficulty in administrations. Methoxy group at both position 10 and 11 simultaneously leads to inactivity. ==== Hexacyclic CPT analogues ==== Hexacyclic CPT analogues have shown great potency. For example, methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 membered ring which leads to more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The reason is the unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme. Adding amino or chloro group at 9th position or chloromethyl group at 7th position to these 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues results in compounds with even greater cytotoxicity but weaker solubility in water. To yield 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues with good water solubility a good way is to introduce a water solubilising substituent at position 7. Lurtotecan meets those requirements; it's a 10, 11-ethylenedioxy analogue with a 4-methylpiperazino-methylene at position 7 and has shown a great potency in clinical researches. A ring can also be formed between position 7 and 9, like position 10 and 11. That gives new opportunities to make water-soluble derivatives [5]. These hexacyclic CPT become more active when electron-withdrawing groups are put in position 11 and methyl or amino groups at 10. Exatecan is an example of hexacyclic CPT that has a 6 membered ring over position 7 and 9, and is 10-methyl, 11-fluoro substituted [4]. It is water-soluble and more potent than topotecan. === C- and D-ring modification === The C- and D-rings have an essential role in the antitumor activity. Replacement in any position results in much less potent compound than parent compound in other cytotoxicity assay. === E-ring modifications === The E-ring doesn't allow many structural changes without losing CPT activity because it is necessary for binding to the active site of TOP I. One possible replacement is changing the hydroxyl group to Cl, F or Br because their polarizability is sufficient to stabilize the enzyme-complex. Another possible modification is to insert a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven membered β-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT). The hCPT's hydroxyl has less inductive effect on the carboxyl group which makes the lactone very reactive. This enhances the interaction of the free hydroxyl group optimally with topoisomerase I and the covalent complex that forms in its presence are more stable. The E-ring of hCPT opens more slowly and the opening is irreversible. hCPTs exhibit enhanced human plasma stability because of decreased protein binding and more affinity for red blood cells than CPT. == CPT analogues == Since the discovery of CPT many analogues have been synthesized. Below is a schematic view of the CPT analogues that have been mentioned in the text above. CPT is linked to a cyclodextrin-based polymer to form the investigational anti-cancer drug CRLX101. == Biosynthesis == Like all other monoterpenoid indole-alkaloids, biosynthesis of camptothecin requires production of the strictosidine. Strictosidine is synthesized through condensation reaction between tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from either mevalonate (MVA) pathway or non-mevalonate pathway (MEP). Strictosidine then undergoes intermolecular cyclization to produce strictosamide, which is converted to camptothecin through a series of oxidation reactions by enzymes that still needs to be resolved. The shikimate pathway leading to biosynthesis of tryptamine is mostly understood. First, chorismate is converted to anthranilate by the alpha-subunit of anthranilate synthase (ASA). Anthranilate reacts with 5-phosphoribose pyrophosphate to produce 5-phosphoribosylanthranilate. Then this intermediate is converted to indole glycerol phosphate, which interacts with the alpha-subunit of tryptophan (TSA) synthase to yield indole. The beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSB) catalyzes condensation of indole with serine, leading to tryptophan. In the next step, tryptamine is produced as the result of decarboxylation by tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC). Secologanin synthesis begins with condensation reaction between pyruvate and D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate catalyzed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) to produce 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP). The conversion of DXP to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is the common terpenoid biosynthesis precursor involves 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase (HDR). The formation of IPP can be achieved by both MVA and MEP pathways. Condensation of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) yields geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The geraniol synthase (GS) then converts GPP to geraniol. The conversion of geraniol to secologanin occurs through various enzymatic reactions. Based on studies with radioactive labelling and pathway specific inhibitors, MEP pathway is the primary source for secologanin. Tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from MVA or MEP pathway are converted to strictosidine through a condensation reaction catalyzed by strictosidine synthase. Although it is not fully resolved, it has been postulated that camptothecin is produced from strictosidine via strictosamide, 3 (S)-pumiloside and 3 (S)-deoxypumiloside. == References ==",Camptothecin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0016695844242349267), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.251982182264328), (' FOOD', -0.000568402698263526)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00392618915066123), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), (',', -0.12702065706253052), ('ĠFOOD', -0.4984810948371887), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2523172199726105)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01419841032475233), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10020732134580612), (' INDUSTR', -0.0015316474018618464), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camptothecin ', [])"
3403,"('Hydroxyurea', 'Hydroxycarbamide', 'N-hydroxyurea', 'Hydrea', 'Oxyurea')",Medical,"Hydroxycarbamide, also known as hydroxyurea, is an antimetabolite medication used in sickle-cell disease, essential thrombocythemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, and cervical cancer. In sickle-cell disease it increases fetal hemoglobin and decreases the number of attacks. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, fevers, loss of appetite, psychiatric problems, shortness of breath, and headaches. There is also concern that it increases the risk of later cancers. Use during pregnancy is typically harmful to the fetus. Hydroxycarbamide is in the antineoplastic family of medications. It is believed to work by blocking the making of DNA. Hydroxycarbamide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Hydroxycarbamide is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Hydroxycarbamide is used for the following indications: Myeloproliferative disease (primarily essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera). It has been found to be superior to anagrelide for the control of ET. Sickle-cell disease (increases production of fetal hemoglobin that then interferes with the hemoglobin polymerisation as well as by reducing white blood cells that contribute to the general inflammatory state in sickle cell patients.) Second line treatment for psoriasis (slows down the rapid division of skin cells) Systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm(SM-AHN) (The utility in treating SM-AHN with hydroxycarbamide stems from its myelosuppressive activity, it does not however exhibit any selective anti-mast cell activity) Chronic myelogenous leukemia (largely replaced by imatinib, but still in use for its cost-effectiveness) == Side effects == Reported side effects are: neurological reactions (e.g., headache, dizziness, drowsiness, disorientation, hallucinations, and convulsions), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, mucositis, anorexia, stomatitis, bone marrow toxicity (dose-limiting toxicity; may take 7–21 days to recover after the drug has been discontinued), megaloblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation, immunosuppression, leukopenia, alopecia (hair loss), skin rashes (e.g., maculopapular rash), erythema, pruritus, vesication or irritation of the skin and mucous membranes, pulmonary edema, abnormal liver enzymes, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Due to its negative effect on the bone marrow, regular monitoring of the full blood count is vital, as well as early response to possible infections. In addition, renal function, uric acid and electrolytes, as well as liver enzymes, are commonly checked. Moreover, because of this, its use in people with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or severe anemia is contraindicated. Hydroxycarbamide has been used primarily for the treatment of myeloproliferative diseases, which has an inherent risk of transforming to acute myeloid leukemia. There has been a longstanding concern that hydroxycarbamide itself carries a leukemia risk, but large studies have shown that the risk is either absent or very small. Nevertheless, it has been a barrier for its wider use in patients with sickle-cell disease. == Mechanism of action == Hydroxycarbamide decreases the production of deoxyribonucleotides via inhibition of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase by scavenging tyrosyl free radicals as they are involved in the reduction of nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs). Additionally, hydroxycarbamide causes production of reactive oxygen species in cells, leading to disassembly of replicative DNA polymerase enzymes and arresting DNA replication. In the treatment of sickle-cell disease, hydroxycarbamide increases the concentration of fetal hemoglobin. The precise mechanism of action is not yet clear, but it appears that hydroxycarbamide increases nitric oxide levels, causing soluble guanylyl cyclase activation with a resultant rise in cyclic GMP, and the activation of gamma globin gene expression and subsequent gamma chain synthesis necessary for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production (which does not polymerize and deform red blood cells like the mutated HbS, responsible for sickle cell disease). Adult red cells containing more than 1% HbF are termed F cells. These cells are progeny of a small pool of immature committed erythroid precursors (BFU-e) that retain the ability to produce HbF. Hydroxyurea also suppresses the production of granulocytes in the bone marrow which has a mild immunosuppressive effect particularly at vascular sites where sickle cells have occluded blood flow. == Natural occurrence == Hydroxyurea has been reported as endogenous in human blood plasma at concentrations of approximately 30 to 200 ng/ml. == Chemistry == Hydroxyurea has been prepared in many different ways since its initial synthesis in 1869. The original synthesis by Dresler and Stein was based around the reaction of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and potassium cyanate. Hydroxyurea lay dormant for more than fifty years until it was studied as part of an investigation into the toxicity of protein metabolites. Due to its chemical properties hydroxyurea was explored as an antisickling agent in the treatment of hematological conditions. One common mechanism for synthesizing hydroxyurea is by the reaction of calcium cyanate with hydroxylamine nitrate in absolute ethanol and by the reaction of a cyanate salt and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in aqueous solution. Hydroxyurea has also been prepared by converting a quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin from the chloride form to the cyanate form with sodium cyanate and reacting the resin in the cyanate form with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. This method of hydroxyurea synthesis was patented by Hussain et al. (2015). == Pharmacology == Hydroxyurea is a monohydroxyl-substituted urea (hydroxycarbamate) antimetabolite. Similar to other antimetabolite anti-cancer drugs, it acts by disrupting the DNA replication process of dividing cancer cells in the body. Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, an enzyme required to convert ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, thereby preventing cells from leaving the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. This agent also exhibits radiosensitizing activity by maintaining cells in the radiation-sensitive G1 phase and interfering with DNA repair. Biochemical research has explored its role as a DNA replication inhibitor which causes deoxyribonucleotide depletion and results in DNA double strand breaks near replication forks (see DNA repair). Repair of DNA damaged by chemicals or irradiation is also inhibited by hydroxyurea, offering potential synergy between hydroxyurea and radiation or alkylating agents. Hydroxyurea has many pharmacological applications under the Medical Subject Headings classification system: Antineoplastic agents – Substances that inhibit or prevent the proliferation of neoplasms. Antisickling agents – Agents used to prevent or reverse the pathological events leading to sickling of erythrocytes in sickle cell conditions. Nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors – Compounds that inhibit cell production of DNA or RNA. Enzyme inhibitors – Compounds or agents that combine with an enzyme in such a manner as to prevent the normal substrate-enzyme combination and the catalytic reaction. Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 inhibitors – Agents that inhibit one of the most important enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body, CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed oxidase system. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include: Hydrea, Litalir, Droxia, and Siklos. == References ==",Oxyurea,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0019305398454889655), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0015040287980809808), (' END', -9.610702363715973e-06), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -6.869017852295656e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -1.7881233361549675e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.4741506576538086), ('ĠEND', -0.0010808822698891163), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002975021197926253)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is still used in France as a nasal decongestant but its use is not recommended by the health authorities due to the lack of evidence of its effectiveness. It has also been used as a stimulant. Tuaminoheptane has been found to act as a reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of norepinephrine, which may underlie its decongestant and stimulant effects. It is an alkylamine. The chemical structure of the drug differs from that of other norepinephrine releasing agents, such as the phenethylamines, which, in contrast to tuaminoheptane, have an aromatic ring in their structure.

3406,"('Oseltamivir (phosphate)', 'Gs 4104', 'Oseltamivir', 'Tamvir', 'Tamiflu-free')",Medical,"Oseltamivir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu among others, is an antiviral medication used to treat and prevent influenza A and influenza B, viruses that cause the flu. Many medical organizations recommend it in people who have complications or are at high risk of complications within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. They recommend it to prevent infection in those at high risk, but not the general population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians use their discretion to treat those at lower risk who present within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. It is taken by mouth, either as a pill or liquid. Recommendations regarding oseltamivir are controversial as are criticisms of the recommendations. A 2014 Cochrane Review concluded that oseltamivir does not reduce hospitalizations, and that there is no evidence of reduction in complications of influenza. Two meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. They also found little evidence regarding whether treatment changes the risk of hospitalization or death in high risk populations. However, another meta-analysis found that oseltamivir was effective for prevention of influenza at the individual and household levels. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and trouble sleeping. Other side effects may include psychiatric symptoms and seizures. In the United States it is recommended for influenza infection during pregnancy. It has been taken by a small number of pregnant women without signs of problems. Dose adjustment may be needed in those with kidney problems. Oseltamivir was approved for medical use in the US in 1999. It was the first neuraminidase inhibitor available by mouth. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines but was downgraded to ""complementary"" status in 2017. A generic version was approved in the US in 2016. In 2022, it was the 205th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Oseltamivir is used for the prevention and treatment of influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The WHO supports its use for severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill people who have been hospitalized. Oseltamivir's risk-benefit ratio is controversial. In 2017, it was moved from the core to the complementary list based on its lower cost-effectiveness. The Expert Committee did not recommend the deletion of oseltamivir from the EML and EMLc, recognizing that it is the only medicine included on the Model Lists for critically ill patients with influenza and for influenza pandemic preparedness. However, the Committee noted that, since the inclusion of oseltamivir on the Model List in 2009, new evidence in seasonal and pandemic influenza has lowered earlier estimates of the magnitude of effect of oseltamivir on relevant clinical outcomes. The Committee recommended that the listing of oseltamivir be amended, moving the medicine from the core to the Complementary List, and that its use be restricted to severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill hospitalized patients. The Expert Committee noted that WHO guidelines for pharmacological management of pandemic and seasonal influenza would be updated in 2017: unless new information is provided to support the use of oseltamivir in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, the next Expert Committee might consider oseltamivir for deletion. === High-risk people === The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Public Health England and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the use of oseltamivir for people who have complications or are at high risk for complications. This includes those who are hospitalized, young children, those over the age of 65, people with other significant health problems, those who are pregnant, and Indigenous peoples of the Americas among others. The Infectious Disease Society of America takes the same position as the CDC. A systematic review of systematic reviews in PLoS One did not find evidence for benefits in people who are at risk, noting that ""the trials were not designed or powered to give results regarding serious complications, hospitalization and mortality"", as did a 2014 Cochrane Review. The Cochrane Review further recommended: ""On the basis of the findings of this review, clinicians and healthcare policy-makers should urgently revise current recommendations for use of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) for individuals with influenza."" That is not utilizing NIs for prevention or treatment ""Based on these findings there appears to be no evidence for patients, clinicians or policy-makers to use these drugs to prevent serious outcomes, both in annual influenza and pandemic influenza outbreaks."" The CDC, ECDC, Public Health England, Infectious Disease Society of America, the AAP, and Roche (the originator) reject the conclusions of the Cochrane Review, arguing in part that the analysis inappropriately forms conclusions about outcomes in people who are seriously ill based on results obtained primarily in healthy populations, and that the analysis inappropriately included results from people not infected with influenza. The EMA did not change its labeling of the drug in response to the Cochrane study. A 2014 review recommended that all people admitted to intensive care units during influenza outbreaks with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia receive oseltamivir until the absence of influenza infection is established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found oseltamivir effective at treating the symptoms of influenza, reducing the length of hospitalization, and reducing the risk of otitis media. The same review found that oseltamivir did not significantly increase the risk of adverse events. A 2016 systematic review found that oseltamivir slightly reduced the time it takes for the symptoms of influenza to be alleviated, and that it also increased the risk of ""nausea, vomiting, [and] psychiatric events in adults and vomiting in children."" The decrease in duration of sickness was about 18 hours. === Otherwise healthy people === In those who are otherwise healthy the CDC states that antivirals may be considered within the first 48 hours. A German clinical practice guideline recommends against its use. Two 2013 meta-analyses have concluded that benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not outweigh its risks. When the analysis was restricted to people with confirmed infection, the same 2014 Cochrane Review (see above) found unclear evidence of change in the risk of complications such as pneumonia, while three other reviews found a decreased risk. Together, published studies suggest that oseltamivir reduces the duration of symptoms by 0.5–1.0 day. Any benefit of treatment must be balanced against side effects, which include psychiatric symptoms and increased rates of vomiting. The 2014 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded that oseltamivir did not affect the need for hospitalizations, and that there is no proof of reduction of complications of influenza (such as pneumonia) because of a lack of diagnostic definitions, or reduction of the spread of the virus. There was also evidence that suggested that oseltamivir prevented some people from producing sufficient numbers of their own antibodies to fight infection. The authors recommended that guidance should be revised to take account of the evidence of small benefit and increased risk of harms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Public Health England (PHE), the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and Roche (the originator) rejected the recommendations of the 2014 Cochrane Review to urgently change treatment guidelines and drug labels. === Prevention === As of 2017, the CDC does not recommend to use oseltamivir generally for prevention due to concerns that widespread use will encourage resistance development. They recommend that it be considered in those at high risk, who have been exposed to influenza within 48 hours and have not received or only recently been vaccinated. They recommended it during outbreaks in long term care facilities and in those who are significantly immunosuppressed. As of 2011, reviews concluded that when oseltamivir is used preventatively it decreases the risk of exposed people developing symptomatic disease. A systematic review of systematic reviews found low to moderate evidence that it decreases the risk of getting symptomatic influenza by 1 to 12% (a relative decrease of 64 to 92%). It recommended against its use in healthy, low-risk persons due to cost, the risk of resistance development, and side effects and concluded it might be useful for prevention in unvaccinated high risk persons. == Side effects == According to the FDA, the two most common adverse drug reactions associated with oseltamivir therapy are nausea (10% vs 6% placebo) and vomiting (9% vs 3% placebo). In adults, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea for which the number needed to harm was 28 and for vomiting was 22. So, for every 22 adult people on oseltamivir one experienced vomiting. In the treatment of children, oseltamivir also induced vomiting. The number needed to harm was 19. So, for every 19 children on oseltamivir one experienced vomiting. When used as a prophylactic there were more headaches, kidney, and psychiatric events. Oseltamivir's effect on the heart is unclear: it may reduce cardiac symptoms, but may also induce serious arrhythmias. Postmarketing reports include liver inflammation and elevated liver enzymes, rash, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, abnormal heart rhythms, seizure, confusion, aggravation of diabetes, and haemorrhagic colitis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and body pain, followed by skin problems, were identified as the side effects most significantly reducing patient satisfaction on a drug review platform. The US and EU package inserts for oseltamivir contain a warning of psychiatric effects observed in post-marketing surveillance. The frequency of these appears to be low and a causative role for oseltamivir has not been established. The 2014 Cochrane Review found a dose-response effect on psychiatric events. In trials of prevention in adults one person was harmed for every 94 treated. Neither of the two most cited published treatment trials of oseltamivir reported any drug-attributable serious adverse events. It is pregnancy category B in Australia, meaning that it has been taken by a small number of women without signs of problems and in animal studies it looks safe. Dose adjustment may be needed in those with kidney problems. == Mechanism of action == Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, a competitive inhibitor of influenza's neuraminidase enzyme. The neuraminidase enzyme binds to the sialic acid which is found on glycoproteins on the surface of human cells. Then it cleaves the sialic acid, which helps new virions to exit the cell. As Oseltamivir is an analogue of the sialic acid, the enzyme can bind to Oseltamivir instead, in which case the enzyme will not bind to sialic acid, so it will not cleave it and new virons will not exit the cell. == Resistance == The vast majority of mutations conferring resistance are single amino acid residue substitutions (His274Tyr in N1) in the neuraminidase enzyme. A 2011 meta-analysis of 15 studies found a pooled incidence rate for oseltamivir resistance of 2.6%. Subgroup analyses detected higher rates among influenza A patients, especially the H1N1 subtype. It was found that a substantial number of patients might become oseltamivir-resistant as a result of oseltamivir use, and that oseltamivir resistance might be significantly associated with pneumonia. In severely immunocompromised patients there were reports of prolonged shedding of oseltamivir- (or zanamivir)-resistant virus, even after oseltamivir treatment was stopped. === H1N1 flu or ""swine flu"" === As of December 15, 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 314 samples of the prevalent 2009 pandemic H1N1 flu tested worldwide showed resistance to oseltamivir. The CDC found sporadic oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus infections had been identified, including with rare episodes of limited transmission, but the public health impact had been limited. Those sporadic cases of resistance were found in immunosuppressed patients during oseltamivir treatment and persons who developed illness while receiving oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis. During 2011, a new influenza A(H1N1)2009 variant with mildly reduced oseltamivir (and zanamivir) sensitivity was detected in more than 10% of community specimens in Singapore and more than 30% of samples from northern Australia. While there is concern that antiviral resistance may develop in people with haematologic malignancies due to their inability to reduce viral loads and several surveillance studies found oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 after administration of oseltamivir in those people, as of November 2013, widespread transmission of oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 has not occurred. During the 2007–08 flu season, the US CDC found 10.9% of H1N1 samples (n=1,020) to be resistant. In the 2008–09 season, the proportion of resistant H1N1 increased to 99.4%, while no other seasonal strains (H3N2, B) showed resistance. === Seasonal flu === From 2009 to 2014, oseltamivir resistance was very low in seasonal flu. In the 2010–11 flu season, 99.1% of H1N1, 99.8% of H3N, and 100% of Influenza B remained oseltamivir susceptible in the US. In January 2012, the US and European CDCs reported all seasonal flu samples tested since October 2011 to be oseltamivir susceptible. In the 2013–14 season only 1% of 2009 H1N1 viruses showed oseltamivir resistance. No other influenza viruses were resistant to oseltamivir. === H3N2 === Three studies have found resistance in 0%, 3.3%, and 18% of subjects. In the study with the 18% resistance rate, the subjects were children, many of whom had not been previously exposed to influenza virus and therefore had a weakened immune response; the results suggest that higher and earlier dosing may be necessary in such populations. === Influenza B === In 2007, Japanese investigators detected neuraminidase-resistant influenza B virus strains in individuals not treated with these drugs. The prevalence was 1.7%. According to the CDC, As of 2019, transmission of oseltamivir-resistant influenza B virus strains—from persons treated with the drug—is rare. === H5N1 avian influenza ""bird flu"" === As of 2013, H274Y and N294S mutations that confer resistance to oseltamivir have been identified in a few H5N1 isolates from infected patients treated with oseltamivir, and have emerged spontaneously in Egypt. === H7N9 avian influenza === As of 2013, two of 14 adults infected with A(H7N9) and treated with oseltamivir developed oseltamivir-resistant virus with the Arg292Lys mutation. == Pharmacokinetics == Its oral bioavailability is over 80% and is extensively metabolised to its active form upon first-pass through the liver, via esterases. It does not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. It has a volume of distribution of 23–26 litres. Its half-life is about 1–3 hours and its active carboxylate metabolite has a half-life of 6–10 hours. More than 90% of the oral dose is eliminated in the urine as the active metabolite. == History == Oseltamivir was discovered by scientists at Gilead Sciences using shikimic acid as a starting point for synthesis; shikimic acid was originally available only as an extract of Chinese star anise; but by 2006, 30% of the supply was manufactured recombinantly in E. coli. Gilead exclusively licensed their relevant patents to Roche in 1996. The drug has not been patent-protected in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and several other countries. In 1999, the FDA approved oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in adults based on two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. In June 2002, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza. In 2003, a pooled analysis of ten randomised clinical trials concluded that oseltamivir reduced the risk of lower respiratory tract infections resulting in antibiotic use and hospital admissions in adults. Oseltamivir (as Tamiflu) was widely used during the H5N1 avian influenza epidemic in Southeast Asia in 2005. In response to the epidemic, various governments – including those of the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, United States, and Australia – stockpiled quantities of oseltamivir in preparation for a possible pandemic and there were worldwide shortages of the drug, driven by the high demand for stockpiling. In November 2005, US President George W. Bush requested that Congress fund US$1 billion for the production and stockpile of oseltamivir, after Congress had already approved $1.8 billion for military use of the drug. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was a past chairman of Gilead Sciences, recused himself from all government decisions regarding the drug. In 2006, a Cochrane Review (since withdrawn) raised controversy by concluding that oseltamivir should not be used during routine seasonal influenza because of its low effectiveness. In December 2008, the Indian drug company Cipla won a case in India's court system allowing it to manufacture a cheaper generic version of Tamiflu, called Antiflu. In May 2009, Cipla won approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) certifying that its drug Antiflu was as effective as Tamiflu, and Antiflu is included in the WHO list of prequalified medicinal products. In 2009, a new A/H1N1 influenza virus was discovered to be spreading in North America. In June 2009, the WHO declared the A/H1N1 influenza a pandemic. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the CDC, the WHO, and the ECDC maintained their recommendation to use oseltamivir. From 2010 to 2012, Cochrane requested Roche's full clinical study reports of their trials, which they did not provide. In 2011, a freedom of information request to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided Cochrane with reports from 16 Roche oseltamivir trials. In 2012, the Cochrane team published an interim review based on those reports. In 2013, Roche released 74 full clinical study reports of oseltamivir trials after GSK released the data on zanamivir studies. In 2014, Cochrane published an updated review based solely on full clinical study reports and regulatory documents. In 2016, Roche's oseltamivir patents began to expire. == Veterinary use == There have been reports of oseltamivir reducing disease severity and hospitalization time in canine parvovirus infection. The drug may limit the ability of the virus to invade the crypt cells of the small intestine and decrease gastrointestinal bacterial colonization and toxin production. == Research == Oseltamivir has been deemed ineffective at treating COVID-19, consistent with the SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking influenza's neuraminidase enzyme. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) Information"".

3407,"('Olmesartan', 'Olmesartan acid', 'Votum', 'Omesartan', 'Olme sartan')",Medical,"In ancient Roman religion, a votum (plural vota; from Latin voveo, vovere 'vow, promise') is a vow or promise made to a deity. As the result of this verbal action, a votum is also that which fulfills a vow, that is, the thing promised, such as offerings, a statue, or even a temple building. The votum is thus an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion, a bargaining expressed by do ut des, ""I give that you might give."" == Private vota == In everyday life, individuals might make votive offerings to a deity for private concerns. Vota privata are attested in abundance by inscriptions, particularly for the later Imperial era. These are regularly marked with the letters V.S.L.M., votum solvit libens merito, noting that the person making the dedication ""He has fulfilled his vow, willingly, as it should."" William Warde Fowler found in these offerings ""expressions of … religious feeling"" and a gratitude for blessings received that go deeper than contractual formalism. == Military vota == During the Republican era, the votum was a regular part of ceremonies conducted at the Capitoline by a general holding imperium before deploying. The triumph with its dedication of spoils and animal sacrifices at the Capitol was in part a fulfillment of such a vow. A general who faced an uncertain outcome in battle might make a votum in the field promising to build a temple out of gratitude for divine aid in a victory. In 311 BC, Junius Bubulcus became the first plebeian general to vow and oversee the building of a temple; he honored the goddess Salus, ""Salvation"". A vow would also be made in connection with the ritual of evocatio, negotiations with the enemy's tutelary deity to offer superior cult. An extreme form of votum was the devotio, the ritual by which a general sacrificed himself in battle and asked the chthonic deities to take the enemy as offerings along with him. == Public vota == In the Republic, public vota (vota publica) or vota pro salute rei publicae (""vows for the well-being of the republic"") were offered on the day the consuls took office, eventually fixed on 1 January (Kal. Ian.). These were joined by vota for Caesar (vota pro Caesare or pro salute Caesaris) in 44 BC. Under the Empire, the Senate decreed vota on behalf of Octavian (later Augustus) as princeps in 30 BC. These vows for the well-being of the emperor (vota pro salute imperatoris, principis, or Augusti) were moved to 3 January—the usual date of the Compitalia—under Caligula in AD 38. Vota for the state continued to be held on January 1st, while the vows for the emperor came to include his family as well. During these public vows, offerings were made to Jupiter, Juno, Salus, and sometimes other deities. In Rome, these ceremonies were conducted by the consuls and pontiffs, and in the provinces probably by governors and local priests and officials. For the vota for the emperor and his family, the people of the capital were assembled to offer collective vows; it was refusal to take part in these events and similar rituals that sometimes led to persecution of Christians. Subsequently, the anniversary day of each emperor's acclamation (dies imperii) were celebrated with similar rituals; larger rituals marked the 5 year (quinquennalia) and 10 year anniversaries (decennalia). Incomplete records have led scholars to debate whether particular quinquennalia and decennalia were celebrated at the beginning of the year, on the dies imperii, or at some other time for specific reasons in each case. Vota publica continued in Rome even after Christianity had become the official religion of the Empire, possibly as late as the 6th century. Because the vows were as much affirmations of political loyalty as religious expressions, they were difficult to abolish without undermining the sacral aura of the emperor's authority. In the Eastern Roman Empire, this festival was known as the Vóta (Βότα). The emperors Arcadius and Honorius banned the sacrifices associated with the festival. In 692 the Quinisext Council forbade Christians from celebrating, but it remained on the court calendar at least until the reign of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r, 905–959). == See also == Ex-voto == References == === Citations === === Bibliography ===",Votum,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00016902448260225356), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007373951375484467)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -6.704273118884885e-07)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3408,"('Hypromellose', 'Hypromellosum')",Medical,"Hypromellose (INN), short for hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), is a semisynthetic, inert, viscoelastic polymer used in eye drops, as well as an excipient and controlled-delivery component in oral medicaments, found in a variety of commercial products. As a food additive, hypromellose is an emulsifier, thickening and suspending agent, and an alternative to animal gelatin. Its Codex Alimentarius code (E number) is E464. == Chemistry == Hypromellose is a solid, and is a slightly off-white to beige powder in appearance and may be formed into granules. The compound forms colloids when dissolved in water. This non-toxic ingredient is combustible and can react vigorously with oxidizing agents. Hypromellose in an aqueous solution, like methylcellulose, exhibits a thermal gelation property. That is, when the solution heats up to a critical temperature, the solution congeals into a non-flowable but semi-flexible mass. Typically, this critical (congealing) temperature is inversely related to both the solution concentration of HPMC and the concentration of the methoxy group within the HPMC molecule (which in turn depends on both the degree of substitution of the methoxy group and the molar substitution). That is, the higher the concentration of the methoxy group, the lower the critical temperature. The inflexibility/viscosity of the resulting mass, however, is directly related to the concentration of the methoxy group (the higher the concentration is, the more viscous or less flexible the resulting mass is). == Uses == There are many fields of application for hypromellose, including: Tile adhesives Cement renders Gypsum products Pharmaceutical Paints and coatings Food Cosmetics Detergents and cleaners Eye drops Contact lenses Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) === Use in whole grain breads === Agricultural Research Service scientists are investigating using the plant-derived HPMC as a substitute for gluten in making all-oat and other grain breads. Gluten, which is present in wheat, rye, and barley, is absent (or present only in trace quantities) in oat and other grains. Like gluten, HPMC can trap air bubbles formed by the yeast in bread dough, causing the bread to rise. === Use in construction materials === HPMC is used primarily in construction materials like tile adhesives and renders where it is used as a rheology modifier and water retention agent. Functionally HPMC is very similar to HEMC (hydroxy ethyl methyl cellulose) Trade names include Methocel and Walocel. The global leading producer is now DuPont, formerly manufactured under Dow Wolff Cellulosics GmbH. === Ophthalmic applications === Hypromellose solutions were patented as a semisynthetic substitute for tear-film. Its molecular structure is predicated upon a base celluloid compound that is highly water-soluble. Post-application, celluloid attributes of good water solubility reportedly aid in visual clarity. When applied, a hypromellose solution acts to swell and absorb water, thereby expanding the thickness of the tear-film. Hypromellose augmentation therefore results in extended lubricant time presence on the cornea, which theoretically results in decreased eye irritation, especially in dry climates, home, or work environments. On a molecular level, this polymer contains beta-linked D-glucose units that remain metabolically intact for days to weeks. On a manufacturing note, since hypromellose is a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, it is slightly more expensive to produce due to semisynthetic manufacturing processes. Aside from its widespread commercial and retail availability over the counter in a variety of products, hypromellose 2% solution has been documented to be used during surgery to aid in corneal protection and during orbital surgery. === Excipient/tableting ingredient === In addition to its use in ophthalmic liquids, hypromellose has been used as an excipient in oral tablet and capsule formulations, where, depending on the grade, it functions as controlled release agent to delay the release of a medicinal compound into the digestive tract. It is also used as a binder and as a component of tablet coatings. == Test methods == Various benchmark tests are used to qualify hypromellose: Viscosity Degree of substitution (DS) Molar substitution (MS) Salt content Moisture === Viscosity test methods === Because hypromellose solution is a non-newtonian solution and exhibits pseudoplastic, more specifically, thixotropic behavior, various test methods are available, and the results of different methods and viscosimeters do not necessarily correspond to each other. Also, due to viscometer acceptable ranges of error, viscosity is typically given as a mean, or as a range. Typical viscosity test will specify the following: Solution concentration (1%, 2%, 1.9% bone dry, etc.) Viscometer (RheoSense m-VROC and microVISC, Brookfield LV or RV, Höppler falling ball, Haake Rotovisco, etc.) Viscometer spindle number (1 ~ 4 for Brookfield LV, 1 ~ 7 for Brookfield RV, etc.) Solution Temperature (20 °C, 25 °C, etc.) === Degree of substitution === Degree of substitution is the average level of methoxy substitution on the cellulose chain. Since there are maximum three possible sites of substitution with each cellulose molecule, this average value is a real number between 0 and 3. However, degree of substitution is often expressed in percentages. === Molar substitution === Molar substitution is the average level of hydroxypropoxy substitution on the cellulose chain. Since hydroxypropoxy base can be attached to each other on side chains and does not each require a base substitution site on the cellulose molecule, this number can be higher than 3. However, molar substitution is also often expressed in percentages. === Moisture === Since all cellulose ethers are hygroscopic, they will absorb moisture from surroundings if left exposed from original packaging. Thus, moisture must be tested and weight corrected to ensure adequate amount of dry active material are apportioned for usage. Moisture is tested by weighing a sample of X grams on an analytic scale, and drying the sample in an oven at 105 °C for 2 hours, then weighing the sample again on the same scale. == See also == Hydroxypropyl cellulose Methyl cellulose == References == == External links == Methylcellulose & Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose for building materials",Hypromellose,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.20510739088058472), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.031110970303416252), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.10022284835577011), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -3.5716304410016164e-05), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.07135725021362305), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.01681007258594036), (',', -0.002480051713064313), ('ĠPERSON', -0.3133402466773987), ('AL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('ĠCARE', -2.1815061700181104e-05), (',', -0.048591189086437225), ('ĠINDU', -3.6238969187252223e-05), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -3.933898824470816e-06), ('AL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009210634743794799)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0009697027853690088), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.339278580620885e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.011988099664449692), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.014163747429847717), (' INDUSTR', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypromellose?utm_source=openai), [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hypromellose-ophthalmic-route/description/drg-20064245?utm_source=openai), [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/inactive/hypromelloses-447.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=347, start_index=42, title='Hypromellose', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypromellose?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=347, start_index=42, title='Hypromellose (ophthalmic route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hypromellose-ophthalmic-route/description/drg-20064245?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=347, start_index=42, title='Hypromelloses: What is it and where is it used?', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/inactive/hypromelloses-447.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3409,"('Folinic acid', 'Leucovorin')","Endogenous, Medical","Folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, is a medication used to decrease the toxic effects of methotrexate and pyrimethamine. It is also used in combination with 5-fluorouracil to treat colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer, may be used to treat folate deficiency that results in anemia, and methanol poisoning. It is taken by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. Side effects may include trouble sleeping, allergic reactions, or fever. Use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally regarded as safe. When used for anemia it is recommended that pernicious anemia as a cause be ruled out first. Folinic acid is a form of folic acid that does not require activation by dihydrofolate reductase to be useful to the body. Folinic acid was first made in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical use == Folinic acid can be taken as a pill (orally) or injected into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). === To reduce effects of methotrexate === Folinic acid is given following methotrexate as part of a total chemotherapeutic plan, where it may protect against bone marrow suppression or gastrointestinal mucosa inflammation. No apparent effect is seen on pre-existing methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity. While not specifically an antidote for methotrexate, folinic acid may also be useful in the treatment of acute methotrexate overdose. Different dosing protocols are used, but folinic acid should be redosed until the methotrexate level is less than 5 x 10−8 M. Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores. === Other uses or indications === Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for ""rescue"" purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, although its value for this indication has not been clearly established. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF. In pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, folinic acid may be used as additional therapy if pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate fails to fully control the seizures. == Side effects == Folinic acid should not be administered intrathecally. This may produce severe adverse effects or even death. Severe neurotoxicity due to intrathecal folinic acid as treatment for intrathecally-administered methotrexate was first noted in an 11-year-old boy being treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia In cancer patients, rare hypersensitivity reactions to folinic acid have been described. == Drug interactions == Fluorouracil: Folinic acid may increase the toxicity associated with fluorouracil if the two are administered together. Some adverse effects that have occurred, particularly in elderly patients, include severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim: A potential drug interaction exists with concomitant use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folinic acid. Folinic acid has been shown to decrease the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii), a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS patients. == Mechanism of action == Folinic acid is a 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily converted to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e.g., 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate), thus has vitamin activity equivalent to that of folic acid. Since it does not require the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. This is the classical view of folinic acid rescue therapy. In 1980s, however, folinic acid was found to reactivate the dihydrofolate reductase itself even when methotrexate exists. Although the mechanism is not very clear, the polyglutamylation of methotrexate and dihydrofolate in malignant cells is considered to play an important role in the selective reactivation of dihydrofolate reductase by folinic acid in normal cells. Folinic acid, therefore, allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, so some normal DNA replication processes can proceed. Folinic acid has dextro- and levorotary isomers. Both levoleucovorin (the levorotary isomer) and racemic folinic acid (a mixture of both isomers) have similar efficacy and tolerability. Levoleucovorin was approved by the FDA in 2008. == History == Folinic acid was discovered as a needed growth factor for the bacterium Leuconostoc citrovorum in 1948, by Sauberlich and Baumann. This resulted in it being called ""citrovorum factor,"" meaning citrovorum growth factor. It had an unknown structure, but was found to be a derivative of folate that had to be metabolized in the liver before it could support growth of L. citrovorum. The synthesis of citrovorum factor by liver cells in culture was eventually accomplished from pteroylglutamic acid in the presence of suitable concentrations of ascorbic acid. The simultaneous addition of sodium formate to such systems resulted in increased citrovorum factor activity in the cell-free supernatants (producing, as now known, the 5-formyl derivative), and from this method of preparation of large amounts of the factor, its structure as levo-folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid) was eventually deduced. == Names == Folinic acid should be distinguished from folic acid (vitamin B9). However, folinic acid is a vitamer for folic acid and has the full vitamin activity of this vitamin. Levofolinic acid and its salts are the 2S-form of the molecule. They are the only forms of the molecule that are known to be biologically active. It is generally administered as the calcium or sodium salt (calcium folinate (INN), sodium folinate, leucovorin calcium, leucovorin sodium). == References == == External links == ""Leucovorin"".

Additionally, folinic acid is sometimes used to reduce the side effects of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This includes reductions in nausea, abdominal pain, abnormal liver blood tests, and mouth sores. === Other uses or indications === Folinic acid is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil in treating colon cancer. In this case, folinic acid is not used for ""rescue"" purposes; rather, it enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. Folinic acid is also sometimes used to prevent toxic effects of high doses of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors such as trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, although its value for this indication has not been clearly established. It may be prescribed in the treatment of toxoplasmosis retinitis, in combination with the folic acid antagonists pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Folinic acid is also used in the treatment of cerebral folate deficiency, a syndrome in which the use of folic acid cannot normalize cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-MTHF. In pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, folinic acid may be used as additional therapy if pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate fails to fully control the seizures. == Side effects == Folinic acid should not be administered intrathecally. This may produce severe adverse effects or even death. Severe neurotoxicity due to intrathecal folinic acid as treatment for intrathecally-administered methotrexate was first noted in an 11-year-old boy being treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia In cancer patients, rare hypersensitivity reactions to folinic acid have been described. == Drug interactions == Fluorouracil: Folinic acid may increase the toxicity associated with fluorouracil if the two are administered together. Some adverse effects that have occurred, particularly in elderly patients, include severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim: A potential drug interaction exists with concomitant use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and folinic acid. Folinic acid has been shown to decrease the efficacy of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii), a common cause of pneumonia in AIDS patients. == Mechanism of action == Folinic acid is a 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily converted to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e.g., 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate), thus has vitamin activity equivalent to that of folic acid. Since it does not require the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. This is the classical view of folinic acid rescue therapy. In 1980s, however, folinic acid was found to reactivate the dihydrofolate reductase itself even when methotrexate exists. Although the mechanism is not very clear, the polyglutamylation of methotrexate and dihydrofolate in malignant cells is considered to play an important role in the selective reactivation of dihydrofolate reductase by folinic acid in normal cells. Folinic acid, therefore, allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, so some normal DNA replication processes can proceed. Folinic acid has dextro- and levorotary isomers. Both levoleucovorin (the levorotary isomer) and racemic folinic acid (a mixture of both isomers) have similar efficacy and tolerability. Levoleucovorin was approved by the FDA in 2008. == History == Folinic acid was discovered as a needed growth factor for the bacterium Leuconostoc citrovorum in 1948, by Sauberlich and Baumann. This resulted in it being called ""citrovorum factor,"" meaning citrovorum growth factor. It had an unknown structure, but was found to be a derivative of folate that had to be metabolized in the liver before it could support growth of L. citrovorum. The synthesis of citrovorum factor by liver cells in culture was eventually accomplished from pteroylglutamic acid in the presence of suitable concentrations of ascorbic acid. The simultaneous addition of sodium formate to such systems resulted in increased citrovorum factor activity in the cell-free supernatants (producing, as now known, the 5-formyl derivative), and from this method of preparation of large amounts of the factor, its structure as levo-folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid) was eventually deduced. == Names == Folinic acid should be distinguished from folic acid (vitamin B9). However, folinic acid is a vitamer for folic acid and has the full vitamin activity of this vitamin. Levofolinic acid and its salts are the 2S-form of the molecule. They are the only forms of the molecule that are known to be biologically active. It is generally administered as the calcium or sodium salt (calcium folinate (INN), sodium folinate, leucovorin calcium, leucovorin sodium). == References == == External links == ""Leucovorin"".

3411,"('Penicillamine', 'Cuprimine', 'Depen', 'Cuprenil', 'Penamine')",Medical,"Penicillamine, sold under the brand name of Cuprimine among others, is a medication primarily used for the treatment of Wilson's disease. It is also used for people with kidney stones who have high urine cystine levels, rheumatoid arthritis, and various heavy metal poisonings. It is taken by mouth. Penicillamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == It is used as a chelating agent: In Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism, penicillamine treatment relies on its binding to accumulated copper and elimination through urine. Penicillamine was the second line treatment for arsenic poisoning, after dimercaprol (BAL). It is no longer recommended. In cystinuria, a hereditary disorder in which high urine cystine levels lead to the formation of cystine stones, penicillamine binds with cysteine to yield a mixed disulfide which is more soluble than cystine. Penicillamine has been used to treat scleroderma. Penicillamine can be used as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) to treat severe active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed to respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy, although it is rarely used today due to availability of TNF inhibitors and other agents, such as tocilizumab and tofacitinib. Penicillamine works by reducing numbers of T-lymphocytes, inhibiting macrophage function, decreasing IL-1, decreasing rheumatoid factor, and preventing collagen from cross-linking. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include rash, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, and low white blood cell levels. Other serious side effects include liver problems, obliterative bronchiolitis, and myasthenia gravis. It is not recommended in people with lupus erythematosus. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Penicillamine works by binding heavy metals; the resulting penicillamine–metal complexes are then removed from the body in the urine. Bone marrow suppression, dysgeusia, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common side effects, occurring in ~20–30% of the patients treated with penicillamine. Other possible adverse effects include: Nephropathy Hepatotoxicity Membranous glomerulonephritis Aplastic anemia (idiosyncratic) Antibody-mediated myasthenia gravis and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which may persist even after its withdrawal Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus Elastosis perforans serpiginosa Toxic myopathies Unwanted breast growth (macromastia) Oligospermia == Chemistry == Penicillamine is a trifunctional organic compound, consisting of a thiol, an amine, and a carboxylic acid. It is an amino acid structurally similar to cysteine, but with geminal dimethyl substituents α to the thiol. Like most amino acids, it is a colorless solid that exists in the zwitterionic form at physiological pH. Penicillamine is a chiral drug with one stereogenic center; the two enantiomers have distinctly different physiological effects. (S)-penicillamine (D-penicillamine, having (–) optical rotation) is antiarthritic. (R)-penicillamine (L-penicillamine, having (+) optical rotation) is toxic because it inhibits the action of pyridoxine (also known as vitamin B6). That enantiomer is a metabolite of penicillin but has no antibiotic properties itself. A variety of penicillamine–copper complex structures are known. == History == John Walshe first described the use of penicillamine in Wilson's disease in 1956. He had discovered the compound in the urine of patients (including himself) who had taken penicillin, and experimentally confirmed that it increased urinary copper excretion by chelation. He had initial difficulty convincing several world experts of the time (Denny-Brown and Cumings) of its efficacy, as they held that Wilson's disease was not primarily a problem of copper homeostasis but of amino acid metabolism, and that dimercaprol should be used as a chelator. Later studies confirmed both the copper-centered theory and the efficacy of D-penicillamine. Walshe also pioneered other chelators in Wilson's such as triethylene tetramine and tetrathiomolybdate. Penicillamine was first synthesized by John Cornforth under supervision of Robert Robinson. Penicillamine has been used in rheumatoid arthritis since the first successful case in 1964. == Cost == In the United States, Valeant raised the cost of the medication from about US$500 to US$24,000 per month in 2016. == References == == External links == ""Penicillamine"".

It is available for veterinary use in both Europe (as Regumate) and the United States (as Matrix). == Uses == === Veterinary === Altrenogest is used in veterinary medicine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === An in vitro yeast structure–activity relationships bioassay study found that altrenogest was the most potent agonist of both the progesterone receptor (PR) and the androgen receptor (AR) of a large selection of other progestogens as well as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS). The observed potency of altrenogest even exceeded that of metribolone (methyltrienolone, R-1881), which was the second most potent compound. In the study, it showed an EC50 of 0.64 nM for the AR and 688% of the relative activational potency of testosterone and an EC50 of 0.3 nM and 1,300% of the relative activational potency of progesterone, with an AR/PR activational potency ratio of 0.53. Although very potent in both activities in vitro, the AR/PR activational potency ratio of altrenogest was in the same range as that of other 19-nortestosterone progestins such as norethisterone, noretynodrel, norgestrel, and allylestrenol (ratio for all < 1.0), whereas the AR/PR activational potency ratio of its 17α-deallylated AAS analogue trenbolone was, at 64, profoundly increased (although the ratio of metribolone (the 17α-methylated variant of altrenogest), at 0.56, was almost the same as that of altrenogest). According to its manufacturer Roussel Uclaf, altrenogest has weak anabolic and androgenic activity equivalent to 1/20th of that of testosterone. However, no significant androgenic effects have been observed in young stallions or mature mares, and altrenogest has notably been used to maintain pregnancy in mares (similarly to the use of allylestrenol to maintain pregnancy in women) with no incidence of virilization or other abnormalities in filly offspring. On the other hand, minor potential anabolic/androgenic effects have been suggested for altrenogest in pigs. == Chemistry == Altrenogest, also known as 17α-allyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone or as 17α-allylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and derivative of 19-nortestosterone and 17α-allyltestosterone, or of 17α-allyl-19-nortestosterone. It is one of only two marketed progestins that possesses a 17α-allyl group, the other being allylestrenol. Most other progestins possess a 17α-ethynyl group, while AAS, if they are 17α-substituted, are usually 17α-alkylated (with a methyl or ethyl group). Altrenogest is the 17α-allylated derivative of the AAS trenbolone (and hence can also be referred to as allyltrenbolone or allyltrienolone), which itself is the 9,11-didehydro analogue of the AAS nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).

Cidofovir was approved for medical use in 1996. == Medical use == === DNA virus === Its only indication that has received regulatory approval worldwide is cytomegalovirus retinitis. Cidofovir has also shown efficacy in the treatment of aciclovir-resistant HSV infections. Cidofovir has also been investigated as a treatment for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with successful case reports of its use. Despite this, the drug failed to demonstrate any efficacy in controlled studies. Cidofovir might have anti-smallpox efficacy and might be used on a limited basis in the event of a bioterror incident involving smallpox cases. Brincidofovir, a cidofovir derivative with much higher activity against smallpox that can be taken orally has been developed. It has inhibitory effects on varicella-zoster virus replication in vitro although no clinical trials have been done to date, likely due to the abundance of safer alternatives such as aciclovir. Cidofovir shows anti-BK virus activity in a subgroup of transplant recipients. Cidofovir is being investigated as a complementary intralesional therapy against papillomatosis caused by HPV. It first received FDA approval on 26 June 1996, TGA approval on 30 April 1998 and EMA approval on 23 April 1997. It has been used topically to treat warts. === Other === It has been suggested as an antitumour agent, due to its suppression of FGF2. == Administration == Cidofovir is only available as an intravenous formulation. Cidofovir is to be administered with probenecid which decreases side effects to the kidney. Probenecid mitigates nephrotoxicity by inhibiting organic anion transport of the proximal tubule epithelial cells of the kidney. In addition, hydration must be administered to patients receiving cidofovir. 1 liter of normal saline is recommended in conjunction with each dose of cidofovir. == Side effects == The major dose-limiting side effect of cidofovir is nephrotoxicity (i.e., kidney damage). Other common side effects (occurring in >1% of people treated with the drug) include: Whereas uncommon side effects include: anaemia and elevated liver enzymes and rare side effects include: tachycardia and Fanconi syndrome. Probenecid (a uricosuric drug) and intravenous saline should always be administered with each cidofovir infusion to prevent this nephrotoxicity. === Contraindications === Hypersensitivity to cidofovir or probenecid (as probenecid needs to be given concurrently to avoid nephrotoxicity). == Interactions == It is known to interact with nephrotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, foscarnet, IV aminoglycosides, IV pentamide, vancomycin, tacrolimus, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.) to increase their nephrotoxic potential. As it must be given concurrently with probenecid it is advised that drugs that are known to interact with probenecid (e.g. drugs that probenecid interferes with the renal tubular secretion of, such as paracetamol, aciclovir, aminosalicylic acid, etc.) are also withheld. == Mechanism of action == Its active metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate, inhibits viral replication by selectively inhibiting viral DNA polymerases.

3418,"('Edrophonium (chloride)', 'Edrophonium', 'Tensilon', 'Edrophonum', 'Enlon')",Medical,"Edrophonium, formerly sold under the brand name Tensilon among others, is a readily reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It prevents breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by competitively inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, mainly at the neuromuscular junction. == Medical uses == Edrophonium (by the so-called Tensilon test) is used to differentiate myasthenia gravis from cholinergic crisis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. In myasthenia gravis, the body produces autoantibodies which block, inhibit or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction. Edrophonium—an effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor— reduces the muscle weakness by blocking the enzymatic effect of acetylcholinesterase enzymes, prolonging the presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. It binds to a Serine-103 allosteric site, while pyridostigmine and neostigmine bind to the ancetylcholinesterase active site for their inhibitory effects. In a cholinergic crisis, where a person has too much neuromuscular stimulation, edrophonium will make the muscle weakness worse by inducing a depolarizing block. However, the edrophonium and ice pack tests are no longer recommended as first-line tests due to false positive results. In practice, the edrophonium test has been replaced by testing for autoantibodies, including acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies and muscle specific tyrosine kinase autoantibodies. The Tensilon test may also be used to predict if neurotoxic paralysis caused by snake envenomation is presynaptic or postsynaptic. If it is postsynaptic, then paralysis will be temporally reversed, indicating that can be reversed by adequate antivenom therapy. If the neurotoxicity is presynaptic, then the Tensilon test will show no response and antivenom will not reverse such paralysis. In this instance reversal of paralysis will not occur until the damaged terminal axons at the neuromuscular junction have recovered, this may take days or weeks. The drug may also be used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade at the end of a surgical procedure. == Chemistry == Edrophonium, ethyl-(3-hydroxyphenyl)dimethylammonium chloride, is made by reacting 3-dimethylaminophenol with ethyl bromide, which forms ethyl(3-hydroxyphenyl)dimethylammonium bromide, the bromine atom of which is replaced with a chlorine atom by reacting it with silver chloride, giving edrophonium. == Pharmacokinetics == The drug has a brief duration of action, about 10–30 mins. == References == == Further reading ==",Enlon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001668252982199192), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011095608584582806)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/enlon.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Enlon Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/enlon.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3421,"('Flavin adenine dinucleotide (disodium salt)', 'Flavin adenine dinucleotide', 'Flavin-adenine dinucleotide', 'Flavine-adenine dinucleotide', 'Flavitan')","Endogenous, Medical","In biochemistry, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a redox-active coenzyme associated with various proteins, which is involved with several enzymatic reactions in metabolism. A flavoprotein is a protein that contains a flavin group, which may be in the form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Many flavoproteins are known: components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. FAD can exist in four redox states, which are the flavin-N(5)-oxide, quinone, semiquinone, and hydroquinone. FAD is converted between these states by accepting or donating electrons. FAD, in its fully oxidized form, or quinone form, accepts two electrons and two protons to become FADH2 (hydroquinone form). The semiquinone (FADH·) can be formed by either reduction of FAD or oxidation of FADH2 by accepting or donating one electron and one proton, respectively. Some proteins, however, generate and maintain a superoxidized form of the flavin cofactor, the flavin-N(5)-oxide. == History == Flavoproteins were first discovered in 1879 by separating components of cow's milk. They were initially called lactochrome due to their milky origin and yellow pigment. It took 50 years for the scientific community to make any substantial progress in identifying the molecules responsible for the yellow pigment. The 1930s launched the field of coenzyme research with the publication of many flavin and nicotinamide derivative structures and their obligate roles in redox catalysis. German scientists Otto Warburg and Walter Christian discovered a yeast derived yellow protein required for cellular respiration in 1932. Their colleague Hugo Theorell separated this yellow enzyme into apoenzyme and yellow pigment, and showed that neither the enzyme nor the pigment was capable of oxidizing NADH on their own, but mixing them together would restore activity. Theorell confirmed the pigment to be riboflavin's phosphate ester, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in 1937, which was the first direct evidence for enzyme cofactors. Warburg and Christian then found FAD to be a cofactor of D-amino acid oxidase through similar experiments in 1938. Warburg's work with linking nicotinamide to hydride transfers and the discovery of flavins paved the way for many scientists in the 40s and 50s to discover copious amounts of redox biochemistry and link them together in pathways such as the citric acid cycle and ATP synthesis. == Properties == Flavin adenine dinucleotide consists of two portions: the adenine nucleotide (adenosine monophosphate) and the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) bridged together through their phosphate groups. Adenine is bound to a cyclic ribose at the 1' carbon, while phosphate is bound to the ribose at the 5' carbon to form the adenine nucledotide. Riboflavin is formed by a carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond between the isoalloxazine and the ribitol. The phosphate group is then bound to the terminal ribose carbon, forming a FMN. Because the bond between the isoalloxazine and the ribitol is not considered to be a glycosidic bond, the flavin mononucleotide is not truly a nucleotide. This makes the dinucleotide name misleading; however, the flavin mononucleotide group is still very close to a nucleotide in its structure and chemical properties. FAD can be reduced to FADH2 through the addition of 2 H+ and 2 e−. FADH2 can also be oxidized by the loss of 1 H+ and 1 e− to form FADH. The FAD form can be recreated through the further loss of 1 H+ and 1 e−. FAD formation can also occur through the reduction and dehydration of flavin-N(5)-oxide. Based on the oxidation state, flavins take specific colors when in aqueous solution. flavin-N(5)-oxide (superoxidized) is yellow-orange, FAD (fully oxidized) is yellow, FADH (half reduced) is either blue or red based on the pH, and the fully reduced form is colorless. Changing the form can have a large impact on other chemical properties. For example, FAD, the fully oxidized form is subject to nucleophilic attack, the fully reduced form, FADH2 has high polarizability, while the half reduced form is unstable in aqueous solution. FAD is an aromatic ring system, whereas FADH2 is not. This means that FADH2 is significantly higher in energy, without the stabilization through resonance that the aromatic structure provides. FADH2 is an energy-carrying molecule, because, once oxidized it regains aromaticity and releases the energy represented by this stabilization. The spectroscopic properties of FAD and its variants allows for reaction monitoring by use of UV-VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Each form of FAD has distinct absorbance spectra, making for easy observation of changes in oxidation state. A major local absorbance maximum for FAD is observed at 450 nm, with an extinction coefficient of 11,300 M−1 cm−1. Flavins in general have fluorescent activity when unbound (proteins bound to flavin nucleic acid derivatives are called flavoproteins). This property can be utilized when examining protein binding, observing loss of fluorescent activity when put into the bound state. Oxidized flavins have high absorbances of about 450 nm, and fluoresce at about 515-520 nm. == Chemical states == In biological systems, FAD acts as an acceptor of H+ and e− in its fully oxidized form, an acceptor or donor in the FADH form, and a donor in the reduced FADH2 form. The diagram below summarizes the potential changes that it can undergo. Along with what is seen above, other reactive forms of FAD can be formed and consumed. These reactions involve the transfer of electrons and the making/breaking of chemical bonds. Through reaction mechanisms, FAD is able to contribute to chemical activities within biological systems. The following pictures depict general forms of some of the actions that FAD can be involved in. Mechanisms 1 and 2 represent hydride gain, in which the molecule gains what amounts to be one hydride ion. Mechanisms 3 and 4 radical formation and hydride loss. Radical species contain unpaired electron atoms and are very chemically active. Hydride loss is the inverse process of the hydride gain seen before. The final two mechanisms show nucleophilic addition and a reaction using a carbon radical. == Biosynthesis == FAD plays a major role as an enzyme cofactor along with flavin mononucleotide, another molecule originating from riboflavin. Bacteria, fungi and plants can produce riboflavin, but other eukaryotes, such as humans, have lost the ability to make it. Therefore, humans must obtain riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, from dietary sources. Riboflavin is generally ingested in the small intestine and then transported to cells via carrier proteins. Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) adds a phosphate group to riboflavin to produce flavin mononucleotide, and then FAD synthetase attaches an adenine nucleotide; both steps require ATP. Bacteria generally have one bi-functional enzyme, but archaea and eukaryotes usually employ two distinct enzymes. Current research indicates that distinct isoforms exist in the cytosol and mitochondria. It seems that FAD is synthesized in both locations and potentially transported where needed. == Function == Flavoproteins utilize the unique and versatile structure of flavin moieties to catalyze difficult redox reactions. Since flavins have multiple redox states they can participate in processes that involve the transfer of either one or two electrons, hydrogen atoms, or hydronium ions. The N5 and C4a of the fully oxidized flavin ring are also susceptible to nucleophilic attack. This wide variety of ionization and modification of the flavin moiety can be attributed to the isoalloxazine ring system and the ability of flavoproteins to drastically perturb the kinetic parameters of flavins upon binding, including flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the genome (the flavoproteome) is species dependent and can range from 0.1% - 3.5%, with humans having 90 flavoprotein encoded genes. FAD is the more complex and abundant form of flavin and is reported to bind to 75% of the total flavoproteome and 84% of human encoded flavoproteins. Cellular concentrations of free or non-covalently bound flavins in a variety of cultured mammalian cell lines were reported for FAD (2.2-17.0 amol/cell) and FMN (0.46-3.4 amol/cell). FAD has a more positive reduction potential than NAD+ and is a very strong oxidizing agent. The cell utilizes this in many energetically difficult oxidation reactions such as dehydrogenation of a C-C bond to an alkene. FAD-dependent proteins function in a large variety of metabolic pathways including electron transport, DNA repair, nucleotide biosynthesis, beta-oxidation of fatty acids, amino acid catabolism, as well as synthesis of other cofactors such as CoA, CoQ and heme groups. One well-known reaction is part of the citric acid cycle (also known as the TCA or Krebs cycle); succinate dehydrogenase (complex II in the electron transport chain) requires covalently bound FAD to catalyze the oxidation of succinate to fumarate by coupling it with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. The high-energy electrons from this oxidation are stored momentarily by reducing FAD to FADH2. FADH2 then reverts to FAD, sending its two high-energy electrons through the electron transport chain; the energy in FADH2 is enough to produce 1.5 equivalents of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Some redox flavoproteins non-covalently bind to FAD like Acetyl-CoA-dehydrogenases which are involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids like leucine (isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase), isoleucine, (short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), valine (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase), and lysine (glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase). Additional examples of FAD-dependent enzymes that regulate metabolism are glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (triglyceride synthesis) and xanthine oxidase involved in purine nucleotide catabolism. Noncatalytic functions that FAD can play in flavoproteins include as structural roles, or involved in blue-sensitive light photoreceptors that regulate biological clocks and development, generation of light in bioluminescent bacteria. == Flavoproteins == Flavoproteins have either an FMN or FAD molecule as a prosthetic group, this prosthetic group can be tightly bound or covalently linked. Only about 5-10% of flavoproteins have a covalently linked FAD, but these enzymes have stronger redox power. In some instances, FAD can provide structural support for active sites or provide stabilization of intermediates during catalysis. Based on the available structural data, the known FAD-binding sites can be divided into more than 200 types. 90 flavoproteins are encoded in the human genome; about 84% require FAD, and around 16% require FMN, whereas 5 proteins require both to be present. Flavoproteins are mainly located in the mitochondria because of their redox power. Of all flavoproteins, 90% perform redox reactions and the other 10% are transferases, lyases, isomerases, ligases. === Oxidation of carbon-heteroatom bonds === ==== Carbon-nitrogen ==== Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an extensively studied flavoenzyme due to its biological importance with the catabolism of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. MAO oxidizes primary, secondary and tertiary amines, which nonenzymatically hydrolyze from the imine to aldehyde or ketone. Even though this class of enzyme has been extensively studied, its mechanism of action is still being debated. Two mechanisms have been proposed: a radical mechanism and a nucleophilic mechanism. The radical mechanism is less generally accepted because no spectral or electron paramagnetic resonance evidence exists for the presence of a radical intermediate. The nucleophilic mechanism is more favored because it is supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies which mutated two tyrosine residues that were expected to increase the nucleophilicity of the substrates. ==== Carbon-oxygen ==== Glucose oxidase (GOX) catalyzes the oxidation of β-D-glucose to D-glucono-δ-lactone with the simultaneous reduction of enzyme-bound flavin. GOX exists as a homodimer, with each subunit binding one FAD molecule. Crystal structures show that FAD binds in a deep pocket of the enzyme near the dimer interface. Studies showed that upon replacement of FAD with 8-hydroxy-5-carba-5-deaza FAD, the stereochemistry of the reaction was determined by reacting with the re face of the flavin. During turnover, the neutral and anionic semiquinones are observed which indicates a radical mechanism. ==== Carbon-sulfur ==== Prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase) catalyzes the cleavage of prenylcysteine (a protein modification) to form an isoprenoid aldehyde and the freed cysteine residue on the protein target. The FAD is non-covalently bound to PCLase. Not many mechanistic studies have been done looking at the reactions of the flavin, but the proposed mechanism is shown below. A hydride transfer from the C1 of the prenyl moiety to FAD is proposed, resulting in the reduction of the flavin to FADH2. COformED IS a carbocation that is stabilized by the neighboring sulfur atom. FADH2 then reacts with molecular oxygen to restore the oxidized enzyme. === Carbon-carbon === UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvylglucosamine Reductase (MurB) is an enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of enolpyruvyl-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (substrate) to the corresponding D-lactyl compound UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (product). MurB is a monomer and contains one FAD molecule. Before the substrate can be converted to product, NADPH must first reduce FAD. Once NADP+ dissociates, the substrate can bind and the reduced flavin can reduce the product. === Thiol/disulfide chemistry === Glutathione reductase (GR) catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to glutathione (GSH). GR requires FAD and NADPH to facilitate this reaction; first a hydride must be transferred from NADPH to FAD. The reduced flavin can then act as a nucleophile to attack the disulfide, this forms the C4a-cysteine adduct. Elimination of this adduct results in a flavin-thiolate charge-transfer complex. === Electron transfer reactions === Cytochrome P450 type enzymes that catalyze monooxygenase (hydroxylation) reactions are dependent on the transfer of two electrons from FAD to the P450. Two types of P450 systems are found in eukaryotes. The P450 systems that are located in the endoplasmic reticulum are dependent on a cytochrome P-450 reductase (CPR) that contains both an FAD and an FMN. The two electrons on reduced FAD (FADH2) are transferred one at a time to FMN and then a single electron is passed from FMN to the heme of the P450. The P450 systems that are located in the mitochondria are dependent on two electron transfer proteins: An FAD containing adrenodoxin reductase (AR) and a small iron-sulfur group containing protein named adrenodoxin. FAD is embedded in the FAD-binding domain of AR. The FAD of AR is reduced to FADH2 by transfer of two electrons from NADPH that binds in the NADP-binding domain of AR. The structure of this enzyme is highly conserved to maintain precisely the alignment of electron donor NADPH and acceptor FAD for efficient electron transfer. The two electrons in reduced FAD are transferred one a time to adrenodoxin which in turn donates the single electron to the heme group of the mitochondrial P450. The structures of the reductase of the microsomal versus reductase of the mitochondrial P450 systems are completely different and show no homology. === Redox === p-Hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) catalyzes the oxygenation of p-hydroxybenzoate (pOHB) to 3,4-dihyroxybenzoate (3,4-diOHB); FAD, NADPH and molecular oxygen are all required for this reaction. NADPH first transfers a hydride equivalent to FAD, creating FADH−, and then NADP+ dissociates from the enzyme. Reduced PHBH then reacts with molecular oxygen to form the flavin-C(4a)-hydroperoxide. The flavin hydroperoxide quickly hydroxylates pOHB, and then eliminates water to regenerate oxidized flavin. An alternative flavin-mediated oxygenation mechanism involves the use of a flavin-N(5)-oxide rather than a flavin-C(4a)-(hydro)peroxide. === Nonredox === Chorismate synthase (CS) catalyzes the last step in the shikimate pathway—the formation of chorismate. Two classes of CS are known, both of which require FMN, but are divided on their need for NADPH as a reducing agent. The proposed mechanism for CS involves radical species. The radical flavin species has not been detected spectroscopically without using a substrate analogue, which suggests that it is short-lived. However, when using a fluorinated substrate, a neutral flavin semiquinone was detected. === Complex flavoenzymes === Glutamate synthase catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate into L-glutamate with L-glutamine serving as the nitrogen source for the reaction. All glutamate syntheses are iron-sulfur flavoproteins containing an iron-sulfur cluster and FMN. The three classes of glutamate syntheses are categorized based on their sequences and biochemical properties. Even though there are three classes of this enzyme, it is believed that they all operate through the same mechanism, only differing by what first reduces the FMN. The enzyme produces two glutamate molecules: one by the hydrolysis of glutamine (forming glutamate and ammonia), and the second by the ammonia produced from the first reaction attacking 2-oxoglutarate, which is reduced by FMN to glutamate. == Clinical significance == === Flavoprotein-related diseases === Due to the importance of flavoproteins, it is unsurprising that approximately 60% of human flavoproteins cause human disease when mutated. In some cases, this is due to a decreased affinity for FAD or FMN and so excess riboflavin intake may lessen disease symptoms, such as for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. In addition, riboflavin deficiency itself (and the resulting lack of FAD and FMN) can cause health issues. For example, in ALS patients, there are decreased levels of FAD synthesis. Both of these paths can result in a variety of symptoms, including developmental or gastrointestinal abnormalities, faulty fat break-down, anemia, neurological problems, cancer or heart disease, migraine, worsened vision and skin lesions. The pharmaceutical industry therefore produces riboflavin to supplement diet in certain cases. In 2008, the global need for riboflavin was 6,000 tons per year, with production capacity of 10,000 tons. This $150 to 500 million market is not only for medical applications, but is also used as a supplement to animal food in the agricultural industry and as a food colorant. === Drug design === New design of anti-bacterial medications is of continuing importance in scientific research as bacterial antibiotic resistance to common antibiotics increases. A specific metabolic protein that uses FAD (Complex II) is vital for bacterial virulence, and so targeting FAD synthesis or creating FAD analogs could be a useful area of investigation. Already, scientists have determined the two structures FAD usually assumes once bound: either an extended or a butterfly conformation, in which the molecule essentially folds in half, resulting in the stacking of the adenine and isoalloxazine rings. FAD imitators that are able to bind in a similar manner but do not permit protein function could be useful mechanisms of inhibiting bacterial infection. Alternatively, drugs blocking FAD synthesis could achieve the same goal; this is especially intriguing because human and bacterial FAD synthesis relies on very different enzymes, meaning that a drug made to target bacterial FAD synthase would be unlikely to interfere with the human FAD synthase enzymes. === Optogenetics === Optogenetics allows control of biological events in a non-invasive manner. The field has advanced in recent years with a number of new tools, including those to trigger light sensitivity, such as the Blue-Light-Utilizing FAD domains (BLUF). BLUFs encode a 100 to 140 amino acid sequence that was derived from photoreceptors in plants and bacteria. Similar to other photoreceptors, the light causes structural changes in the BLUF domain that results in disruption of downstream interactions. Current research investigates proteins with the appended BLUF domain and how different external factors can impact the proteins. === Treatment monitoring === There are a number of molecules in the body that have native fluorescence including tryptophan, collagen, FAD, NADH and porphyrins. Scientists have taken advantage of this by using them to monitor disease progression or treatment effectiveness or aid in diagnosis. For instance, native fluorescence of a FAD and NADH is varied in normal tissue and oral submucous fibrosis, which is an early sign of invasive oral cancer. Doctors therefore have been employing fluorescence to assist in diagnosis and monitor treatment as opposed to the standard biopsy. == Additional images == == See also == FMN FMO, flavin-containing monooxygenase NAD == References == == External links == FAD bound to proteins in the PDB FAD entry in the NIH Chemical Database",Flavin-adenine dinucleotide,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.013740074820816517), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -5.180879816180095e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.20144179463386536), (' FOOD', -0.016052432358264923)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.021998554468154907), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -7.033323527139146e-06), ('OUS', -2.7418097943154862e-06), (',', -0.5760308504104614), ('ĠFOOD', -0.2513241469860077), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25205060839653015)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03147?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=194, start_index=21, title='Flavin adenine dinucleotide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=194, start_index=21, title='Flavin adenine dinucleotide: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03147?utm_source=openai')])"
3422,"('Atosiban (acetate)', 'Atosiban', 'Tractocile', 'Antocin', 'Antocin ii')",Medical,"Atosiban, sold under the brand name Tractocile among others, is an inhibitor of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin. It is used as an intravenous medication as a labour repressant (tocolytic) to halt premature labor. It was developed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals in Sweden and first reported in the literature in 1985. Originally marketed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, it is licensed in proprietary and generic forms for the delay of imminent preterm birth in pregnant adult women. The most commonly reported side effect is nausea. == Medical uses == Atosiban is used to delay birth in adult women who are 24 to 33 weeks pregnant, when they show signs that they may give birth pre-term (prematurely). These signs include regular contractions lasting at least 30 seconds at a rate of at least four every 30 minutes, and dilation of the cervix (the neck of the womb) of 1 to 3 cm and an effacement (a measure of the thinness of the cervix) of 50% or more. In addition, the baby must have a normal heart rate. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Atosiban is a nonapeptide, desamino-oxytocin analogue, and a competitive vasopressin/oxytocin receptor antagonist (VOTra). Atosiban inhibits the oxytocin-mediated release of inositol trisphosphate from the myometrial cell membrane. As a result, reduced release of intracellular, stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of myometrial cells and reduced influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space through voltage-gated channels occur. In addition, atosiban suppresses oxytocin-mediated release of PGE and PGF from the decidua. In human preterm labour, atosiban, at the recommended dosage, antagonises uterine contractions and induces uterine quiescence. The onset of uterus relaxation following atosiban is rapid, uterine contractions being significantly reduced within 10 minutes to achieve stable uterine quiescence. == Other uses == === Atosiban use after assisted reproduction === Atosiban is useful in improving the pregnancy outcome of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in patients with repeated implantation failure. The pregnancy rate improved from zero to 43.7%. First- and second-trimester bleeding was more prevalent in ART than in spontaneous pregnancies. From 2004 to 2010, 33 first-trimester pregnancies with vaginal bleeding after ART with evident uterine contractions, when using atosiban and/or ritodrine, no preterm delivery occurred before 30 weeks. In a 2010 meta-analysis, nifedipine is superior to β2 adrenergic receptor agonists and magnesium sulfate for tocolysis in women with preterm labor (20–36 weeks), but it has been assigned to pregnancy category C by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so is not recommended before 20 weeks, or in the first trimester. A report from 2011 supports the use of atosiban, even at very early pregnancy, to decrease the frequency of uterine contractions to enhance success of pregnancy. == Pharmacovigilance == Following the launch of atosiban in 2000, the calculated cumulative patient exposure to atosiban (January 2000 to December 2005) is estimated as 156,468 treatment cycles. To date, routine monitoring of drug safety has revealed no major safety issues. == Regulatory affairs == Atosiban was approved in the European Union in January 2000 and launched in the European Union in April 2000. As of June 2007, atosiban was approved in 67 countries, excluding the United States and Japan. It was understood that Ferring did not expect to seek approval for atosiban in the US or Japan, focusing instead on development of new compounds for use in Spontaneous Preterm Labor (SPTL). The fact that atosiban only had a short duration before it was out of patent that the parent drug company decided not to pursue licensing in the US. == Systematic reviews == In a systematic review of atosiban for tocolysis in preterm labour, six clinical studies — two compared atosiban to placebo and four atosiban to a β agonist — showed a significant increase in the proportion of women undelivered by 48 hours in women receiving atosiban compared to placebo. When compared with β agonists, atosiban increased the proportion of women undelivered by 48 hours and was safer compared to β agonists. Therefore, oxytocin antagonists appear to be effective and safe for tocolysis in preterm labour. A 2014 systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration showed that while atosiban had fewer side effects than alternative drugs (such as ritodrine), other beta blockers, and calcium channel antagonists, it was no better than placebo in the major outcomes i.e. pregnancy prolongation or neonatal outcomes. The finding of an increase in infant deaths in one placebo-controlled trial warrants caution. Further research is recommended. === Clinical trials === ==== Atosiban vs. nifedipine ==== A 2013 retrospective study comparing the efficacy and safety of atosiban and nifedipine in the suppression of preterm labour concluded that atosiban and nifedipine are effective in delaying delivery for seven days or more in women presenting with preterm labour. A total of 68.3% of women in the atosiban group remained undelivered at seven days or more, compared with 64.7% in the nifedipine group. They have the same efficacy and associated minor side effects. However, flushing, palpitation, and hypotension were significantly higher in the nifedipine group. A 2012 clinical trial compared tocolytic efficacy and tolerability of atosiban with that of nifedipine. Forty-eight (68.6%) women allocated to atosiban and 39 (52%) to nifedipine did not deliver and did not require an alternate agent at 48 hours, respectively (p=.03). Atosiban has fewer failures within 48 hours. Nifedipine may be associated with a longer postponement of delivery. A 2009 randomised controlled study demonstrated for the first time the direct effects of atosiban on fetal movement, heart rate, and blood flow. Tocolysis with either atosiban or nifedipine combined with betamethasone administration had no direct fetal adverse effects. ==== Atosiban vs. ritodrine ==== Multicentre, controlled trial of atosiban vs. ritodrine in 128 women shows a significantly better tocolytic efficacy after 7 days in the atosiban group than in the ritodrine group (60.3 versus 34.9%), but not at 48 hours (68.3 versus 58.7%). Maternal adverse events were reported less frequently in the atosiban group (7.9 vs 70.8%), resulting in fewer early drug terminations due to adverse events (0 versus 20%). Therefore, atosiban is superior to ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labour. == References == == External links == ""Atosiban"". Drug Information Portal.

It was discovered in Singapore by S*BIO Pte Ltd and falls under the category of small molecule macrocycles. It crosses the blood brain barrier and acts by depleting Myc through the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9). It is one of a number of CDK inhibitors under investigation; others targeting CDK9 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia include alvocidib and atuveciclib. Myc overexpression is a known factor in many cancers, with 80 percent of glioblastomas characterized by this property. Zotiraciclib has been granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of gliomas. As of January 2020, zotiraciclib is being evaluated by Adastra Pharmaceuticals in two separate Phase 1b clinical trials for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Zotiracicib is also being developed as a potential treatment for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a rare pediatric cancer. Both forms of brain cancer are characterized by Myc overexpression. == Development == The first Phase 1b clinical trial of zotiraciclib in GBM, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is a multi-arm, dose-finding study examining zotiraciclib plus dose-dense or metronomic temozolomide (TMZ) in adults with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM.

It may also be used to treat other conditions. It is similar in structure to another ramipril but has a cyclohexane group. It is a prodrug that must be metabolized into its active form. It has a longer half-life when compared to other agents in this class. It was patented in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1993. It is marketed by Abbott Laboratories under the brand name Mavik. == Side effects == Side effects reported for trandolapril include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dry cough, dizziness or lightheadedness when sitting up or standing, hypotension, or fatigue. == Possible drug interactions == Patients also on diuretics may experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with trandolapril. It can reduce potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. Therefore, hyperkalemia is a possible risk. Increased serum lithium levels can occur in patients who are also on lithium. == Contraindications and precautions == == Pregnancy and lactation == Trandolapril is teratogenic (US: pregnancy category D) and can cause birth defects and even death of the developing fetus. The highest risk to the fetus is during the second and third trimesters. When pregnancy is detected, trandolapril should be discontinued as soon as possible. Trandolapril should not be administered to nursing mothers. == Additional effects == Combination therapy with paricalcitol and trandolapril has been found to reduce fibrosis in obstructive uropathy. == Pharmacology == Trandolapril is a prodrug that is deesterified to trandolaprilat. It is believed to exert its antihypertensive effect through the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Trandolapril has a half-life of about six hours, while trandolaprilat has a half life of about ten hours. Trandolaprilat has about eight times the activity of its parent drug. About one-third of trandolapril and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, and about two-thirds of trandolapril and its metabolites are excreted in the feces.

3429,"('Albendazole sulfoxide', 'Ricobendazole', 'Albendazole oxide', 'Albendazole s-oxide', 'Rycobendazole')",Medical,"Albendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelmintic and antiprotozoal agent of the benzimidazole type. It is used for the treatment of a variety of intestinal parasite infections, including ascariasis, pinworm infection, hookworm infection, trichuriasis, strongyloidiasis, taeniasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, cutaneous larva migrans, giardiasis, and gnathostomiasis, among other diseases. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Rare but potentially serious side effects include bone marrow suppression which usually improves on discontinuing the medication. Liver inflammation has been reported and those with prior liver problems are at greater risk. It is pregnancy category D in Australia, meaning it may cause harm if taken by pregnant women. Albendazole was developed in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Albendazole is available in a fixed-dose combination with ivermectin. == Medical uses == Albendazole is an effective treatment for: Flatworms Clonorchiasis Fasciolosis Opisthorchiasis Cestodes (tapeworms), as an alternative to praziquantel or niclosamide for adult beef tapeworms and as an alternative to praziquantel for pork tapeworms. It is also given for infections by T. crassiceps. Though praziquantel is often better at treating tapeworm infections, albendazole is used more often in endemic countries due to being cheaper and having a broader spectrum. Cysticercosis (especially neurocysticercosis), which is caused by the larval form of the pork tapeworm (i.e. albendazole is the drug of choice for larval pork tapeworms, but not adult pork tapeworms). Old cysts are not affected. Echinococcosis of the liver, lung, and peritoneum (caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, or of the alveoli (caused by E. multilocularis) when surgical excision is not possible. Alveolar and cystic echinococcosis may require lifelong treatment with albendazole, which only prevents the parasites from growing and reproducing rather than killing them. Nematodes Anatrichosomiasis Angiostrongyliasis Anisakiasis Ascariasis, which can be cured with a single dose of albendazole. Baylisascariasis, caused by the raccoon roundworm. Albendazole can achieve good results (95–100% efficacy after a 10-day course of treatment) if treatment is initiated within 72 hours of ingestion of the egg-containing raccoon feces. Corticosteroids are sometimes added in cases of eye and CNS infections. Pinworm infection Filariasis; since albendazole's disintegration of the microfilariae (""pre-larva"") can cause an allergic reaction, antihistamines or corticosteroids are sometimes added to treatment. In cases of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi, albendazole is sometimes given as an adjunct to ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine in order to suppress microfilaremia. It can also be given for Loa loa filariasis as an adjunct or replacement to diethylcarbamazine. Albendazole has an embryotoxic effect on Loa loa adults and thus slowly reduces microfilaremia. Gnathostomiasis when caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum. Albendazole has a similar effectiveness to ivermectin in these cases, though it needs to be given for 21 days rather than the 2 days needed for ivermectin. Gongylonemiasis Hepatic capillariasis caused by Capillaria hepatica Hookworm infections, including cutaneous larva migrans caused by hookworms of genus Ancylostoma. A single dose of albendazole is sufficient to treat intestinal infestations by A. duodenale or Necator americanus. Intestinal capillariasis, as an alternative to mebendazole Mansonelliasis when caused by Mansonella perstans. Albendazole is effective against adult worms but not against the immature microfilariae. Oesophagostomumiasis, when caused by Oesophagostomum bifurcum Strongyloidiasis, as an alternative to ivermectin or thiabendazole. Albendazole can be given with diethylcarbamazine to lower microfilaremia levels. Toxocariasis, also called ""visceral larva migrans"", when caused by the dog roundworm Toxocara canis or cat roundworm T. catis. Corticosteroids can be added in severe cases, and surgery might be required to repair secondary damage. Trichinosis, when caused by Trichinella spiralis or T. pseudospiralis. Albendazole has a similar efficacy to thiabendazole, but fewer side effects. It works best when given early, acting on the adult worms in the intestine before they generate larva that can penetrate the muscle and cause a more widespread infection. Corticosteroids are sometimes added on to prevent inflammation caused by dying larva. Trichostrongyliasis, as an alternative to pyrantel pamoate. A single dose is sufficient for treatment. Trichuriasis (whipworm infection), sometimes considered as an alternative to mebendazole and sometimes considered to be the drug of choice. Only a single dose of albendazole is needed. It can also be given with ivermectin. Giardiasis, as an alternative or adjunct to metronidazole, especially in children Microsporidiosis, including ocular microsporidiosis caused by Encephalitozoon hellem or E. cuniculi, when combined with topical fumagillin Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, when caused by the amoeba Balamuthia mandrillaris, in combination with miltefosine and fluconazole Arthropods Crusted scabies, when combined with topical crotamiton and salicylic acid Head lice infestation, though ivermectin is much better Intestinal myiasis Though albendazole is effective in treating many diseases, it is only FDA-approved for treating hydatid disease caused by dog tapeworm larvae and neurocysticercosis caused by pork tapeworm larvae. === Ivermectin/albendazole === When co-administered, ivermectin and albendazole act in synergy. Ivermectin targets the parasite's nervous and muscular systems, causing paralysis, while albendazole disrupts the parasite's metabolism and energy production. This dual approach immobilizes and kills the parasite and improves the treatment's effectiveness. In January 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive scientific opinion for ivermectin/albendazole for the treatment of infections caused by several types of worm parasites including lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for use in people aged five years of age or older, for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminth infections, caused by different types of intestinal parasitic worms, which are spread through soil contaminated by human feces in areas with poor sanitation. Among the worms responsible for these diseases are hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus), roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms (Trichuris trichiura) and a roundworm called Strongyloides stercoralis. Ivermectin/albendazole is also indicated for the treatment of microfilaraemia (the presence of worm larvae in the blood) in people with lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease commonly known as elephantiasis, which impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to the abnormal enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and social stigma. Ivermectin/albendazole is indicated for the treatment of cases of lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, a parasite which is responsible for 90% of cases worldwide. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity to the benzimidazole class of compounds contraindicates its use. == Side effects == The most common side effects of albendazole are experienced by over 10% of people and include headache and abnormal liver function. Elevation of liver enzymes occurs in 16% of patients receiving treatment specifically for hydatid disease and goes away when treatment ends. Liver enzymes usually increase to two to four times the normal levels (a mild to moderate increase). An estimated 1–10% of people experience abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or vertigo, increased intracranial pressure, meningeal signs, temporary hair loss, and fever. The headache, nausea, and vomiting are thought to be caused by the sudden destruction of cysticerci (tapeworm larvae), which causes acute inflammation. Fewer than 1% of people get hypersensitivity reactions such as rashes and hives, leukopenias (drop in white blood cell levels) such as agranulocytosis and granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count), pancytopenia (drop in white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets), hepatitis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, irreversible bone marrow suppression, and aplastic anemia. Side effects can be different when treating for hydatid disease versus neurocysticercosis: for example, those being treated for the former are more likely to experience elevated liver enzymes and abdominal pain, while those being treated for the latter are more likely to experience headache. Treating hydatid disease can also unmask undiagnosed neurocysticercosis. People receiving albendazole for the treatment of neurocysticercosis can have neurological side effects such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, and focal signs caused by the inflammatory reaction that occurs when parasites in the brain are killed. Steroids and anticonvulsants are often given with albendazole when treating neurocysticercosis to avoid these effects. Those being treated for retinal neurocysticercosis can face retinal damage if they are not first checked for ocular cysticeri, since changes to existing lesions in the eye by albendazole can cause permanent blindness. === Pregnancy === Albendazole is a pregnancy class D drug in Australia. It is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy, and should be avoided up to one month before conception. While studies in pregnant rats and rabbits have shown albendazole to be teratogenic, albendazole has been found to be safe in humans during the second and third trimesters. It can, however, possibly cause infantile eczema when given during pregnancy. In pregnant dogs, albendazole use has led to puppies with reduced weight and with cleft palates. Birds have lower rates of laying eggs and hatching when given albendazole. Albendazole sulfoxide is secreted into breast milk at around 1.5% of the maternal dose, though oral absorption is poor enough that it is unlikely to affect nursing infants. == Overdose == Because of its low solubility, albendazole often cannot be absorbed in high enough quantities to be toxic. The oral LD50 of albendazole in rats was found to be 2,500 mg/kg. It takes 20 times the normal dose to kill a sheep, and 30 times the normal dose to kill cattle. Overdose affects the liver, testicles, and gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) the most. It can manifest with lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal cramps, dizziness, convulsions, and sleepiness. There is no specified antidote. == Interactions == The antiepileptics carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital lower the plasma concentration and half-life of albendazole sulfoxide's R(+) enantiomer. The antacid cimetidine heightens serum albendazole concentrations, increases the half-life of albendazole, and doubles albendazole sulfoxide levels in bile. It was originally thought to work by increasing albendazole bioavailability directly; however, it is now known that cimetidine inhibits the breakdown of albendazole sulfoxide by interfering with CYP3A4. The half-life of albendazole sulfoxide thus increases from 7.4 hours to 19 hours. This might be a helpful interaction on more severe cases, because it boosts the potency of albendazole. Paradoxically, cimetidine also inhibits the absorption of albendazole by reducing gastric acidity. Several other interactions exist. Corticosteroids increase the steady-state plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide; dexamethasone, for example, can increase the concentration by 56% by inhibiting the elimination of albendazole sulfoxide. The anti-parasitic praziquantel increases the maximum plasma concentration of albendazole sulfoxide by 50%, and the anti-parasitic levamisole increases the AUC (total drug exposure) by 75%. Grapefruit inhibits the metabolism of albendazole within the intestinal mucosa. Finally, long-term administration of the antiretroviral ritonavir, which works as a CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreases the maximum concentration of albendazole in the plasma as well as the AUC. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === As a vermicide, albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of β-tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules (it binds much better to the β-tubulin of parasites than that of mammals). Albendazole leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Albendazole also prevents the formation of spindle fibers needed for cell division, which in turn blocks egg production and development; existing eggs are prevented from hatching. Cell motility, maintenance of cell shape, and intracellular transport are also disrupted. At higher concentrations, it disrupts the helminths' metabolic pathways by inhibiting metabolic enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase, with inhibition of the latter leading to less energy produced by the Krebs cycle. Due to diminished ATP production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies. Some parasites have evolved some resistance to albendazole by having a different set of amino acids constitute β-tubulin, decreasing the binding affinity of albendazole. Some parasites (especially filarial nematodes) live in symbiosis with Wolbachia, a type of intracellular parasite bacteria. In such cases the Wolbachia are necessary to the survival of the parasitic worms. Elimination of Wolbachia from these filarial nematodes generally results in either death or sterility of the host nematode. === Pharmacokinetics === To target intestinal parasites, which is the most common indication for prescription, albendazole is taken on an empty stomach to stay within the gut. Oral absorption of albendazole varies among species, with 1–5% of the drug being successfully absorbed in humans, 20–30% in rats, and 50% in cattle. The absorption also largely depends on gastric pH. People have varying levels of gastric pHs on empty stomachs, and thus absorption from one person to another can vary wildly when taken without food. Generally, the absorption in the GI tract is poor due to albendazole's low solubility in water. It is, however, better absorbed than other benzimidazole carbamates. Food stimulates gastric acid secretion, lowering the pH and making albendazole more soluble and thus more easily absorbed. Oral absorption is especially increased with a fatty meal, as albendazole dissolves better in lipids, allowing it to cross the lipid barrier created by the mucus surface of the GI tract. Absorption is also affected by how much of the albendazole is degraded within the small intestine by metabolic enzymes in the villi. The pharmacokinetics of albendazole differ slightly between men and women: women have a lower oral clearance and volume of distribution, while men have a lower serum peak concentration. Albendazole undergoes very fast first-pass metabolism in all species, such that the unchanged drug is undetectable in plasma. Most of it is oxidized into albendazole sulfoxide (also known as ricobendazole and albendazole oxide) in the liver by cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs) and a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was discovered later. In humans, the cytochrome P450 oxidases are thought to include CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, while those in the rats are thought to be CYP2C6 and CYP2A1. Oxidation to albendazole sulfoxide by FMO produces R(+) enantiomers, while oxidation the cytochromes and by some enzymes in the gut epithelium produce S(−). Different species produce the R(+) and S(−) enantiomers in different quantities; humans, dogs, and most other species produce the R(+) enantiomer more (with the human AUC ratio being 80:20). Compared to the S(−) enantiomer, the R(+) has greater pharmacological activity, lasts longer in the bloodstream, is found in higher concentrations in the infected host tissues, and is found in higher concentrations within the parasites themselves. Some albendazole is also converted to hydroxyalbendazole, mainly by CYP2J2. For systemic parasites, albendazole acts as a prodrug, while albendazole sulfoxide reaches systemic circulation and acts as the real antihelminthic. Albendazole sulfoxide is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the cerebrospinal fluid at 43% of plasma concentrations; its ability to enter the central nervous system allows it to treat neurocysticercosis. Albendazole sulfoxide is converted to the inactive albendazole sulfone by cytochrome P450 oxidases, thought to include CYP3A4 or CYP2C. Other inactive metabolites include: 2-aminosulfone, ω-hydroxysulfone, and β-hydroxysulfone. The major final metabolites that are excreted by humans are: methyl [5-(propylsulfonyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)] carbamate, methyl [6-hydroxy 5-(n-propylsulfonyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)] carbamate, methyl [5-(n-propylsulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)] carbamate, 5-(n-propylsulfonyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl amine, and 5-(n-propysulfinyl)-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl amine. There are also some minor hydroxylated sulfated or glucuronidated derivatives. No unchanged albendazole is excreted, as it is metabolized too quickly. In humans, the metabolites are excreted mostly in bile, with only a small amount being excreted in urine (less than 1%) and feces. In ruminants, 60–70% of the metabolites are excreted in urine. Like all benzimidazoles, albendazole has no residual effect, and thus protects poorly against reinfestations. == History == Albendazole, patented in 1975, was invented by Robert J. Gyurik and Vassilios J. Theodorides and assigned to SmithKline Corporation. It was introduced in 1977 as an antihelminthic for sheep in Australia, and was registered for human use in 1982. == Society and culture == === Economics === The pharmaceutical company Amedra increased the price after purchasing the rights to the drug, instead of lowering it as generics are predicted to do, drawing criticism from patients' rights advocates. In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline donated 763 million albendazole tablets for the treatment and prevention of parasitic infections in developing countries, bringing the total to over 4 billion tablets donated since 1998. === Brand names === Brand names include: Albenza, Alworm, Andazol, Eskazole, Noworm, Zentel, Alben-G, ABZ, Cidazole, Wormnil etc. == Research == Albendazole and related compounds or metabolites like albendazole sulfone (ALB-SO2) exhibit antibacterial effects via an unknown, possibly FtsZ-related, mechanism. It inhibits division of Wolbachia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, turning them into a long ""filament"" shape as they grow and fail to divide. Since Brugia malayi relies on symbiotic Wolbachia, this would mean that albendazole is targeting both the worm and its essential symbioant. == Veterinary use == Albendazole is mainly used in cattle and sheep, but has found some use in cats and dogs as well; it is also used in ratite birds for flagellate parasites and tapeworms. It is also used off-label to treat endoparasites in goats and pigs. Albendazole has been used as an antihelminthic and for control of flukes in a variety of animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, swine, camels, dogs, cats, elephants, poultry, and others. Side effects include anorexia in dogs and lethargy, depression, and anorexia in cats, with more than 10% of dogs and cats having anorexia. Of dogs and cats, 1–10% experience elevated liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Less than 1% experience neutropenia or aplastic anemia, though these require a use of at least 5 days. While it is also associated with bone marrow suppression and toxicity in cats and dogs at high doses, albendazole has a higher margin of safety in other species. Thus, it is usually only prescribed in cats and dogs when an infection is present that is resistant to the commonly prescribed metronidazole and fenbendazole. It is extensively used for ruminant livestock in Latin America. It is marketed for this purpose by Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health) in numerous countries (including the United States and Canada) as Valbazen in oral suspension and paste formulations; by Interchemie in the Netherlands and elsewhere as Albenol-100; by Channelle Animal Health Ltd. in the United Kingdom as Albex; and by Ravensdown in New Zealand (as Albendazole). Although most formulations are administered orally, Ricomax (ricobendazole, or albendazole sulfoxide) is administered by subcutaneous injection. Albendazole has greater bioavailability in ruminants: some albendazole sulfoxide, when released back into the rumen, is reduced to albendazole by the resident microbiota, with a preference of the (+) enantiomer being the substrate. Cats and dogs, having no rumen reservoir, sometimes need higher or more frequent doses as compared to ruminants. In dogs, albendazole sulfoxide is detectable in the plasma for less than 12 hours, but in sheep and goats, it remains at measurable levels for around three days. === Meat === The limitations in early pregnancy are due to a limited period during which teratogenic effects may occur. Summarized research data relating to the durations of these preslaughter and early pregnancy periods when albendazole should not be administered are found in US FDA NADA 110-048 (cattle) and 140-934 (sheep). Some data and inferences regarding goats are found in US FDA Supplemental NADA 110-048 (approved 24 January 2008). Maximum residue limits (MRLs) for albendazole in food, adopted by the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius in 1993, are 5000, 5000, 100, and 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (μg/kg) for kidney, liver, fat, and muscle, respectively, and 100 μg/L for milk. For analysis purposes, MRLs of various nations may pertain to concentration of a marker substance which has been correlated with concentrations of the administered substance and its metabolized products. For example, in Canada, the marker substance specified by Health Canada is albendazole-2-aminosulfone, for which the MRL in liver of cattle is 200 μg/kg. There is a 27-day cattle withdrawal time for meat. == References ==",Albendazole oxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014096579980105162), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005871717585250735), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014209638349711895)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06196768581867218), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D07106?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=72, start_index=9, title='KEGG DRUG: Albendazole oxide', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D07106?utm_source=openai')])"

Its molecular structure is uncommon for pharmacological compounds in that it has both an ozonide (trioxolane) group and an adamantane substituent. Initial results were disappointing, and in 2007 MMV withdrew support, after having invested $20M in the research; Ranbaxy said at the time that it intended to continue developing arterolane in combination with another drug. In 2009, Ranbaxy started a Phase II clinical trial of arterolane in combination with piperaquine, and it was published in 2015. In 2012, Ranbaxy obtained approval to market an arterolane/piperaquine combination drug in India, under the brand name Synriam.

Resistance arteries from myometrial and omental biopsies obtained at cesarean section of normal pregnant and preeclamptic women were dissected and mounted in organ baths for recording of isometric tension. The contractile response to endothelin-1 in presence and absence of BQ-123 was recorded. Endothelin-1 induced similar concentration-dependent contractions in all arteries investigated. In women with preeclampsia the contractile response induced by endothelin-1 was significantly higher in omental as compared to myometrial vessels. Pretreatment with BQ-123 significantly shifted the concentration-response curve to the right but only reduced the maximum contractile response in omental vessels. Endothelin-1 is a potent constrictor of resistance arteries from different vascular beds in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia. The contractile effect is at least in part mediated by ETA receptors, since it was significantly reduced after pretreatment with BQ-123. In preeclamptic but not in normal pregnant women the response to endothelin-1 was reduced in myometrial as compared to omental arteries, possibly secondary to receptor down regulation. Preterm birth (PTB), defined as any delivery occurring prior to the completion of 37 weeks' gestation, currently accounts for 11-12% of all births in the United States. Maternal genito-urinary infections account for up to 40% of all PTBS and induce a pro-inflammatory state in the host. The potent vasoconstrictor Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is known to be upregulated in the setting of infection, and elicits its effect by binding to the ETA receptor. We have previously shown that antagonism of the ETA receptor with BQ-123 is capable of preventing LPS-induced PTB in mice. We hypothesize that the administration of BQ-123 post LPS exposure will dismantle a positive feedback loop observed with pro-inflammatory cytokines upstream of ET-1. On GD 15.5, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were injected with PBS, LPS, BQ-123, or LPS+BQ-123. Changes at both the level of transcription and translation were observed in uterus and placenta in the ET-1 axis and in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines over the course of 12h. We discovered that BQ-123, when administered 10h post LPS, is capable of increasing production of uterine and placental Interleukin-10, causing a shift away from the pro-inflammatory state. We also observed that antagonism of the ETA receptor decreased IL-1β and TNFα in the placenta while also decreasing transcription of ET-1 in the uterus. Our results reinforce the role of ET-1 at the maternal fetal interface and highlight the potential benefit of ETA receptor blockade via the suppression of ET-1, and induction of a Th2 cytokine dominant state. To research the impact and mechanism of endothelin receptor A inhibitor BQ-123 combined with electroacupuncture on tibia cancer pain in rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham group (SHAM group) and bone cancer pain model group (BCP group). The behavior of SD rats was measured. The histology of the right tibia was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The remaining rats were randomly divided into model, BQ-123, electroacupuncture, and BQ-123+ electroacupuncture group.

3432,"('Phenylbutazone', 'Butazolidine', 'Fenilbutazona', 'Butadion', 'Butapirazol')",Medical,"Phenylbutazone, often referred to as ""bute"", is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the short-term treatment of pain and fever in animals. In the United States and United Kingdom, it is no longer approved for human use (except in the United Kingdom for ankylosing spondylitis), as it can cause severe adverse effects such as suppression of white blood cell production and aplastic anemia. This drug was implicated in the 2013 meat adulteration scandal. Positive phenylbutazone tests in horse meat were uncommon in the UK, however. == Uses == === In humans === Phenylbutazone was originally made available for use in humans for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and gout in 1949. However, it is no longer approved, and therefore not marketed, for any human use in the United States. In the UK it is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis, but only when other therapies are unsuitable. === In horses === Phenylbutazone is the most commonly used NSAID for horses in the United States. It is used for the following purposes: Analgesia: It is used for pain relief from infections and musculoskeletal disorders, including sprains, overuse injuries, tendinitis, arthralgias, arthritis, and laminitis. Like other NSAIDs, it acts directly on musculoskeletal tissue to control inflammation, thereby reducing secondary inflammatory damage, alleviating pain, and restoring range of motion. It does not cure musculoskeletal ailments or work well on colic pain. Antipyresis: It is used for reduction of fevers. Its antipyretic qualities may mask other symptoms. ==== History of phenylbutazone in racing ==== In the 1968 Kentucky Derby, Dancer's Image, the winner of the race, was disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone were allegedly discovered in a post-race urinalysis. Owned by prominent Massachusetts businessman Peter D. Fuller and ridden by jockey Bobby Ussery, Dancer's Image was the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby and then be disqualified. Phenylbutazone was legal on most tracks around the United States in 1968, but had not yet been approved by Churchill Downs. Controversy and speculation still surround the incident. In the weeks prior to the race, Fuller had given previous winnings to Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., which brought both praise and criticism. The previous year, King held a sit-in against housing discrimination which disrupted Derby week. Forty years later, Fuller still believed Dancer's Image was disqualified due to these events. Although Forward Pass had been named the winner, after many appeals the Kentucky Derby official website lists both Dancer's Image and Forward Pass as the winner. The website's race video commentary states that on the winner's plaque at Churchill Downs, both Dancer's Image and Forward Pass are listed as the 1968 winner of the Kentucky Derby. === In dogs === Phenylbutazone is occasionally used in dogs for the longer-term management of chronic pain, particularly due to osteoarthritis. About 20% of adult dogs are affected with osteoarthritis, which makes the management of musculoskeletal pain a major component of companion animal practice. The margin of safety for all NSAIDs is narrow in the dog, and other NSAIDs are more commonly used (etodolac, and carprofen). Gastrointestinal-protectant drugs, such as misoprostol, cimetidine, omeprazole, ranitidine, or sucralfate, are frequently included as a part of treatment with any NSAID. Dogs receiving chronic phenylbutazone therapy should be followed with regular blood work and renal monitoring. Side effects of phenylbutazone in dogs include gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bone marrow depression, rashes, malaise, blood dyscrasias, and diminished renal blood flow. == Dosage and administration in horses == Phenylbutazone has a plasma elimination half-life of 4–8 hours, however the inflammatory exudate half life is 24 hours, so single daily dosing can be sufficient, although it is often used twice per day. The drug is considered fairly non-toxic when given at appropriate doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg/day), even when used repeatedly. This dose has been doubled for diseases that cause severe pain, such as laminitis, but is toxic if repeated long-term, and exceptionally high doses (15 mg/kg/d or higher) can kill the animal in less than a week. Phenylbutazone can be administered orally (via paste, powder or feed-in) or intravenously. It should not be given intramuscularly or injected in any place other than a vein, as it can cause tissue damage. Tissue damage and edema may also occur if the drug is injected repetitively into the same vein. == Side effects and disadvantages == Side effects of phenylbutazone are similar to those of other NSAIDs. Overdose or prolonged use can cause gastrointestinal ulcers, blood dyscrasia, kidney damage (primarily dose-dependant renal papillary necrosis), oral lesions if given by mouth, and internal hemorrhage. This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug. Effects of gastrointestinal damage include edema of the legs and belly secondary to leakage of blood proteins into the intestines, resulting in decreased appetite, excessive thirst, weight loss, weakness, and in advanced stages, kidney failure and death. Phenylbutazone can also cause agranulocytosis. Phenylbutazone amplifies the anticoagulant effect of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin or phenprocoumon. Phenylbutazone displaces warfarin from plasma binding sites, and toxic blood levels leading to haemorrhage can occur. It may aggravate kidney or liver problems. Phenylbutazone may be toxic to the embryo and can be transferred via the umbilical cord and by milk. Phenylbutazone can be used in foals. Premature foals, septicemic foals, foals with questionable kidney or liver function and foals with diarrhea require careful monitoring. Drugs to protect the GI tract such as omeprazole, cimetidine, and sucralfate are frequently used with phenylbutazone. High doses of phenylbutazone may be considered a rules violation under some equestrian organizations, as the drug may remain in the bloodstream four to five days after administration. The International Agency for Research on Cancer places it in Group 3; i.e., ""not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"". Use in horses is limited to those not intended for food. Metabolites of phenylbutazone can cause aplastic anaemia in humans. == Investigations into potential carcinogenicity == Opinions are conflicting regarding the carcinogenicity of phenylbutazone in animals; no evidence indicates it causes cancer in humans at therapeutic doses. Maekawa et al. (1987) found no increased cancer incidence in DONRYU rats fed a diet containing 0.125% or 0.25% phenylbutazone over two years. On the other hand, Kari et al. (1995) found a rare type of kidney cancer in rats (13 of 100) and an increased rate of liver cancer in male rats fed 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight of phenylbutazone for two years. Tennant (1993) listed phenylbutazone as a non-mutagenic carcinogen. Kirkland and Fowler (2010) acknowledged that, while phenylbutazone is not predicted to be a mutagen by computer software that simulates the chemicals interaction with DNA, one laboratory study indicated phenylbutazone subtly altered the structure of chromosomes of bone marrow cells of mice. Kirkland and Fowler (2010) furthermore explained that the theoretical carcinogenic effects of phenylbutazone in humans cannot be studied because patients prescribed the drug were given doses far below the level any effect may become apparent (<1 mM). The World Health Organization's International Agency For Research On Cancer (IARC) stated in 1987 that there was inadequate evidence for a carcinogenic effect in humans. == Interactions == Other anti-inflammatory drugs that tend to cause GI ulcers, such as corticosteroids and other NSAIDs, can potentiate the bleeding risk. Combination with anticoagulant drugs, particularly coumarin derivatives, also increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid combining with other hepatotoxic drugs. Phenylbutazone may affect blood levels and duration of action of phenytoin, valproic acid, sulfonamides, sulfonylurea antidiabetic agents, barbiturates, promethazine, rifampicin, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, and penicillin G. == Overdose == Overdoses of phenylbutazone can cause kidney failure, liver injury, bone marrow suppression, and gastric ulceration or perforation. Early signs of toxicity include loss of appetite, and depression. == Chemistry == Phenylbutazone is a crystalline substance. It is obtained by condensation of diethyl n-butylmalonate with hydrazobenzene in the presence of base. In effect, this represents the formation of the heterocyclic system by simple lactamization. Oxyphenbutazone, the major metabolite of phenylbutazone, differs only in the para location of one of its phenyl groups, where a hydrogen atom is replaced by a hydroxyl group (making it 4-butyl-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-3,5-pyrazolidinedione). == References ==",Butapirazol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.7548043727874756), ('U', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.058687347918748856), ('ICAL', -5.006777428206988e-06), (',', -0.16028930246829987), ('ĠINDU', -0.10754086077213287), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04867726191878319)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5759395360946655), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3433,"('Talc', 'Silica', 'Quartz', 'Dioxosilane', 'Diatomaceous earth')","Food, Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Diatomaceous earth ( DY-ə-tə-MAY-shəs), also known as diatomite ( dy-AT-ə-myte), celite, or kieselguhr, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that can be crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from more than 3 mm to less than 1 μm, but typically 10 to 200 μm. Depending on the granularity, this powder can have an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and has a low density as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80–90% silica, with 2–4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals), and 0.5–2% iron oxide. Diatomaceous earth consists of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled microalgae, that have accumulated over millions of years. It is used as a filtration aid, mild abrasive in products including metal polishes and toothpaste, mechanical insecticide, absorbent for liquids, matting agent for coatings, reinforcing filler in plastics and rubber, anti-block in plastic films, porous support for chemical catalysts, cat litter, activator in coagulation studies, a stabilizing component of dynamite, a thermal insulator, and a soil for potted plants and trees as in the art of bonsai. It is also used in gas chromatography packed columns made with glass or metal as stationary phase. == Composition == Diatomaceous earth consists of the fossilized remains of diatoms that accumulated over millions of years. It is usually composed of 80% to 90% silica, 2% to 4% alumina minerals, and 0.5% to 2% iron oxide, although the precise composition of every deposit is different. Deposits may contain different amounts of silica depending on the sedimentation conditions, the presence of other sediments (clay, sand, volcanic ashes), and the age of the deposit (diagenesis, silica (SiO2) dissolution/precipitation, diatoms tests ageing). The species of diatom may also differ among deposits. The species of diatom is dependent upon the age and paleoecology of the deposit. In turn, the shape of a diatom is determined by its species. Many deposits throughout British Columbia, such as Red Lake Earth, are from the Miocene epoch and contain a species of diatom known as Melosira granulata. These diatoms have a small globular shape. A deposit containing diatoms from this epoch can provide certain benefits over others. For example, diatoms from the Eocene epoch are not as effective in their ability to absorb fluids because as older diatoms recrystallize, their small pores become filled with silica. == Formation == Diatomite forms by the accumulation of the amorphous silica (opal, SiO2·nH2O) remains of dead diatoms (microscopic single-celled algae) in lake sediment or marine sediments. The fossil remains consist of a pair of symmetrical shells or frustules. Marine diatomites are found in association with a wide variety of other rock types but lacustrine diatomites are almost always associated with volcanic rock. Diatomaceous chert consists of diatomite that has been cemented with silica. Diatoms are able to extract silica from water that is less than 1% saturated in amorphous silica (saturation index (SI): -2). Their frustules remain undissolved because they are surrounded by an organic matrix. Clay minerals may also precipitate on the frustules and protect them from dissolution in sea water. When the diatom dies, the frustule is stripped of its organic layer and exposed to sea water. As a result, only 1% to 10% of frustules survive long enough to be buried under sediments and some of this is dissolved within the sediments. Only an estimated 0.05% to 0.15% of the original amount of silica produced by diatoms is preserved in the sedimentary record. == Discovery == In 1836 or 1837, German peasant Peter Kasten discovered diatomaceous earth (German: Kieselgur) when sinking a well on the northern slopes of the Haußelberg hill, on Lüneburg Heath in North Germany. The extraction site on Lüneburg Heath was 1863–1994 Neuohe, while the storage sites were: The deposits are up to 28 meters (92 ft) thick and are all of freshwater diatomaceous earth. Until World War I, almost the entire worldwide production of diatomaceous earth was from this region. == Other deposits == In Poland diatomaceous earth deposits are found in Jawornik, and are composed mostly of diatomaceous skeletons (frustules). In Germany, diatomaceous earth was also extracted at Altenschlirf on the Vogelsberg (Upper Hesse) and at Klieken (Saxony-Anhalt). There is a layer of diatomaceous earth more than 6 meters (20 ft) thick in the nature reserve of Soos in the Czech Republic. Deposits on the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland, were mined until 1960. In Colorado and in Clark County, Nevada, United States, there are deposits that are up to several hundred meters thick in places. Marine deposits have been worked in the Sisquoc Formation in Santa Barbara County, California near Lompoc and along the Southern California coast. This is the world's largest deposit of diatomite. Additional marine deposits have been worked in Maryland, Virginia, Algeria and the MoClay of Denmark. Freshwater lake deposits occur in Nevada, Oregon, Washington and California. Lake deposits also occur in interglacial lakes in the eastern United States, in Canada and in Europe in Germany, France, Denmark and the Czech Republic. The worldwide association of diatomite deposits and volcanic deposits suggests that the availability of silica from volcanic ash may be necessary for thick diatomite deposits. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes found on desert surfaces. Research has shown that the erosion of diatomaceous earth in such areas (such as the Bodélé Depression in the Sahara) is one of the most important sources of climate-affecting dust in the atmosphere. The siliceous frustules of diatoms accumulate in fresh and brackish wetlands and lakes. Some peats and mucks contain a sufficient abundance of frustules such that they can be mined. Most of Florida's diatomaceous earths have been found in the muck of wetlands or lakes. The American Diatomite Corporation, from 1935 to 1946, refined a maximum of 145 tons per year from their processing plant near Clermont, Florida. Muck from several locations in Lake County, Florida was dried and burned (calcined) to produce the diatomaceous earth. It was formerly extracted from Lake Mývatn in Iceland. The commercial deposits of diatomite are restricted to Tertiary or Quaternary periods. Older deposits from as early as the Cretaceous Period are known, but are of low quality. Diatomite deposits rich in fossils have been located in New Zealand, but mining of the Foulden Maar deposits on an industrial scale, for conversion to animal feed, has drawn strong opposition. == Commercial form == Diatomaceous earth is available commercially in several formats: granulated diatomaceous earth is a raw material simply crushed for convenient packaging milled or micronized diatomaceous earth is especially fine (10 μm to 50 μm) and used for insecticides calcined diatomaceous earth is heat-treated and activated for filters == Usage == === Explosives === In 1866, Alfred Nobel discovered that nitroglycerin could be made more stable if absorbed in diatomite (kieselguhr in German). This allowed safer transport and handling than pure nitroglycerin in liquid form. Nobel patented this mixture as dynamite in 1867; the mixture is also called guhr dynamite in reference to the kieselguhr. === Filtration === The Celle engineer, Wilhelm Berkefeld, recognized the ability of the diatomaceous earth to filter and developed tubular filters (known as filter candles) fired from diatomaceous earth. During the cholera epidemic in Hamburg in 1892, these Berkefeld filters were used successfully. One form of diatomaceous earth is used as a filter medium, especially for swimming pools. It has a high porosity because it is composed of microscopically small, hollow particles. Diatomaceous earth (sometimes referred to by trademarked brand names such as Celite) is used in chemistry as a filtration aid, to increase flow rate, and filter very fine particles that would otherwise pass through or clog filter paper. It is also used to filter water, particularly in the drinking water treatment process and in fish tanks, and other liquids, such as beer and wine. It can also filter syrups, sugar, and honey without removing or altering their color, taste, or nutritional properties. === Abrasive === The oldest use of diatomite is as a very mild abrasive and has been used in toothpaste, metal polishes, and some facial scrubs. === Pest control === Diatomite is of value as an insecticide because of its abrasive and physico-sorptive properties. The fine powder adsorbs lipids from the waxy outer layer of the exoskeletons of many species of insects; this layer acts as a barrier that resists the loss of water vapour from the insect's body. Damaging the layer increases the evaporation of water from their bodies, so that they dehydrate, often fatally. This also works against gastropods and is commonly employed in gardening to defeat slugs. However, since slugs inhabit humid environments, efficacy is low. Diatomaceous earth is sometimes mixed with an attractant or other additives to increase its effectiveness. The shape of the diatoms contained in a deposit has not been proven to affect their functionality when it comes to the adsorption of lipids; however, certain applications, such as that for slugs and snails, work best when a particularly shaped diatom is used, suggesting that lipid adsorption is not the only factor involved. For example, in the case of slugs and snails, large, spiny diatoms work best to lacerate the epithelium of the mollusk. Diatom shells will work to some degree on the vast majority of animals that undergo ecdysis in shedding cuticle, such as arthropods or nematodes. It also may have other effects on lophotrochozoans, such as mollusks or annelids. Medical-grade diatomite has been studied for its efficacy as a deworming agent in cattle; in both studies cited the groups being treated with diatomaceous earth did not fare any better than control groups. It is commonly used in lieu of boric acid and can be used to help control and possibly eliminate bed bugs, house dust mite, cockroach, ant, and flea infestations. Diatomaceous earth is widely applied for insect control in grain storage. It is used to control cannibalistic behaviors in confused flour beetles, which infest flour storages. In order to be effective as an insecticide, diatomaceous earth must be uncalcinated (i.e., it must not be heat-treated prior to application) and have a mean particle size below about 12 μm (i.e., food grade—see below). Although considered to be relatively low-risk, pesticides containing diatomaceous earth are not exempt from regulation in the United States under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency. === Thermal === Its thermal properties enable it to be used as the barrier material in some fire-resistant safes. It is also used in evacuated powder insulation for use with cryogenics. Diatomaceous earth powder is inserted into the vacuum space to aid in the effectiveness of vacuum insulation. It was used in the classical AGA cookers as a thermal heat barrier. === Catalyst support === Diatomaceous earth also finds some use as a support for catalysts, generally serving to maximize a catalyst's surface area and activity. For example, nickel can be supported on the material—the combination is called Ni–Kieselguhr—to improve its activity as a hydrogenation catalyst. === Agriculture === Natural freshwater diatomaceous earth is used in agriculture for grain storage as an anticaking agent, as well as an insecticide. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a feed additive to prevent caking. Some believe it may be used as a natural anthelmintic (dewormer), although studies have not shown it to be effective. Some farmers add it to their livestock and poultry feed to prevent the caking of feed. ""Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth"" is widely available in agricultural feed supply stores. Freshwater diatomite can be used as a growing medium in hydroponic gardens. It is also used as a growing medium in potted plants, particularly as bonsai soil. Bonsai enthusiasts use it as a soil additive, or pot a bonsai tree in 100% diatomaceous earth. In vegetable gardening it is sometimes used as a soil conditioner, because like perlite, vermiculite, and expanded clay, it retains water and nutrients, while draining fast and freely, allowing high oxygen circulation within the growing medium. === Marker in livestock nutrition experiments === Natural dried, not calcinated diatomaceous earth is regularly used in livestock nutrition research as a source of acid-insoluble ash (AIA), which is used as an indigestible marker. By measuring the content of AIA relative to nutrients in test diets and feces or digesta sampled from the terminal ileum (last third of the small intestine) the percentage of that nutrient digested can be calculated using the following equation: where: Natural freshwater diatomaceous earth is preferred by many researchers over chromic oxide, which has been widely used for the same purpose, the latter being a known carcinogen and, therefore, a potential hazard to research personnel. === Construction === Spent diatomaceous earth from the brewing process can be added to ceramic mass for the production of red bricks with higher open porosity. Diatomaceous earth is considered a prominent inorganic non-metallic material that can be used for the production of various ceramics, including production of porous ceramics under low temperature hydrothermal technology. === Home goods === Diatomaceous earth (DE) is used in some home products where dryness or the ability to wick away moisture is needed. In particular there are bath mats made of DE which absorb water from the bather and allow it to spread the material and rapidly evaporate. There are also spoons made of DE for scooping sugar and other hydroscopic kitchen ingredients. == Specific varieties == Tripolite is the variety found in Tripoli, Libya. Bann clay is the variety found in the Lower Bann valley in Northern Ireland. Moler (mo-clay) is the variety found in northwestern Denmark, especially on the islands of Fur and Mors. Freshwater-derived food grade diatomaceous earth is the type used in United States agriculture for grain storage, as feed supplement, and as an insecticide. It is produced uncalcinated, has a very fine particle size, and is very low in crystal silica (<2%). Salt-water-derived pool / beer / wine filter grade is not suitable for human consumption or effective as an insecticide. Usually calcinated before being sold to remove impurities and undesirable volatile contents, it is composed of larger particles than the freshwater version and has a high crystalline silica content (>60%). == Microbial degradation == Certain species of bacteria in oceans and lakes can accelerate the rate of dissolution of silica in dead and living diatoms by using hydrolytic enzymes to break down the organic algal material. == Climatologic importance == The Earth's climate is affected by dust in the atmosphere, so locating major sources of atmospheric dust is important for climatology. Research indicates that surface deposits of diatomaceous earth play an important role. Research shows that significant dust comes from the Bodélé Depression in Chad, where storms push diatomite gravel over dunes, generating dust by abrasion. == Safety considerations == Inhalation of crystalline silica harms the lungs, causing silicosis. Amorphous silica is considered to have low toxicity, but prolonged inhalation causes lung changes. Diatomaceous earth is mainly amorphous silica but contains some crystalline silica, especially in the saltwater forms. In a 1978 study of workers, those exposed to natural diatomaceous earth for over five years had no significant lung changes while 40% of those exposed to the calcined form had developed pneumoconiosis. Today's standard diatomaceous earth formulations are safer to use, as they are predominantly made of amorphous silica and contain little or no crystalline silica. The crystalline silica content of diatomaceous earth is regulated in the United States by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). There are guidelines from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that set maximum amounts allowable in the product (1%) and in the air near the breathing zone of workers, with a recommended exposure limit at 6 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. OSHA has set a permissible exposure limit for diatomaceous earth as 20 mppcf (80 mg/m3/%SiO2). At levels of 3,000 mg/m3, diatomaceous earth is immediately dangerous to life and health. In the 1930s, workers with long-term occupational exposure in the cristobalite diatomaceous earth industry who were exposed to high levels of airborne crystalline silica over decades were found to have an increased risk of silicosis. Diatomite produced for pool filters is treated with high heat (calcination) and a fluxing agent (soda ash), causing the formerly harmless amorphous silicon dioxide to assume its crystalline form. == See also == Aerogel – Synthetic ultralight solid material Biomineralization – Process by which living organisms produce minerals Fuller's earth – Any clay material that can decolorise oil or other liquids Perlite – Amorphous volcanic glass Rock flour – Glacier-generated sediment Siliceous ooze – Biogenic pelagic sediment located on the deep ocean floor Zeolite – Microporous, aluminosilicate mineral group == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0248 CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards Diatomite: Statistics and Information – USGS Tripolite: Tripolite mineral data Citat: ""...A diatomaceous earth consisting of opaline silica...""

It is used as a topical drug for medical depigmentation. It is a colourless solid that is classified as the monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone. Monobenzone is soluble in alcohol, benzene, and diethyl ether, and practically insoluble in water. == Pharmacology == The topical application of monobenzone in animals increases the excretion of melanin from melanocytes. The same action is thought to be responsible for the depigmenting effect of the drug in humans. Monobenzone may cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation. The histology of the skin after depigmentation with topical monobenzone is the same as that seen in vitiligo; the epidermis is normal except for the absence of identifiable melanocytes. Therefore, monobenzone is used as a topical medicine to permanently depigment normal skin surrounding vitiliginous lesions only in patients with disseminated (greater than 50 percent of body surface area) idiopathic vitiligo.

When acting on GLA, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase produces no leukotrienes and the conversion by the enzyme of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes is inhibited. == Chemistry == GLA is categorized as an n−6 (also called ω−6 or omega-6) fatty acid, meaning that the first double bond on the methyl end (designated with n or ω) is the sixth bond. In physiological literature, GLA is designated as 18:3 (n−6). GLA is a carboxylic acid with an 18-carbon chain and three cis double bonds. It is a regioisomer of α-linolenic acid, which is a polyunsaturated n−3 (omega-3) fatty acid, found in rapeseed canola oil, soybeans, walnuts, flax seed (linseed oil), perilla, chia, and hemp seed. == History == GLA was first isolated from the seed oil of evening primrose. This herbal plant was grown by Native Americans to treat swelling in the body. In the 17th century, it was introduced to Europe and became a popular folk remedy, earning the name king's cure-all. In 1919, Heiduschka and Lüft extracted the oil from evening primrose seeds and described an unusual linolenic acid, which they name γ-. Later, the exact chemical structure was characterized by Riley. Although there are α- and γ- forms of linolenic acid, there is no β- form. One was once identified, but it turned out to be an artifact of the original analytical process. == Dietary sources == GLA is obtained from vegetable oils such as evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) oil (EPO), blackcurrant seed oil, borage seed oil, and hemp seed oil. GLA is also found in varying amounts in edible hemp seeds, oats, barley, and spirulina. Normal safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) oil does not contain GLA, but a genetically modified GLA safflower oil available in commercial quantities since 2011 contains 40% GLA. Borage oil contains 20% GLA, evening primrose oil ranges from 8% to 10% GLA, and black-currant oil contains 15–20%. The human body produces GLA from linoleic acid (LA). This reaction is catalyzed by Δ6-desaturase (D6D), an enzyme that allows the creation of a double bond on the sixth carbon counting from the carboxyl terminus. LA is consumed sufficiently in most diets, from such abundant sources as cooking oils and meats. However, a lack of GLA can occur when there is a reduction of the efficiency of the D6D conversion (for instance, as people grow older or when there are specific dietary deficiencies) or in disease states wherein there is excessive consumption of GLA metabolites. == Source of eicosanoids == From GLA, the body forms dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). This is one of the body's three sources of eicosanoids (along with AA and EPA.) DGLA is the precursor of the prostaglandin PGH1, which in turn forms PGE1 and the thromboxane TXA1. Both PGE11 and TXA1 are anti-inflammatory; thromboxane TXA1, unlike its series-2 variant, induces vasodilation, and inhibits platelet consequently, TXA1 modulates (reduces) the pro-inflammatory properties of the thromboxane TXA2. PGE1 has a role in regulation of immune system function and is used as the medicine alprostadil. Unlike AA and EPA, DGLA cannot yield leukotrienes. However, it can inhibit the formation of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes from AA. Although GLA is an n−6 fatty acid, a type of acid that is, in general, pro-inflammatory, it has anti-inflammatory properties. (See discussion at Essential fatty acid interactions: The paradox of dietary GLA.) == Topical use == In 2002, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency withdrew marketing authorisations for evening primrose oil as an eczema remedy. == Notes and references ==",Gamma-linolenic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.2038906067609787), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.003178306156769395), (' END', -0.2018880546092987), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.8961017202818766e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.03748800605535507), ('OD', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.0005577438860200346), ('ĠEND', -0.016694366931915283), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25196313858032227)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.004078401252627373), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-Linolenic_acid?utm_source=openai), [mountsinai.org](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/gamma-linolenic-acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=223, start_index=21, title='Γ-Linolenic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-Linolenic_acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=223, start_index=21, title='Gamma-linolenic acid Information | Mount Sinai - New York', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/gamma-linolenic-acid?utm_source=openai')])"

A white solid, fumaric acid occurs widely in nature. It has a fruit-like taste and has been used as a food additive. Its E number is E297. The salts and esters are known as fumarates. Fumarate can also refer to the C4H2O2−4 ion (in solution). Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid, while maleic acid is the cis isomer. == Biosynthesis and occurrence == It is produced in eukaryotic organisms from succinate in complex 2 of the electron transport chain via the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. Fumaric acid is found in fumitory (Fumaria officinalis), bolete mushrooms (specifically Boletus fomentarius var. pseudo-igniarius), lichen, and Iceland moss. Fumarate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle used by cells to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from food. It is formed by the oxidation of succinate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. Fumarate is then converted by the enzyme fumarase to malate. Human skin naturally produces fumaric acid when exposed to sunlight. Fumarate is also a product of the urea cycle. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == Uses == === Food === Fumaric acid has been used as a food acidulant since 1946. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. As a food additive, it is used as an acidity regulator and can be denoted by the E number E297. It is generally used in beverages and baking powders for which requirements are placed on purity. Fumaric acid is used in the making of wheat tortillas as a food preservative and as the acid in leavening. It is generally used as a substitute for tartaric acid and occasionally in place of citric acid, at a rate of 1 g of fumaric acid to every ~1.5 g of citric acid, in order to add sourness, similarly to the way malic acid is used. As well as being a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as ""Salt and Vinegar"" flavored potato chips, it is also used as a coagulant in stove-top pudding mixes. The European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, part of DG Health, found in 2014 that fumaric acid is ""practically non-toxic"" but high doses are probably nephrotoxic after long-term use. === Medicine === Fumaric acid was developed as a medicine to treat the autoimmune condition psoriasis in the 1950s in Germany as a tablet containing 3 esters, primarily dimethyl fumarate, and marketed as Fumaderm by Biogen Idec in Europe. Biogen would later go on to develop the main ester, dimethyl fumarate, as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. In patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the ester dimethyl fumarate (BG-12, Biogen) significantly reduced relapse and disability progression in a phase 3 trial. It activates the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway, the primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. === Other uses === Fumaric acid is used in the manufacture of polyester resins and polyhydric alcohols and as a mordant for dyes. Fumaric acid can be used to make 6-methylcoumarin. When fumaric acid is added to their feed, lambs produce up to 70% less methane during digestion. == Synthesis == Fumaric acid is produced based on catalytic isomerisation of maleic acid in aqueous solutions at low pH. It precipitates from the reaction solution. Maleic acid is accessible in large volumes as a hydrolysis product of maleic anhydride, produced by catalytic oxidation of benzene or butane. === Historic and laboratory routes === Fumaric acid was first prepared from succinic acid. A traditional synthesis involves oxidation of furfural (from the processing of maize) using chlorate in the presence of a vanadium-based catalyst. == Reactions == The chemical properties of fumaric acid can be anticipated from its component functional groups. This weak acid forms a diester, it undergoes bromination across the double bond, and it is a good dienophile. == Safety == The oral LD50 is 10g/kg. == See also == Citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) Fumarate reductase Photosynthesis Maleic acid, the cis isomer of fumaric acid Succinic acid == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 1173",Trans-butenedioic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.07702483236789703), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017982252757064998), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.026304712519049644), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' MED', -0.05488701909780502), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -4.56102097814437e-05), (' INDUSTR', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.03215843811631203), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -5.769562994828448e-05), ('ĠMED', -0.5378543734550476), ('ICAL', -6.318072337307967e-06), (',', -0.018156984820961952), ('ĠEND', -0.5764241814613342), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20143117010593414)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.049702201038599014), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008614808320999146), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://periodical.knowde.com/industrial-applications-of-fumaric-acid/,https://www.atamanchemicals.com/trans-butenedioic-acid_u30911/,https://www.britannica.com/science/fumaric-acid ', [])"
3437,"('Maleic acid', 'Cis-butenedioic acid', 'Toxilic acid', 'Maleinic acid', 'Malenic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Maleic acid or cis-butenedioic acid is an organic compound that is a dicarboxylic acid, a molecule with two carboxyl groups. Its chemical formula is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. Maleic acid is the cis isomer of butenedioic acid, whereas fumaric acid is the trans isomer. Maleic acid is mainly used as a precursor to fumaric acid, and relative to its parent maleic anhydride, which has many applications. == Etymology == 'Maleic acid' from the French acide maléique altered from acide malique, malic acid, from which it was synthesised. The word 'malic' is derived from Latin mālum, meaning 'apple'. == Physical properties == Maleic acid has a heat of combustion of −1,355 kJ/mol., 22.7 kJ/mol higher than that of fumaric acid. Maleic acid is more soluble in water than fumaric acid. The melting point of maleic acid (135 °C) is also much lower than that of fumaric acid (287 °C). As confirmed by X-ray crystallography, maleic acid is planar. Two normal hydrogen bonds are observed, one intramolecular and one intermolecular. Crystallographic analysis shows that the intramolecular hydrogen bond is little affected in the monopotassium salt. == Production and industrial applications == In industry, maleic acid is derived by hydrolysis of maleic anhydride, the latter being produced by oxidation of benzene or butane. Maleic acid is an industrial raw material for the production of glyoxylic acid by ozonolysis. Maleic acid may be used to form acid addition salts with drugs to make them more stable, such as indacaterol maleate. Maleic acid is also used as an adhesion promoter for different substrates, such as nylon and zinc coated metals e.g galvanized steel, in methyl methacrylate based adhesives. === Isomerization to fumaric acid === The major industrial use of maleic acid is its conversion to fumaric acid. This conversion, an isomerization, is catalysed by a variety of reagents, such as mineral acids and thiourea. Again, the large difference in water solubility makes fumaric acid purification easy. The isomerization is a popular topic in schools. Maleic acid and fumaric acid do not spontaneously interconvert because rotation around a carbon carbon double bond is not energetically favourable. However, conversion of the cis isomer into the trans isomer is possible by photolysis in the presence of a small amount of bromine. Light converts elemental bromine into a bromine radical, which attacks the alkene in a radical addition reaction to a bromo-alkane radical; and now single bond rotation is possible. The bromine radicals recombine and fumaric acid is formed. In another method (used as a classroom demonstration), maleic acid is transformed into fumaric acid through the process of heating the maleic acid in hydrochloric acid solution. Reversible addition (of H+) leads to free rotation about the central C-C bond and formation of the more stable and less soluble fumaric acid. Some bacteria produce the enzyme maleate isomerase, which is used by bacteria in nicotinate metabolism. This enzyme catalyses isomerization between fumarate and maleate. == Other reactions == Although not practised commercially, maleic acid can be converted into maleic anhydride by dehydration, to malic acid by hydration, and to succinic acid by hydrogenation (ethanol / palladium on carbon). It reacts with thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride to give the maleic acid chloride (it is not possible to isolate the mono acid chloride). Maleic acid, being electrophilic, participates as a dienophile in many Diels-Alder reactions. == Maleates == The maleate ion is the ionized form of maleic acid. The maleate ion is useful in biochemistry as an inhibitor of transaminase reactions. Maleic acid esters are also called maleates, for instance dimethyl maleate. === Use in pharmaceutical drugs === Many drugs that contain amines are provided as the maleate acid salt, e.g. carfenazine, chlorpheniramine, pyrilamine, methylergonovine, and thiethylperazine. == See also == Fumaric acid Malic acid Malonic acid Succinic acid == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 1186 Calculator: Water and solute activities in aqueous maleic acid",Cis-butenedioic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0007505440153181553), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.021346578374505043), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.31343594193458557), ('ĠMED', -0.040039218962192535), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0110840555280447)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.04042509198188782), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.003177952254191041), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([chembk.com](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Cis-Butenedioic%20acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=12, title='Cis-Butenedioic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Cis-Butenedioic%20acid?utm_source=openai')])"

It does not have any effect on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) located on target organs of the parasympathetic nervous system, nor on the nicotinic receptors at the skeletal neuromuscular junction, but acts as antagonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia (nAChR). == Pharmacology == By blocking the neuronal nicotinic receptors in autonomic ganglia, which are necessary for transmission in all autonomic ganglia, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are inhibited. Its action on the neuronal nicotinic receptors is primarily through the block of the ion pore, rather than through competition with the binding site for acetylcholine. Postganglionic sympathetic systems are usually regulated by norepinephrine (noradrenaline) (adrenergic receptors), whereas parasympathetic systems are acetylcholine-based, and instead rely on muscarinic receptors (some post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, such as those stimulating sweat glands, release acetylcholine). The organ system and adverse effects of ganglion blockers are due to the parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli blockage at preganglionic sites. Side-effects include combined sympatholytic (e.g., orthostatic hypotension and sexual dysfunction) and parasympatholytic (e.g., constipation, urinary retention, glaucoma, blurry vision, decreased lacrimal gland secretion, dry mouth (xerostomia)) effects. == Uses == It was formerly used to treat disorders, such as chronic hypertension, of the peripheral nervous system, which is innervated only by the sympathetic nervous system.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) have a broad spectrum of epigenetic activities. Vorinostat is marketed under the name Zolinza ( zoh-LIN-zə) by Merck for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after two systemic therapies. The compound was developed by Columbia University chemist Ronald Breslow and Memorial Sloan-Kettering researcher Paul Marks. == Medical uses == Vorinostat was the first histone deacetylase inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CTCL on October 6, 2006. == Development == In 1966, Charlotte Friend published her observation that a suspension of murine erythroleukemia cells underwent cytodifferentiation to normal erythrocytes when treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, a common drug solvent and cryoprotectant frequently used for cell culture freezing) at 280 mmolar. Memorial Sloan-Kettering researcher Paul Marks approached Columbia University chemist Ronald Breslow about these findings and together they decided to develop more potent analogs of DMSO, in order to make use of this property for cancer treatment. Their optimization process lead to the discovery of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and its HDAC-inhibiting property. == Mechanism of action == Vorinostat has been shown to bind to the active site of histone deacetylases and act as a chelator for zinc ions also found in the active site of histone deacetylases. Vorinostat's inhibition of histone deacetylases results in the accumulation of acetylated histones and acetylated proteins, including transcription factors crucial for the expression of genes needed to induce cell differentiation. It acts on class I, II and IV of histone deacetylase. == Clinical trials == Vorinostat has also been used to treat Sézary syndrome, another type of lymphoma closely related to CTCL. A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4–4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned in which vorinostat will be combined with other drugs. Including vorinostat in treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) showed improved response rates and increased median progression free survival and overall survival. It has given encouraging results in a phase II trial for myelodysplastic syndromes in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine. It failed to demonstrate efficacy in treating acute myeloid leukemia in an earlier phase II study. == Preclinical investigations == Vorinostat is being investigated as a potential HIV latency reversing agent (LRA) as part of an investigational therapeutic strategy known as ""shock and kill"". Vorinostat was shown to reactivate HIV in latently HIV-infected T cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Vorinostat also has shown some activity against the pathophysiological changes in α1-antitrypsin deficiency and cystic fibrosis. Recent evidence also suggests vorinostat can be a therapeutic tool for Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), a rare lysosomal lipid storage disease. Preclinical experiments by University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers suggest the cancer drugs vorinostat, belinostat and panobinostat might be repurposed to treat infections caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV. == See also == Trichostatin A == References == == External links == Vorinostat bound to proteins in the PDB",Suberanilohydroxamic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.490105023549404e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001511027687229216)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29191808/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Suberanilohydroxamic Acid as a Pharmacological Kruppel-Like Factor 2 Activator That Represses Vascular Inflammation and Atherosclerosis', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29191808/?utm_source=openai')])"
3442,"('(s)-phenylethanol', '(s)-1-phenylethanol', '(1s)-1-phenylethanol', '(1s)-1-phenylethan-1-ol', '(s)-1-phenyl-1-ethanol')","Food, Medical"," 2-Phenylethanol (2-PE) is an important flavor ingredient with a rose-like odor. Due to concerns about the toxic byproducts potentially found in 2-PE from chemical synthesis, consumers prefer the natural aroma compound, promoting the biosynthesis of 2-PE. Various microorganisms produce 2-PE naturally with low yield. Recent metabolic engineering strategies in yeasts and Escherichia coli have achieved great success in improving 2-PE bioproduction, including the alleviation of feed-back inhibition, improvement of precursor transport, enhancing activities of crucial enzymes, and reduction of by-products. Here, we review the metabolic engineering strategies applied to microorganisms for increasing bioproduction of 2-PE, address current problems, and propose further improvements. 1-Phenylethanol is a chiral flavor compound that has enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethanol, with different flavor properties. Given that isolating these enantiomers from plants is low yielding and costly, enzymatic synthesis presents an alternative approach. However, the genes/enzymes that specifically produce (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethanol in plants are unknown. To identify these enzymes in tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers, 21 short chain dehydrogenase (SDR) genes were isolated from tea flowers, cloned, and functionally characterized. Several recombinant SDRs in Escherichia coli exhibited activity for converting acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol (CsSPESs, >99.0%), while only one SDR produced (R)-1-phenylethanol (CsRPES, 98.6%). A pair of homologue enzymes (CsSPES and CsRPES) showed a strong preference for NADPH cofactor, with optimal enzymatic reaction conditions of 45-55 °C and pH 8.0. Identification of the tea flower-derived gene responsible for specific synthesis of (R)- and (S)-1-phenylethanolsuggests enzymatic synthesis of enantiopure 1-phenylethanol is possible using a plant-derived gene. The NADPH-dependent (S)-carbonyl reductaseII from Candida parapsilosis catalyzes acetophenone to chiral phenylethanol in a very low yield of 3.2%. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to design two mutants Ala220Asp and Glu228Ser, inside or adjacent to the substrate-binding pocket. Both mutations caused a significant enantioselectivity shift toward (R)-phenylethanol in the reduction of acetophenone. The variant E228S produced (R)-phenylethanol with an optical purity above 99%, in 80.2% yield. The E228S mutation resulted in a 4.6-fold decrease in the K M value, but nearly 5-fold and 21-fold increases in the k cat and k cat/K M values with respect to the wild type. For NADPH regeneration, Bacillus sp. YX-1 glucose dehydrogenase was introduced into the (R)-phenylethanol pathway. A coexpression system containing E228S and glucose dehydrogenase was constructed. The system was optimized by altering the coding gene order on the plasmid and using the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the aligned spacing sequence as a linker between them. The presence of glucose dehydrogenase increased the NADPH concentration slightly and decreased NADP(+) pool 2- to 4-fold; the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio was improved 2- to 5-fold. The recombinant Escherichia coli/pET-MS-SD-AS-G, with E228S located upstream and glucose dehydrogenase downstream, showed excellent performance, giving (R)-phenylethanol of an optical purity of 99.5 % in 92.2% yield in 12 h in the absence of an external cofactor. When 0.06 mM NADP(+) was added at the beginning of the reaction, the reaction duration was reduced to 1 h. Optimization of the coexpression system stimulated an over 30-fold increase in the yield of (R)-phenylethanol, and simultaneously reduced the reaction time 48-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme.

3443,"('Desonide', 'Prednacinolone', 'Locapred', 'Desowen', 'Topifug')",Medical,"Desonide (INN) is a low-potency topical corticosteroid anti-inflammatory that has been available since the 1970s. It is primarily used to treat atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and psoriasis in both adults and children. It has a fairly good safety profile and is available as a cream, ointment, lotion, and as a foam under the tradename Verdeso Foam. Other trade names for creams, lotions, and ointments include Tridesilon, DesOwen, Desonate. It is a group VI corticosteroid under US classification, the second least potent group. == Medical uses == Desonide is a prescription topical treatment for redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort of various skin conditions. Regardless of the vehicle used, desonide is applied 2 to 3 times a day, at the same times each day. Skin conditions typically improve in the first two weeks of treatment. Patients are instructed to use desonide for the minimum amount of time necessary for conditions to improve. == Adverse effects == The safety of desonide has not been determined beyond 4 weeks of use. Patients with allergies to corticosteroids (like hydrocortisone or prednisone) should use caution when taking desonide. Pharmacists and prescribing physicians should be aware that this medication may contain inactive ingredients than can cause allergic reactions. Desonide should not be used if there is an infection or open wound in the treatment area. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce adverse effects. Indication of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria have been observed in some patients receiving treatment. After stopping treatment, reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency is possible. The cosyntropin (ACTH1-24) laboratory test can evaluate patients for HPA axis suppression. HPA function can be reversed after the cessation of treatment or replacement with another less potent corticosteroid. If glucocorticosteroid insufficiency occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be required. Side effects of desonide requiring immediate contact with the prescribing physician: Blistering, burning, crusting, dryness, or flaking of the skin burning, itching, redness, skin rash, swelling, or soreness at the application site flushing or redness of the skin irritation itching, scaling, severe redness, soreness, or swelling of the skin peeling of the skin raised, dark red, wart-like spots on the skin, especially when used on the face stinging and burning unusually warm skin Side effects that may go away as the body adjusts to the medication: Body aches or pain chills cough difficulty with breathing ear congestion fever headache loss of voice nasal congestion runny nose sneezing sore throat unusual tiredness or weakness === Pregnancy === The FDA has labeled desonide as pregnancy category C. Desonide should only be used during pregnancy when absolutely necessary. === Breastfeeding === It is currently unknown whether topical application of Desonide can pass into breast milk. Similar drugs taken orally have been seen to pass into breast milk. The prescribing doctor should be consulted prior to breast-feeding. == Mechanism of action == Desonide is a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid; topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of these properties, however, is unclear for the dermal route of administration. Following absorption through the skin, corticosteroids follow pharmacokinetic pathways similarly to intravenously administered corticosteroids. The mechanism of corticosteroids is thought to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Lipocortins control the biosynthesis of inflammation mediators, like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Lipocortins can inhibit the common precursor of inflammation mediators, arachidonic acid. == Interactions == Common medications causing a minor negative drug interaction include: Insulin and Metformin. Common medications checked in combination, but that are not known to create a negative drug interaction, include: Aspirin, Cymbalta (duloxetine), Fish Oil, Acetaminophen, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Zyrtec. == History == Desonide was first introduced in the United States under the trade name Tridesilon by Dome Laboratories in 1972. Since the discovery in the United States, several other countries have introduced different brand names of desonide, including Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Germany. The FDA first approved Connetics Corporation’s Verdeso Foam® on September 16, 2006. Just shortly after, the FDA approved SkinMedica Inc.’s Desonate® hydrogel delivery vehicle on October 20, 2006. Desonate® gel is currently manufactured by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Whippany, NJ. DesOwen® creams, ointments, and lotions are currently manufactured by DPT Laboratories, Ltd. in San Antonio Texas and is marketed by Galderma Laboratories. Other suppliers for the generic desonide include Rebel Distributors Corp and Perrigo New York Inc. === Research and clinical trials === Desonate was approved by the FDA following two major clinical trials in 2006. Each randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 582 pediatric patients (between the ages of 3 months and 18 years). The patient was topically administered the drug or placebo two times a day for four weeks. Using the Investigator’s Global Severity Score (IGSS), the treatment was considered successful if at Week 4 there was at least a two (2) point decrease from the patient’s baseline IGSS. In clinical trial 1, 44% of patients succeeded successful treatment of Desonate versus 14% treated with the placebo. In clinical trial 2, 28% of patients succeeded successful treatment of Desonate versus 6% treated with the placebo. The FDA approved Tridesilon for the following treatments: Contact Dermatitis, Rhus Dermatitis, Eczema, Dermatitis, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, Granuloma Annulare, Seborrheic Dermatitis, Polymorphous Light Eruption, Pruritus, Psoriasis, Lichen Simplex, Atopic Dermatitis, Lichen Planus, Xerosis, Exfoliative Dermatitis. Recently, in late 2014, phase 3 clinical trials were completed to evaluate treatments using Desonide cream versus amino acid moisturizing cream. Patients with eczema or atopic dermatitis could be enrolled in this study, both male and female, over the age of 18. The randomized, double-blind, active control, 5-week study compared the effects of treatment of both creams through twice-a-day application. The clinical trial is sponsored by NeoStrata Company, Inc. No research has been completed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photoco-carcinogenic potential of desonide. Additionally, no research has been completed to determine the effect on fertility. These are current opportunities for improvement to learn more about the risks and benefits associated with desonide. === Regulatory === The first US. patent for desonide was US4185100A was granted on January 22, 1980. The patent was for topical anti-inflammatory treatment using desonide. The patent defends the suitability of the anti-inflammatory for the treatment of cutaneous disorders or disruptions characterized by skin inflammation and/or hyperproliferative activity in the epidermis. Side effects and the mechanism of action are both disclosed.

3445,"('Tylosin', 'Tylosin a', 'Tylosine', 'Tylocine', 'Tylosin tartrate')",Medical,"Tylosin is a macrolide antibiotic and bacteriostatic feed additive used in veterinary medicine. It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive organisms and a limited range of Gram-negative organisms. It is found naturally as a fermentation product of Streptomyces fradiae. Tylosin is used in veterinary medicine to treat bacterial infections in a wide range of species and has a high margin of safety. It has also been used as a growth promotant in some species, and as a treatment for colitis in companion animals. == Mode of action == Like other macrolides, tylosin has a bacteriostatic effect on susceptible organisms, caused by inhibition of protein synthesis through binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. == Spectrum of activity == Tylosin has a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, and Erysipelothrix. It has a much narrower Gram-negative spectrum of activity, but has been shown to be active against Campylobacter coli, and certain spirochaetes. It has also been shown to be extremely active against Mycoplasma species isolated from both mammalian and avian hosts. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens: Mycoplasma bovis: 0.06 - 4 μg/ml Staphylococcus aureus: 0.5 - >128 μg/ml == Clinical use == Tylosin has been used to treat a variety of different diseases throughout the world. Differing formulations and licensing conditions mean it may not be a recognized method of treatment for certain conditions in certain countries. In general, tylosin is licensed for the treatment of infections caused by organisms susceptible to the drug, but it has also been used as a treatment of colitis in small animals, as a growth promotant in food-producing animals, and as a way of reducing epiphora (tear staining) around the eyes of white-faced dogs. In these cases, the result is positive only when using the tylosin in the form of tartrate, a chelating porphyrin. No marketing authority exists for the use of other tylosin forms as a tear-stain remover, thus it is not legal to use it for such purposes; the exception is as a prescription-only medicine of last resort by veterinarians under the cascading rule (UK) or the extra-label use rule (US). Examples of bacterial infections that could potentially be treated with tylosin include respiratory infections, metritis, and acute mastitis in cattle; mastitis in sheep and goats; enteritis, pneumonia, erysipelas, and infectious arthritis in swine; and soft-tissue infections in small animals. While tylosin may be one appropriate therapeutic choice in theory for the conditions listed above, many other antibiotics may be preferable for treating a specific infection, and tylosin will not be the first choice. It is also used as a growth promoter for a variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals grown for human consumption. == Available forms == Tylosin is available in injectable, intramammary, and oral formulations with different product ranges available in different countries. == Composition == Tylosin is a mixture of four major components: tylosins A, B, C, and D. Tylosin A is considered the major component of tylosin (comprises about 90% of tylosin); however, tylosins B, C, and D contribute to the overall potency of tylosin. == Precautions and contraindications == Administration of tylosin should be avoided in animals with a known hypersensitivity to the product, or to other macrolides. Oral administration can result in diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbance. This is particularly true of horses, such that it can be fatal. Tylosin also has a foul taste that is difficult to disguise. The injectable formulations of tylosin can cause pain, inflammation, and itchiness around the injection site. Since tylosin has a relatively poor spectrum of activity against Gram-negative organisms, it may not be a sensible therapeutic choice in the treatment of infections caused by unknown, potentially unsusceptible organisms. == Drug interactions == Tylosin may increase digitalis blood levels, thus its toxicity, and may be antagonistic to chloramphenicol or lincosamides. Colorimetric assays of serum ALT and AST may be falsely elevated by macrolide antibiotics. == See also == Tylvalosin == References ==",Tylocine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02456657774746418)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.17239922285079956), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.062108445912599564), ('ĠINDU', -0.2556345462799072), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16059990227222443)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylosin,https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/1401-69-0_402597.html,https://www.invivochem.com/tylosin.html ', [])"

3447,"('Pemetrexed',)",Medical,"Pemetrexed, sold under the brand name Alimta among others, is a chemotherapy medication for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is available as a generic medication. == Medical use == In February 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pemetrexed for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma, a type of tumor of the mesothelium, the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs, in combination with cisplatin for patients whose disease is either unresectable or who are not otherwise candidates for curative surgery. In September 2008, the FDA granted approval as a first-line treatment, in combination with cisplatin, against locally advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with non-squamous histology. === Carboplatin === Pemetrexed is also recommended in combination with carboplatin and pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, the relative efficacy or toxicity of pemetrexed-cisplatin versus pemetrexed-carboplatin has not been established beyond what is generally thought about cisplatin or carboplatin doublet drug therapy. === Supplementation === Patients are recommended to take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplement even if levels are normal when they are on pemetrexed therapy. (In clinical trials for mesothelioma, folic acid and B12 supplementation reduced the frequency of adverse events.) It is also recommended for patients to be on a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone) on the day prior, day of, and day after pemetrexed infusion to avoid skin rashes. == Drug interaction == The administration of cisplatin and vitamin B12 concomitantly does not modify the pharmacokinetics of the pemetrexed. It was recently shown that pemetrexed may play a role in cisplatin resistance in lung cancer by increasing the expression of Orai3 calcium channels as well as the expression of certain ABC transporters like MDR1 and MRP-5 responsible for cisplatin efflux and therefore a reduction of the effect of cisplatin As current therapies are based on the co-administration of pemetrexed and cisplatin, there may be interactions between pemetrexed and cisplatin, including a reduction in the therapeutic effects of cisplatin caused by pemetrexed. == Mechanism of action == Pemetrexed is chemically similar to folic acid and is in the class of chemotherapy drugs called folate antimetabolites. It works by inhibiting three enzymes used in purine and pyrimidine synthesis—thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). By inhibiting the formation of precursor purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, pemetrexed prevents the formation of DNA and RNA, which are required for the growth and survival of both normal cells and cancer cells. == Society and culture == === Economics === In the United States, as of 2015, each vial of the medication costs between US$2,623 and US$3,100. === Brand names === In February 2020, Pemfexy was approved for use in the United States. == Research == A Phase III study showed benefits of maintenance use of pemetrexed for non-squamous NSCLC.

Apple peels contain large quantities of ursolic acid and related compounds. == Potential biochemical effects == A number of potential biochemical effects of ursolic acid have been investigated, but there has been no clinical study demonstrating benefits to human health. In vitro, ursolic acid inhibits the proliferation of various cancer cell types by inhibiting the STAT3 activation pathway, and may also decrease proliferation of cancer cells and induce apoptosis. Ursolic acid has also been shown to inhibit JNK expression and IL-2 activation of JURKAT leukemic T Cells leading to the reduction in proliferation and T cell activation. Ursolic acid is a weak aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 32 μM), and has been shown to increase the amount of muscle and brown fat and decrease white fat obesity and associated conditions when added to diets fed to mice. Under physiological concentrations, ursolic acid also induces eryptosis (the apoptosis-like suicidal cell death in defective red blood cells). It has been found to reduce muscle atrophy and to stimulate muscular growth in mice, also shows a potential cardioprotection. In mice, ursolic acid induces neural regeneration after sciatic nerve injuries and recently found to have COVID preventative capabilities. More research in this recent finding is underway. In mice with chronic multiple sclerosis, ursolic acid has reduced further damage to neurons and helped rebuild the protective sheaths covering neurons, apparently by suppressing Th17 immune cells and activating precursor cells that mature into myelin-sheath-making cells, called oligodendrocytes. Ursolic acid improves domoic acid-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Ursolic acid improves high fat diet-induced cognitive impairments by blocking endoplasmic reticulum stress and IκB kinase β/nuclear factor-κB-mediated inflammatory pathways in mice. Ursolic acid attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced cognitive deficits in mouse brain through suppressing p38/NF-κB mediated inflammatory pathways. Ursolic acid ameliorates cognition deficits and attenuates oxidative damage in the brain of senescent mice induced by D-galactose. Ursolic acid enhances mouse liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Ursolic acid enhances the cellular immune system and pancreatic beta-cell function in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice fed a high-fat diet. Ursolic acid increased skeletal muscle mass, as well as grip strength and exercise capacity, improved endurance, reduced the expression of the genes involved in the development of muscle atrophy, and decreased indicators of accumulated fatigue and exercise-induced stress. In rats, ursolic acid ameliorated high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and improved metabolic disorders in high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. == Uses == Ursolic acid can be found in plants that are used for cosmetics additives.

It may be used both in relapsed as well as in treatment-naive settings. Common side effects include headaches, feeling tired, low red blood cells, low platelets, and low white blood cells. It is a second generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Acalabrutinib blocks an enzyme called Bruton's tyrosine kinase, which helps B cells to survive and grow. By blocking this enzyme, acalabrutinib is expected to slow down the build-up of cancerous B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, thereby delaying progression of the cancer. Acalabrutinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2017, and in the European Union in November 2020. == Medical uses == In the European Union, acalabrutinib as monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. It is also indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who have received at least one prior therapy. In the United States, acalabrutinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy, and for the treatment of adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. In January 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted traditional approval to acalabrutinib, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, for the treatment of adults with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are ineligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The FDA also granted traditional approval to acalabrutinib as a single agent for adults with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma. Acalabrutinib received accelerated approval for this indication in 2017. == Side effects == The most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea and weight gain. Despite the appearance of a greater occurrence of transient headaches, data suggest a preferred advantage of acalabrutinib over ibrutinib due to expected reduced adverse events of skin rash, severe diarrhea, and bleeding risk. == History == The efficacy of using acalabrutinib, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, was evaluated in ECHO (NCT02972840), a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial in 598 participants with untreated mantle cell lymphoma who were ≥65 years of age and not intended to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive acalabrutinib plus bendamustine and rituximab or placebo plus bendamustine and rituximab. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for acalabrutinib, in combination with bendamustine and rituximab, priority review and orphan drug designations. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Acalabrutinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2017, and in the European Union in November 2020. As of February 2016, acalabrutinib had received orphan drug designation in the United States for mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and was similarly designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) for treatment of three indications: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia). Approval would result in a 10-year period of market exclusivity for the stated indications within Europe. === Economics === It was developed by Acerta Pharma. After promising results for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in initial clinical trials, Astra Zeneca purchased a 55% stake in Acerta Pharma for $4 billion in December 2015, with an option to acquire the remaining 45% stake for an additional $3 billion, conditional on approval in both the US and Europe and the establishment of commercial opportunity. === Names === Acalabrutinib is the international nonproprietary name (INN), and the United States Adopted Name (USAN). == Research == Relative to ibrutinib, acalabrutinib demonstrated higher selectivity and inhibition of the targeted activity of BTK, while having a much greater IC50 or otherwise virtually no inhibition on the kinase activities of ITK, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, JAK3, BLK, FGR, FYN, HCK, LCK, LYN, SRC, and YES1. In addition, in platelets treated with ibrutinib, thrombus formation was clearly inhibited while no impact to thrombus formation was identified relative to controls for those treated with acalabrutinib. These findings strongly suggest an improved safety profile of acalabrutinib with minimized adverse effects relative to ibrutinib. In pre-clinical studies, it was shown to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, the first-in-class BTK inhibitor. The interim results of the still on-going first human phase I/II clinical trial (NCT02029443) with 61 patients for the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia are encouraging, with a 95% overall response rate demonstrating potential to become a best-in-class treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Notably, a 100% response rate was achieved for those people which were positive for the 17p13.1 gene deletion, a subgroup that typically results in a poor response to therapy and expected outcomes. == References == == External links == ""Acalabrutinib"".

3451,"('Digitoxin', 'Digitoxoside', 'Digitoxinum', 'Unidigin', 'Digitoksin')",Medical,"Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside used for the treatment of heart failure and certain kinds of heart arrhythmia. It is a phytosteroid and is similar in structure and effects to digoxin, though the effects are longer-lasting. Unlike digoxin, which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys, it is eliminated via the liver, and so can be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function. While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for digitoxin is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective. == Medical uses == Digitoxin is used for the treatment of heart failure, especially in people with impaired kidney function. It is also used to treat certain kinds of heart arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation. == Contraindications == Contraindications include problems with the heart rhythm, such as severe bradycardia (slow heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat caused by the ventricles), ventricular fibrillation, or first- to second-degree atrioventricular block, and certain electrolyte imbalances: hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), and hypercalcemia (high calcium). == Adverse effects and toxicity == Digitoxin exhibits similar toxic effects to digoxin, namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Antidigoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious digitoxin toxicity. == Interactions == Drugs that can increase digitoxin toxicity include: calcium substances that lower potassium or magnesium levels, such as diuretics and corticosteroids inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, which slow down digitoxin metabolism; examples are the antibiotic clarithromycin, the antifungal itraconazole, and grapefruit juice inhibitors of the transporter protein P-gp, such as clarithromycin Beta blockers add to the bradycardia (slow heartbeat) caused by digitoxin. Drugs that can decrease the effectivity of digitoxin include: substances that increase potassium levels, such as potassium sparing diuretics inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp, such as phenytoin, rifampicin and St John's Wort substances that bind digitoxin in the gut, such as aluminium containing antacids or colestyramine == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Digitoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase in heart muscle cells, resulting in increased force of contractions (positive inotropic), reduced speed of electric conduction (negative dromotropic), increased excitability (positive bathmotropic), and reduced frequency of heartbeat (negative chronotropic). === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is almost completely absorbed from the gut. When in the bloodstream, 90 to 97% are bound to plasma proteins. Digitoxin undergoes enterohepatic circulation. It is metabolized in part by CYP3A4; metabolites include digitoxigenin, digoxin (>2%), and conjugate esters. In healthy people, 60% are eliminated via the kidneys and 40% via the faeces. In people with impaired kidney function, elimination via the faeces is increased. The biological half-life is 7 to 8 days except when kidney and liver functions are impaired, in which case it is usually longer. == History == The first description of the use of foxglove dates back to 1775. For quite some time, the active compound was not isolated. Oswald Schmiedeberg was able to obtain a pure sample in 1875. The modern therapeutic use of this molecule was made possible by the works of the pharmacist and the French chemist Claude-Adolphe Nativelle (1812–1889). The first structural analysis was done by Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus in 1925, but the full structure with an exact determination of the sugar groups was not accomplished until 1962. == Use as a weapon == Digitoxin has been used for at least 7,000 years as an arrow poison. Marie Alexandrine Becker, a Belgian serial killer, was sentenced to death for poisoning eleven people with digitoxin. === In fiction === Digitoxin is used as a poison or murder weapon in: Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death Elizabeth Peters' Die For Love CSI, season 9, episode 19: ""The Descent of Man"" Rosewood season 2, episode 20: Calliphoridae and Country Roads ""Casino Royale"" (2006) ""Uneasy Lies the Crown"" on Columbo, season 9, episode 5 (1990) ""Affair of the Heart"" on McMillan and Wife, season 6, episode 5 (1977) Murder 101: ""College can be a Murder"" Several episodes of Murder She Wrote. Private Practice, season 4, episode 18: “The Hardest Part” In The Decemberists's song, ""The Rake's Song"" on The Hazards of Love album, the narrator murders his daughter by feeding her foxglove. In Metal gear Solid V the phantom pain, venom snake uses digitalis to obtain digoxin for tranquilizer rounds to incapacitate enemies. == Research == Digitoxin and related cardenolides display anticancer activity against a range of human cancer cell lines in vitro but the clinical use of digitoxin to treat cancer has been restricted by its narrow therapeutic index. Digitoxin glycorandomization led to the discovery of novel digitoxigenin neoglycosides which displayed improved anticancer potency and reduced inotropic activity (the perceived mechanism of general toxicity). == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Digitoxin at Wikimedia Commons Comparing the Toxicity of Digoxin and Digitoxin in a Geriatric Population: Should an Old Drug Be Rediscovered? on Medscape (registration required), a convenience link from the original.

Originally discovered in 1983, and approved in 1992, it was sold under the tradename Cefzil by Bristol Meyers Squibb until 2010 when the brand name version was discontinued. It continues to be available from various companies in its generic form. It is used in the treatment of pharyngitis, tonsillitis, ear infections, acute sinusitis, bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and skin and skin structure infections. It is currently available as a tablet and as a liquid suspension. == Adverse effects == Although there is a widely quoted cross-allergy risk of 10% between cephalosporins and penicillin, research has shown no increased risk for cross-allergy for cefprozil and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins. The most common side effects were increased hepatic lab values (including AST and ALGT), dizziness, eosinophilia, diaper rash and superinfection, genital pruritus, vaginitis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. == Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and resistance == Currently, bacteria like Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to cefprozil, while Salmonella enterica serotype Agona and streptococci are susceptible to cefprozil. Some bacteria like Brucella abortus, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae have developed resistance towards cefprozil in varying degrees.

It has been used in the form of the dihydrochloride and hemisulfate salts as a topical antiseptic, and was formerly used as a urinary antiseptic. Proflavine is also known to have a mutagenic effect on DNA by intercalating between nucleic acid base pairs. It differs from most other mutagenic components by causing basepair-deletions or basepair-insertions and not substitutions. In the presence of light, proflavine can induce double-stranded breaks in DNA. Proflavine is a fluorescent dye that is sometimes used in microscopic in-vivo imaging due to its intercalation properties. However, there was concern that women exposed to proflavin could develop cervical cancer since they have mutagenesis potential. However, the retrospective analysis performed by Pantano et. al. demonstrated that there is no increased cervical cancer risk after exposure to proflavine. In astronomical spectroscopy proflavine present in interstellar clouds (derived from the modification in meteorites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by heteroatoms) strongly absorbs in the blue region at 445 nm.

3456,"('Rifapentine', 'Dl 473', 'Cyclopentylrifampicin', 'Priftin', 'Rifapentin')",Medical,"Rifapentine, sold under the brand name Priftin, is an antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis. In active tuberculosis it is used together with other antituberculosis medications. In latent tuberculosis it is typically used with isoniazid. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include low neutrophil counts in the blood, elevated liver enzymes, and white blood cells in the urine. Serious side effects may include liver problems or Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. Rifapentine is in the rifamycin family of medication and works by blocking DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Rifapentine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == A systematic review of regimens for prevention of active tuberculosis in HIV-negative individuals with latent TB found that a weekly, directly observed regimen of rifapentine with isoniazid for three months was as effective as a daily, self-administered regimen of isoniazid for nine months. The three-month rifapentine-isoniazid regimen had higher rates of treatment completion and lower rates of hepatotoxicity. However, the rate of treatment-limiting adverse events was higher in the rifapentine-isoniazid regimen compared to the nine-month isoniazid regimen. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include allergic reaction, anemia, neutropenia, elevated transaminases, and pyuria. Overdoses have been associated with hematuria and hyperuricemia. === Pregnancy === Rifapentine in pregnant women has not been studied, but animal reproduction studies have resulted in fetal harm and were teratogenic. == Contraindications == Rifapentine should be avoided in patients with an allergy to the rifamycin class of drugs. This drug class includes rifampicin and rifabutin. == Interactions == Rifapentine induces metabolism by CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 enzymes. It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of drugs metabolized by these enzymes if they are taken with rifapentine. Examples of drugs that may be affected by rifapentine include warfarin, propranolol, digoxin, protease inhibitors and birth control pills. == Chemical structure == The chemical structure of rifapentine is similar to that of rifampicin, with the notable substitution of a methyl group for a cyclopentane (C5H9) group. == History == Rifapentine was first synthesized in 1965, by the same company that produced rifampicin. The drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 1998. It is made from rifampicin. Rifapentine was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA in June 1995, and by the European Commission in June 2010. == Society and culture == === Cancer-causing impurities === In August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of nitrosamine impurities in certain samples of rifapentine. The FDA and manufacturers are investigating the origin of these impurities in rifapentine, and the agency is developing testing methods for regulators and industry to detect the 1-cyclopentyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (CPNP). CPNP belongs to the nitrosamine class of compounds, some of which are classified as probable or possible human carcinogens (substances that could cause cancer), based on laboratory tests such as rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although there are no data available to directly evaluate the carcinogenic potential of CPNP, information available on closely related nitrosamine compounds was used to calculate lifetime exposure limits for CPNP. As of January 2021, the FDA continues to investigate the presence of 1-methyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (MNP) in rifampin or 1-cyclopentyl-4-nitrosopiperazine (CPNP) in rifapentine approved for sale in the US. == References == == External links == ""Nitrosamine impurities in medications: Guidance"".

3458,"('Azoxystrobin', 'Amistar', 'Bankit', 'Icia-5504', 'Quadris')",Medical,"Johannes de Quadris (Quatris) (before 1410 – 1457?) was an Italian composer of the early Renaissance. He was one of the first composers of polyphony associated with the basilica of St. Mark's in Venice, and the earliest known composer to write a polyphonic setting of the Magnificat for four voices. == Life == He was a priest, and originally from the diocese of Valva-Sulmona, in the vicinity of L'Aquila, in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. Sometime before 1436 he began to work as a singer at San Marco in Venice, which was then at the very beginning of its rise to fame; the first mention of a choir there is found in a document of 1403 (by the end of the 16th century, it was one of the most renowned musical institutions in Europe). Quadris worked at San Marco from at least 1436, the date given on his Magnificat, to the time that a Vatican document listed him as ""deceased"", in 1457. He made repeated requests (1450, 1452, 1454) to Pope Nicholas V to obtain a prebend in Aquileia. == Music == His musical style is highly varied, and possibly he wrote his surviving pieces over a career of more than the twenty documented years. The motet Gaudeat ecclesia and the Magnificat are stylistically related to the music of the late Middle Ages, with a cantus firmus surrounded by texturally distinct vocal lines; the other works, with their lighter texture, are more characteristic of Italian composers writing later in the century. Clarity of the text is foremost in these works, as is liturgical utility. According to Giulio Cattin, writing in the New Grove: ""Taken as a whole, his output developed in a way typical of the 15th century, from a northern late Gothic idiom to the expressive, tuneful simplicity of Italian music."" The Magnificat is the earliest polyphonic setting of the Canticle for four voices; the few surviving earlier settings are all for two or three only. It is marked ""pbr. Johannes de Quatris: 1436 mensis maij Venet[iis]"" – a much-debated notation which may refer to the time and place of composition (May 1436, Venice) or perhaps an occasion for performance, or even the date the manuscript was copied. Quadris's music remained popular for more than half a century, as shown by the many copies made of his hymn Iste confessor, as well as the printing of his music for the Passion by Ottaviano Petrucci in 1506 (the only source that gives Quadris as the composer). The music for the Passion, which includes Lessons for Matins as well as a set of Lamentations, also has been found in a manuscript, now in Vicenza, which was copied around 1440. His settings of the Lamentations were in use at San Marco until they were replaced by those by Giovanni Croce in 1603, another indication of the esteem in which they were held. == Works == === Attributed to Johannes de Quadris in contemporary sources === Chants for a Good Friday procession (two voices) Gaudeat ecclesia (motet, for four voices) Iste confessor (hymn, for three voices; attributed to him in the manuscript I-Fn 112bis by Antonius Janue, around 1456) Lamentations (two voices) Magnificat (four voices; signed and dated 1436) Planctus Mariae: Cum autem venissem === Anonymous, attributed to de Quadris by contemporary musicologists === Douce speranche (virelai) Se je n'é mal (virelai) == References == Giulio Cattin: ""Johannes de Quadris"", Grove Music Online ed.

3461,"('Cortodoxone', 'Cortexolone', ""Reichstein's substance s"", 'Reichstein s', 'Substance s')","Endogenous, Medical","11-Deoxycortisol, also known as cortodoxone (INN), cortexolone as well as 17α,21-dihydroxyprogesterone or 17α,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is an endogenous glucocorticoid steroid hormone, and a metabolic intermediate toward cortisol. It was first described by Tadeusz Reichstein in 1938 as Substance S, thus has also been referred to as Reichstein's Substance S or Compound S. == Function == 11-Deoxycortisol acts as a glucocorticoid, though is less potent than cortisol. 11-Deoxycortisol is synthesized from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone by 21-hydroxylase and is converted to cortisol by 11β-hydroxylase. 11-Deoxycortisol in mammals has limited biological activity and mainly acts as metabolic intermediate within the glucocorticoid pathway, leading to cortisol. However, in sea lampreys, an early jawless fish species that originated over 500 million years ago, 11-deoxycortisol plays a crucial role as the primary and ultimate glucocorticoid hormone with mineralocorticoid properties; 11-deoxycortisol also takes part, by binding to specific corticosteroid receptors, in intestinal osmoregulation in sea lamprey at metamorphosis, during which they develop seawater tolerance before downstream migration. Sea lampreys do not possess the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP11B1) responsible for converting 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, as observed in mammals. The absence of this enzyme in sea lampreys indicates the existence of a complex and highly specific corticosteroid signaling pathway that emerged at least 500 million years ago with the advent of early vertebrates. The lack of cortisol and corticosterone in sea lampreys suggests that the presence of the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme may have been absent during the early stages of vertebrate evolution. The absence of cortisol and corticosterone in sea lampreys suggests that the 11β-hydroxylase enzyme may not have been present early in vertebrate evolution. == Clinical significance == 11-Deoxycortisol in mammals has limited glucocorticoid activity, but it is the direct precursor of the major mammalian glucocorticoid, cortisol. As a result, the level of 11-deoxycortisol is measured to diagnose impaired cortisol synthesis, to find out the enzyme deficiency that causes impairment along the pathway to cortisol, and to differentiate adrenal disorders. In 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone levels increase, and excess of 11-deoxycorticosterone leads to mineralocorticoid-based hypertension (as opposed to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, in which patients have low blood pressure from a lack of mineralocorticoids). Low levels of cortisol can affect blood pressure by causing a decrease in sodium retention and volume expansion. This is because cortisol plays a role in regulating the balance of water and electrolytes in the body. When cortisol levels are low, there is less sodium reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to increased excretion of sodium through urine. This ultimately reduces blood volume and lowers blood pressure. On the other hand, high levels of cortisol can also affect blood pressure by causing an increase in sodium retention and volume expansion. Cortisol-induced hypertension is accompanied by significant sodium retention, leading to an increase in extracellular fluid volume and exchangeable sodium. This results in an increase in blood volume and subsequently increases blood pressure. The underlying mechanisms for these effects involve various factors such as suppression of the nitric oxide system, alterations in vascular responsiveness to pressor agonists like adrenaline, increased cardiac output or stroke volume due to plasma volume expansion, and potential dysregulation of glucocorticoid receptors or 11β-hydroxylase enzyme activity. It's important to note that these mechanisms may be relevant not only for cortisol-induced hypertension but also for conditions such as Cushing's syndrome (excess cortisol production), apparent mineralocorticoid excess (related to defects in 11β-hydroxylase enzymes), licorice abuse (glycyrrhetinic acid affecting glycyrrhetinic acid receptor), chronic renal failure (prolonged half-life of cortisol due to reduced 11β-hydroxylase activity), and even essential hypertension where there may be abnormalities with 11β-hydroxylase activity or glucocorticoid receptor variations. Low levels of cortisol lead to reduced vascular tone as cortisol helps maintain normal vascular tone by promoting vasoconstriction. Low levels of cortisol can lead to decreased vasoconstriction, resulting in relaxed blood vessels and lower overall blood pressure. Also, low cortisol levels lead to impaired fluid balance, as cortisol affects fluid balance by influencing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys. When cortisol levels are low, sodium absorption may be reduced, leading to increased excretion of sodium in the urine and subsequent lowering of blood volume and blood pressure. Additionally, low levels of cortisol cause a dysregulated renin-angiotensin system, as cortisol interacts with the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure through vasoconstriction and fluid balance. Low cortisol levels can disrupt this system, leading to altered angiotensin production, reduced aldosterone secretion, and subsequently lower blood pressure. Conversely, high levels of cortisol lead to increased vascular tone, enhanced sodium retention, and increased sympathetic activity. Stress-induced release of high-level glucocorticoids such as cortisol activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS controls heart rate, cardiac output, and vasomotor tone, causing constriction, and thereby increasing peripheral arterial resistance, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. In 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol can also be converted to androstenedione in a pathway that could explain the increase in androstenedione levels this condition. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol levels are low. == History == In 1934, biochemist Tadeus Reichstein, working in Switzerland, began research on extracts from animal adrenal glands in order to isolate physiologically active compounds. He was publishing results of his findings along the way. By 1944, he already isolated and elucidated the chemical structure of 29 pure substances. He was assigning names that consisted of the word ""Substance"" and a letter from the Latin alphabet to the newly found substances. In 1938, he published an article about ""Substance R"" and ""Substance S"" describing their chemical structures and properties. The Substance S since about 1955 became known as 11-Deoxycortisol. In 1949, American research chemist Percy Lavon Julian, in looking for ways to produce cortisone, announced the synthesis of the Compound S, from the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol). On 5 April 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn, published the first report of a breakthrough fermentation process for the microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids (e.g. progesterone) in a single step by common molds of the order Mucorales. 11α-oxygenation of Compound S produces 11α-hydrocortisone, which can be chemically oxidized to cortisone, or converted by further chemical steps to 11β-hydrocortisone (cortisol). == See also == 11-Deoxycorticosterone Cortexolone 17α-propionate == References ==",Cortexolone,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0008969316841103137), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00010926496179308742), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.01681651920080185), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -8.22540732769994e-06), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.07904749363660812), ('ĠMED', -0.0003163314249832183), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002484332537278533)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.06829150766134262)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([medchemexpress.com](https://www.medchemexpress.com/Cortodoxone.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=20, title='Cortodoxone (11-Deoxycortisol) | Glucocorticoid Steroid Hormone | MedChemExpress', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medchemexpress.com/Cortodoxone.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3463,"('Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid', 'Butanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-', 'Beta-hydroxybutyric acid', 'Butyric acid, 3-hydroxy-', 'Beta-hydroxybuttersaeure')","Endogenous, Medical","β-Hydroxybutyric acid, also known as 3-hydroxybutyric acid or BHB, is an organic compound and a beta hydroxy acid with the chemical formula CH3CH(OH)CH2CO2H; its conjugate base is β-hydroxybutyrate, also known as 3-hydroxybutyrate. β-Hydroxybutyric acid is a chiral compound with two enantiomers: D-β-hydroxybutyric acid and L-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Its oxidized and polymeric derivatives occur widely in nature. In humans, D-β-hydroxybutyric acid is one of two primary endogenous agonists of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). == Biosynthesis == In humans, D-β-hydroxybutyrate can be synthesized in the liver via the metabolism of fatty acids (e.g., butyrate), β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, and ketogenic amino acids through a series of reactions that metabolize these compounds into acetoacetate, which is the first ketone body that is produced in the fasting state. The biosynthesis of D-β-hydroxybutyrate from acetoacetate is catalyzed by the β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase enzyme. Butyrate can also be metabolized into D-β-hydroxybutyrate via a second metabolic pathway that does not involve acetoacetate as a metabolic intermediate. This metabolic pathway is as follows: butyrate→butyryl-CoA→crotonyl-CoA→β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA→poly-β-hydroxybutyrate→D-β-(D-β-hydroxybutyryloxy)-butyrate→D-β-hydroxybutyrate The last reaction in this metabolic pathway, which involves the conversion of D-β-(D-β-hydroxybutyryloxy)-butyrate into D-β-hydroxybutyrate, is catalyzed by the hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase enzyme. The concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate in human blood plasma, as with other ketone bodies, increases through ketosis. This elevated β-hydroxybutyrate level is naturally expected, as β-hydroxybutyrate is formed from acetoacetate. The compound can be used as an energy source by the brain and skeletal muscle when blood glucose is low. Diabetic patients can have their ketone levels tested via urine or blood to indicate diabetic ketoacidosis. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, this ketone body is produced in greatest concentration. Ketogenesis occurs if oxaloacetate in the liver cells is depleted, a circumstance created by reduced carbohydrate intake (through diet or starvation); prolonged, excessive alcohol consumption; and/or insulin deficiency. Because oxaloacetate is crucial for entry of acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle, the rapid production of acetyl-CoA from fatty acid oxidation in the absence of ample oxaloacetate overwhelms the decreased capacity of the TCA cycle, and the resultant excess of acetyl-CoA is shunted towards ketone body production. == Biological activity == D-β-Hydroxybutyric acid, along with butyric acid, are the two primary endogenous agonists of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a Gi/o-coupled GPCR. β-Hydroxybutyric acid is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system. Levels of β-hydroxybutyric acid increase in the liver, heart, muscle, brain, and other tissues with exercise, calorie restriction, fasting, and ketogenic diets. The compound has been found to act as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Through inhibition of the HDAC class I isoenzymes HDAC2 and HDAC3, β-hydroxybutyric acid has been found to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and TrkB signaling in the hippocampus. Moreover, a rodent study found that prolonged exercise increases plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, which induces promoters of the BDNF gene in the hippocampus. These findings may have clinical relevance in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. In epilepsy patients on the ketogenic diet, blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels correlate best with degree of seizure control. The threshold for optimal anticonvulsant effect appears to be approximately 4 mmol/L. == Laboratory and industrial chemistry == β-Hydroxybutyric acid is the precursor to polyesters, which are biodegradable plastics. This polymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), is also naturally produced by the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus. β-Hydroxybutyrate can be extracted from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) by acid hydrolysis. The concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate in blood plasma is measured through a test that uses β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, with NAD+ as an electron-accepting cofactor. The conversion of β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, which is catalyzed by this enzyme, reduces the NAD+ to NADH, generating an electrical change; the magnitude of this change can then be used to extrapolate the amount of β-hydroxybutyrate in the sample. == See also == Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB) Hydroxybutyric acid Ketogenesis == Notes == == References ==",Beta-hydroxybutyric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.00019734179659280926), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00015872348740231246), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0040799472481012344), (' MED', -0.8270924091339111), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.007613613270223141), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('EN', -0.13743899762630463), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.58813522325363e-05), ('OUS', -2.7418097943154862e-06), (',', -0.00679586548358202), ('ĠINDU', -0.22055919468402863), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133431375026703)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.06196846812963486), (' FOOD', -0.0011531977215781808)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Hydroxybutyric_acid?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9558159/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=223, start_index=30, title='β-Hydroxybutyric acid - Wikipedia', type='url_citation', url='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%92-Hydroxybutyric_acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=223, start_index=30, title='Safety of β‐hydroxybutyrate salts as a novel food pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9558159/?utm_source=openai')])"

The α- (alpha), β- (beta), and γ- (gamma) cyclodextrins correspond to six, seven, and eight glucose units, respectively. β-Cyclodextrin is the most used natural cyclodextrin in marketed medicines. The reason for this lies in the ease of its production and subsequent low price (more than 10,000 tons produced annually with an average bulk price of approximately 5 USD per kg). == Structure == In β-cyclodextrin, the seven glucose subunits are linked end to end via α-1,4 linkages. The result has the shape of a tapered cylinder, with seven primary alcohols on one face and fourteen secondary alcohol groups on the other. The exterior surface of cyclodextrins is somewhat hydrophilic whereas the interior core is hydrophobic. == Physical properties == β-Cyclodextrin exists as a white (colorless) powder or crystals. The density of its saturated hydrate crystal (βCD·12H2O) is 1.46 g/cm3. β-Cyclodextrin is moderately soluble in water and glycerin; well soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, pyridine, HFIP, and ethylene glycol; and insoluble in ethanol and acetone. == Applications == β-Cyclodextrin is widely used in medicine, pharmacy, food industry, textiles. Its molecules can accommodate various biomolecules and hence are also used as a complexing agent. Hydrophobic forms of β- CD have been used as sustained release drug carriers. In addition to improving the solubility of compounds, complexation with cyclodextrin has been used to improve the stability of many drugs by inclusion of the compound and protecting certain functional groups from degradation. == Derivatives == β-cyclodextrin has relatively low solubility in water, and hence industry uses its derivatives, such as 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPbCD), randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin (RAMEB), and β-cyclodextrin sulfobutyl ether sodium salt (SBEbCD). == See also == α-Cyclodextrin γ-Cyclodextrin == References ==",Betadex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.014291377738118172), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.0020705638453364372), (',', -0.014202055521309376), (' INDUSTR', -0.000630947935860604), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01954931579530239), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -1.1324817933200393e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.001208290341310203), (',', -0.10022922605276108), ('ĠINDU', -0.0015355474315583706), ('ST', -4.541770613286644e-05), ('RI', -5.8412379075889476e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011096080765128136)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.14075671136379242), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -7.941850526549388e-06), (' FOOD', -0.041168857365846634)])","('Betadex, also known as beta-cyclodextrin, is primarily used as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulations to enhance the solubility and stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients.

3466,"('Povidone iodine', 'N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone', 'N-vinylpyrrolidone', 'N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone', 'Povidone')","Medical, Personal Care","Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), also commonly called polyvidone or povidone, is a water-soluble polymer compound made from the monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone. PVP is available in a range of molecular weights and related viscosities, and can be selected according to the desired application properties. == Uses == === Medical === There are high-purity injectable grades of PVP available on the market, for specific use in intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous applications. PVP is a frequently used binder in pharmaceutical tablet formulations. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans and various laboratory animal models indicate no to very little systemic absorption of PVP following oral administration. PVP added to iodine forms a complex called povidone-iodine that possesses disinfectant properties. This complex is used in various products such as solutions, ointment, pessaries, liquid soaps, and surgical scrubs. It is sold under the trade names Pyodine and Betadine, among others. It is used in pleurodesis (fusion of the pleura because of incessant pleural effusions). For this purpose, povidone-iodine is as effective and safe as talc, and may be preferred because of its easy availability and low cost. PVP is used in some contact lenses and their packaging solutions. It reduces friction, thus acting as a lubricant, or wetting agent, built into the lens. Examples of this use include Bausch & Lomb's Ultra contact lenses with MoistureSeal Technology, Air Optix contact lens packaging solution (as an ingredient called ""copolymer 845""), and Johnson & Johnson's Acuvue contact lenses. PVP is used as a lubricant in some eye drops, e.g. Bausch & Lomb's Soothe. PVP was used as a plasma volume expander for trauma victims after the 1950s. It is not preferred as a volume expander due to its ability to provoke histamine release and also interfere with blood grouping. Autopsies have found that crospovidone (PVPP) contributes to pulmonary vascular injury in substance abusers who have injected pharmaceutical tablets intended for oral consumption. The long-term effects of crospovidone or povidone within the lung are unknown. === Technical === PVP is also used in many technical applications: as a special additive for batteries, ceramics, fiberglass, inks, and inkjet paper, and in the chemical-mechanical planarization process as an emulsifier and disintegrant for solution polymerization to increase resolution in photoresists for cathode-ray tubes (CRT) in aqueous metal quenching for production of membranes, such as dialysis and water purification filters as a binder and complexation agent in agricultural applications such as crop protection, seed treatment and coating as a thickening agent in tooth whitening gels as an aid for increasing the solubility of drugs in liquid and semi-liquid dosage forms (syrups, soft gelatine capsules) and as an inhibitor of recrystallisation as an additive to Doro's RNA extraction buffer as a liquid-phase dispersion enhancing agent in DOSY NMR as a surfactant, reducing agent, shape controlling agent and dispersant in nanoparticle synthesis and their self-assembly as a stabilizing agent in all inorganic solar cells === Other uses === PVP binds to polar molecules exceptionally well, owing to its polarity. This has led to its application in coatings for photo-quality ink-jet papers and transparencies, as well as in inks for inkjet printers. PVP is also used in personal care products, such as shampoos and toothpastes, in paints, and adhesives that must be moistened, such as old-style postage stamps and envelopes. It has also been used in contact lens solutions and in steel-quenching solutions. PVP is the basis of the early formulas for hair sprays and hair gels, and still continues to be a component of some. As a food additive, PVP is a stabilizer and has E number E1201. PVPP (crospovidone) is E1202. It is also used in the wine industry as a fining agent for white wine and some beers. In in-vitro fertilisation laboratories, polyvinylpyrrolidone is used to slow down spermatozoa in order to capture them for e.g. ICSI. In molecular biology, PVP can be used as a blocking agent during Southern blot analysis as a component of Denhardt's buffer. It is also exceptionally good at absorbing polyphenols during DNA purification. Polyphenols are common in many plant tissues and can deactivate proteins if not removed and therefore inhibit many downstream reactions like PCR. In microscopy, PVP is useful for making an aqueous mounting medium. PVP can be used to screen for phenolic properties, as referenced in a 2000 study on the effect of plant extracts on insulin production. == Safety == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this chemical for many uses, and it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). PVP is included in the Inactive Ingredient Database for use in oral, topical, and injectable formulations. However, there have been documented cases of allergic reactions to PVP/povidone, particularly regarding subcutaneous (applied under the skin) use and situations where the PVP has come in contact with autologous serum (internal blood fluids) and mucous membranes. Examples of documented allergic reactions: A boy had an anaphylactic response after application of PVP-Iodine for treatment of impetigo. He was found to be allergic to the PVP component of the solution. A woman had experienced urticaria (hives) from various hair products, later found to contain PVP. The woman had an anaphylactic response after povidone-iodine solution was applied internally during a surgery. She was found to be allergic to PVP. A man experiencing anaphylaxis after taking acetaminophen tablets orally was found to be allergic to PVP. Additionally, Povidone is commonly used in conjunction with other chemicals. Some of these, such as iodine, are blamed for allergic responses. Yet subsequent testing results in some patients show no signs of allergy to the suspect chemical. Allergies attributed to these other chemicals may possibly be caused by the PVP instead. == Properties == PVP is soluble in water and other polar solvents. For example, it is soluble in various alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, as well as in more exotic solvents like the deep eutectic solvent formed by choline chloride and urea (Relin). When dry it is a light flaky hygroscopic powder, readily absorbing up to 40% of its weight in atmospheric water. In solution, it has excellent wetting properties and readily forms films. This makes it good as a coating or an additive to coatings. A 2014 study found fluorescent properties of PVP and its oxidized hydrolyzate. == History == PVP was first synthesized by BASF chemist Walter Reppe, and a patent was filed in 1939 for one of the derivatives of acetylene chemistry. PVP was initially used as a blood plasma substitute and later in a wide variety of applications in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetics and industrial production. BASF continues to make PVP, including a pharmaceutical portfolio under the brand name of Kollidon. == Cross-linked derivatives == == See also == 2-Pyrrolidone Peter DeMarco == References ==",Povidone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.012837117537856102), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.5360003113746643), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.1797657459974289), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.016203615814447403), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -8.153582894010469e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -0.21773621439933777), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -6.556489552167477e-06), (',', -7.652943895664066e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.16024349629878998), (',', -0.03804921731352806), ('ĠINDU', -0.0007750368095003068), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004109272733330727)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.3137819468975067), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.6097483038902283), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -9.615255839889869e-05), (' PERSONAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/inactive/povidone-169.html?utm_source=openai), [poison.org](https://www.poison.org/articles/povidone-iodine-safe-use-of-a-common-antiseptic-193?utm_source=openai), [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/povidone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=343, start_index=36, title='Povidone: What is it and where is it used?', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/inactive/povidone-169.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=343, start_index=36, title='Povidone-iodine: Safe Use of a Common Antiseptic | Poison Control', type='url_citation', url='https://www.poison.org/articles/povidone-iodine-safe-use-of-a-common-antiseptic-193?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=343, start_index=36, title='Povidone - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics', type='url_citation', url='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/povidone?utm_source=openai')])"

Benzbromarone is highly effective and well tolerated, and clinical trials as early as 1981 and in April 2008 have suggested it is superior to both allopurinol, a non-uricosuric xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and probenecid, another uricosuric drug. == Mechanism of action == Benzbromarone is a very potent inhibitor of CYP2C9. Several analogues of the drug have been developed as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inhibitors for use in research. == History == Benzbromarone was introduced in the 1970s and was viewed as having few associated serious adverse reactions. It was registered in about 20 countries throughout Europe, Asia and South America. In 2003, the drug was withdrawn by Sanofi-Synthélabo, after reports of serious hepatotoxicity, although it is still marketed in several countries by other drug companies. == References ==",Normurat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0025527053512632847), ('ICAL', -5.245195097813848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004113546572625637)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/benzbromarone.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Benzbromarone | P450 (e.g. CYP) inhibitor | Xanthine Oxidase/XO inhibitor | CAS 3562-84-3 | Buy L2214; L 2214; MJ-10061; MJ10061; L-2214; L2214-Labaz; Narcaricin; Normurat from Supplier InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/benzbromarone.html?utm_source=openai')])"
